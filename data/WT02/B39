DEUTSCHE POST'S TAKEOVER PLAN STYMIED BY SCHRODERS

DEUTSCHE POST's ambition to take over 75 percent of Postbank, the state-
owned German bank - in alliance with Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re - has
suffered a blow with the release of a report by UK investment bank
Schroders for the German government.

Schroders has recommended that Deutsche Post, the German post office,
should get a stake of no more than 25 percent plus one share in the
bank.

Last October, Deutsche Post, Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re made a surprise
DM3.1 billion ($2.1 billion) bid for 75 percent of Postbank, widely
considered a gross undervaluation. Deutsche Post wanted to keep 40
percent of the capital and divide the rest between the other two
bidders (see EB 118). Schroders has put Postbank's current market value
at between DM4 billion and DM5.1 billion.

Wolfgang Botsch, Minister for Post and Telecommunications, who
supported this hostile bid, seems to like Schroders's idea so far, but
has not made a definitive statement. Postbank is adamant that the stake
should be between 15 percent and 20 percent. It would not accept a 25
percent stake unless"certain conditions (not defined) were met", a
spokesman said.

Schroders has recommended that Postbank get rid of its 80 specialised
outlets in post offices, carry out marketing jointly with Deutsche Post
and sell its products over the post office counters. This would open
the way for recruiting other financial services partners, Schroders
said.

No doubt Deutsche Bank and Swiss Re would want a piece of this action,
along with the partners that Postbank sought out for a counter attack -
BHF Bank and Volksfursorge, the insurance group.

SE-BANKEN FINED FOR GIVING MISLEADING INFORMATION

SKANDINAVISKA ENSKILDA Banken, Sweden's largest bank, has been hit with
a fine of SKr2.14 million ($3.3 million) by the Stockholm Stock
Exchange for providing misinformation on the heavy credit losses which
caused a dramatic fall in its profits in 1995.

The stock exchange accuses the bank of providing misleading information
on Luxonen, a failed financial investment group, in a press release of
January 23 last year. SE-Banken stated that the Luxonen losses were
covered by SKr1 billion provisions made in 1994 and that restructuring
the group would strengthen rather than weaken its position.

In the first six months of 1995, however, SE-Banken made further
provisions of SKr2.9 billion to cover Luxonen losses. First half
profits dropped from SKr2.2 billion to a mere Skr19 million (see EB
117).

The stock exchange disciplinary committee has imposed a SKr2.14 fine,
corresponding to two annual listing fees.

SE Banken admits that it was not fully aware at the time of
the"complicated construction" of the swap contracts held by Luxonen,
which caused much of the loss, a spokeswoman said.

FRANCE READY FOR CONSOLIDATION?

Some recent deals seem to indicate that the French banking industry is
willing to consider the type of consolidation that has become common in
Europe in recent years

FOUR EVENTS toward the end of 1995 suggest that, faced with an
unprecedented crisis, the French banking industry has embarked on a
long overdue period of consolidation and rationalisation.

In December, after many hiccups, Credit National finally announced the
terms of its public offer to acquire Banque Francaise de Commerce
Exterieur (BFCE) and its intention that the two banks' operations
should eventually merge.

Each of the banks is already among the top 15 banks in France by assets
and combined they will have total assets of Fr350 billion ($71 billion)
and a corporate loan book of Fr195 billion. This will give Credit
National "the means to assert itself as one of the top French
institutions", according to the bank's chairman Emmanuel Rodocanachi.

In itself, the deal is likely to have only a limited impact on the
banking industry. Credit National and BFCE have small branch networks
and are involved in sectors where commercial banks barely tread. Credit
National, for example, focuses largely on long-term corporate loans to
large and medium-sized companies, capital markets and equity financing
business. BFCE's activities are concentrated on the corporate sector;
international trade financing and cash management services.

The true significance of the deal lies in its symbolic value. The
proposed merger is, in fact, the first such operation of consequence in
France since the merger of Banque Indochine and Banque de Suez et de
l'Union des Mines to form Banque Indosuez in 1975. It is testimony of
the French banking industry's willingness to contemplate the type of
consolidation that has become common in Europe in recent years.

The second significant event pointing toward long-overdue consolidation
was the news that GAN, a major insurance company, is to sell a majority
stake in its banking subsidiary Groupe CIC as part of its
privatisation. Groupe CIC is the seventh-largest bank in France so
there are likely to be suitors aplenty although, like many French
banks, CIC is barely profitable. It has an abysmal cost-to-income ratio
of 80 percent.

Societe Generale and Credit Mutuel have already expressed an interest,
although banks from outside France (possibly the Dutch bank ABN AMRO)
may also be tempted to add CIC's network of around 1,300 branches to
their empires.

The ardour of some suitors may, however, be tempered if it is decided
to sell the different regional CIC networks separately. The acquisition
of consumer finance specialist Sovac by giant US conglomerate General
Electric Capital (GE Capital) at least shows a revival of foreign
interest in investing in those parts of the French financial industry
that remain profitable.

Foreigners' interest in making an important banking acquisition in
France has long been frustrated by various kinds of unavowed
protectionism. At the beginning of this decade, for example, Deutsche
Bank's international division was able to show journalists 36 fat
files, each one representing an acquisition target in France that had
to be ruled out for a series of reasons.

Now, in one fell swoop, a major international company has become one of
the major consumer credit providers in a market that has been
traditionally divided between a handful of national competitors and the
subsidiaries of the big commercial banks.

The acquisition, the third significant event in French banking in
recent months, has had the effect of a bombshell on the French retail
financial services industry and may herald a period of intense
manoeuvring. Already, rumours are rife that Banque Sofinco (another
consumer finance specialist and subsidiary of the troubled Suez
conglomerate) could come on the market, as may Credit du Nord, the weak
retail banking subsidiary of the Paribas group.

The fourth and final event demonstrating a new openness in the French
banking sector is the decision to end Credit Foncier de France's quasi-
monopoly over the distribution of subsidised housing loans, called
PAPs. This may be a sign that the state is beginning to contemplate
ending other privileges reserved for a number of state and quasi-state
banks.

Likewise, the decision to replace these PAPs with interest-free
mortgage loans that are open to all banks to distribute is an
indication that the authorities are conscious of the serious problems
facing the French financial industry.

That said, French banking remains ridden by a host of special
privileges accorded to some banks and not to others. The commercial
banks (members of the Association Francaise des Banques) periodically
mount campaigns to have the same right to flexible opening hours as the
savings and mutual banks and the post office. For a number of years,
they have also been striving to obtain the same access to fiscally
advantaged products as the mutual and savings banks. It remains
unlikely that, in this respect at least, French banking will change
radically in the near future.

The sudden increase in the tempo of change in French banking in 1995
follows a lot of soul searching among the financial industry, at the
root of which is a series of events, including bail-outs (most
spectacularly that of Credit Lyonnais) and the collapse last year of
Banque Pallas-Stern. The failure of the latter bank is especially
significant in that, for the first time in memory, a bank's
shareholders did not respond to the Bank of France's "invitation" to
help refloat their investment. This spells an end to France's much-
vaunted banking solidarity and points to the growing vulnerability of
small banks.

In addition, the AFB estimates that its members' net banking income
fell by 10 percent in 1995, having already dropped by 8 percent in
1994.

French banks in general can only look with envy on their "Anglo- Saxon"
cousins which, on average, have operating margins and returns on equity
that are two or three times higher than theirs. In the latest annual
survey of bank profitability undertaken by rating agency IBCA, the most
profitable French bank (Credit Immobilier de France) ranked only 84th
out of 300 institutions in the world.

In the words of one Paris analyst,"whereas French banks used to be able
to take justifiable pride in their quality of service and technological
prowess, now they have had to become seriously worried with the more
basic themes of low profitability and how to survive in a frighteningly
competitive environment".

Perhaps even more telling in the current upheaval is the growing
realisation that banks' real estate problems (which some analysts
estimate could cost a cumulative Fr100 billion-Fr200 billion by the end
of this decade) are not going to go away soon.

Here, too, a sea change can be detected. In 1994 and the first half of
1995 the Suez group, a financial and industrial conglomerate, took the
courageous step of writing down the massive real estate losses its
various subsidiaries had accumulated in previous years instead of
posting provisions that do not necessarily take into account possible
further falls in market values, as all Suez's domestic rivals have
done.

This provisioning effort cost Suez a total of Fr11.7 billion in the 18
months up to mid-1995 and contributed largely to the consolidated
losses of Fr8.8 billion in the same period.

At least this exercise should ensure that the much-troubled group sees
the light at the end of the tunnel fairly quickly. This may not be the
case for a number of other unfortunate institutions in France.

UK MARKET FAVOURS SHAREHOLDER APPROACH

AIMING TO double shareholder value every three years has over the last
decade driven Lloyds Bank's market capitalisation up from #1.35 billion
($2 billion) to #8.25 billion - on roughly the same share base.

The bank's equity has doubled from #2.1 billion to #4.06 billion, price
to book value has risen from 64 percent to more than 200 percent and
the dividend has increased at a compound rate of 15 percent.

Lloyds's pre-tax return on equity currently stands at 35.2 percent,
higher even than Spain's famously profitable bank, Banco Popular (33.6
percent), points out a recent report from Salomon Brothers.

This impressive performance, combined with widespread enthusiasm about
the bank's recent purchases of Church & General building society and
TSB Bank, have pushed the share price sky high. In fact, Salomon
Brothers's only proviso on a buy recommendation on Lloyds is that the
bank's shares have passed the #8.25- #8.50 price mark.

Both the C&G and TSB purchases fit the Lloyds criterion for a
successful financial institution of widening the gap with other
operators: C&G for its low-cost production in the mortgage market,
strong image-based technology and turnaround skills; and TSB for the
potential integration savings it offers as well as general insurance
skills that Lloyds has up to now had to buy in.

Salomon Brothers is particularly enthusiastic about the UK, despite the
fact that shares rallied so strongly in 1995. Buy Barclays, Lloyds,
NatWest and HSBC Holdings, Salomon Brothers advises, with a hold on
Abbey National. The favoured buy is HSBC, because the shares have
lagged the recovery in UK bank shares.

Salomon is less enthusiastic about other markets. In France, where it
considers the banks are not particularly good value in relation to
earnings, it has a hold recommendation on the major banks, although
preferring the quality of Societe Generale.

Italian banks, although cheap on book value, are expensive on an
earnings basis, Salomon argues, and better share performance will only
happen in the (currently unlikely) event of an improvement in political
and economic conditions. Top Italian choice is Istituto Mobiliare
Italiano (IMI) (see page 6).

Despite the fact that Salomon Brothers is bearish about operating
conditions in the Spanish market, it has upgraded its recommendation on
Argentaria to buy from hold in the light of the mounting speculation
about mergers and acquisitions. Salomon argues that the Spanish
government has no real interest in keeping any investment in Argentaria
in the medium term. Argentaria's break-up value is a lot higher than
current market capitalisation and the likely change of government in
1996 will allow a rethink of the privatisation agenda, the report
predicts.

Salomon Brothers has also kept a buy recommendation on Bank Bilbao
Vizcaya, another bank which focuses on shareholder value. Luis Bastida,
chief financial officer of BBV, told Salomon Brothers' Global
Conference that BBV has established ROE objectives of about 15 percent
for all main business lines. The bank will repurchase more stock if
market price falls below adjusted book value and is continuing to
maximise cost cuts from the 1998 Banco Bilbao/Banca Vizcaya merger.

In Germany, the favoured bank shares are Commerzbank and Dresdner Bank.
In Switzerland, Salomon Brothers has downgraded its only buy
recommendation - Swiss Bank Corporation - to hold and cut the estimates
on the other three major banks, citing stagnant domestic banking
conditions and poor credit quality.

Salomon Brothers considers the Nordic banks, particularly Christiania
Bank, as among the best buys in Europe.

NEW CHANCES, NEW COSTS

While the large banks are in a good position to take advantage of the
new European financial regulations, the directives could be just too
much for many smaller players to handle

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION has added two further pieces to the single
financial services market jigsaw - the Investment Services Directive
(ISD) and the Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD).

Both came into effect on January 1 of this year and are likely to lead
to increased competition between stock exchanges and investment banks
alike, with larger players set to come out on top.

Only seven of the 15 member states were ready to implement the ISD at
the start of the new year, although all are adopting an "open door"
policy, according to the European Federation of Stock Markets. Those
that met the requirements were the UK, Ireland, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Sweden, Luxembourg and Belgium.

The main thrust of the ISD is to create a "European Passport" for non-
bank investment firms to carry out activities such as order collecting,
dealing and portfolio management more easily across borders.

Under the terms of the directive, any institution regulated in one EU
country can operate in all of the others without having to comply with
additional requirements.

The British Banking Association "warmly welcomes" the directives,
because they reinforce the basic right to cross-border financial
services, according to Peter Vipond, assistant director.

As in the case of the Second Banking Directive, the Association is
concerned that the interpretation of the ISD should not be conservative
or ambiguous (see EB 120).

Larger banks, already present in more than one EU country, can expect
lower costs as a result of the ISD but the directive will not have a
significant impact on their cross-border activities, predicted John
Leonard, European banking analyst at Salomon Brothers. Although some
member states have been strict on foreign players in the past, most
large banks have been free to operate where they choose.

"The ISD will have no effect whatsoever on our business, as we already
had the passport," said Dominique Hoenn, member of the board of
management at Groupe Paribas, France's second-largest banking group.
"It is a bit of a non-event for banks."

Smaller players operating in countries which have no regulations for
securities traders will, on the other hand, find themselves needing
authorisation for the first time.

The costs of keeping up with regulations may be too much and firms and
brokers could become overshadowed by the bigger investment banks which
will find it easier to adapt, Arun Aggarwal, partner in treasury and
capital markets at Price Waterhouse, forecast.

One market observer suggests that in terms of increased cross- border
activity US investment houses, such as Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley
and Goldman Sachs, will be particularly keen to avail of the
opportunities presented by the ISD. Their authorisation in London will
allow them to spread out further into Europe.

A second objective of the ISD is to open up stock exchange membership
in all member states to all types of investment firm, whether bank or
non-bank entities. It will allow them to choose between indirect access
to membership through a subsidiary company or direct access through a
branch.

The ISD will lead to a surge in "remote membership" of stock exchanges,
according to market analysts, as it permits regulated markets operating
without a physical floor to provide terminals to investment firms and
banks in other member states.

This move will boost continental exchanges which have dramatically
modernised recently, said Jean-Pierre Paelinck, secretary general of
the European Federation of Stock Exchanges.

Indeed, the London exchange is on shaky ground at the moment after its
chief executive Michael Lawrence was forced to resign on January 4
because the board "lost confidence" in him. The board insists that this
has nothing to do with Lawrence's push for reform of trading on the
exchange this year. Few are convinced by the argument and a select
committee of the House of Commons has launched an inquiry into the
dismissal.

"Our objective is to be a market of choice," said John Kemp- Welch,
chairman of the board, who has taken over the chair of the executive
committee until a new chief executive is found. "To achieve that, we
have a large programme of work in train and this will be pursued
vigorously."

On the same day as Lawrence's departure, the board announced the
formation of a steering committee, which will oversee the decision
taken at the Stock Exchange Board meeting of November 30, concerning
market structure and regulation. The decision provides for the
Exchange's service to include full electronic trading and order
matching.

UK stockbroker NatWest Securities added fuel to the fire on January 2,
when it started to trade on the Swedish stock exchange from its offices
in London. It was the first leading UK market- maker to question
publicly the London Stock Exchange's function as a centre for
international trading.

Before the ISD came in, UK firms wanting to trade continental stocks
had to set up offices in other countries and apply for membership or
advertise their prices on Seaq International, the London Exchange's
electronic bulletin board for international dealing.

In Germany, Gruppe Deutsche Borse, which runs the German stock and
derivatives markets, has reacted to the ISD by installing "access
points" in London and Zurich to link to its systems and harmonising the
communications fees abroad with those at home, facilitating access to
the German market for foreign entrants.

Deutsche Borse plans to extend its electronic network to other
countries in the future, with the aim of bringing down all round
telecommunications costs.

Investment banks are likely to feel the effects of the Capital Adequacy
Directive (CAD) most, although the Directive also covers non-bank
investment firms. Under the directive, investment banks are required
for the first time to examine market risks when allocating capital.

Under the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive of 1993, banks can
carry out securities-related activities in addition to core banking
business, which means that banks and non-banks can be in direct
competition with each other in this area.

The CAD distinguishes between a bank's "trading book" and the rest of
its business (its investment portfolio and loans portfolio). It applies
broadly similar rules to the trading book as apply to the securities
business of non-bank investment firms in defining regulatory capital
and rules relating to the measurement of risk.

The rest of the bank's business is still subject to the requirements of
the Solvency Ratio Directive, which sets out an 8 percent minimum
capital requirement in respect of weighted credit risks.

Another element of the CAD is that banks and investment firms must
monitor risks at all times, keeping a close eye on large exposures.
Trading exposures to a single client will have to be restricted in most
cases to less than 25 percent of the capital base, for instance.

Analysts agree that market risks have been neglected in the past.
"Considering that Swiss banks make 29 percent of their total revenues
from trading, and the Barings collapse, it is clear that there are
risks there that should be dealt with," said Mark Rubenstein, European
banking analyst at BZW. "Banks will have to sit down and look more
carefully at the capital they need."

Banks have had two years to prepare for the CAD so on the whole they
are relatively unshaken by its arrival. The overall effect on holding
capital will be neutral and won't make much difference to banks,
according to Ian Linnell, investment banking analyst at Standard &
Poor's.

"The CAD will give a good kick to the market," he said, "but as a risk
management tool, it is not a magic silver bullet, it's too cumbersome".

Linnell suggests that investment banks themselves delegate risk control
in a much more efficient way than the CAD, a view held by many of the
banks themselves. Paribas is a case in point. Its own risk model uses
250 points of observation. "It is not clear whether we are permitted to
continue with our internal model," said Hoenn. "It would be stupid to
have to invest more in developing a new system just to comply with the
rules."

Indeed, the CAD will require increased expenditure on upgrading
technology, as it is a systems-based approach. "Everyone is investing
lots of money in systems, because they have one additional set of
calculations that has to be done concurrently and accurately," said
Leonard. IT investment among Europe's top banks ranges from as little
as 0.5 percent of asset value, according to a 1995 review of the top
100 largest spenders on IT by Spikes Cavell, the market intelligence
providers. Three banks appeared in the top ten spenders: Barclays was
number three spending $1.3 billion; ABN AMRO was number five with $960
million and Deutsche Bank ranked ninth with $814 million.

Smaller players may be crippled by the new overheads brought on by the
directives. At the end of the day, this factor, along with other
handicaps, such as lack of controlling models, will mean that the
increasingly "global" European market will become a stomping ground
mainly for big investment banks and investors.

"Larger banks can exploit their muscle on a wider front, and the
directives offer significant re-engineering opportunities," said
Aggarwal."The odds are definitely tilting towards larger players."

POLAND:  MERGER PLANS VIEWED WITH SUSPICION

POLISH BANKERS are less than enthusiastic about the government's new
approach to restructuring the banking sector.

The government has decided to merge seven state-owned banks into groups
led by Bank Handlowy y Warszawie and Polska Kasa Opieki (Bank Pekao).
Pekao is to take over Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy, Bank Depozytowo-
Kredytowy and the Treasury's 63 percent stake in the Polski Bank
Rozwoju (PBR). Handlowy would take over Pomorski Bank Kredytowy and the
Treasury's remaining 46.6 percent stake in Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy
(BPH).

Until now, the government has sold off four of the nine regional banks
one at a time - Bank Slaski, Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, Bank
Przemyslowo-Handlowy and, most recently, Bank Gdanski. At the end of
last year, it sold a domestic tranche of 35.8 percent of the Gdanski
shares, and foreign investors bought all 25 percent of shares on offer
abroad. Poland's eleventh- largest bank, Bank Iniciatyw Gospodarczych
(BIG) bought 24.07 percent of the bank.

Privatisation of the institutions remaining in state hands is expected
in late 1996 or in 1997. Although the new strategy of grouping the
banks could simplify an eventual privatisation "a more jaundiced view
held by some market players is that the consolidation strategy is
merely a ploy for reasserting control over the banking system, a theory
that would be borne out if Bank Handlowy and Pekao are not privatised,"
points out rating agency Standard & Poor's.

Shareholders of BPH and of PBR, as well as the management of the
regional banks, have raised objections. The plan can only succeed if
the two banks are free of political influence, Handlowy president
Cezary Stypulkowski has said.

Standard & Poor's also argue that the consolidation "would not
significantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,
or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range for
zloty-denominated obligations".

The rating agency points out that in the near term the mergers would
bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio and that
integration could be difficult.

"However, longer term, the greater diversity and market share could be
positive factors. Bank Handlowy would gain more retail deposits and
commercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution network
and possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertise
of Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail broker
strength."

THE UNWANTED DISTRACTION

While Italian banks are keen to grow, in recent times they have been
cutting back on foreign expansion. Now the smaller, more flexible banks
seem to be in the best position to exploit opportunities quickly

THE ONGOING troubles of Italian banks as they come to terms with
deregulation, privatisation and a more open and competitive market have
been well documented. A less well-publicised aspect of the large-scale
changes underway has been the quiet scaling down or even complete
withdrawal from operations abroad.

Most of the Italian banks' foreign expansion happened in the 1980s, on
the back of a buoyant economy at home when politically- controlled
banks could afford prestigious offices in major capitals and branch
networks in the more important markets. More recently, though,
recession and the arrival of private investment have brought more
pressing concerns at home and foreign expansion appears to have become
an unwanted distraction.

IMI, the Rome-based bank privatised last year, was one of the more
active and successful of the Italian banks abroad. Determinedly
independent from political interference, it became an efficient
operator in international investment banking and capital markets.

In 1993 Massimo Amato, managing director, of IMI International in
Luxembourg, echoed the bank's president when he said optimistically
that "IMI is a truly international bank and our intention is to become
a European institution of the highest calibre".

The bank certainly had the right credentials for satisfying the
ambitions of its management and may well have achieved their objectives
but for one costly mistake - the acquisition of the US investment bank,
Mabon Securities, for around $20 million in 1991. Little is known of
exactly what went wrong, but only two years after the purchase the bank
was said to be looking for a buyer. Problems appear to have been
concentrated in the subsidiary, Cedar Street, particularly in London,
where management walked out en masse to join a rival.

In September 1995 IMI announced that it was restructuring its
investment banking operations so that it could concentrate on Italian
markets and its lira-denominated products. It also revealed that IMI
Capital Markets, the sole owner of Mabon Securities, was to have $30
million injected into it. Little over a month later Cedar Street was
sold to a US securities dealer, MKI. There has been no mention of
losses and little coverage in the Italian press, although IMI's balance
sheet could be L60 billion ($38 million) the worse in 1995 and Mabon
Securities faces liquidation.

The mistake severely compromised IMI's other foreign operations and the
bank also closed its Frankfurt-based venture, leaving the Luxembourg
bank as the only serious foreign-based bank. Even Luxembourg's role was
downgraded and Massimo Amato returned to a high ranking position with a
medium-sized bank in Italy last year.

Banca Nazionale del Lavoro has also had well-publicised problems in its
foreign subsidiaries and has reduced its once large US operation to its
New York offices.

Other groups have suffered from market pressures. Comit, the banking
group containing Banca Commerciale Italiana, is looking to cut its
operation in France. Comit entered the French market at much the same
time as IMI was beginning its foreign expansion programme, buying Banca
Sudameris France. Losses in the French operation have forced the bank
to look for buyers of most of the 19 branches.

Banco di Napoli may also be looking for buyers in France. The Naples
bank had record losses last year and other Italian banks have bailed it
out on condition that it implements an effective restructuring
programme. This will almost certainly include the disposal of foreign
operations in France and Luxembourg.

Another casualty of the tough French market was the bank owned by
Olivetti owner Carlo De Benedetti, Dumenil Leble, which after L900
billion losses over the last five years will be put into liquidation at
the end of January.

In many cases, the purpose behind withdrawal has been to concentrate
resources on the home front where, ironically, foreign banks are
becoming increasingly active. Leaner foreign banks are increasingly
looking to exploit weaknesses in the cumbersome Italian banking system.

One of the major recent problems is the rift between Italian industry
and its banking counterparts over lending rates. The needs of smaller
exporting companies for competitive rates are quite clearly not being
met. All leading banks in Italy raised their lending rates by O.5
percent to 0.75 percent in November leaving industrialists dissatisfied
and rebellious.

Mario Carraro, head of the Veneto region's industrial association, has
little doubt that foreign banks are exploiting the rift and Italian
companies are responding.

"Working with strong currencies we can get loans at 8 percent," he
said. "Our [local] economy is primarily based on exports . .
Republic or Poland we need advice and support from banks."

The largest Italian banks appear to be the ones finding this sort of
service more difficult to offer. Often it is the smaller banks with
strong roots in particular regions that are now exploiting the
opportunities presented abroad. For example, Banca Popolare di Bergamo-
Credito Varesino, which bought the Swiss Banque de Depots et de Gestion
in 1994, says that foreign expansion is limited to creating a network
in the areas that have strong links with the home base in Lombardy.

Similarly, the Banca Popolare di Verona group, which is based in the
eastern region of Veneto, has opened offices in eastern Europe"because
that is where our clients are going for their work".

The new approach to international expansion is much more pragmatic and
often the players are the second-tier banks. This creates something of
a contradiction for the industry. On the one hand, Italy's banks are
keen to grow, with even the biggest groups small by international
standards. On the other hand, it seems to be the smaller flexible
operators which are better able to exploit openings quickly.

TAKING FRIENDSHIP A STAGE FURTHER

Westdeutsche Landesbank has formed two alliances which mark another
stage in the evolution of cross-border business at German banks. The
other Landesbanks would be well-advised to follow suit, EB reports

THE RECENT co-operation agreement between Westdeutsche Landesbank
(WestLB) and Bank Austria has created a three-way alliance between
Germany's largest Landesbank and its counterparts in Austria and Italy,
where Cariplo forms the third point of the triangle.

The strategy marks a further departure from the Landesbanks'
traditional business profile, although it is still too early to say
whether these co-operation agreements will generate significant new
business.

It is some years now since WestLB moved beyond its original job
description as local banker and lender of last resort to the public
sector in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. As competitive pressures
grew on the local savings banks (Sparkassen), which buy their wholesale
banking services from WestLB, the Landesbank found it needed to offer
better products and services and to earn more than their traditional
low-interest municipal lending business could offer.

That way of thinking led WestLB to move into corporate business and
then, as a natural consequence, into capital markets and international
commercial banking. WestLB has since grown to become Germany's third-
largest bank and is currently bolstering its London investment bank,
known as West Merchant Bank, into a significant rival to private-sector
domestic competitors, Deutsche, Dresdner and Commerzbank.

Under the terms of the German bank's agreement with Bank Austria, which
was signed just before Christmas, each becomes the other's"preferred
partner" for cross-border financial transactions, particularly in
foreign commercial business, international payments, currency clearing
and securities business.

Bank Austria's experience in eastern Europe will be invaluable. WestLB
has established branches in a number of central and eastern European
capitals but does not have the broad network that the Austrians have
already established.

The German's other partner is Cassa di Risparmio delle Provincie
Lombarde (Cariplo), the Italian bank. WestLB's ultimate aim is to
construct a network of partner banks in all the main European markets.

WestLB's aspirations in investment banking have taken up plenty of time
and resources over the past year and the man with chief responsibility
for the new alliances with Cariplo and Bank Austria is Hans-Henning
Offen, deputy chairman of the board of management and one of the two
board members responsible for investment banking. Bank sources say it
will take a good year before any substantial progress can be announced,
although quicker results might be achieved in cross-border payments.

It is clear that WestLB, the wholesale banker and umbrella for 150
local savings banks in the Rhine and Ruhr region, has chosen to rely on
alliances with other savings bank institutions. Bank Austria is a
savings bank sector institution and, like WestLB, has grown
prodigiously. Cariplo comes from the same roots and is often referred
to as the world's largest savings bank.

These upper-tier banks choose to co-operate with one another because
they understand the difficulties of convincing local savings banks to
market new products to customers rather than being able to approach
customers directly. The structure of the savings bank sector in almost
any European country usually means delays and it sometimes results in
painful, politically charged compromises.

Other state-owned banks understand that the German Landesbanks are
obliged to take on some unrewarding business, such as low- interest
credits or the administration of subsidies, for local authorities.
Since they understand each other better than private sector banks
would, the alliances between WestLB, Cariplo and Bank Austria have a
better chance of success.

WestLB's recent activities in the capital markets suggest that the
Landesbanks are still wary of liaisons with private sector
institutions. West Merchant Bank in London is being fashioned into a
competitor for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell and Dresdner/Kleinwort Benson.
Possibly because there is no savings bank institution with sufficient
expertise in investment banking, WestLB has chosen to go it alone. Even
the domestic competition was ousted: Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, a
minority shareholder in West Merchant Bank, was bought out so that
WestLB could avoid internal competition from German or foreign banks
with similar constituencies.

As for Bayerische Landesbank, NordLB, Helaba and the other German
Landesbanks, it is a fair bet that their future strategy will be
inspired by that of WestLB, which has long been the largest and most
international of the 13 Landesbanks.

Bayerische Landesbank, in particular, is investing heavily in other
European markets. Over the past two years, chief executive Franz
Neubauer has purchased shareholdings in the Hungarian Foreign Trade
Bank, the Czech Savings Bank in Prague, the Sudtiroler Sparkasse in
Italy - and now the Bank fur Arbeit und Wirtschaft in Vienna.

Others are more tardy. One reason is that their energy is being sapped
by problems and challenges at home - and by the constant effort of
expanding in order to keep level with WestLB. Norddeutsche Landesbank,
Helaba and Bayerische Landesbank are negotiating a far-reaching co-
operation on everything from edp systems to international strategy.
NordLB has already bought a stake in BGB.

Traditional banking alliances are still being made with banks in
emerging markets. Bayerische Landesbank has just signed an agreement on
the financing of German exports to Russia with Inkombank, the country's
largest commercial bank. But the Bavarians are not taking any risks:
all the long-term deals concerned will be covered by the German export
guarantee agency Hermes; others will be guaranteed by the Russian
Ministry of Finance or covered by barter deals. Indeed, Bayern LB has
been sensible enough to keep its initial objectives modest.

But the other Landesbanks will have to move quickly into more strategic
alliances if WestLB, Cariplo, Bank Austria and whichever new partner
next emerges are not to steal away their regional business. Although
WestLB is still formally committed to the Rhine/Ruhr region, it now
acts for corporate customers all over Germany.

MUTUAL FUNDS READY FOR TAKE-OFF

Though they still lag far behind US investors, Britons are beginning to
appreciate the benefits of mutual funds, thanks in no small part to
Virgin's Richard Branson

ONE OF the most fascinating developments in the retail financial
services sector over the last ten years has been the rise of the mutual
fund in the US. The Money Market Mutual Fund (MMMF) is displacing the
traditional bank deposit. The volume of assets held in MMMFs now
exceeds the cash held in call or demand deposits. Conventional mutual
funds are winning market share in the longer-term savings market.
Overall, around 30 percent of US households own mutual funds.

In the UK, however, mutual funds have failed to arouse the same depth -
and breadth - of interest. Indeed, in some respects the UK mutual fund
sector lags behind that of mainland Europe.

Unit trusts, the UK equivalent of the open-ended investment fund, have
had their moments, most notably during the late 1960s and early 1970s.
More recently, the sector experienced a minor boom in 1993 on the back
of rising stockmarkets.

In the intervening periods, however, the unit trust has failed to
excite the British punter. The number of unitholder accounts reached a
peak of 2.4 million in 1970 and declined throughout the 1970s, reaching
a trough of 1.72 million. Interest in unit trusts recovered during the
1980s on the back of booming stockmarkets but it was not until 1985
that the 1970 peak was exceeded.

Interest subsided following the crash of 1987 before moving onto new
highs during the 1990s. Currently the Association of Unit Trusts and
Investment Funds (AUTIF), the sector's trade association, estimates
that there are 6.58 million unit trust accounts, with total assets of
#109 billion ($168 billion).

Since investors typically hold units in more than one fund, the overall
number of unit trust holders is probably much less. In 1993 AUTIF
estimated that there were only around 1.5 million individual investors -
 around 3 percent of the total population.

There are a number of reasons for this situation. The fact that UK
banks have tended to pay interest not dissimilar to money market rates
on bank deposits has diminished the attraction of MMMFs. Unit trusts
have had to compete on an unfavourable basis with the attractions of
alternative long-term savings products such as life assurance
contracts. Until the advent of the Personal Equity Plan (PEP), mutual
funds were not in receipt of any form of fiscal privilege. By way of
contrast, until 1984 tax relief was offered on life assurance premiums.

The relative attraction of life assurance contracts was enhanced by the
fact that they were a preferred way of funding residential mortgages.
For a significant part of the post-war period residential property has
been perceived by the average Briton as the investment par excellence.

From the manufacturer's point of view, life assurance contracts offered
other attractions. The fact that the investment value of a life
assurance policy was relatively opaque - investors just assumed that
they would receive a large sum of money when the contract was
terminated - obscured the risks associated with this type of
instrument. More pertinently, in an age of non- disclosure, it opened
the way for high costs and fees to be passed directly to the customer.

Unit trusts were more transparent. Investment losses or poor
performance quickly came to light. Costs were also much more visible
and off-putting. The nature of the contract permitted only limited
opportunities for realising commission income. In contrast to their
peers in the US, the UK mutual fund companies seemed incapable of
coming up with anything that would positively enhance the unit trust's
image.

In fact, they often seemed intent on the reverse. Loads and annual
management charges were allowed to creep up. UK companies even turned
down the UK government's invitation to introduce legislation permitting
the introduction of open-ended investment companies (OIECs), a mutual
fund structure which has become the norm elsewhere.

There is at last evidence, however, to suggest that the tide may be
turning, irrespective of the behaviour of stockmarkets (always an
important factor as far as the public's appetite for unit trusts is
concerned).

A key element in this respect was the decision by the UK government to
make qualifying unit trusts fully eligible for inclusion in PEPs.
Investors can now shelter from both income and capital gains tax up to
6,000 of unit trust investments per annum. For the first time, unit
trusts have a more favourable tax status than life assurance contracts.

The relative attraction of life assurance contracts has been undermined
by a combination of factors. The scandals associated with the way in
which these and other long-term savings contracts such as personal
pensions were sold, the advent of disclosure and the inflexibility of
these contracts have all impeded their sale.

More importantly, competition has finally arrived. There has been an
explosion in new products, especially"life-style products" such as unit
trust savings plans linked to school and college fees, mortgage
repayments and pensions. Price competition has also picked up. No-load
funds, with very low annual management fees, are becoming increasingly
common.

As is often the case, when the history of the UK mutual fund sector
comes to be written, credit for these changes will probably be
attributed to an outsider: Virgin's Richard Branson. His launch of a
low-cost index tracking fund in early 1995 was an important catalyst.
Close on Branson's heels, HSBC, River & Mercantile, Legal & General and
Fidelity Investments have all introduced low-cost index trackers.
Indeed, since the index tracker appears to have captured the public's
imagination, other suppliers are set to join them in the near future.

Will the UK be converted to the merits of the mutual fund? The
situation is certainly much more promising. The arrival of the OIEC
later this year, low-risk corporate bond trusts, low costs, low
interest rates and (hopefully) booming stockmarkets, coupled with
greater marketing awareness on the part of the fund companies, should
provide the basis for take-off. As usual, however, time will tell.

WAITING FOR THE TELEKOM BONANZA

The biggest flotation in European history represents every banker's
hopes for improved earnings in 1996

THE NEW Year has begun and Deutsche Telekom is the name on every German
banker's lips: the national telecommunications group is not only set to
launch the biggest flotation in European history, but represents every
banker's hopes for improved earnings in 1996.

If the DM15 billion ($10.4 billion) sale of Telekom shares goes well,
every bank in the land will share in the bonanza. But, if demand is
weak, banks could be left holding the stock themselves for months or
even years.

By that simple logic, it seems self-evident that the banks will try
every tactic and ruse to encourage investors to buy the nation's first
telecoms shares. That is what the German government hoped when it
decided last year not to create new tax breaks on share ownership in
order to encourage the German public to buy Telekom stock.

Instead, the government and Deutsche Telekom's own management have
appealed to the banks to invent (and pay for) whatever incentives they
think necessary to make the new shares attractive.

By placing the ball so firmly in the banks' court, the German
government is perpetuating the old belief that banks are not just
commercial organisations which aim to maximise profits for their
shareholders but also have a duty to offer financial support to
deserving parts of the economy.

It is a curious reflection of the German consensus model that banks too
are regarded as official sponsors of economic and social change.

Banks may rage about this outdated view but the Telekom debate has put
them in a difficult dilemma. All of the major banks were so eager to
win places in the Telekom issuing syndicate that they were driven to
make extravagant promises.

Deutsche Bank, one of the global coordinators, and Dresdner Bank,
coordinator for the German market, are said to have made a personal
pledge to German chancellor Helmut Kohl that the Telekom issue would be
a success at all costs. And the government's favour is all-important
for banks which want a prominent role in future privatisation issues
such as Deutsche Bahn and Postbank.

In January 1996, just weeks before the marketing campaign begins for a
mammoth placement that cannot be postponed any longer, it is now
evident what responsibility the banks face. That burden rests
particularly on the shoulders of Dresdner Bank.

Unless the banks forgo bank charges, they may not be able to sell
sufficient stock to establish investor confidence. And if demand is
weak the banks will be blamed - and will end up forced to buy the
unwanted shares. Indeed, outsiders may never find out how much genuine
demand there really was for Telekom stock.

We can only speculate what the results of the Telekom issue will be. If
banks do have to provide special incentives for private investors, that
will set a trend for all future privatisations and could have a radical
effect on bank charges in Germany.

It will also create a new interdependence between the retail banking
and capital markets division of the big German banks. That will be
unwelcome at institutions which are trying to create more autonomy in
each division, but it may be unavoidable.

CHANGES IN GERMAN MARKET

RETAIL BANKERS in Germany have been confronted by dozens of innovations
over the past 18 months: discount broking was followed by direct
banking, dual-branded credit cards, free banking and now Internet
broking.

But before any home grown innovators, such as the pioneer discount
broker Direkt-Anlage Bank, could find the time and the money to reach
out to foreign markets, German brokers have found themselves defending
their crumbling market from foreigners. Credit Suisse, for instance,
recently launched a direct brokerage in Germany.

The appearance of foreign competitors is nothing new. US-based
investment banks created a stir in the late 1980s when they established
operations in Frankfurt and began to attract capital markets business
away from German institutions. The expertise they brought to Frankfurt
propelled German banks into acquiring the same experience themselves.
With hindsight, German bankers agree that the foreign investment
bankers have been beneficial for the Frankfurt marketplace.

They are still classified as"foreign banks" and few belong to the
mainstream Association of German Banks, but in fact institutions like
Salomon Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Swiss Bank Corporation now pursue
much the same objectives as domestic banks. That recognition is the key
to the successful development of Finanzplatz Frankfurt in future.

All 135 foreign banks in Frankfurt - even the branches which simply
administer commercial business for clients from home - are concerned
about the minimum reserve requirement, the supervision of derivatives
business, the new electronic systems of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange
and the improvement of international payment systems.

Although the financial legislation of 1994 introduced some reforms,
notably the establishment of a securities trading supervisory office,
both Germans and foreign banks complain that the changes have not yet
gone far enough. The finance ministry in Bonn is being lobbied by
various banking groups which hope to see a number of changes in the
forthcoming Third Financial Markets Promotion Act.

Ideally, the banks would like to see abolition of the minimum reserve,
rapid implementation of the capital adequacy directive and immediate
issue of short-term government debt.

With the finance ministry still smarting from the decision of the big
German banks to shift important capital markets operations to London or
New York, it is important for the banking community to present a united
front. That will be enormously beneficial in persuading both the
finance ministry and the Bundesbank that a free-market and not a
protectionist approach will best secure a promising future for
Finanzplatz Frankfurt.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS BOOSTS CREDITANSTALT

CREDITANSTALT, Austria's second-largest bank and long-time
privatisation target, has announced an increase in consolidated net
income of 16 percent, largely due to a strong international
performance.

Foreign business, which accounted for half of the consolidated balance
sheet, generated about two-thirds of the group's net income. The
group's net profit went up to Sch2.2 billion ($215 million) in 1995
from Sch1.9 billion a year earlier. Its operating result rose to Sch5.9
billion, up 4 percent and 40 percent higher than that of the domestic
operation Creditanstalt- Bankverein AG.

Domestic business suffered from weak credit demand, a shift to low-
interest, short-term loans and pressure on the interest margin, Guido
Schmidt-Chiari, group chairman, said on January 9. Earnings from
industrial holdings were up but provisions for loans to domestic
customers were up to Sch3.1 billion, from Sch2.7 billion in 1994.

In its recent Banking System Outlook for Austria, Moody's rating agency
expressed concern about the country's poor banking returns. After
Belgium, Austria is the most overbanked country in the European Union -
at end 1994 one bank or bank branch served only 1,384 people.

Unlike Austria's bankers, Moody's is not sure that the thin returns
will deter foreign entrants. This might, Moody's believes, "(a) only be
true during the near-term, and (b) hold only for the more plain vanilla
banking products and services".

Creating shareholder value has not been an overriding strategic
objective for Austrian banks. The politicised system has not only
contributed to the delay in selling the government's 49 percent stake
in Creditanstalt and 20 percent of Bank Austria but means that it will
be difficult for banks to improve their cost structure, Moody's argues.

Inherent competitive cost advantages "may enable more efficient foreign
entrants to compete against domestic institutions with some success",
the report says. It predicts that the country's financial markets will
become more exposed to domestic asset and savings disintermediation and
to cross-border competition "that is likely to focus on niche markets
such as mutual funds, lease finance and credit cards".

Faced with pressure at home, Creditanstalt, like Austria's other
leading banks, has been turning its attention to eastern Europe. In
this region, where Creditanstalt has to date invested Sch1.9 billion,
the bank's accumulated operating result rose from Sch330 million to
Sch366 million.

Moody's warns that competition may, in the medium term, make banking
activities in eastern Europe less attractive than they looked
initially. It also cautions that the extent and volatility of risk is
difficult to quantify.

AXA AND GENERALI TIDY UP LINKS

AXA, THE French insurance group, and Italian insurer Generali are
restructuring their complicated cross-shareholdings in a bid to develop
their long-standing but so far not very strategically productive
relationship.

AXA has announced a Fr5.9 billion ($1.19 billion) capital increase and
a restructuring which will give Generali a direct holding of 11 percent
in the French insurer.

Generali and AXA have been entangled since 1990, when AXA bought French
insurer Compagnie de Midi. At that time, the companies set up two joint
control and development holdings: Midi Participations, which is 60
percent owned by Finaxa and 40 percent by Generali; and Generali Midi
Expansion (GME), which is 60 percent held by Generali and 40 percent by
AXA.

Under the new agreement, Midi Participations will be dissolved and
Generali will buy back AXA's 40 percent reciprocal stake in GME. The
groups have also agreed to finalise a shareholder agreement by February
15, reaffirming their intention to seek joint development opportunities
and "barring unforeseen circumstances" to maintain their shareholdings
at current levels.

Generali observers have been speculating about possibly heavier French
involvement since June last year, when Eugenio Coppola di Cazano
stepped down as Generali chairman and chief executive for health
reasons. He was replaced as chairman by Antoine Bernheim, general
partner of Lazard Freres, the Paris financial group which owns 4.7
percent of Generali's equity.

At the beginning of that month, Generali had signed an agreement to
fuse its French subsidiary with La France group, indirectly controlled
by Lazard Freres, creating France's 11th-largest non- life insurer,
Generali France Holding.

CL AWAITS DECISION OF COMMISSION

THE CONFUSION surrounding the future of Credit Lyonnais's branch
network continues. The European Commission in Brussels is shortly due
to spell out clearly how the bank is to proceed in selling off 35
percent of its commercial banking assets abroad, including 50 percent
of those in Europe outside France, before the end of 1998 - the price
the bank has had to pay for its massive state bail-out (see EB).

This would mean dismantling the French banks' expensively acquired
branch network, with the exception of BfG Bank in Germany, the largest
and most profitable of Credit Lyonnais's European units and the one it
most earnestly wants to keep.

But this would also seem to be in contradiction of the assertion by
Phillippe Cloes, managing director of Credit Lyonnais Belgium, that his
bank was "not on the list of sell-offs" and a similar statement made by
managers at Credit Lyonnais's Swiss unit.

The protocol signed between the Commission and the French state which
stipulates that the 1998 deadline can be extended if the sale of assets
leads to "large losses" or "forces the main shareholder [the state] to
give fresh financial support". The bank's own board of directors has
stated that it will be "very careful that future disinvestments do not
lead to a decline in the bank's financial standing".

Credit Lyonnais has also announced the opening of a branch in the
Netherlands, designed to serve the bank's corporate customers. This
comes just a few months after the sale of the scandal-ridden Credit
Lyonnais Bank-Nederland to the Belgian Generale de Banque as part of
the rationalisation of its non-domestic network.

HYPO STEPS BACK IN THE EAST

HYPO SERVICE Bank (HSB), the wholly-owned subsidiary of Bayerische
Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank, Germany's fifth-largest bank, has cut
nearly one-fifth of its branches in the new federal states.

Set up in 1992 as a low-budget bank for private clients in east
Germany, HSB lost DM28 million ($19 million) in 1995. It closed nine of
its 46 branches and let go 30 of its 280 staff in late December last
year in a bid to halve these losses by the end of 1996.

"The branches were simply unprofitable and had too few customers." said
Lothar Lanz, board member at HSB. So far Hypo- Bank has invested about
DM50 million in HSB, which currently has 110,000 customers and a
balance sheet total of DM1.5 billion.

Deutsche Bank has built up a network of 400 branches in the new Federal
States in two-and-a-half years and plans to maintain it, a spokesman
said. "It makes sense to build up a branch network, although not all
are profitable," he said. Germany's number one bank acquired 120 of
these offices through a joint venture with Deutsche Kredit Bank,
formerly an exclusively east German bank. It currently has 90 branches
in west Berlin alone.

Bayerische Vereinsbank has a widely spread network of over 100 branch
offices, built up since reunification. The bank expects corporate
business to get riskier in the coming years because a lot of state
schemes will peter out.

It also expects margins to narrow in the retail sector because
competition will be largely price-based and, for this reason, is
promoting phone banking and on-line banking.

Dresdner Bank, which has 250 branches in the new federal states, sees
"no need for cuts".

GE CAPITAL BUYS INTO BUDAPEST BANK

GE CAPITAL, the financial services arm of the US General Electric
Company, has succeeded in its efforts to buy Sovac, the French finance
company, and a controlling stake in Budapest Bank, Hungary's second
largest bank.

The Sovac board accepted GE's public offer of Fr610 ($123) per share
(or Fr7.7 billion) on December 19. The US non-bank, now holds 97.49
percent of Sovac's capital, making it one of the major consumer credit
providers in France in one fell swoop (see EB 119).

In Hungary, GE Capital has bought 27.5 percent of Budapest Bank's
shares and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's 32.5
percent for a combined price of $87 million. The move means that
Budapest Bank can hold on to a state capital injection of HUF3 million
($22,000), which it received at the beginning of last year. (see EB
119)

LEPETIT QUITS INDOSUEZ

THE COMPLETION of Banque Indosuez's strategic review has also brought
to an end Jean-Francois Lepetit's career with the bank. Lepetit
resigned as chief executive on January 15"to pursue other interests
outside the group".

He has been replaced by Christian Maurin, who takes on the functions of
chairman and chief executive. Compagnie de Suez chairman Gerard
Mestrallet becomes chairman of the supervisory board.

Maurin comes from Banque Sofinco, where he has been chief executive
since 1991. Sofinco is now France's second-ranked consumer credit
institution, with return on equity of 20 percent.

The Suez group has been working to restructure and streamline in order
to combat huge losses. In the first six months of 1995, it made a net
loss of Fr3.976 billion ($800 million), largely due to real estate
losses. Banque Indosuez reported net losses of Fr16 million after
transferring Fr5.6 billion of real estate assets to Compagnie de Suez
(EB 118).

On January 23, Banque Indosuez shareholders were due to vote on whether
to transform Banque Indosuez into a company governed by a supervisory
board and an executive board.

KLEINWORT BENSON BUYS WARBURG LEASING

KLEINWORT BENSON, the UK investment bank taken over last year by
Dresdner Bank, has bought the leasing finance and advisory subsidiaries
of rival SBC Warburg, formed through Swiss Bank Corporation's takeover
of SG Warburg, for an undisclosed sum.

Kleinwort Benson has bought most of the former SBC Warburg big ticket
leasing portfolio and an executive team of ten individuals and will
integrate the new business into its financing department.

Buying SBC Warburg's subsidiaries almost doubles Kleinwort Benson's
leasing asset base, estimated to be around #450 million ($696 million).

The SBC Warburg business is a good match because many of its contracts
were with existing Kleinwort customers, John Cameron, joint head of
financing at Kleinwort, said. It also opens up opportunities for the
expansion of the advisory business.

Meanwhile, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell has taken on three utilities
analysts from Kleinwort Benson, to work on pan-European research.

CHASING THE `EUROCONSUMER'

All European branches now sport the Citibank label and the bank's aim
is to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Cola is
to the soft drinks industry. Sorcha Corcoran reports

OFTEN DESCRIBED as the only true pan-European retail bank, Citibank,
the banking arm of US multi-finance group Citicorp, now generates
nearly one-third of its total revenues in Europe. Germany continues to
be Citibank's European shining star but the bank is also pushing its
global strategy of providing services "anywhere, anytime, anyhow", in
Belgium, France, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and, most recently,
the UK.

There have been rumours that Citibank will reorganise its European
retail operations in view of former head of retail banking Victor
Menezes' recent promotion to corporate finance officer at Citicorp. A
decision on reorganisation will be made in the next couple of months
but no comment is available yet.

Up to now, Citibank in Europe has stuck closely to its global retail
strategy, pursued in 41 countries worldwide. This is to provide
upscale, premium financial services, with a multinational service
network, through a minimal number of branches, supplemented with
telephone and ATM service.

"We aim to deliver private customers the same bank services in the same
branches across Europe," Folkert Mindermann, managing director of
Citibank Privatkunden AG, the German consumer bank, told EB. "It is a
region where we expect considerable growth in revenues."

The bank's considerable success in the lucrative European consumer
market is largely due to the fact that its niche strategy minimises
frontal attacks, argued a recent study of the Citicorp organisation,
Citicorp Europe - Refashioning Itself for the Nineties, published by
analysts Salomon Brothers.

Citibank has defined its retail target as "internationally aware,
performance demanding and located primarily in large population
centres". The middle-income market needs most attention in the near
future, Mindermann said.

Excluding the card business, Europe contributed $1.5 billion to
Citibank's total consumer revenues in 1995, representing 30 percent of
total revenues, Mindermann said. There are 500 consumer branches in
Europe, nearly half the world total of 1,200, and the bank employs
7,000 people in the region. Assets came to $50 billion last year.

The consumer business is as much a marketing company as a bank. The
aim: to make Citibank to the financial services sector what Coca Cola
is to the soft drinks industry. All European branches now sport the
Citibank label and Citibank has introduced the "model branch" concept,
in which the same signage, architecture and operating systems are used
in Citibank branches around the world.

In these branches, consumers have access to Customer Activated
Terminals (CATs), an advanced touchscreen system that recognises from
the customer's PIN what language to use. Every Citibank customer has a
Citicard, which can be tied to several accounts, even with different
currencies.

An important feature of Citibank's Euro-attack is its integrated
network, Mindermann said. The bank moved nine consumer banking data
centres scattered around Europe to a single location at Meerbusch,
Germany in 1994. All European branches now have access to account
information on line.

"Citibank is the only European bank with one integrated system,"
Mindermann said. "For this reason it is the highest ranked in Europe in
terms of consumer orientation."

The integrated electronic data processing system improves cost and
control and allows Citibank to roll out new products more quickly,
Salomon Brothers notes. The bank need simply transfer "existing
systems, products and methodologies using infrastructure, experience
and language skills available elsewhere in the network", the report
points out.

One key business area in Europe is cards. Citibank had 1 million credit
card accounts in 1995 and by the end of the millennium this should grow
to 5 million, predicted Roberta Arena, head of cards in the US and
Europe. To minimise unit costs, the bank is transferring European
transactions across the Atlantic to Citibank's processing centre in
Sioux Falls, South Dakota.

Citicorp started its regional credit card effort in 1989, beginning
with four countries - Belgium, Germany, Greece and Spain. In five
years, the card base had grown to 500,000. The bank has become the
largest issuer in Greece since then and is now opening accounts in two
new countries each year.

Establishing cards businesses was a "gruesomely expensive" five year
effort, Arena said. High entry costs will, however, benefit Citibank by
discouraging other players from entering its selected markets, she
forecast.

Arena expects Citibank to be the number one card issuer in Germany
before long. At the end of 1994 it ranked fourth and was within 50,000
cards of Deutsche Bank.

In a move which alarmed traditionalists, Citibank has launched a co-
branded card with Deutsche Bahn, the German railway. The dual-branding
offer allows holders of the Bahncard rail discount card to add a Visa
or Electron payment function at no additional charge.

A legal battle ensued as the German competition authority, Zentrale zur
Bekampfung des unlauteren Wettbewerbs, opposed the deal, deeming it
unlawful. Citibank won the case in November and now claims that its
Bahncard has the potential to revolutionise the cards industry in a
market viewed by many observers as still underpenetrated. There are
already 3 million Bahncard holders in Germany, and their numbers are
set to rise to 5 million over the next couple of years.

Indeed, Germany stands out for Citibank in more ways than one. As the
largest and oldest retail bank (founded in 1926), Citibank Privatkunden
AG generates over 50 percent of European revenues. Of the 500 European
branches, 300 are German, and 4,000 of the 7,000 employees are located
there.

At end-September 1995, the balance sheet total of Citibank Privatkunden
AG came to DM15.9 billion ($11 billion), up from DM15.2 billion at the
end of 1994. It now serves 2.5 million customers with 4.4 million bank
accounts, insurance policies, Citibank Visa cards and home savings
agreements.

Mindermann attributes much of Citibank's German success to the
acquisition of Kundenkreditbank in 1974. "Kundenkreditbank was very
strong at that time, with a good branch network," he said.

Although among the highest returning banks in Germany for many years,
the bank was traditionally a blue-collar-oriented company with limited
growth. Citibank revamped the bank in 1989, establishing a more upscale
image through enhancing service and marketing.

Unique to Germany so far is CitiPhone Direct Banking, a full banking
and financial service, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, with personal
service by telephone. Citibank, as the pioneer of telephone banking in
Germany in 1989, started the new service in October 1995.

Previously only cash transactions were possible over the phone. Now,
customers use a personal password and identification number for
telephone handling of savings-account, investment, securities, credit
and insurance business. Only one signature is needed for all accounts.

"CitiPhone Direct Banking has got off to a very good start," said
Mindermann. "Already we have reached more than 3,000 new customers, and
are receiving an average of 1,500 calls a day. Most people are
interested in all the services offered."

Citibank plans to use the Aachen-based telecentre for CitiPhone Direct
Banking to target customers in other European countries. Aachen is well
situated for this purpose in the German, Dutch and Belgian border
triangle, close to France and within easy reach of the UK, so that
staff with mother tongues can easily be recruited.

In order to tap new market potential in Germany, Citibank entered in
December into an extensive collaboration agreement with HDI
Haftpflichtverband der Deutschen Industrie, the country's seventh
largest insurance group.

HDI is taking over the entire insurance operations of the Citibank
Group in Germany through the purchase of all shares in its insurance
holding company, Citifinanzleistungen GmbH. This company holds all the
shares in Citi Lebensversicherung, set up in 1985 and in Citi
Versicherung, set up in 1992. A purchase price has not been disclosed.

Under the agreement, Citibank will integrate the products of HDI into
the marketing channels of its banking operations - both the branch
network and telephone banking channel - and HDI will, in turn, offer
its private clients the banking products and services of Citibank.
"HDI's 1.8 million private insurance customers will provide us with
very good cross-selling business,", Mindermann said.

Citi Leben, whose product range covers individual, whole life and risk
insurance, had total sum insured by end-November 1995 of DM16.7
billion, up 4 percent on 1994. HDI notched up consolidated premium
income totalling DM8 billion in 1994 and a net profit of DM134 million.

This kind of co-operative agreement will be important for Citibank in
Europe in promoting its concept of a "multi- finance service in banking
operations", Mindermann said. In linking up with HDI, Citibank is
continuing along the path already taken in offering home financing
(together with Rheinboden), home savings agreements (with mh) and
health insurance (with Barmenia) in order to optimise its own financial
services business by exploiting "intercorporate alliances".

The most recent European market Citibank has targeted with its consumer
services is the UK. During 1995, it opened five branches, all following
the same strategy as elsewhere on the globe.

"We simply rolled out what's been happening in Germany, France and
Spain," said Mike Dennehy, consumer banking and marketing director for
the UK. "The UK is such a mature and sophisticated market that we had
to be sure we got the formula exactly right before starting a consumer
operation."

Account structures differ around Europe but the UK has adopted various
features from other Citibank markets. For example, if a customer has a
balance of over #2,000 on all of his/her accounts, there is no banking
charge, a feature of the Belgian operation.

The UK has also taken on the Greek policy of instant credit card
issuance. Customers can receive a card on the spot, if they fulfil all
the requirements, simply by filling out a form.

The biggest obstacle to setting up a retail operation in the UK was the
fact that Citibank was so well known as a corporate bank, Dennehy said.
In the UK since 1902, Citibank now employs 3,000 people, 400 of which
are now in the consumer business. The bank has been offering mortgages
for 25 years. Dennehy stressed that Citibank in the UK is only after a
niche market - clients earning #30,000 ($46,418) and above with an
"international element to their lives".

"We're not looking for hundreds of thousands of customers, but tens of
thousands," he said."They could be someone who works in Belgium one
week out of four, or has a house in France, for instance."

CITIBANK TO PULL BACK IN FRANCE?

CITIBANK IS set to become the latest of a series of foreign banks to
reduce their presence in France. According to reports, Citibank's
French subsidiary is attempting to sell its small and medium-sized
enterprise portfolio and its small branch network in the provinces in
order to concentrate on its consumer banking business in the Paris
area. Among the possible candidates set to take over this portfolio is
the Banques Populaires group.

The rumours, on which Citibank would not comment, come hard on the
heels of news that prestigious names such as Banca Commerciale Italiana
(Comit), Barclays Bank, La Caixa and American Express are all in the
process of lowering their retail banking ambitions in France.

Comit, for example, is thought to be discussing the sale of part of its
19-branch network (most of which is on the Cote d'Azur, apart from five
branches in Paris) to Banques Populaires. The Italian bank lost Fr495.8
million ($100 million) in France in the period 1992-1994, mostly
because of its involvement in speculative property loans.

Less prominent names such as Banco di Napoli, ASLK-CGER Bank of Belgium
and the Banque Franco-Portugaise have also announced lay- offs and
decisions to refocus their businesses.

The news also comes shortly after the release of figures by the
Association Francaise des Banques which suggest that the chances of
survival of small niche-based retail banks (many of which are owned by
non-French institutions) are extremely slim. These suggest that net
banking income and operating profits have continued to fall steadily
through the first half of 1995.

As foreign banks in France generally lack the critical mass to
withstand this downward pressure and increasing competition, their
attempts to carve out a branch-based business have been frustrated.

PORTUGAL BEATS GERMANY TO TOP LEAGUE OF SAVERS

The Portuguese appear to be the thriftiest people in Europe, according
to OECD data.

The surprising figures push Italy and Germany into second and third
places in terms of household savings as a proportion of disposable
income.

In absolute terms, the Germans save more than any other Europeans -
simply because there are more of them, each with more money at his or
her disposal than the majority of other Europeans.

The reunification of the two German republics in October 1990 makes
historical comparisons and projections in the area of personal savings
problematical.

But in round figures, German households could put away something like
DM150 billion (Ecu 77 bn) this year in long-term financial investments
- including life assurance and occupational pension funds.

Besides being among Europe's heaviest savers, the Germans also have the
distinction of being the steadiest.

In comparison with other states they show a batch of remarkably
consistent savings ratios:  total savings (including investment in
housing) as a percentage of disposable income;  financial savings as a
percentage of total resources available for investment; or long-term
financial savings in relation to short-term - all follow a
conspicuously regular pattern.

Another distinguishing feature of German households is a low level of
indebtedness, particularly compared with the French and the British.

Although there is evidence that in Germany (as in the United Kingdom)
consumers regard borrowed money in very much the same way as income, as
part, in other words, of their normal budget, a recent survey showed
that nearly half the adult German population still feels uneasy about
the idea of having to take out a loan.

Higher consumer confidence

According to the OECD, from  data supplied by the Ministry of Finance
and the Bank of Portugal, Portuguese households save a greater
proportion of their income than anyone else in Europe.

Throughout the 1980s the personal savings ratio, as defined above,
averaged 25.9 per cent.

The ratio reached a peak of 28.3 per cent in 1985, but declined by
nearly six percentage points over the next three years.

Although real disposable income grew at the record rate of 6.5 per cent
in 1990, its rate of increase has since eased to 2.8 per cent in 1992.

At the same time, the savings ratio has also continued to decline, and
in 1992 was 21.6 per cent.

The decline was probably due to a number of factors.  The slowing down
of consumer price inflation, with its positive impact on households'
net worth was one.

Added to this were higher consumer confidence, the progressive relaxing
of liquidity constraints, expectations of higher permanent incomes as
future employment prospects improved, and (until 1991, at least) the
notably sharp rise in retirement pensions.

But a household savings ratio of 21.6 per cent of disposable income is
still well above the ratios of the other OECD countries, and a number
of social and economic factors are at work to maintain such a high
rate.

It is estimated that there are some 4.3 mn  Portuguese living abroad
(one million of them in other EC countries), compared with a resident
population of 10.4 mn.

Remittances from emigrant workers, although showing a decline in 1992,
have made and still make a substantial contribution on current account
to the Portuguese balance of payments, and although no data are
available to allow one to distinguish this specific flow of funds,
these remittances may be assumed to give a significant boost to
personal sector savings.

A comparatively high proportion of the resident workforce is self-
employed, and motivated by the consequent volatility of income and
comparatively low social protection to maintain a fairly high level of
precautionary saving.

A further element in personal saving is probably intended to maintain
or restore the net wealth of households subject to erosion  by a rate
of inflation which, although falling since 1990 is still the second
highest (after Greece) in the European Community.

Finally, the relatively under developed consumer credit market may also
play a part in Portugal's high household savings ratio, as it certainly
does in Italy.

Italy has the highest household savings rate of all the major OECD
countries -  in recent years even above Japan by between one and two
percentage points.

Although the rate has declined steadily since its peak around 26 per
cent in the 1960s and early 1970s, in the last three years it has
averaged more than 15 per cent, compared with just over 8 per cent in
the United Kingdom and 12 per cent in Germany.

The fact that Italy's savings rate is so high is at first sight
surprising, and probably not consonant with what many people outside
Italy take to be the national temperament.  But the causes of such a
high rate are not immediately cultural, but technical.

Low development of capital markets

In a paper1 presented to an international conference on savings
behaviour held in Helsinki in 1991, a team of Italian economists found
that the low development of Italian capital markets was the main reason
for three conspicuous characteristics of the Italian savings rate
(whether national or private): its high level; its substantial
reduction in the past three decades; and its strong correlation with
the growth of the national economy.

The authors of the paper showed that Italian credit and insurance
markets are considerably smaller, relative to GDP, than those of other
comparably developed countries.

Credit finances a trivial share of household consumption and
investment, Italy's small credit market being explained by the terms of
consumer credit (high down payment levels; a wide spread between
borrowing and lending rates) rather than by demographic or cultural
factors.

One consequence of these technical factors is that the Italian mortgage
market is one of the smallest among OECD countries, and expressed as a
percentage of private consumption expenditure, only a small fraction of
the average of the seven major (G7) countries.  This factor alone,
according to Sig Guiso and his co-authors,  may account for some two or
three percentage points in the aggregate savings ratio.

Italians still buy little life insurance

Italians still buy very little life insurance, in comparison with the
citizens of other G7 countries, particularly.  Life assurance premium
income is now increasing rapidly (by 22 per cent in 1991, compared with
19 per cent in France and 13 per cent in Germany), but the level of
life assurance per inhabitant is still only a fraction (between  20 and
25 per cent) of the level in those other two EC countries.

The authors of the Helsinki paper give reasons, however, for supposing
that credit market imperfections outweigh imperfect insurance markets
in explaining the behaviour of Italian households.

They also discount any special bequest motive in explaining the high
personal savings rate, arguing that the rate at which the elderly shed
their assets is actually greater in Italy than in Japan or the United
States.

`The  evidence,'  they conclude, `suggests that Italians are not
different in any major respect from other OECD citizens;  rather, it is
Italian capital markets that are different.'

RATIONALE OF THE RATIOS

In spite of their importance to national economies, household or
personal savings are defined by official statisticians essentially as a
residual item.

Savings from their point of view are simply that portion of an
individual's income that he or she refrains from spending.  They're
what's left, in other words, after consumers have stopped consuming.

Official statisticians also like to refer to `disposable income', by
which they mean income, from whatever source, after taxes have been
paid and social security payments or receipts have been netted out.

Flows of personal savings are calculated in effect as the surplus of
current income over current expenditure, and disposable income is
allocated for the purposes of national accounts entirely between saving
and consumption.

Consumption is estimated from a variety of data, and simply deducted
from income in order to arrive at savings.

The figures on savings are supposed to be checked against other
indicative data, but this enterprise tends to show up some pretty
glaring discrepancies, which official statisticians seek to correct by
falling back on conveniently undefined `balancing items'.

In any case, household savings, as featured in national accounts,
include investment in housing, both in house or apartment purchase and
home renovation or improvement.

In some countries, spending on consumer durables is also sometimes
counted as saving.

Realistic measure of savings

Financial savings, which are mainly what this newsletter is concerned
with, are therefore only a part of household savings, as habitually
defined.

But if the numerator in the household savings ratio is too broad to
indicate the magnitude of purely financial savings, the denominator is
too narrow to determine households' financial resources.

Because apart from actual income, derived from salaries, wages and
investments, householders (which in practical terms include millions of
individuals who do not actually hold a house) also often borrow money,
and perhaps not quite so often, inherit it.

For this reason, more and more analysts of savings trends in a number
of countries are focusing attention on the financial resources
available to households, rather than on income as usually defined.

The practical implications of what may seem to be conceptual nuances
are enormous.

From the point of view of financial services, as pointed out by Dr
David Fleming in his paper, Time for a realistic measure of savings1,,
`a high-savings, highly-borrowed market is very different from a low-
savings, lightly-borrowed market, even if the net savings level is the
same in each case.'

Why bother, then, with the traditional household savings ratio?

The only answer to this is that for the time being it is the most fully
documented and consistently estimated savings indicator available.  And
it is the only savings indicator so far to form any possible basis for
comparisons not only between different countries, but between one
period of time and another.

ITALY:  SUPPLEMENTARY PENSION REGIME APPROVED - FINALMENTE

After something like 18 years of argument, and in the face of a barrage
of heavy criticism , the Italian government finally approved a
legislative decree on supplementary pension funds.

Finally approved - but such is the nature of the legislative process in
Italy, that the government can still amend the decree by the end of
this year, with the result that the debate continues with undiminished
vigour.

Two more decrees on the funds' establishment procedures, contracts with
their managing bodies, and investment criteria will be issued over the
next six months, and the intention is that the schemes will become
operative in 1994.

The new pension funds - fondi pensione complementari or integrativi -
are `supplementary' in the sense that membership of them is open to
persons already contributing to state schemes.

This will take some of the burden off the state pension system in a
country with an ageing population and a notoriously large and still
rising public sector deficit.

As it is, state pensions are now less generous than they were in the
past.

Most workers and managers earning more than L50 mn (Ecu 28,000) a year
are already covered by voluntary plans, so that the main market for the
new funds will be  employees and self-employed individuals with incomes
below the L50 mn level.

As about 80 per cent of the working population fall into this category,
the market is potentially a large one.

But it's an entirely open question how many will decide to participate
in the new pension funds instead of putting their savings into high-
interest Treasury bills (buoni del Tesoro - BOT) or private insurance.

The new pension funds will be legal entities, established through
company contracts or workers' agreements promoted by trade unions that
are signatories to national labour contracts.

Employees, whether in the public or private sector, grouped by
category, company or public body, may institute defined contribution
plans with a guaranteed rate of financial return.  These funds may be
constituted within the assets of an individual company.

Self-employed workers and tradesmen and free-lance professionals,
grouped by trade or profession or territorial sector, or by their trade
associations, may constitute defined benefit plans.

The benefits, the size of which will be determined by the statutory and
contractual choices made at the act of constitution of each pension
fund, will be paid in the form of income (rendita), though members may
receive a lump sum (capitale) equivalent to 50 per cent of the current
value of the amount accrued.

Length of service benefits will be paid

Members who have contributed to the new funds for at least five years
will be eligible for old age pension benefits when they reach the
pensionable age laid down in the compulsory system.

Length-of-service benefits will be paid to individuals who have been
members of the funds for at least 15 years, and who are not more than
ten years younger than the age envisaged in the compulsory system
(which will be raised gradually from 60 to 65 years for men, and from
55 to 60 for women).

Fund members for whom severance pay (trattamento di fine rapporto -
TFR) has been accrued for at least eight years may be granted advance
payments for medical treatment or for the purchase of a house as first-
time buyers.

For tax purposes, employers may deduct contributions up to 50 per cent
of the quota taken from the TFR.

Members' contributions will benefit from a 27 per cent tax deduction on
amounts up to a maximum of L3 mn.

This applies to all contributors, whether they are employees (for whom
contributions are also made by their employers and from the TFR) or
self-employed (for whom such contributions are not paid).

The L3 mn limit also includes other deductions that may be made for the
payment of life policy and health premiums.

The contributions made out of the annual allocation to the TFR are not
taxable, but when the TFR is liquidated, these quotas are taken into
account in determining the amount of tax to be paid.

All payments into the fund will be subject to a withholding tax of 15
per cent per annum, but members are allowed a tax deduction of 17.6 per
cent on the income or capital they eventually receive.

Company payments are subject to a 10 per cent `solidarity contribution'
to the national institute for social security (Istituto nazionale di
previdenza sociale - INPS).

The supplementary pension funds are not allowed to undertake insurance
commitments directly.

Their assets may be managed under agreements concluded with three
distinct types of entity.

The first is the so-called SIM - societe di intermediazione mobiliare,
a type of company instituted in December 1990 which as well as carrying
out brokerage, dealing, market making and underwriting operations may
also manage assets.

Banks rank with SIM for this purpose, as well as other EC
intermediaries that perform the same activity and that have obtained
mutual recognition.

The second category of pension fund asset managers comprises  insurance
companies authorised to handle life assurance and capital redemption
policies.  Indeed, plans with defined benefits and guaranteed rates of
financial return are allowed to manage their resources only through
contracts with these insurance companies.

Financing by workers and employers

Finally, fund assets may be managed by entities already managing
compulsory pension schemes (principally the INPS).

With the permission of the anti-trust authority, the INPS may conclude
agreements with the supplementary pension funds for the collection of
contributions and the disbursement of benefits.

`Open' (as distinct from defined group) pension funds may be instituted
by the intermediaries authorised to manage ordinary pension funds
(brokers, banks, insurance companies, social insurance institutions) as
well as by the companies that manage investment funds (fondi comuni
d'investimento).

Membership of open pension funds is available only to workers covered
by the compulsory pension system and employed by companies that have
not established complementary pension schemes, and to workers who have
lost the requirements for participating in the group schemes to which
they would normally belong.

Financing the complementary pension funds is the responsibility of the
workers and the employers.

No one may contribute more than 10 per cent either, in the case of
employees, of the annual wage taken as the basis for determining
severance pay, or, in the case of the self-employed, of annual income.

The government is expected to make some changes to the decree,
particularly concerning its tax provisions, perhaps changing the 15 per
cent withholding tax and introducing instead a 15 per cent obligatory
investment in convertible bonds to encourage privatisation.

FRANCE:  RECLASSIFICATION OF SICAVS AND FCPS

The French stock market supervisory body, the Commission des operations
de Bourse  (COB), has revealed details of its plans to change the
classification of all managed funds operating in France.

All Sicavs and fonds communs de placement (FCPs) sold in France will be
affected by the new classification, due to take effect from January 1,
1994.

The new system involves five descriptive categories and three sub-
categories, and replaces an out-of-date 13-category classification
introduced in 1985 before derivative products became an important part
of funds, and before Sicav monetaires took off.

The new categories are designed to inform savers more clearly whether a
fund is invested in equities, bonds, or monetary instruments, whether
it has a guarantee, or whether it involves potential currency exposure.

For investors this is expected to give a better appreciation of risk
than the old system which, while giving an idea of equities, bonds and
short-term investments, divided these into several sub-sections with
minor differences.

The COB says that the new system will also help multi-service groups
such as banks and financial intermediaries determine their
responsibilities in relation to investors and their depository bodies.

France is the only European country to have an obligatory fund
classification system that has such an impact on the day-to-day
operation of funds.

The new classification requires an equity fund to remain at least 60
per cent invested in equities at all times.  A monetary instrument fund
is restricted to a maximum of 10 per cent investment in equities.

Funds holding convertibles must declare whether their convertibles
behave more like an equity or more like a bond.

Fund managers now have four months to decide which categories their
funds fall into, and to make any necessary adjustments to management
aims and techniques.

The COB will then give its approval to the self-declared allegiance, or
suggest a recategorisation.

Any fund managers who disagree with COB recommendations can move to the
diversified section, which covers all funds not eligible for `pure'
categories.

Although the new system of classification was not prompted by the ucits
directive, it is expected that French funds will remain compatible with
it.

Foreign funds sold in France are unlikely to have to change their
management practices, as they fall straightforwardly into the foreign
equities, foreign bonds, or foreign monetary categories in the case of
single-instrument products or, for mixed funds, into the catch-all
diversified products category, which will also include all funds under
discretionary management, as well as funds invested in convertible
stocks.

SPAIN:  FIRST PROPERTY FUNDS LIKELY BY AUTUMN

Property investment funds - fondos de inversion inmobiliaria - are the
latest arrival on the investment scene in Spain, under a royal decree
issued last month.

The concept of such funds has existed in Spanish law since 1964 but it
was not until July last year that a new law specifically laid out the
framework for an instrument that is well established in many other EC
member states.

And only in May this year, with the issuing of royal decree 686/1993,
was the earlier framework fleshed out with the detail needed for the
creation of the first property funds, which may be launched as early as
the autumn.

One of the benefits that Spanish officials hope to reap from this new
savings instrument is a stimulus to the housing market, at present deep
in the doldrums.

Property investment funds tend to flourish in a relatively deep and
well-developed property market, where they may boost its development
and enhance its stability.

Opening the way for small savers to enter the housing market via fondos
inmobiliarios will mean `new financing for the property market',
according to a top executive of the Groupe Pelloux.

Spanish officials also hope that the new funds will fill a specific and
important market gap: that of rental housing, which is scarce in Spain.

The July 1992 law clearly referred to the role it is hoped the funds
will play by calling them in the preamble `a component of the
government's housing policy.'  But some experts say this narrow focus
is a weak point of the 1992 law.

A needed long-term investment vehicle

Another great benefit of property investment funds in Spain is that
they will provide a new and much-needed long-term investment instrument
in Spain.

According to the same Groupe Pelloux spokesman, the funds will fill a
gap in Spanish capital markets, which at present have only 10-year
Treasury bonds as long-term instruments, whose volume is still quite
small.

The 1992 law specifies that property investments may not exceed between
70 and 80 per cent of the fund's assets.  The remainder can be invested
in tradable securities, either equities or bonds.

A new fund must have assets of at least Ptas1.5 bn (Ecu10 mn).

It must have at least 100 participants, and no individual investor may
hold more than a 25 per cent share in the fund.

Property assets will be valued at least once a year by assessors
registered with the bank of Spain.

Another feature of the law is that it aims to encourage medium-and long-
term investment by tying tax benefits to a minimum four-year period of
ownership of property by the fund.

Still to be defined by the Ministry of the Economy are the rules to be
applied to the diversification of funds' real estate holdings, to avoid
the risks inherent in undue concentration in a single property.

The Ministry must also decide what types of property will be open to
investment by the funds - whether, for example, building lots can also
be included.

Limits will also have to be set on the amount of outstanding loans that
a fund may contract.

But although these details have still to be clarified, an official of
the Comision Nacional del Mercado de Valores (CNMV), the stock market
regulatory body that will supervise the funds, claims that there is
already more than one candidate waiting to be the first on the market.

FRANCE:  SHARE OWNERSHIP SET TO REVIVE

The first quarter of the year showed Sicav managers increasing their
exposure to equities.

With only part of the increase attributable to the strength of the
stock market, the value of shares in their portfolios rose by FF90 bn
(Ecu13.7 bn).

French fund managers increased the proportion of the CAC-100 index
accounted for by Sicavs from 5.88 per cent to 6.36 per cent, according
to the Dealers' Book.

That is a tiny fraction compared with their counterparts across the
channel, but an increase in the funds' exposure to equities is a
necessary condition for the success of the privatisation programme.

But there may still be a lot of resistance to overcome.

Spectacular fall in equity fund owners

According to a study conducted by Sofres, the polling agency, on behalf
of the Bank of France, the number of private individuals holding shares
has dropped by some 900,000 to 4.5 mn since April 1991, the last time
the survey was conducted.

The number of people owning equity funds dropped even more
spectacularly, from 7.5 mn to 3.2 mn, but the numbers owning money
market funds rose from 4 mn to 5.6 mn over the same  period.

Of the approximately FF1,000 bn (Ecu150 bn) held in Sicav monetaires,
some FF700 bn (Ecu135 bn) is invested by private individuals, and the
rest by companies that use the funds as short-term means of cash
management.

The Bank of France and the Societe des Bourses francaises  (SBF - the
executive authority governing the day-to-day operations of the stock
market) remain optimistic, however, that share holding will rise again,
as historically privatisation programmes have been major periods of
increase, when young persons particularly are tempted to invest in
equities.

The managing director of the Commission des operations de Bourse (COB),
M. Pierre Fleuriot, predicts that employee share schemes and the tax-
favourable equity savings scheme introduced in September 1992 (the plan
d'epargne en actions - PEA) will also have the effect of lifting share
ownership.

The importance of small investors is shown by the fact that over half
the people in France owning equities have a portfolio worth less than
FF50,000 (Ecu7,600).

GERMANY:  GERMAN EQUITIES BRING GREATER REWARDS...

Mr Ralf Conen, head of quantitative capital markets analysis at
Deutsche Bank, has recently completed a study of stock market yields in
Germany covering three historical periods  1876-1913; 1924-1941; and
1949-1992.

In each of these periods the average annual yield from equities was
considerably higher than the yield from fixed-interest securities, the
most striking yield gap appearing in the period since 1949.

Since 1949, according to Mr Conen, equities have shown an average real
post-tax return of 12.08 per cent a year, while bonds have shown a
negative yield of 0.09 per cent.

In another computation, the Deutsche Bank study claims that a German
investor  who started in 1949 to put DM10,000 every year into equities
would have been a millionaire in constant 1949 terms by 1977.

But his next door neighbour who put the same amount into bonds each
year would not be a genuine 1949-vintage millionaire until the year
2059.

Mr Conen is evidently making some pretty bold assumptions about the
course of German taxes and consumer prices over the next 66 years, but
his general conclusion that the long-term German investor is paid a
pretty hefty risk premium for investing in equities seems unassailable.

 One of the more detailed findings of the study  is that, the longer
the time-span under consideration, the greater the probability that an
investment in equities is more rewarding than one in bonds.

If single years only are considered, equities were more profitable in
56 out of the 97 years covered by the research.

If periods of five years are taken as the basis of comparison, however,
in 62 out of 85 possible runs, equities were more profitable; and in
ten-year periods, 54 out of 70.


In percentage terms, this means that equities were more profitable in
58 per cent of one-year periods, in 73 per cent of five-year periods,
and in 77 per cent of ten-year periods.

When periods of 20 years or more are taken as the basis of comparison,
equities are found to have scored from 83 per cent up to 100 per cent
of the time.

In spite of the higher performance of equities, however, the German
public still show a marked preference for  bonds, at least when it
comes to putting money  into investment funds.

Last year, for example, bond funds (both German and foreign) attracted
a total of DM53.4 bn (Ecu27.3 bn) new money, equivalent to no less than
86.5 per cent of the total inflow into German funds.

As it happens, over the last year German bond funds have performed on
average better than German equity funds, benefiting both from high
yields on the bonds in their portfolios and from bond price rises
resulting from the lowering of interest rates.

But over the last ten years, for example, German equity funds have
outperformed German bond funds by a considerable margin.

According to the Bundesverband Deutscher Investment-Gesellschaften BVI
(the German Investment Fund Association), German equity funds showed an
average rise in unit value of 163.6 per cent in the ten years to the
end of March, 1993, with the top-performing fund, SMH-Special-Fonds 1,
registering an advance of 254.9 per cent.

Compared with this, the best performance shown by German bond funds was
a 113.9 per cent gain by Universal's BERENBERG-UNIV.-RENTENFONDS (the
fund which also turned in the best performance over 20 years).

The average of the 28 funds in this sector to have a ten-year or longer
track record was a 98.2 per cent increase in unit value - a mere 60 per
cent of the equity fund average.


This persistent preference for bond funds can only be based on short-
term considerations.

In any given year since 1949, bonds showed a minimum yield of 2.6 per
cent, whereas while the highest average yield of equities reached 47.2
per cent in one year, there was a year in which investors saw an
average loss of 14 per cent.

But if the risk of losing money persuades German investors to forego the
chance of enjoying more substantial returns, it also apparently focuses
their attention mistakenly on current values to the neglect of the
erosive action of inflation , which in West Germany, though less than
half the EC average, has averaged nearly 4 per cent a year in the last
20 years.

`If you want to eat well, buy shares,' runs a German saying.  "If you
want to sleep well, buy bonds.'

There may be something in that, but if consumer prices are rising while
you sleep, your dream of a bond-invested nest egg could well turn into
a nightmare.

UNITED KINGDOM:  PRIVATE MEDICAL INSURANCE USED AS 'SOFT SELL'

Although private medical insurance (PMI) is not in itself a savings
product, its development in the United Kingdom is linked to trends in
the broader savings market.

It appears that life companies - especially those that operate through
their own direct sales forces - are getting into the PMI market as a
soft way of prospecting clients for more lucrative business, such as
private pensions.

The tied sales agent must have a full range of products to offer in
order to prevent the client from going elsewhere for one particular
type of product, and then perhaps being seduced by a new company into
buying savings products as well.

A newly-launched product is easier to sell, and health insurance has
proved attractive to an industry ever hungry for new products.

Branching out into PMI offers the agent a pretext  to visit customers
to see if this area of their financial planning is covered, when the
routine annual updating visit may have lost its sales pull.

In recent years, tied agent companies such as Allied Dunbar and Lloyds
Abbey Life have entered the market, as well as major composites like
Norwich Union, Sun Alliance (through its purchase of Mutual of Omaha),
and the guaranteed bond specialist General Portfolio.

Allied Dunbar added PMI to a range which already comprised critical
illness cover (first offered in 1989) and permanent health insurance
(1985).  Allied Dunbar make their own underwriting arrangements on
these two contracts through their life funds.  Their PMI contract is
underwritten by Lloyds syndicates.

Allied Dunbar claim that one in five of all critical illness plans in
force in the United Kingdom is theirs, though in the PMI market they
are not yet a significant force, with only 20,000 contracts in
existence.

Norwich Union made a major entry into the PMI market in 1990, setting
up a new division which at the end of March 1993 claimed 375,000
clients, an estimated one-third share of all new and switched business
in 1992, and a 6 per cent share of the total market.

The managing director of Norwich Union Health Care, Mr David Cavers,
says that PMI was seen to be a market capable of rapid growth,
dominated by a couple of provident institutions (British Union
Provident Association - BUPA - of London and Private Patient Plan - PPP
-  of Tunbridge Wells), only one of which has put a lot of money into
marketing.

Norwich Union Health Care expects premium income of close to #100 mn
this year.

The only link between Norwich Union's PMI product and other savings
plans is the distribution chain - both are sold largely through
intermediaries.

Mr Cavers sees PMI as an under developed product for the intermediary.
Brokers had not been selling it actively until the last four or five
years, when specialist advisers began to appear.

`Intermediaries have now woken up to the fact that they can sell
medical plans to savings customers,' says Mr Cavers.

The effect of such competition has been to make heavy inroads into the
market share of the leading companies, BUPA and PPP, with BUPA down
from 80 per cent of the market to less than 50 per cent over the last
five years.

Continental firms enter the UK market

The most recent development in the PMI market has been the link-up
between the French healthcare mutual Strasbourgeoise and Clinicare, the
UK specialist health insurer.

Strasbourgeoise entered the British market in 1990 with a plan offering
a number of features not available in standard UK plans, but probably
because of its high cost the plan did not attract a large market share.

A standard view of the PMI market is that in the current economic and
political climate, it is bound to grow.

But in practice, the market has disappointed expectations in recent
years.

About seven million persons in the United Kingdom currently have health
insurance.  The industry hopes to see 18 million insured by the end of
the century.

But rising claim rates and rising medical costs have hit insurers hard,
and premiums have had to be increased by more than 10 per cent a year
for several years.

In 1992, so far from growing, the market is estimated to have
contracted by between 6 and 10 per cent.

In spite of this, more companies are entering the market.  The Dutch
PMI company OHRA entered the United Kingdom market in March.

A new joint venture between Cornhill Insurance and Deutsche
Krankenversicherung AG is in the process of development, and its launch
is expected in the next few months
with a full range of products specialising in the hospital sector.

No more major UK insurers are expected to launch PMI products, though
it is thought that both Royal Life and the Prudential have been looking
at the market.

UNITED KINGDOM:  SCOTTISH EQUITABLE GOES DUTCH

Policyholders of Scottish Equitable, the Edinburgh-based life assurance
company, will vote at the end of this month on a deal whereby the Dutch
insurer Aegon will buy a 40 per cent share of Scottish Equitable's unit-
linked business.

With-profits policyholders with Scottish Equitable will continue to own
100 per cent of their fund.

Scottish Equitable's rise has been meteoric in the independent
financial adviser pensions market.

In 1981, premium income was #105 mn.  By 1992 it had grown to #1,004
mn.

Recent comment suggests that Scottish Equitable has been a victim of
its own success: further expansion will be difficult without an
injection of capital, which is made more difficult by the company's
mutual structure.

Aegon - one of the top ten insurance groups in Europe, with 1992
revenues equivalent to more than Ecu7.5 bn (nearly two-thirds of it
related to life assurance) - will pay #200 mn into the Scottish
company's with-profits fund, and a further #40 mn to capitalise the new
holding company, which will be 60 per cent owned by the with-profits
fund and 40 per cent by Aegon.

This arrangement has been arrived at because it is estimated that full
demutualisation would have cost Aegon as much as #700 mn.

Scottish Equitable and Aegon are waiting for confirmation from the EC
Commission that the proposed deal is not anti-competitive, as well as
for the approval of policyholders.

UNITED KINGDOM:  SECOND-HAND DEALERS FLOURISH

Policy Portfolio, the North London-based market maker in second-hand
with-profits endowment policies, announced last week its intention to
seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.

The move will make it the only second-hand policy market maker to be
listed in its own right.

Recession in the United Kingdom has seen a surge in the fortunes of
dealers in second-hand policies.

According to the managing director of Policy Portfolio, Mr Isaac Rubin,
more than 50 per cent of with-profits policies taken out in the United
Kingdom are surrendered before they reach maturity.

Owing to clawback of commission and other effects of policy charges,
surrender values can be poor, even after the policy has been in force
for several years.

Policyholders can get a better return by selling the policy on to
another investor, who then collects the final policy value on maturity
or the death of the original owner.

Policies `overvalued'

Several market makers are now in business in Great Britain.  One
investment trust has been set up by Kleinwort to hold second-hand
policies, and two further investment trusts are planned, one from
Barclays de Zoete Wedd market maker Beale Dobie, and the other from
market maker Gerald Edelman.

Insurance companies offering the original policies fear that they may
be overvalued and that the market is not big enough to support all the
players at present in it.

The Kleinwort fund, launched in July 1992, raised #30 mn, of which less
than half has so far been invested, because of a shortage of suitable
policies.

The Financial Intermediaries', Managers' and Brokers' Association
(FIMBRA), one of the United Kingdom's self-regulating organisations,
recently introduced a ruling to make market makers modify their claims
for the projected values of the policies being sold.

The leading with-profits company Standard Life has also caused
controversy recently by writing to holders of second-hand policies to
say that only the normal policy benefits will accrue to such policies.

The company has been quoted as saying that prices `have been bid up
beyond reasonable levels'.

FRANCE:  BIG GROUPS TO BE PRIVATISED

Whereas some 50 conservative deputies either abstained or voted against
the law to give the Bank of France greater independence, the unveiling
of the list of state enterprises that are candidates for privatisation
caused far less contention among the government's supporters.

Most commercial and industrial companies are considered privatisable,
and it appears that the government has no intention of holding on to
either the three state-controlled insurance giants (AGF, GAN and UAP
which between them account for about 28 per cent of new life assurance
business in France) or banks like Banque Nationale de Paris - BNP and
Credit Lyonnais, which do not look particularly attractive buys at the
moment owing to their exposure to small companies, entertainment and
property.

FRANCE:  PUBLICITY DRIVE FOR POSTE AVENIR

La Poste, the French post office, is giving a huge publicity spin
(television ads in prime time and inserts in every TV listings
magazine) to its already established Poste Avenir savings and life
assurance contract.

Managed by the state-controlled Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP),
France's leading life assurer, Poste Avenir is guaranteeing 8 per cent
net of management fees for sums (minimum FF3,000) invested before June
30.

As this is a life-related product, it also gives rise to useful tax
breaks - reductions of FF1,000 per adult and FF250 per dependent child
in the family.

INSURERS LOSE OUT TO BANKS

The longer institutions are involved in bancassurance, the wider the
scope of products and services they aim for, with banks getting the
most benefit from integration.

This is one of the key findings of a paneuropean survey, Making
bancassurance work, published  by Coopers&Lybrand and based on
interviews with senior management of 54 leading players in
bancassurance in France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain and the
United Kingdom.

As an example of what they mean by `integration` the authors of the
survey cite a move from a marketing agreement between a bank and an
insurance company to an exclusive arrangement involving joint training,
product and sales development.

Similarly, a merging of a bank's insurance subsidiary's marketing or
investment management department into one group-led department also
represents more integration.

According to Mr Angus Hislop, a consultant with C&L's financial
services group, banks have gained much more from bancassurance than
insurers. With life products in particular, they have succeeded in
reaching many more of their own customers.

UK institutions the exception

While over two-thirds of all the institutions interviewed for the C&L
survey stated that a major integration had either already been applied
or was planned for at least one of five business functions (sales
force/distribution channels; marketing; service departments;
administration; and senior management), seven out of the 11 UK
institutions were not planning any integration at all.

In other words, the UK institutions show the inverse of the trend among
the continental institutions surveyed.

This, suggest C&L, may be due to a traditionally more short-term
orientation; greater opportunities for early reduction of the unusually
high distribution costs without integration; and a more sceptical
attitude towards the achievement of economies of scale in distribution
and operational functions.

In contrast to the continental institutions, half of the UK
institutions do not plan to realise scale effects in sales and
distribution.

But 30 out of the 43 continental institutions plan to integrate their
distribution channels and sales forces, and 32 of them plan to
integrate marketing functions.

The reasons for developing bancassurance cited most often by the
survey's respondents were factors such as recognising changes in
clients' needs, such as, for example, the demand for more personal
wealth management; building closer ties with clients; and serving them
at all stages of their lives.

This last factor was singled out by all the institutions planning or
applying major integration of business functions as a driving impulse
behind bancassurance.

Defensive and offensive strategy

Defending their customer base is another major driving factor,
especially for institutions integrating their market approaches and
structure.

The survey cites the example of a large French institution whose
primary goal is to sell life assurance.  If the client does not want to
buy at a particular moment, savings products are used to maintain the
relationship with the customer.

A few years later this client will be approached again for life
assurance, and bancassurance is therefore implemented to protect the
core insurance business.  (We might add, however, that the distinction
between life and savings products is not so clear in France as in other
EC countries).

A similar approach has been used by French banks that have successfully
offered money funds to their clients to discourage them from
transferring to other institutions.

In Italy, more than one institution indicated that life assurance, with
a link to a current account, is an effective way to tie the client in
for the medium term.

Seen in this light, bancassurance is as much a defensive strategy to
ward off threats to an institution's client base as an offensive one to
exploit opportunities made possible by integration of business
functions.

GERMANY:  BUSINESS BOOMS AT  MORTGAGE BANKS

German mortgage banks (Hypothekenbanken) recorded a surge in new
commitments to lend in the first four months of this year.

Compared with the January-April period in 1992, new commitments to the
private sector (including loans for house and flat purchase or
conversion; loans for the construction of new dwellings; and loans to
the private commercial sector) rose 46.6 per cent to DM25.4 bn.

Commitments to lend to local authorities rose 51.7 per cent in the
first four months of this year, compared with the corresponding period
of 1992.

The volume of mortgage bonds issued by the Hypothekenbanken rose by
more than 72 per cent to DM68.8 bn.

In spite of the current recession in the German construction industry,
and tightening of the laws governing property rental, a spokesman for
the mortgage banks claimed that their longer-term prospects were
bright, in view of the great housing shortage in west Germany, the need
to raise housing standards in the new federal states, and the extensive
requirements for financing of local authorities.

Since the legal restraints on the conduct by the mortgage banks of
business outside Germany were relaxed in 1991, the banks have granted
more loans in other EC member states.  These loans now amount to close
to DM3 bn, equivalent to 1 per cent of the banks' domestic mortgage
loans.

Most of the credit granted abroad has been to German clients, and the
United Kingdom, France and Netherlands are the main countries
concerned.

The mortgage banks have loans to foreign local authorities to a total
of DM7.5 bn on their balance sheets, equivalent to 2.4 per cent of
total local authority loans.

GERMANY:  LIFE INDUSTRY PYRAMID SALESMEN UNDER ATTACK

New life assurance contracts to the tune of DM 400 billion were written
in Germany in 1992, and pyramid sales companies probably accounted for
more than one-fifth of that colossal total.

The Strukturvertriebe, to give them a name which they do not always
acknowledge, have been the German life industry's success story of the
last decade.

They first appeared on the scene in the aftermath of the IOS debacle,
and after a comparatively slow start could still claim only about 8 per
cent of total new life business by 1985.

But their share of the market more than doubled in the next five years,
and although its rate of growth has slowed down, it is still expanding,
and by the end of the decade on present form could well be nudging 25
per cent of the total.

A hierarchy of eight levels

Not only have the Struckis - as the pyramid salesmen are colloquially
known in Germany -  been capturing a rapidly increasing share of the
market, but the total market is itself growing apace.

To take one indicator, since 1980 life assurance gross premium income
has increased at a compound annual growth rate of nearly 9 per cent,
and in 1992 amounted to a massive DM69.4 billion.

More recently, however, the rate of growth has been accelerating, and
in the last three years it has averaged more than 12 per cent.

In part this acceleration is due to the accession in October 1990 of
the former East German Lander, where a population of 16 million could
not boast a single life assurance policy between them before
reunification.

Significantly enough, the Struckis have been particularly active in
these Lander, where it is claimed they may have as much as 30 per cent
of the market.

A Strukturvertrieb consists of a number  of teams reporting upwards
through a hierarchy of as many as seven or eight levels.

Senior managers (typically known as regional directors) owe their
position entirely to the constant generation of sales income by those
below them in the structure.

Recruits are usually drawn from outside the financial services sector
but, prompted by their companies, they tend to call themselves
Finanzberater or Vermogensberater (literally, wealth or assets
advisers).

And if these self-styled advisers often prefer not to be known as
insurance salesmen, the companies, too, would rather be known to the
public as Allfinanzvertriebe, and like to get the word Beratung
(`consultation') into their registered name.

Officially, indeed, such a company is likely to be registered as an
independent sales force (eigenstandige Aussendienst), while being
wholly or partly owned by an insurance company.

But a Strukturvertrieb's independence may be genuine to the extent that
it does not sell exclusively own-house products, but a fairly wide
range of insurance and investment products from a number of suppliers.

In the former East Germany, one product that has been particularly
popular is a short-term savings contract taking advantage of a State
incentive and designed to release capital for house purchase or
renovation.

Companies selling their products through Struckis have to pay higher
commissions than they offer to brokers or to their own tied agents
(considerably higher in the latter case).

An excessively high lapse rate for policies sold by Struckis - reported
to be as high for some as 18 per cent, or four times the rate
experienced on average by other sales methods - adds significantly to
the acquisition costs of pyramid sales.

Salesmen thoroughly trained

A necessary feature of the system is that commissions received by the
Struckis are never passed on intact to the salesmen..

As much as one-third may be deducted immediately for company overheads,
and the balance then percolates through the structure in ever
decreasing percentages, so that a junior salesman usually receives
between 1 and 1.5 per cent.

An established insurance company agent, by comparison, receives a
commission of 3.5 per cent.

The Strukturvertriebe give new salesmen a thorough training not only in
selling financial products, but in recruiting new potential salesmen.

One of the leading Strukturvertriebe, Bonn Finanz Vermogensberatung AG
(100 per cent owned by the insurance company Deutscher Herold, recently
bought by Deutsche Bank), mounts a 12-week training course.

This consists of three five-day residential seminars backed by work
experience, for which the aspiring salesman has to pay DM2,500.

In general, however, the demands of a system that requires the new
recruit to force through as many sales as he can in the shortest
possible time and to persuade other people to work for him lead to an
exceptionally high dropout rate.

In fact, it is claimed by critics of the pyramid sales  system that
only about one recruit in five survives the first year of selling.

But that is probably the mildest criticism levelled against the
Strukturvertriebe.

The main objections are raised against the Struckis' high pressure
selling methods.

Legally obliged to give good advice

Brokers belonging to medium and small firms, particularly (the large
firms not usually being concerned with mass personal lines insurance)
feel themselves at a disadvantage, because unlike the Struckis they are
legally obliged to give their clients good advice (not yet `best
advice'!) about the growth prospects of investments and protection
against risks.

The Struckis benefit from the fact that in Germany the emphasis in the
supervision of insurance is on products, the design and pricing of
which have to conform to strict guidelines.

Distribution of products, on the other hand, is comparatively
unregulated.  There is, for instance, no provision under law for the
licensing or testing of insurance intermediaries, whether they work as
company tied agents or in the independent sector.

One man who has mounted a vigorous campaign to have tougher rules
applied to independent financial intermediaries is Hans-Wolff Graf, the
chairman and chief executive of the Munich-based financial services
company efv-AG (Erste Finanz- und Vermogensberater Aktiengesellschaft
in Deutschland).

Mr Graf began his own career with IOS and then continued with two of
the largest Allfinanzvertriebe before setting up his own company, and
he brings the missionary zeal of a religious convert to his  campaign.

`To sell a pork cutlet in Germany,' he says, `you have to study for
three years and then work constantly under the vigilant eye of the law.

`Nothing like this is required from anyone selling financial contracts,
including life assurance policies.'

Mr Graf has submitted a draft law governing independent financial
intermediaries to the authorities and has set up a registered
association to pursue his cause.

Embarrassed by sales techniques

One of his more startling claims is that unqualified salesmen, or
`pseudo-consultants' as he calls them will have received more than DM
10 billion in commission last year from new contracts that will sooner
or later be cancelled prematurely.

So far Mr Graf has received little encouragement from Bonn, but the
Berlin-based supervisory authority, the Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das
Versicherungswesen, is said to be embarrassed by the Struckis'
aggressive sales techniques and the flamboyant public image of some of
the leading figures in the sector.

But while these misgivings may be shared by the life assurance industry
in general, many insurance companies have lost members of their tied
agent force to the independent sector, and in the process have become
heavily dependent on Struckis for their new business

Some companies have bought majority or even total share holdings in a
Strukturvertrieb, and although stricter requirements may one day be
imposed on the training and professional standards of the pyramid
salesmen, a system bringing as much as DM 15 billion a year in premium
income is bound to have some keen champions even among the older German
life assurance companies.

PYRAMID POWER ON THE WANE?

While the authorities may be slow to tighten their supervision of the
pyramid salesmen, the Strukturvertriebe may become the victims of their
own excesses.

According to a recent article in manager magazin (published in Hamburg)
, Germany's second largest Allfinanz- or Strukturvertrieb is faced with
a number of problems.

Objektive Vermogensberatung GmbH (OVB) was founded in 1970 by Otto
Wittschier, one of the most senior former IOS salesmen still active in
Germany.  The company's principal shareholder is Deutscher Ring, but
OVB sells a variety of insurance and savings products on behalf of as
many as 18 companies, including Equity & Law, American Express, and
Deutsche Bank's DWS investment fund company.

Data for such items as sales forces are always given in suspiciously
round figures for Strukturvertriebe, but a figure of 15,000 salesmen
(nearly one-third of them recruited in the former DDR) is frequently
quoted for OVB.  But many of these salesmen are reported to be
currently doing little or no business.

Selling mainly life assurance, investment funds, and house purchase
contracts, OVB's salespersons raised the company's turnover from DM4.4
bn in 1989 to DM12.7 bn in 1990, and then to DM15.4 bn in 1991.  But in
1992, turnover plummeted by an ominous 19 per cent to DM12.5 bn.

One reason for the fall in new business appears to be a drying up of
the east German market, where OVB had scored some of its most striking
successes.  But there are also difficulties between Mr Wittschier and
his two co-founders and the parent company.

Under a contentious agreement between the two, Deutscher Ring has to
buy the founders out if they so demand, but Deutscher Ring is reported
to be unwilling to do this.

Further problems are being created by the departure of key personnel at
the top of the company's hierarchy.  One former OVB salesman, Mr
Carsten Maschmeyer, left while still in his 20s in to found his own
company, Allgemeiner Wirtschaftsdienst, in 1988, and the possibility of
new rivals (one's own former star salesmen, as likely as not) appearing
in such an unregulated field must always threaten the established
companies.

One casualty of OVB's present plight is its ambitious plan to extend
operations to other European countries.  After, according to manager
magazin, spending half a million marks on studies and analysis, it has
put its intended Italian operation on the back burner.  In Austria,
where OVB established itself in 1991, the level of business has been
decidedly modest, and in Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, only
the legal formalities have been completed.  OVB was also reported to
have had plans to start up in the United Kingdom, but if there ever
really were such plans, they seem to have been dropped.

A NEW GENERATION OF INVESTORS

Apart from demographic changes, the single factor to have most impact
on future savings trends in Germany will be the growth of personal
incomes. This will affect both the volume of savings and the way they
are allocated between the various available vehicles.

Over the next two decades, for the first time since 1945, a whole
generation of German citizens will come into substantial inherited
wealth. According to estimates made by banks, this generation of
Germans will have aggregate assets of DM 2,500 bn, and their attitudes
towards investments will be vastly different from that of previous
generations who experienced hyper-inflation coupled with economic and
political turmoil. Banks believe they will be more receptive towards
new savings products..

Some market researchers claim that there is a new generation of jungen
Aufstiegsorientierten, akin to yuppies, who demand a wider range of
financial products more finely tuned to the individual's requirements.

COMING OF AGE IN PRAGUE

THE focus of attention this year  in the Czech Republic will inevitably
be on the parliamentary elections in the summer. Political
considerations have already hit an ambitious plan to sell minority
stakes in the country's 16 gas and electricity distribution companies
(eight of each), which has been postponed indefinitely. In the week
before Christmas Roman Ceska, head of the National Property Fund, the
state holding company, said there would be no further strategic
privatizations before the election.

The action, however, is likely to be elsewhere. The last quarter of
1995 saw what many feel could be the start of a new trend - a series of
takeovers, some of them hostile, and large investments by foreign
investors. Among the most notable are Bankers Trust's $250 million
purchase of stakes in two investment funds from Ceska Sporitelna (see
page 4), and the acquisition of stakes in seven leading industrial
companies by Stratton Investments in partnership with Viktor Kozeny's
Harvard fund management group.

Michael Dingman, the Bahamas-based US millionaire who owns Stratton,
has made much of the ground-breaking aspect of his investment company,
with some justification. Stratton's alliance with Harvard allows a
powerful and rich entrepreneur to team up with an equally powerful
entrepreneur with a good reputation for innovation but with little
financial firepower.

Stratton's strategy appears so far to be paying off. Daniel Arbess, a
senior Dingman associate, acknowledges that its original investment is
greater than the $140 million initially mentioned, and is "closer to
$200 million". But he says the stakes, before recent increases in two
of them, are now worth $240 million. Stratton and Harvard have also
gained control of Sepap, the paper group, and the glass holding company
Sklo Union, through boardroom reshuffles.

Bankers Trust's acquisition is the biggest deal yet on the Prague
capital markets. Although the opportunity was relatively rare - Ceska
Sporitelna was under pressure from the Czech National Bank and its
auditors to reduce the stakes it owns in the funds it runs - fund
managers are increasingly taking the view that this type of development
is both inevitable and desirable.

As an investor, Dingman says he sees less risk in the Czech market than
in a Dow Jones index above 5,000. Whether other investors feel that way
will depend on several issues that should be clarified in 1996.

The first is whether an amendment to the securities law is approved.
Tomas Jezek, author of the amendment and a proposed chairman of the PSE
from next summer, is proposing substantial reform of the market that
should offer greater protection to small investors, establish clear
rules for takeovers, and make the stock market more transparent.

But Jezek's proposal is ground down in parliament, which is not likely
to debate it until February, at the earliest. It is facing opposition
from fund managers anxious to preserve the secrecy that currently
surrounds share-dealing. Stratton and Harvard were able to exploit this
secrecy and lack of disclosure to the hilt in developing their alliance
and short term strategy for the companies they targeted. Jezek says he
is confident of having his amendment approved but does not yet know
when that is likely to happen.

The second crucial influence will be the attitude of the bank-run and
independent investment funds to the new wave of foreign money coming
into the market. Ales Barabas, director of capital markets at
Zivnostenska Banka, says fund managers have no objection in principle
to ceding control of their funds to new managers. But he doubts whether
the market is mature enough to ensure that the process is orderly.

He cites the example of Motoinvest, a financial conglomerate that
emerged in November when it made hostile takeovers for some bank-run
funds. Motoinvest's campaign was characterized by secrecy and elements
of greenmail, and its intentions are still not entirely clear.
Executives at the financial group strongly deny greenmail charges and
point out that the promise of more active management they offer has
simply caused larger fund managers to freeze them out.

Barabas says recent developments suggest that, far from being ready for
the next phase of development as a more mature market, recent
developments show the PSE still in "a privatization phase", where banks
are still keen to exert control of assets. There is the potential for
the so-called "third wave" of privatization, he believes, but not the
will among the main shareholders in the market.

Further pressure on the shareholding structure inherited from mass
privatization is likely to be exerted by a third factor that will come
into play in 1996 - Czech membership of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development. Analysts suggest that one of the first
results of membership will be a re-rating of the country as an
investment location, which could spark a fresh wave of capital for
longer term investment. Both Stratton and Bankers Trust are being
touted as examples of this development.

This in turn leads to a fourth consideration - of what action the Czech
National Bank takes on the koruna's exchange rate against the dollar
and deutschemark. Economists say they expect a move early in the New
Year to widen the band against which the koruna fluctuates - currently
half a percentage point either side of parity - to perhaps five points
either side. This could lead to an early but temporary revaluation, to
be followed by a more gradual move towards devaluation, perhaps
encouraged by the monetary authorities ahead of the election to boost
exports.

The Czech market is clearly at a turning point, with pressure building
on several fronts for more consolidation, a freer currency, and greater
transparency in its operations. Policy makers will have to play a
delicate balancing act between the demands of the market on the one
hand and political considerations on the other in what will be a true
test of the country's maturity as a grown-up member of the club of rich
nations.

ANALYSTS BULLISH ON 1996 PROSPECTS

Central Europe watchers think the Czech economy is poised to surge
ahead this year, building on the dynamic growth of 1995.

Industry has boomed, pushing third quarter 1995 GDP 6.3 per cent higher
year-on-year, mostly on the back of strong home demand. Analysts are
confident of further gains in 1996. "We should see growth of 4.7 per
cent in the light of the [1995] third quarter results, and [in 1996] it
will probably be between 5.0 and 6.0 per cent," says Pavel Sobisek of
Zivnostenska Banka. Real GDP for the first nine months of 1995 stood at
4.8 per cent, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU).

Scott Riedel, treasurer of Citibank in Prague, also expects strong 1996
growth but says the country is far from emulating levels seen in the
Asian Tiger economies. "We're looking at around the five per cent level
of 1996 and that's probably conservative. But this economy is quite
young still, and it's a long way behind Far East countries like
Malaysia in terms of sustainable high growth," says Riedel.

While the Czech Republic stands at the higher end of the East European
growth table, it has yet to attract the sort of huge foreign investment
that sparked rapid growth in Southeast Asia. To close the gap with the
rich Western economies more rapidly - something that many in Eastern
and Central Europe see as a primary goal - investment must accelerate,
analysts say. "It is necessary, but I'm just wondering whether we'll
see sustainable increases," says Riedel. The Asian tigers continue to
devour much of the foreign direct investment (FDI) earmarked for
emerging markets.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus hopes the feel-good factor arising from the
booming economy will win his centre-right coalition government another
term in office in this summer's elections. The Czech reform process has
been considerably more stable than in other former Soviet bloc
countries, with year-on-year inflation at eight per cent in November
and unemployment standing at 2.8 per cent. But official figures
compiled by the EBRD in its transition report for 1995 showed sharp
falls in real GDP in the first years of reform.

The EBRD recorded a 14.2 per cent drop in real GDP in 1991 followed by
further, but less spectacular, declines in the next two years, before
an upturn in 1994 when growth hit 2.6 per cent. Even with EBRD-
projected growth of five per cent in 1995, the organization put 1995
real Czech GDP at just 85 per cent of the level before the fall of
communism in 1989. It warned, however, that such comparisons should be
treated with caution because of conceptual and data collection problems
when comparing market and planned economies.

STRATTON MOVES INTO MEDIA

Stratton Investments, owned by the Bahamas-based investor Michael
Dingman, has made a further push into the Czech market with an
agreement in principle to buy a 15 per cent stake in Premiera TV, a
commercial television station.

Stratton said on December 6 it would buy the stake from Investicni a
Postovni Banka (IPB), one of the main commercial banks. If the purchase
is approved by the state broadcasting council IPB's stake in Premiera
will fall to 30 per cent. The bank has been seeking a buyer for the
stake for several months.

"The deal launches Stratton's investment in the media industry in
Central Europe and CIS countries. We look forward to working together
with IPB on this and hopefully other investments in the future,"
Stratton said. Terms were not disclosed.

It is also a departure for Dingman, who stormed into the market in
October, buying stakes in seven industrial companies from Viktor
Kozeny's Harvard fund management group. Premiera is the first
acquisition from a local investor other than Harvard.

Stratton said it was ready to provide Premiera access to "all world-
wide programming resources" and with "foreign experts with a high level
of broadcasting knowledge." Premiera currently reaches less than half
the nationwide audience and is seeking to expand in the teeth of fierce
competition from Nova TV.

Nova, majority-owned by Central European Media Enterprises, which is in
turn controlled by cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, became eastern
Europe's first commercial TV station in early 1993. It has captured a
huge slice of the local advertising market with a successful mix of
imported mass-market series.

Earlier this year IPB was reportedly in talks with companies connected
to Turner Broadcasting and Capital Cities/ABC, the US media giants.
Scandinavian Broadcasting System, which is partially owned by Cap
Cities, has also been mooted as a buyer.

Separately, Stratton bought additional stakes in two of its original
seven investments from the fund management arm of Ceska Sporitelna, the
savings bank. These transactions took its stakes in Prazska
Telparenska, the heating utility for Prague, and in glass industry
holding company Sklo Union to 43 per cent and 66.5 per cent
respectively. The stakes are held jointly by Stratton and Harvard.

Stratton and Harvard have also taken control of the entire management
board of Sklo Union, appointing seven representatives of Harvard at a
shareholder meeting on December 5. The move is similar to the takeover
of the board of Sepap, the paper group now controlled by both
investment companies.

EBRD SELLS COKOLADOVNY STAKE

The EBRD has sold its 12.07 per cent stake in the confectionery company
Cokoladovny to Copart, a joint venture between Nestle of Switzerland
and Danone of France that already owns 56 per cent of the chocolate and
biscuit maker.

Terms were not disclosed but the EBRD said in a statement on December 6
that the sale and price of the shares to Copart was agreed at the time
of the privatization of Cokoladovny in 1992, when the EBRD first
acquired its stake. The stake has a market value currently of about $35
million.

Guy de Selliers, deputy vice president of banking at the EBRD, said in
the statement that the Cokoladovny stake represented the bank's most
mature investment in the country, and was also its first divestment.

Describing Cokoladovny as a successfully transformed company able to
compete and succeed in its markets, de Selliers said the sale was "a
natural departure for the EBRD." The bank expects the proceeds of the
sale to be used for other investment purposes in the Czech Republic as
its focus shifts to investing in post-privatization industry.

LIST OF BIDDERS FOR GSM GROWS

TeleDanmark and Telenor, of Denmark and Norway respectively, are to
make a joint bid for a 49 per cent stake in a GSM mobile telephone
licence, one of two being awarded by the government. The companies said
on December 20 that they would be "equal partners" in their joint
venture but that TeleDanmark would have a majority stake to abide by
rules of a tender for the stake.

Separately, the electricity generator CEZ said it would be making a
joint bid for the licence stake with RWE Telliance of Germany. A third
partner may join that consortium, but TeleDanmark and Telenor said they
would not be seeking a local partner.

The two alliances join a growing list of domestic and international
bidders seeking to win the stake in the licence. The domestic
technology group Ceske Radiokomunikace, which operates television and
radio signal transmission in the country, will own 51 per cent of the
licence.

The licence will cost about $15 million but developing a nationwide GSM
network is set to cost "several hundred million dollars," said Harald
Grytten of Telenor, the dominant Norwegian telecoms provider. Industry
analysts have put the cost of a new network at between $300 million and
$500 million. Most of the finance to develop it will be provided by the
selected partner.

A second GSM licence is being awarded to EuroTel, a joint venture
between the national operator SPT Telecom and the US groups Bell
Atlantic and US West. EuroTel was the first Czech/foreign joint venture
created after the Velvet Revolution of 1989, and has been providing
mobile services since 1990 using low-frequency NMT technology
throughout former Czechoslovakia.

Other groups and consortiums bidding for the stake in the licence
include AirTouch of the US, France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom,
Mannesmann of Germany in partnership with the engineering group Skoda
Plzen, and a consortium of domestic energy distribution companies in a
probable alliance with Telecom Finland.

Bids for the stake, setting out development plans and a timetable for
creating the GSM network, are expected to be sought by the end of
January. A partner for Ceske Radiokomunikace should be chosen by next
March.

BANKERS TRUST BUYS INTO FUNDS

Bankers Trust has bought stakes of 40 per cent in two investment funds
owned and run by Ceska Sporitelna, the savings bank, in the biggest one-
off deal ever on Prague's fledgling capital markets.

The US bank is paying Kc 6.7 billion for the stakes and has said it
will seek to sell them on to other Western investors. It will pay for
the stakes by issuing five-year zero-coupon notes to the savings bank.
During the life of the notes Sporitelna will retain all dividends on
the shares and retain the voting rights on three quarters of each
stake.

Bankers Trust will repay the notes in cash or shares or a combination
of both, depending on whether it has been able to sell the shares in
the funds on to new investors. If it retains any shares in the funds
after five years these shares will be returned to Sporitelna to pay off
the notes.

Sporitelna has been under pressure from its auditors and the Czech
National Bank for some time to reduce the stakes it holds in its own
investment funds.  Under current legislation a bank cannot own more
than 10 per cent of any non-banking asset, including investment funds.

The bank acquired the shares when thousands of its clients defaulted on
loans it issued using individual shareholdings in its funds as
collateral following a slide on the Prague stock exchange during 1994.

Bankers Trust has been developing a relationship with Sporitelna for
several years and is understood to be planning an issue of global
depository shares for the savings bank as part of a long-term strategy.
But Sporitelna is regarded as the weakest of the big four Czech banks
because of its failure to diversify sufficiently away from its core
savings business.

Sporitelna is the biggest lender on the Prague interbank market and has
been hit hard by the instability of some of the country's smaller
banks. It has been exposed to two recent collapses; those of AB Banka -
which it subsequently acquired - and Ceska Banka, which is in
liquidation after collapsing in the autumn. The disposal of the stakes
in its investment funds should enable it to strengthen its balance
sheet.

POLITICAL JITTERS FOR STOCK EXCHANGE

Recent political events have taken their toll on the Warsaw Stock
Exchange. Its main WIG indicator has slipped by 7 per cent since the
last session on November 17, when investors were still confident that
Lech Walesa would win the presidential election.

The news that former communist Aleksander Kwasniewski had won by a
narrow majority took 3.8 per cent off the WIG and the market's slow
recovery in the weeks following was ended by another 3.5 per cent fall
on December 20 in the wake of a public accusation that prime minister
Jozef Oleksy was a Russian agent.

The setback, against the background of low morale on the stock exchange
dating back to before the summer, has caused companies hoping to profit
from stock exchange listings to have second thoughts. Examples include
Forte, a Polish-German furniture producer, which delayed its initial
public offer sine die, and chemicals producer  Boryszew, due to open
its IPO of 600,000 shares priced at Zl 15 at the end of November, but
which has now postponed it until January 10.

January will also see the public offer of 3 million shares in the Ocean
Company, a fledgling retail chain, and Lodzka Drukarnia Akcydensowa,
which specializes in printing for packaging, will be offering between
625,000 and 1.7 million shares priced at Zl 5. The issue by the
company, which has been owned by its management and employees since
1991, has been underwritten by Polish Development Bank (PBR) and the
Lodz-based Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy (PBG), which have agreed to take
300,000 shares for a 5 per cent fee.

Polisa, the private insurance company which came to prominence during
the presidential campaign when it transpired that the wives of both
Kwasniewski and Oleksy hold its shares (see FEE 5:23) has seen the
placement of 1.2 million of its shares in a public offer of between
800,000 and 3.2 million shares priced at Zl 8. Reportedly the
purchasers of around 60 per cent of the shares placed were Bel Leasing
and Forin, two companies controlled by Bank IG, which seems to be
planning to add an insurance arm to its group.

In another development Bank Handlowy has taken a 13.1 per cent stake in
the Wolczanka shirt producer. The stake comes from the bankrupt Bank
Przemyslowo Handlowy (BHK) in Katowice, which is currently being wound
up. The securities commission has given Heineken permission to purchase
BHK's stake in the Zywiec brewery, increasing its stake from its
present 24.9 per cent to 31.8 per cent. The Zywiec stock price has
fallen by 10 per cent recently in the wake of an announcement by Adam
Loewe, the brewery's chief executive, that he would be resigning in the
new year.

Bank Handlowy's move in taking a larger stake in Wolczanka reflects
part of a wider strategy towards the textile sector. Recently the BH
announced that it would be part of a consortium including Wolczanka,
Prochnik and Vistula which aims to bid for the DT Centrum chain of city
centre department stores which are to be privatized this year. Handlowy
has also taken a stake in the Poltex textile mill in Lodz, in exchange
for the company's debts. Meanwhile Wolczanka  is to purchase half of
Handlowy's Poltex equity and is to act as the bank's partner in the
venture.

MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUES PLANNED

Several cities were planning to issue bonds to finance infrastructural
developments as the year closed. Gdansk, which wants to raise Zl 90
million this way and has shortlisted three advisers, is the furthest
along the path.

Gdansk, which wants to help fund the construction of a wholesale goods
distribution centre for the city as well as improve its road link with
its local airport at Rembiechowo has shortlisted ING, the Bank PKO BP
and a group composed of Merrill Lynch, Bank Handlowy and Bank Gdanski
as potential advisers for the project.

Meanwhile Gdynia is considering giving a mandate to ING to raise Zl 28
million through bonds to finance the purchase of 50 Mercedes buses for
the city's transportation system. Lodz, which has yet to take final
decisions on the issue, is also talking of raising Zl 50 million for
new bus purchases.

Other cities considering bond issues are Krakow, which has pencilled in
the sum of Zl 5 million as an initial placement and Warsaw which has
said it would like to finance the construction of a new bridge across
the Vistula river through bonds. Meanwhile Wroclaw has appointed Bank
Handlowy as its financial adviser without specifying whether bonds or
loans will be used to finance its municipal needs. Ostrow Wielkopolski
is another potential bond player with a planned Zl 7.5 million issue.

Most cities are planning a private issue to avoid the costs and delay
accompanying a public placement.

ING, Merrill Lynch and JP Morgan appear to be the foreign investment
banks which have targeted this sector of Poland's financial services
market as a speciality while locally Bank Handlowy and Bank IG are
hoping to serve municipal needs.

MPP GAINING MOMENTUM

The Mass Privatization Programme (MPP) is moving ahead as equity in a
further 99 state sector companies has been allocated to the 15 national
investment funds and coupons entitling people to shares in the funds
are trading at over double their initial price.

Some 2.5 million of the 28 million  people eligible have so far picked
up their coupons, which have been available since November 22. The
coupons, priced at Zl 20, are currently trading at between Zl 50 and Zl
60 and have even been reported as being accepted as common currency
(notoriously in one example by a "social agency", a local euphemism for
a brothel).

The allocations of the equity in the new companies brings the number
now involved up to 513 and the new tranche include valuable assets such
as the Nowiny cement works, the Gryf confectionery producer as well as
the successful Morliny meat processing works in Ostroda near Olsztyn.

Meanwhile the Solidarity-led opposition is keeping up a drum beat of
criticism of the scheme ahead of a referendum planned for February 19.
Poles are to be asked whether they are in favour of "enfranchisement",
Solidarity's word for Czech-style coupon privatization which the trade
union movement argues spread ownership more democratically than the
modes favoured by successive governments in Poland. Critics say Polish
privatization has so far supported efforts by the former Communist
nomenklatura in gaining control over the economy. This argument has now
gained some credibility after President Walesa's electoral defeat.

Deputies from the governing Left Democratic Alliance (SLD) have however
voted through parliament a number of additional questions to be asked
in the referendum. These include a query on the extension of the MPP by
adding more companies (the SLD's coalition partner the Polish Peasant
Party (PSL) was opposed on the grounds that the scheme should be given
time to prove itself before it is expanded). Other new questions dwell
on whether state assets now worth an estimated Zl 75 billion should be
used to capitalize pension funds envisaged under welfare spending
reforms as well as to compensate government employees and pensioners
who suffered unlawful wage cuts at the hands of the administration in
1991 and 1992. Finally the opposition Freedom Union (UW) managed to
force through an amendment which specified that privatization could
include "coupons", which helped to define the enfranchisement question
originally put forward by Solidarity and backed by Lech Walesa.

BUDGET LOOKS FOR $720M OF STATE ASSET DISPOSALS

Disposals of state-owned corporate assets in 1996 are expected to raise
Zl 1.8 billion ($720 million) according to the draft budget for the
year. This is slightly more than the Zl 1.7 billion raised last year
from sales of treasury-owned companies or 13 per cent more than the
figure written into the 1995 budget target.

At the same time the government intends to continue to squeeze
privatization advisory costs which ran to 5 per cent of revenues last
year down to 4 per cent of this year's inflows. This suggests that the
privatization ministry will continue to favour local companies in
tenders for advisory work.

However it can be expected that the sale of a minority stake in the
giant copper producer KGHM Polska Miedz SA will see the appointment of
a foreign adviser. A tender has been announced and bids have to be in
by January 23 for what could be the largest sale of the year through
both GDRs and the Warsaw Stock Exchange.

Other major sales will be DT Centrum, the state-owned chain of
department stores which controls a series of city centre sites in the
country's largest towns and Ruch, once the all powerful newspaper
distribution network. PHS, which is what remains of the state's
wholesale network is to be another "infrastructural" sale in 1996.

In all privatization minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek hopes to dispose of
around 90 companies to local and foreign investors. These will include
breweries in Tychy and Zabrze in southern Poland and Lezajsk in the
south east. A start is also to be made on the heavy chemical sector,
with three bidders shortlisted for two chemical producers,  Janikosody
and Soda Matwy. These are RhOne Poulenc, Brunner Mond and state-owned
chemicals and pharmaceuticals trader Ciech. Other sectors which will
see disposals according to Kaczmarek are cement, furniture and meat
processing.

The minister has also outlined a number of possible public offers which
could include the Celuloza paper works in Swiecie, three fertilizer
producers in Pulawy, Tarnow and Kedzierzyn Kozle. Also included are
Zelmer, a white goods producer in Rzeszow and Polar, which specializes
in washing machines and cookers in Wroclaw.

The list could be supplemented by any one of the three tobacco
producers in Krakow, Poznan or Lodz which the ministry still has on
offer after receiving unsatisfactory bids from investors who include
Philip Morris and Reemstma.

Impexmetal, the still state-owned metals trader which has purchased the
Konin aluminium mill and has plans to swap its debts for equity in the
Zawiercie steel mill, is also expected to be listed this year.

BANK GDANSKI IPO A SUCCESS

Bank Gdanski's privatization, which saw the first use in Poland of
GDRs, drew to a successful conclusion just before Christmas with 60.06
per cent of the equity in private hands and a slight upward trend on
the Warsaw Stock Exchange following the bank's listing at its initial
public offer price of Zl 24.

However the sale was only saved thanks to Bank IG, which took two-
thirds of the domestic tranche and ended up with a 24.07 per cent share
of Gdanski's equity. It was the first time that one of the new small
banks has forged a strategic link with one of the, larger, regional
banks hived off from the National Bank of Poland (NBP) in 1989.
Hitherto private sector banks have concentrated on buying up smaller
institutions to extend their branch network.

Bank IG's move, initiated by its founder and chairman Boguslaw Kott, a
46 year-old former finance ministry official, meant that 527,518 shares
were moved from the foreign to the domestic tranche leaving 7 million
shares or 35.7 per cent of Bank Gdanski's equity in local hands
alongside the treasury's 37 per cent stake.

The reduction in the foreign tranche which HSBC Investment Services,
the government's adviser for the sale, had originally set at between
5.9 million to 6.5 million shares (30 per cent to 33 per cent of the
equity) still saw foreign demand for the BG shares falling short of
supply. In the end HSBC and Daiwa Europe, who acted as joint lead
managers, and were backed by Schroders and Creditanstalt acting
together with Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, SBC Warburg and MC Securities,
guaranteed a mere 4.8 million shares, which ended up with Bank of New
York as the security for the GDRs.

The underwriters took a 4 per cent fee for the service and have
reportedly placed the stock with institutions in Europe and North
America. The GDRs are currently traded at the issue price of $9.48 in
London through the SEAQ international trading system.

GSM AUCTION REMAINS TROUBLED

On January 3 the telecommunications ministry confirmed that three
consortia, all including both domestic and foreign firms, had placed
bids  for the controversial tender for two digital GSM mobile telephone
operating licences.

Telecoms and power equipment trader Elektrim heads one consortium, with
US West as the chief foreign partner, while state-owned chemicals
trader Ciech has teamed up with Stet of Italy in the second group. The
most domestic-ally oriented consortium seems to be the third, led by
the Petrochemia Plock oil refinery and includes KGHM, the domestic
copper conglomerate, PSE, the Polish Power Grid Company, and Tele
Danmark. Foreign partners are limited by the terms of the tender to no
more than 49 per cent of the equity in each group.

But problems and recriminations remain. France Telecom Mobile looks
likely to take the government to court, joining Ameritech, which has
already gone to arbitration to wrest one of the licences from the
authorities. Both companies are basing their claim on a letter written
by the government in 1991, when they won a tender to develop an NMT
mobile telephone system, promising them the GSM licence when the
requisite frequencies became available.

Under the conditions of the tender winning consortia will have to pay
an initial ECU 100 million licence fee augmented by annual payments for
a set period thereafter. The total investment costs of each project are
estimated at $1.2 billion. One factor which is worrying prospective
bidders is that the tender documents do not specify the size of the
interconnect fee the mobile operator will have to pay TP SA, the state-
owned land system operator, for connections with land-based
subscribers. This, according to the tender, will be negotiated with TP
SA once the winners of the bid have been chosen.

LUCCHINI IN MODERNIZATION PROJECT FOR HUTA WARSZAWA

Lucchini, the Italian private steel maker, which took over the Huta
Warszawa steelworks in Warsaw three years ago, has embarked on a three-
stage ECU 161.1 million modernization project for the works.

Lucchini's modernization project, which is financed by the IFC, the
EBRD and a consortium of Italian banks, has been delayed by problems
with establishing the tenure of the land on which the Huta Warszawa is
located. However the group expects to report an around Zl 20 million
net profit for the plant for 1995 following a Zl 1.5 million net profit
in 1994 and a Zl 2.7 million loss the year before. The ECU 65.2 million
first stage will see the steel mill refurbished using equipment from
Danieli of Italy.

In all the modernization programme which will be completed in the
autumn of 1998 will increase the plant's capacity to 1 million tonnes
of steel a year. Last year Huta Lucchini Warszawa produced 380,000
tonnes of steel products and this will rise to 400,000 tonnes this
year.

Meanwhile Stalexport, the listed steel trader, which was forced last
October to withdraw a new share issue which would have raised between
Zl 30 million and Zl 150 million, has completed the construction of a
Zl 155 million modern mini mill at its Labedy works in Silesia. This
will give the mill $30 per tonne savings in energy costs on an annual
output of 350,000 tonnes of semi finished castings. Labedy, which
Stalexport plans to take over when the steel sector is privatized,
specializes in supplies for the Polish coal mining industry.

The equipment for the mini mill was supplied by Mannesman-Demag as well
as Concast Standard from Switzerland and was 28 per cent paid for with
supplier credits as well as a loan amounting to 40 per cent of the cost
from Poland's Environmental Protection Fund (NFOS). The remaining 32
per cent came from Stalexport and the Labedy works.

Stalexport's prospects for a return to its planned new share issue
remain dim. Major existing shareholders like Bank Handlowy and the
Pioneer investment fund who paid Zl 34 per share at the initial public
offer are insisting that any new issues should be priced at around this
level. Meanwhile the company's current share price is languishing
around the Zl 24 per share mark and shows little sign of rising in the
near term. The share issue was to have included a placement abroad
through GDRs with HSBC Investment Services acting as an adviser to
Stalexport.

FRENCH PURCHASER FOR TOBACCO WORKS

The state-owned Radom tobacco works, which control around 13 per cent
of the domestic market, has been sold to Seita, the recently privatized
French cigarette producer. The sale follows the purchase of the
Augustow works by BAT Industries and leaves the government with a
further three companies in Krakow, Lodz and Poznan still on offer.

Seita has agreed to pay $64 million for a 33 per cent stake in Radom
with the option to purchase a further 32 per cent of the equity for a
nominal fee after completing a $40 million investment programme over
three years. Earlier BAT agreed to pay $88 million for a similar stake
in Augustow, which controls 12 per cent of the market and promised to
invest $70 million in the plant.

Market shares however are changing following a pre-privatization
government decision to have the country's cheaper brands, which were
once made throughout the industry, located in Radom and Krakow. Plants
in Krakow, Poznan and Lodz are the other three producers currently on
offer.

This decision means that Radom's market share will rise to around 24
per cent, according to a text in the Rzeczpospolita newspaper written
by the head of Burston Marsteller, a PR company retained by Philip
Morris which is bidding for Krakow. Krakow will also see its pre
allocation share of 35 per cent rise slightly although its expected net
profit of $26 million for 1995 is expected to fall to $24 million as a
result of the decision. The greatest loser, however, is Poznan whose
28.5 per cent market share will be hit and whose pre-allocation net
profit of $9.2 million will fall to around $6.4 million. Reemstma of
Germany is thought to be interested in taking Poznan over.

So far the government has judged offers for the three remaining plants
from bidders such as Philip Morris and Reemstma to be inadequate.
However the Burston Marsteller text would suggest that Philip Morris
values the Krakow works at between $286 million and $327 million and
thus would be willing to pay around $200 million for a 65 per cent
stake. The same text, written before the Radom deal was struck with
Seita, valued the Radom works at between $83 million and $78 million
while the price Seita paid valued the works at $98 million. This
suggests that the government will try to hold out to get PM to improve
its offer by around 10 to 15 per cent.

IMF DEAL IN SIGHT, BUDGET PASSED

Hungary reached the basis of an IMF agreement on a much-delayed 18-
month stand-by loan at the end of a mission in mid-December.

However - much to the anger of the trade unions and social security
officials - the agreement is conditional on parliament's passing
satisfactory budgets for the two state social security funds which
handle health and pensions payments. Parliament is not expected to pass
the budgets of the semi-independent funds before late February.

The unions and fund administrators say they are being blackmailed into
agreeing with finance ministry suggestions for the 1996 fund budgets as
otherwise they will be blamed for scuppering the IMF deal. Economists
say the IMF's condition should at least encourage an early solution to
what has been a highly contentious issue. The funds and the finance
ministry have been locked in discussions over spending plans for 1996
for some time.

Leslie Lipsitz, head of the mission, said the government and IMF had
agreed on the key economic targets until end-1997 and that he was very
hopeful an agreement could be reached and approved early next year. He
said another mission would not be necessary and that the loan could go
to board approval within a couple of weeks of parliament passing the
social security budgets.

Ever since a Socialist-led coalition took office in July 1994, Hungary
has been keen to secure an IMF stand-by to boost its standing on
international markets and with foreign investors. Central banks
officials have said that Hungary, which recently repaid some of its
earlier IMF loans ahead of schedule, may not even draw on the present
planned stand-by likely to be worth $300 million.

Lipsitz said Hungary aimed to bring down inflation to 20 per cent by
the end of 1996 and to 15 per cent by late 1997. GDP is forecasted to
rise by 2-3 per cent this year and by more than 3 per cent from 1997
onwards, up from an estimated 2 per cent in 1995. The budget deficit
for this year is put at 4 per cent and is due to fall to 3 per cent
next year. The target current account for this year is $2 billion and
is due to fall to $1.5 billion in 1997, down from more than $2.5
billion in 1995 and $3.9 billion in 1994.

MATAV RAISES A FURTHER $852M

After months of often difficult negotiations, Ameritech, the US
regional operator, and Deutsche Telekom have succeeded in their quest
to purchase a majority stake in Matav, Hungary's telecoms operator in
which they had held a minority cent stake since 1993. Matav becomes the
first national telecoms operator in the region to pass to majority
foreign ownership.

In late December, Magyarcom, the consortium formed by the two companies
two years ago, agreed to pay $852 million for a further 37 per cent of
Matav, bringing their total stake to around 67 per cent. The sale,
together with the US-German consortium's purchase of a 30.3 per cent
stake for $875 million in December 1993, is the region's largest
privatization to date and the largest foreign investment in Hungary.

However, the deal - the culmination of a spate of year-end sales by APV
Rt, the state privatization agency - nearly fell through at the last
minute. Ron Sommer, chairman of Deutsche Telekom's management board,
and Walter Catlow, Ameritech vice-president, flew into Budapest to sign
the purchase contract only to run into an eleventh-hour hitch requiring
further negotiations. The deal was finally clinched after delays of
several hours.

Sources said the Hungarian side failed to include all the consortium's
contractual rights in the purchase document and also sought guarantees
that Magyarcom would not exit its investment within a fixed period of
time.

APV Rt said the consortium, in which Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom
have equal shares, had undertaken to float the company and reduce its
stake from 67 per cent to 50 per cent plus one vote by the end of the
century.

The state is due to retain a 25 per cent plus one stake in Matav, one
of Hungary's leading blue chip companies, while management and
employees are to be offered up to 2.7 per cent. Hungary was advised on
the sale by CS First Boston.

In the summer, when Hungary appointed CSFB as adviser, most analysts
doubted Hungary would sell a majority stake to Magyarcom. State
officials also indicated they would prefer to bring in institutional
investors and float the company in line with a government policy to
boost the Budapest Stock Exchange through privatization when possible.

But the consortium consistently argued against an early public offer on
the grounds that the company would fetch more once it had completed a
three-year Ft 210 billion ($1.5 billion) investment and restructuring
plan begun last year. An offer at a lower price than the consortium
paid would also have forced Ameritech and Deutsche Telekom to write
down their investments at a loss.

Magyarcom also wished to have full control of the company. Although it
gained significant management control in 1993, including a power of
veto over some decisions, it frequently had to spend much time
negotiating issues with its Hungarian partners. It took several months,
for example, for the two sides to agree on a new managing director in
early 1995.

At the signing ceremony, Sommer said the consortium was committed to
developing further Hungary's telecoms infrastructure and to making
Matav, the region's leading telecoms company. As part of its successful
bid in 1993, the consortium agreed to make Matav an international
telecoms hub and to increase the number of telephone lines by 15.5 per
cent annually - a target it exceeded by some eight percentage points in
1995.

Matav has a monopoly on national long-distance and international calls
until 2001 and will also be the exclusive operator in 39 out of 54
local network regions during this time. In addition, it has majority
stakes in two out of three local mobile telephone companies.

Catlow said the company had decided to increase its stake in Matav as
the Hungarian telecoms sector was the most attractive for investment in
the region. Ameritech is in dispute with the Polish government which it
alleges has reneged on a promise to grant it a digital mobile telephone
licence.

SERVIER ACQUIRES MAJORITY OF EGIS

Servier, the privately-held French pharmaceuticals company, formed a
strategic alliance with and acquired a 51 per cent stake in Egis, one
of Hungary's leading pharmaceuticals producers, in late December.
Servier, France's third largest pharmaceutical supplier, acquired 30
per cent of the company from the EBRD and the balance from NatWest
Securities.

The purchase price was not disclosed. However, the company's market
capitalization at the end of trading on December 15, the last day
before the purchase, was $184 million. Peter Reiniger, joint head of
the EBRD's Hungary team, told FEE  that the bank, which paid $45
million for its stake in late 1993, had made a profit on the
transaction. He said the value of the deal reflected the company's
share price as well as a premium for the purchase of a controlling
stake.

Egis, Hungary's second largest pharmaceutical company after Richter
Gedeon, was the leader on the local market in 1994 with a 13 per cent
market share. Exports accounted for 44 per cent of total sales. The
company, which went public in June 1994, made a profit of Ft3.8 billion
($31 million) on turnover of Ft14.4 billion in the first nine months of
1995.

Last summer the state's remaining 28 per cent stake in Egis was sold to
NatWest Securities at a price of Ft2,550 a share, compared to Ft3,275
in December, making the company the first of the country's large
pharmaceutical companies to become 100 per cent private.

The sale to NatWest, however, caused considerable controversy after it
emerged that the EBRD had urged the government to sell its shares to
NatWest - whose corporate finance division had been appointed to advise
on the sale - rather than to rivals including CS First Boston.

Brokers say the sale to NatWest without a proper tender for the shares
was in contravention of Hungary's new privatization law, passed last
May. However, the EBRD insisted on the sale to a "friendly party" on
the grounds that its 30 per cent stake would be worth less unless sold
in tandem with the government's remaining stake. EBRD officials told
FEE they had initially urged the government to sell its stake later
once a strategic partner had been found but that APV, anxious to raise
privatization revenues, had insisted on divesting its stake in the
summer. Only then had the EBRD stepped in and ensured the two stakes
could still be sold together.

The sale is one of only two "exits" made by the EBRD - earlier in
December it sold on its stake in a Czech chocolate maker. Officials
said the two sales reflected the growing maturity and stability in
Hungary and the Czech Republic and were also textbook examples of the
role the bank was set up to play. In both cases the bank got involved
in the companies' privatizations, acting as a "bridge" between the
state and private buyers.

Analysts said the sale also reflected Hungary's leading role in the
regional pharmaceuticals industry. The deal came only days after the
launch of a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a medium-sized private
drugs producer (see following article), and just weeks after the sale
of 78 per cent of Biogal, another former state-owned pharmaceutical
company, to Teva of Israel for $26 million (FEE 5:22). Sanofi of France
owns a majority stake in Chinoin while Richter Gedeon has been floated
(FEE 5:22) and is now majority-owned by institutional and local
investors.

The Egis acquisition is Servier's first in central and eastern Europe.
Servier officials said they had negotiated the purchase in just six
weeks and had not yet decided whether they would increase their stake
further.

BRISTOL-MYERS LAUNCHES OFFER FOR PHARMAVIT

Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the US pharmaceuticals giant, has launched
a $110 million offer for Pharmavit, a rapidly expanding local
pharmaceutical company, set up in 1988. The offer, which is for 100 per
cent of the company, is Hungary's first public takeover of a company
listed on the Budapest Stock Exchange and one of the first such
takeovers in the region.

BMS said it had already reached agreement to buy 77 per cent of the
company from its majority owners Dr Imre Somody, Pharmavit chief
executive and founder, and Genericon Pharma, an Austrian
pharmaceuticals company. Its offer to both majority and minority
shareholders is to be at the same price even though Hungary has few
regulations governing takeovers and ensuring minority shareholder
protection.

BMS has offered $62.35 per share or $12.47 per global depository share,
each representing one fifth of a share - a significant premium over the
company's stock market price. GDSs were trading at $7.25 in the London
OTC market the day before the offer was announced in December, down
from an offer price of $57.5 when the company went public in June 1994.

BMS said its offer which closes on January 26 was conditional on it
gaining 90 per cent of Pharmavit and that it intended to withdraw the
company from the BSE. The vast majority of the 23 per cent stake not
owned by the majority shareholders is held by foreign institutional
investors.

BMS is being advised on the sale by Schroders, the UK investment bank,
together with Creditanstalt Securities Budapest - the same team which
this year advised on the flotation of OTP, the national savings bank,
and on the placement of a further tranche of Richter Gedeon, Hungary's
largest pharmaceuticals company.

Pharmavit made pre-tax profit of Ft632 million ($5.7 million) on
turnover of Ft4.1 billion in 1994, up from Ft533 million on turnover of
Ft2.4 billion in 1993. It is Hungary's leading producer of vitamin
pills - mainly through its Plussz effervescent tables. Most of its
sales are in Hungary but the company also has sales subsidiaries in the
Czech Republic, Slovakia and Poland.

The company is one of a growing breed of eastern European companies,
set up at the beginning of market-led changes, which are now
sufficiently mature to attract the interest of a multinational company.

Since 1990 the company has also produced generic drugs and over-the-
counter medicines. Its main pharmaceutical product is Diclofenac, an
anti-inflammatory drug developed by Ciba-Geigy.

Before setting up Pharmavit, Somody, 37, was a director at Chinoin, the
local drugs company now owned by Sanofi of France. He will stay on as
head of BSM in Hungary - although Pharmavit is to retain its
independence. BSM intends to use Pharmavit, its first acquisition in
the central and eastern Europe, to expand further in the region.

Somody recommended that minority shareholders accept the offer. He
apologised for the company's change of strategy - Pharmavit had
previously indicated it would not seek a strategic partner - but said
BSM's offer was a good one.

GE CAPITAL, EBRD ACQUIRE BUDAPEST BANK

GE Capital, the financial services division of General Electric of the
US, and the EBRD have together acquired a 60 per cent stake in Budapest
Bank for $87 million, ending the bank's three years on the sale block.

Like Matav, however, the sale suffered a number of last minute hitches
as both sides rushed to meet a December 15 deadline. The deadline was
set in late 1994 when the government agreed to transfer Ft12 billion in
state securities to the bank - to make it more attractive ahead of
privatization - on condition it was sold by December 15 1995. In the
end, the deadline had to be extended for two weeks while the deal was
finalized. Senior GE and EBRD officials, including Christopher
MacKenzie, GE Capital's chief executive in Europe, flew into Budapest
with the expectations that a deal would be signed by the 15th only to
leave empty-handed. A technical hitch appeared which could only be
resolved by finance minister Lajos Bokros, who was away at the time. It
appears that liability for at least one court case involving Budapest
Bank had not been fully resolved in the sales contract, causing a three-
day delay in the signing.

Under the terms of the agreement, GE Capital, which will take a 27.5
per cent stake, will assume operational control of the bank. Together
with the EBRD, which has a 32.5 per cent, GE has an option to increase
its stake by 22 per cent within five and a half years. Until the sale
the state held an 82.6 per cent stake in the bank.

Hungary was advised on the sale jointly by Salomon Brothers and Lehman
Brothers. Salomon initially won the adviser's contract but was obliged
to share it with Lehman after much of its banking team left to join
Lehman.

The sale is a significant boost to government efforts to sell off state
banks, many of which have borne the brunt of the country's difficult
post-communist transition and have proved hard to privatize. The deal
is only Hungary's second sale of a large commercial bank to a Western
strategic partner. It follows the sale of a 25 per cent plus one vote
stake in Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank, the foreign trade bank, to
Bayerische Landesbank in mid-1994.

GE Capital, which is expanding aggressively into Europe through a
string of recent acquisitions, entered the bidding for Budapest Bank,
Hungary's fifth largest commercial bank, relatively late. It was not
one of the three companies which tendered for the bank in late 1994.
Then, Credit Suisse was named preferred bidder ahead of ING and Allied
Irish, only to withdraw abruptly in March after conducting due
diligence.

GE Capital and the EBRD signed a letter of intent to purchase the bank
in October and subsequently conducted due diligence. The buyers are
understood to have initially offered around $100 million but scaled
back their offer to $87 million after due diligence. Like other banks,
Budapest Bank has suffered from bad loans and in the middle of last
year had to make 15 per cent risk provisions. The bank has assets of
around Ft215 billion and 74 branches.

GE Capital, whose parent company is one of the biggest investors in
Hungary, said it would bring in new financial products and modern
technology. It is expected to keep on Bela Singlovics, the bank's chief
executive.

POLITICAL FEARS KEEP INVESTORS AWAY DESPITE BOOMING ECONOMY

For 1995, Slovakia should achieve the second-highest growth rate among
east Europe's emerging markets behind Albania, with gross domestic
product rising by 6 per cent. Economists expect a similar growth rate
in 1996 as key industries such as chemicals and steel continue to
benefit from booming export markets and as domestic demand grows.

Whether this rosy scenario leads to a reassessment of the country by
domestic and foreign investors will depend crucially on whether the
prime minister, Vladimir Meciar, is prepared to settle his damaging
constitutional row with President Michal Kovac. It is this power
struggle more than anything that has caused Slovakia to lag behind its
peers in the Visegrad group of countries - the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland - in the eyes of foreign observers, to the detriment of its
reputation abroad.

There appears to be little likelihood of an early reconciliation, and
diplomats in Bratislava say they can see no way out of the deadlock.
"Meciar must make the first move, and he does not appear willing to do
so," one diplomat said before Christmas. Until he does, the diplomat
adds, Slovakia will remain in limbo.

So far, however, the political row has not had an adverse impact on the
economy. Indeed, there is much progress on all fronts, including
privatization, which has speeded up considerably since the government
abandoned coupon sell-offs early in 1995 and replaced them with an ad
hoc series of sales to a narrow group of owner/managers. The key
question in 1996, as privatization reaches a climax, is: What next?

There were good reasons for abandoning coupon privatization. It is slow
and can be an administrative nightmare. It results in widely dispersed
ownership and to be truly successful it requires the immediate
implementation of rules to protect small investors (which are not yet
forthcoming in, for example, the Czech Republic).

On the other hand, it has a measure of transparency and fairness in
that all adult citizens can participate, making it politically popular.

The government's main argument for abandoning the coupon plan was that
dispersed shareholdings meant there was no clearly identified owner.
There was also the unstated fear among the nationalists that the back
door would be opened to foreign investors to pick up assets on the
cheap.

Critics argued that these were excuses for abandoning privatization
altogether. In fact, the reverse has happened. The adoption of
"standard methods" of privatization has quickened the pace
considerably, with hundreds of sell-offs in the second half of this
year with an estimated book value of $1 billion.  These range from
small factories to a big chunk of the Slovnaft petrochemical group .

The speed of the sell-offs is admirable. About 65 per cent of gross
domestic product is now generated by the private sector, according to
official estimates. The vast majority of these sales have been made to
executives and workers at the enterprises involved.

Meciar defends the methods used to reduce state ownership: "Various
lobbies say our methods are undemocratic. We think they are necessary
and inevitable," he says.

Yet there are clear signs of a wider agenda in the current bout of
privatization fever. Assets are often sold at knock-down prices and
buyers have 10 years to pay for them. If the enterprise is deemed
important enough, a controversial and ambiguous law on strategic
enterprises enables the state to retain a golden share that allows it
to wield influence long after the stake has been sold.

Most contentiously, critics say assets are sold only to those deemed
loyal to Meciar's all-embracing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia.

Eugen Jurzyca of the Centre for Economic Development, a think tank,
doubts the wisdom of what he terms "family circle privatization".
Selling companies on the cheap throws away money that could be used for
social spending and the relief of bad debts. It also promotes
inequality by concentrating potentially valuable assets among a narrow
group who can then sell them on at great profit to themselves.

There is also growing concern about how these assets are being paid
for, in a country chronically short of capital. Those managers who buy
the stakes will owe substantial sums to the state holding company, the
National Property Fund (NPF), over the 10-year period of the payment.
The fear is that company cash flow will be diverted in the form of
dividends to owners to make those payments.

Few Slovak companies have the cash flow to afford this. "The company is
paying for its own acquisition in the end," notes Jean-Christophe Ganz,
manager of ING Bank in Bratislava.

Economists play down the political dimension of privatization. For the
National Bank of Slovakia the important thing is that it is continuing,
says Elena Kohutikova, head of the independent central bank's monetary
policy unit. "It is difficult to decide which privatization policy is
the best one," she says.

So far the government's policy has not had an adverse impact on
inflation, but nor has it enabled substantial inflows of fresh capital
and know-how. This raises two further questions. The first is how the
cost of the bond issue will be met.

Each coupon holder is to receive a nominal Sk 10,000 ($345) bond backed
by the assets of the NPF. The bonds can be used for things like paying
for an apartment or contributing to a private pension scheme, requiring
early redemption, and they are also likely to be transferable.

The bonds are due to mature in 2001, requiring the NPF to have up to Sk
35 billion ($1.2 billion) available to pay out. Meantime there is
annual interest based on the discount rate (currently 9.75 per cent).
Although not all holders are expected to retain the bonds to maturity,
economists warn that the potential cost of the scheme could be as high
as Sk 50 billion ($1.7 billion). This is a giant mortgage on the NPF
that it must be able to discharge.

The second question is how industry will be restructured. Key companies
like Slovnaft and the big VSZ steel plant have largely modernized and
are helping to fuel economic growth. Many others await the kiss of
life.

Foreign investment is one obvious solution, and some observers expect a
push to attract it in 1996. This would be a volte face for the
government, but one that Meciar may be pragmatic enough to pull off.

POWER INDUSTRY RESTRUCTURED

The EBRD is backing Ukraine's power sector with a loan of $61.9 million
to support the restructuring of the country's power sector. Following
an EU and UK Know-How-Fund commissioned study on Ukraine's power
industry, the government is set to re-organize the thermal power
sector, to include the creation of thermal generating companies,
broadly following the pattern established during the privatization of
Britain's power industry.

The loan will go to the country's four newly created thermal generating
companies to finance repair and maintenance at the largest thermal
power plants in order to improve the reliability of power generation.
The loan will also pay for more accurate meters, investments required
to start a wholesale electricity market, which is to be set up soon.
Funds will also pay for managerial assistance to provide modern
accountancy measures and financial management techniques.

The loan was signed during President Leonid Kuchma's official visit to
London in December, when the EBRD signed a total of $75 million in
funding to Ukrainian enterprises. In view of the continued operation of
the Chernobyl nuclear power station, which Western experts unanimously
want closed down, it is a top priority to help provide a more reliable
power industry to replace the Chernobyl plant.

"Perhaps the most urgent issue for Ukraine today concerns the country's
energy sector," said Kuchma during his London visit. "With the EBRD's
loan we can strengthen our existing resources, in this case thermal
power plants."

In the longer term, the project will include a "twinning" programme for
management with a Western power company. The actual company has yet to
be chosen.

$50M AGREEMENT SIGNED

President Kuchma's London visit saw the signing of an important project
aimed to grease the wheels of trade in Ukraine. The EBRD has signed a
$50 million trade finance agreement under which it will guarantee the
payments of participating Ukrainian banks to their foreign
correspondent banks. The Ukrainian Innovation Bank (Ukrinbank), a
private bank, is the first to sign up to the programme. Other banks are
expected to join the programme shortly.

The programme was first started in Russian and Macedonia. Day-to-day
trade is stifled by a chronic shortage of trade finance, covering both
exports and imports from the East European countries. Under the
programme, the EBRD guarantees six-month letters of credit issued by
selected financial institutions. This guarantee allows banks to
establish reliable reputations with Western financial institutions,
enabling them to adopt normal correspondent relations with banks in
Eastern Europe. The programme may be expanded later to cover banks in
Eastern Europe and in "lost" markets, such as India, where Ukrainian
enterprises used to export five years ago.

Under the programme, the Ukrainian bank informs the EBRD which foreign
bank it wants to deal with and pays the EBRD a fee to cover the
guarantee. The EBRD guarantees up to 80 per cent of the letter of
credit thus allowing importers and exporters to get out of the current
stalemate and re-establish trade on a normal footing.

EBRD INCREASES UKRAINE FUND CAPITAL

The EBRD is backing equity funding by increasing the capital base of
the Ukraine Fund, the first private venture funds to be established in
Ukraine. Set up two years ago, the fund has lent $5 million to 18
companies. The EBRD will now increase its capital base by a further
$6.5 million. Equity funding has been provided to companies
manufacturing medical equipment, construction materials and food
processing and distribution.

The fund was established with a group of international investors,
including Bank of Boston and Claflin Capital Management. Despite the
difficult economic conditions, the Fund was oversubscribed and
initially raised $12 million as against a target of $10 million.

The EBRD is backing further infrastructure investment with an
investment of $5 million to assist in the construction of a fertilizer
terminal, Transinvestservice at Odessa. The terminal is part-owned by
the Ukrainian State Property Fund, the Norwegian company, Norsk Hydro
as well as local investors. The terminal will be used mainly for the
export of fertilizers from Ukraine and other CIS countries to Latin
America and Asia.

These investments bring the value of signed commitments to a total of
about $312 million for this year. EBRD president Jacques de LarosiAre
noted that the bank is able to achieve this due to the improved macro-
economic situation in the country and the growth of the private sector.
This total compares favourably with the EBRD projects approved in 1994,
when Ecu 153.9 million was committed in only three projects.

TACIS FUNDS THREATENED

Technical assistance programmes to the CIS countries are under threat
following a top-level move to block funding from the European Union.
Spain is demanding tougher controls and greater participation in
awarding contracts under the TACIS programme, which funds technical
assistance programmes to the 12 CIS member countries.

No agreement has been reached to authorize the TACIS budget of Ecu 500
million for 1996. While this dispute will not stop the programme in its
tracks, unless there is a resolution soon, the effects will be felt in
the future.

"We have the legal base to operate by extending the present regulations
for one year, but the budget is unclear," said EU official, Per Winter.

Although TACIS officials agree on financial commitments within each
budgetary year, which runs to December 31, the drawdown period can
extend for up to three years. Winter added that there is always a rush
to complete commitments by the end of the year in order to spend the
full annual allocation. If there is agreement within the first few
months of 1996, then officials are confident that the programme will be
able to fulfil commitments for the year. Funding for the programme will
be discussed again early in 1996, when it is hoped that Spain and other
possible allies might be persuaded to authorize a budget.

Spain is objecting to the way TACIS is run, mainly because so far
Spanish companies have only won 2 per cent of the programme's
contracts. EU officials claim they have tried to interest Spanish
companies in the programme, but with little success. They point out
that Spain scoops the pool in Latin America, but have little experience
or language skills in Eastern Europe. Spain wants to introduce a new
system of monitoring contracts and reduce the financial threshold for
contracts that are tendered, proposals resisted by other Member States,
who fear it would create a larger bureaucracy and lead to delays.

The TACIS programme had earlier been attacked by the European Court of
Auditors for inefficiency and poor targeting of funds, criticism that
the PHARE programme, aimed at the Central European countries had
earlier suffered. PHARE has been re-drafted, changed its bureaucratic
structure and focus to enable it to prepare the Central European
countries for joining the EU.

At the Cannes meeting in June, the EU decided to change the funding
mechanism for PHARE from an annual budget system to a five-year budget
of Ecu 6.7 billion, to avoid the annual scramble to commit funds by the
end of the year. The civil service oversight was also changed from a
sectoral to a country basis. There are now country desks and these
officials hold monthly meetings in the countries' capitals to determine
the future programmes in agreement with the individual governments.

Contracts under the PHARE programme have also changed from a series of
technical assistance contracts to a cohesive pre-accession strategy.
There are three main strands of the PHARE strategy.

The primary aim is devoted to helping the countries prepare for
membership of the EU. Each country has to work out a programme of
action that includes passing new legislation, preparing and ensuring
its enforcement and introducing European technical norms and standards.
While the programmes are driven by the individual countries, if EU
officials feel that the programmes do not make a realistic contribution
to EU integration, then they can reduce the funds available.

The second priority for PHARE funding is for infrastructure in areas
such as telecommunications, environment, gass and electricity networks
and road and rail transport. In transport, the EU has designated Trans-
European Networks, which integrate Central Europe's roads and railways
with existing networks in Western Europe and in particular easing
bottlenecks at border crossings.

 PHARE has now expanded into also providing finance in order to
catalyse foreign investments. Typically this might take the form of
putting up the government's share in an investment programme. The first
time this was done was two years ago, when the World Bank and the
European Investment Bank were looking to the Polish government to kick
in 10 per cent of the money needed to upgrade the E20 railway line from
Berlin to Warsaw. The Polish government re-drafted its proposed PHARE
programme to allow the money available to be spent on the railway
project.

EU officials are confident that the accession of the Central European
countries will be the best prepared of any new Member States. The
timing of their entry remains in the air, and it is also undecided
whether they will come in singly or in groups. What is certain is that
Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary will be the first, with
officials speculating that the likely entry date is the year 2000.
Meanwhile, Slovenia, which would also qualify for early entry, has not
signed an Association Agreement yet, because of a dispute with Italy,
while Macedonia, having solved its dispute with Greece, now qualifies
for PHARE assistance. The eligibility of the other former Yugoslav
republics remains in limbo.

FOCUS ON ENFORCEMENT

The UK Securities and Investments Board (SIB), under its chairman,
Andrew Large, is entering a new phase in its attempt to police London's
financial markets.

The SIB's early years were mainly taken up with detailed rule-setting;
subsequently there was a shift away from detailed rules in favour of
broader principles which the self-regulating organizations (SROs) could
then apply; and now, following some spectacular financial scandals, the
emphasis is on enforcement.

The background to this problem is the fragmentation of responsibility
for tackling market abuse. The multifinance enforcement agencies
involved include the Department of Trade and Industry, the Treasury,
the Crown Prosecution Service, the Services Fraud Office, the
Securities and Futures Authority, the Stock Exchange - and, of course,
the SIB.

The SIB Chairman is now proposing a much more centralised and effective
enforcement regime, based partly on US experience. Firstly, he wants to
see the development of a central transaction database covering on-
exchange and off-exchange transactions in both cash and derivatives
markets, so that abuse can be better detected. Secondly, the
investigation of abuse needs to be strengthened, particularly where
misconduct is of a criminal nature. And, finally, there should be more
effective enforcement action to deal with cases where abuse has been
established - as already reflected in the SIB's willingness to use its
powers under Section 59 of the Financial Services Act to ban people
from the investment industry.

In the areas of investigation and enforcement the SIB is now focusing
its efforts on more rigorous monitoring of the performance of the SROs
that come under its wing. This is being done through on-site
supervisory reviews of both the SROs themselves and (more
controversially) individual regulated firms. However, the SIB believes
that it is handicapped through insufficient statutory powers:
specifically, powers relating to the appointment of officers of SROs
and the imposition of monetary penalties on SROs where there is a
failure to comply with regulations.

In addition, the SIB would like to possess punitive powers over
authorised firms (eg the power to impose fines). The belief is that
fallback enforcement powers of this kind would encourage more decisive
action by SROs who would wish to avoid any need for the SIB to
intervene.

But the most radical new ideas on enforcement concern the interface
between the civil and criminal law. Mr Large has pointed out that in
the US, market abuse may be dealt with both under the criminal law and
as an administrative "offence", for which the SEC may impose penalties
of three times the profit made. The most serious cases are dealt with
by criminal prosecutors but in many other cases the civil route is
preferred, the public interest being served by the payment of financial
penalties to the SEC, which passes them to the US Treasury. This regime
is further buttressed by a plea-bargaining system which often avoids
the need for protracted legal proceedings.

Mr Large evidently sees much to be admired in the US enforcement
regime, and on the particular issue of plea-bargaining he expressed his
views forcefully earlier this month:

"I believe it cannot be beyond the wit of man, and certainly not beyond
the combined brain power of our best legal minds, to devise a fair and
open system of plea-negotiations which respects the role of the
judiciary in sentencing, a guilty defendant's desire to own up quickly
and on all fronts, and the needs of our criminal and regulatory-
enforcement agencies to secure their respective objectives without
wasting valuable resources - that could command real public
confidence."

The fact is that the law, and the law enforcement agencies, have
fallen into disrepute following a succession of failed prosecutions
involving allegations of financial fraud and market abuse. The public
perception is that the UK legal/ regulatory system is simply incapable
of dealing with serious misconduct based on sophisticated exploitation
of London's increasingly complex financial markets. The SIB chairman
clearly wants to do something about this, but it will require the co-
operation of Parliament and, above all, the legal profession, if
financial law and order is to be restored.

SEC REPROPOSES "LARGE TRADER" REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

In reply to an unusually large volume of negative comments, the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has modified its earlier
proposed rule requiring reporting by "large traders" both inside and
outside the US on transactions effected in "publicly traded securities"
using US market facilities. (For a description of the originally
proposed rule, see FT-FRR January 1992.)

As re-proposed, Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identify
themselves to the SEC, and require their brokers to maintain records of
the large traders' activity, to be provided to the SEC upon request. A
large trader is a person who, for an account he owns or controls,
effects transactions, during a calendar day where the account is
located, in publicly traded securities, aggregating at least the lesser
of (a) 200,000 shares with a fair market value of $2 million, or (b)
$10 million fair market value, or that constitute "program trading."
("Program trading" is either index arbitrage or any trading strategy
involving the related purchase or sale of a basket of 15 or more
publicly traded securities with fair market value of at least
$1,000,000.)

The modifications are designed to reduce the number of traders
affected, as well as the burdens and costs of the proposed system on
both large traders and their brokers. This is accomplished through:
clarifying the definition of a large trader; increasing the minimum
level of trading that requires reporting; reducing the amount of
information required for filing; streamlining the filing itself, as
well as providing for an inactive status; improving the instructions
for filing; reducing record keeping requirements; providing special
reporting requirements for execution times; and defining a safe harbour
for the broker's duty to supervise his large trader clients.

The large trader reporting system, if approved as re-proposed, will
require large traders to file Form 13H with the SEC to obtain a large
trader identification number (LTID). Each trader is then responsible
for advising his brokers of his LTID and all accounts to which it
applies. These brokers must maintain records of the trades for the
accounts, which they will be required to provide to the SEC upon
request. The brokers must also supervise their clients' compliance with
the rule. The large traders themselves are required to update Form 13H
annually.

In the re-proposal, the large trader definition has been clarified to
include a person who effects transactions "for an account that he owns
or controls" in place of the original "for his own account or an
account for which he exercises investment discretion." According to the
SEC, this change is merely a clarification and does not change the
functional meaning of the definition. The re-proposal includes similar
clarifications with regard to the definitions of "person," "account,"
"ownership," "control," and "transaction." The revisions are designed
to limit the reach of the large trader definition by limiting the
number of accounts that are deemed to be owned or controlled
indirectly.

Probably the most important modification is that of the increase in the
level of activity which identifies one as a large trader. The
identifying activity level for any 24-hour period would increase from
activity involving 100,000 shares or a fair market value of $4 million
to 200,000 shares or a fair market value of $10 million. In addition,
those 200,000 shares must have a fair market value of $2 million, in
effect excluding from large trader status many who trade in large
volumes of lower priced securities. The re-proposed activity levels are
also intended to minimise the impact of the rule on natural persons who
infrequently trade large amounts of securities.

To simplify the identification of activity which requires reporting,
the SEC has proposed to change the 24-hour period to "a calendar day
where the account is located." The change will preclude the need to
aggregate trades occurring on different days, or to "correct" for time
zone differences. An account is deemed to be located at the principal
place of business of the broker, not where the client is located.

The re-proposal narrows the scope of the rules for aggregation of
accounts and transactions. This is accomplished partly through the
modifications to the definitions of "ownership" and "control." In
addition, aggregation of accounts will not be required where the
aggregation would include accounts of a person who would independently
qualify as a large trader. On the other hand, aggregation will be
required to include accounts of any other person who would not
independently qualify as a large trader. Further, under no
circumstances shall a person or group acting in concert toward a common
investment objective be allowed to disaggregate where that
disaggregation would permit them to avoid large trader identification.

Modifications to the filing requirements provide that a large trader
must file its original Form 13H within 10 days after it initially
reaches the identifying activity level; and within 60 days after the
end of each year thereafter. The re-proposal has rejected the original
requirement that large traders submit a new Form 13H each time the
"information contained therein becomes inaccurate for any reason," in
favour of the single annual update. In addition, the new form provides
for "inactive status" filing, by which a trader is exempt from annual
filing requirements until and unless it subsequently reaches the
identifying activity level. At that point, the trader again has 10 days
to "reactivate" by filing Form 13H.

Form 13H and its schedules and instructions have been modified to
reflect the changes in the Rule and have been generally simplified. The
re-proposed Form 13H allows for incorporation by reference of
information already on file with the SEC. The requirement for detailed
information regarding persons who own or control large trader
organizations has been largely eliminated. The schedules for listing
new accounts have also been revised, corresponding to the large
trader's status as owner, controller or custodian/ nominee of the
accounts.

With regard to the duties of broker-dealers, the rule requires that
they report electronically transactions that reach a certain level for
persons who they know or have reason to know are large traders. The
level of trading activity that must be reported is increased in the re-
proposed rule from 1,000 shares or a fair market value of $40,000 to
2,000 shares or a fair market value of $100,000. This change also
incorporates the change from a 24-hour period to a "calendar day." The
SEC recommends that brokers inform persons they have reason to know are
large traders of their obligations to identify themselves to the SEC.
Although the principal responsibility for compliance in placed on large
traders, brokers have a duty to identify large traders. The re-proposal
provides "a safe harbour" for brokers in this regard, provided they
adopt and follow reasonable procedures to identify large traders.

Finally, the SEC maintains that the burdens imposed by the proposed
rule on foreign entities are "necessary and appropriate" and "not
unduly burdensome," given their uniform application to foreign and
domestic entities. The re-proposal points out that, through the
redefinitions of identifying activity level as well as the concepts of
"ownership" and "control," the effect of the rule on foreign entities
is greatly reduced.

PROGRESS IN INTERSTATE BANKING LEGISLATION

Both the Senate and House Banking Committees have now passed their
versions of interstate banking legislation, and prospects are good that
both Bills will pass the respective Houses of Congress before the July
4 holidays. That will provide time before the end of the Congressional
year for a conference between the Houses to resolve differences between
the two Bills, and passage of a landmark interstate banking Bill this
Congress.

House
The House Banking Committee passed HR 3841, the "Interstate Banking
Efficiency Act of 1994", by a vote of 50-1, and it should be reported
to the full House of Representatives within the next 30-60 days. Senior
members of the Committee are considering placing it on the portion of
the agenda of the House known as the suspension calendar, usually
reserved for non-controversial Bills. While that may not succeed, since
two-thirds of those voting are required to pass such a Bill, the mere
fact that it is being considered shows that the Bill has solid strength
and will very likely pass the full House.

The Bill is similar to the Bill passed by the Financial Institutions
Subcommittee, changed only by modest amendments related to branch
closing requirements, statistical data collection, and inter-affiliate
agency activities. Efforts to impose crippling amendments sought by con-
sumer activists were soundly defeated.

The House Bill would permit acquisitions of banks across state lines
one year after passage of the Bill with no authority for states to
prohibit such acquisitions. Consolidation of interstate banks within a
holding company into a single branch network could take place 18 months
after passage. States would be able to prohibit branching by passing
legislation any time within three years after passage of the Bill, and
if a bank holding company had consolidated its subsidiary banks within
such states into an interstate branch network before the passage of
three years, it would be required to convert them back into banks as
they existed prior to the consolidation.

De novo interstate branching, as opposed to acquisitions and
consolidations, could take place only if a state expressly permits it
by statute. States would also be able, during a three-year period
following passage of the Bill, to prohibit interstate branching through
acquisitions.

Branches of national banks would be subject to the laws of the host
state with respect to con-sumer protection, fair lending, and community
re-investment as though they were branches of a state bank chartered in
that state. Branches of state banks would be subject to the laws of the
host state as though they were branches of a state bank chartered in
that state.

Foreign banks would be free to branch interstate with wholesale
branches and would not have to establish a subsidiary bank to do so,
but no change is made in the current law which requires establishment
of a subsidiary bank for conducting retail banking activity, whether
such activity be conducted through a branch or a bank. In other words,
if a foreign bank wished to engage in interstate retail banking
activity, it would have to do so through a US subsidiary bank.

Senate
The Senate Banking Committee passed its interstate banking Bill,
currently unnumbered and known as the "Interstate Banking and Branching
Act of 1994", by unanimous vote, and it is expected to pass the full
Senate before the Easter recess. It differs from the House Banking
Committee Bill in some key respects.

Interstate acquisition authority mirrors the House Bill, and no
significant differences need be debated in conference on that part of
the Bill. In the Senate Banking Committee Bill, interstate
consolidation, however, may not occur until two years after passage, as
opposed to 18 months in the House Banking Committee Bill.

Under the Senate Banking Committee Bill branches of national banks
would be treated in a host state as though they were branches of a
national bank chartered in that state. Branches of state banks would be
treated as though they were branches of state banks chartered in that
state.

Foreign branches do not fare as well under the Senate Banking Committee
Bill as under the House Banking Committee Bill. While a foreign bank
which had established a subsidiary bank to engage in retail banking
would be permitted to branch (as would any other US bank) it appears
that it would not be permitted to establish interstate wholesale
branches without first establishing a subsidiary bank, unless the state
law expressly permitted such activity. It appears, however, that it
would continue to be able to have representative offices, agencies, and
loan production offices in all states not specifically prohibited by
state laws, as long as those entities only conducted wholesale banking
activities.

Under both the Senate and House Banking Committee Bills there are
limits on the aggregate amount of deposits which can be retained in a
firm which expands by acquisition, although those limits differ
slightly.

Prognosis
Interstate banking seems to be alive and doing well in this Congress.
While passage of onerous provisions urged by consumer activists may
still derail final passage in the House, the prospects now are good
that an interstate Bill will pass this year.

The conference between the two Houses on the Bill will be difficult.
Significant differences exist on a wide range of subjects such as
determination of applicable law governing interstate branches, timing
and effect of state actions vis-e-vis branching, effect on foreign
branch activity, concentration limits, and the effective date for the
conduct of activities permitted by the Bills.

Similarly, the shadow of serious disruption of Congressional activity
which might be occasioned by hearings into the "Whitewater" affair are
beginning to build, and what Bills that might retard or scuttle are
unpredictable.

Still, for the first time since the McFadden Act was passed in 1927,
Congress appears to be prepared to liberalise laws governing interstate
banking and branching activity.

FEDERAL RESERVE PROPOSES REVISIONS TO RISK-BASED CAPITAL STANDARDS

The Federal Reserve Board ("the Board") has proposed revisions to
existing risk-based capital standards as part of the implementation of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).

In line with the Basle Accord, US banks currently calculate their
regulatory capital requirement on the basis of credit risks associated
with broad categories of assets and off-balance-sheet instruments.
Institutions are required to maintain a level of capital equal to at
least eight per cent of their risk weighted assets.

The proposed modifications would seek to adjust capital standards so as
to take into account the following factors:

1 The degree concentration of credit risk in a bank's loan portfolio.

2 An institution's ability to manage credit risk.

3 An institution's ability to manage the risks posed by involvement in
non-traditional activities.

Although the Board recognises that there is no generally accepted
approach to identifying and quantifying the risks associated with
concentration, it proposes that institutions with significant levels of
credit-risk concentration should hold additional capital. They note
that the information to achieve this is already available. Banks can
identify and track loans by industry, geographical location, country,
and loan type. This information would form the basis for the new
standard.

While the Board recognises that there are potential gains in risk
reduction through portfolio diversification, it is aware that there are
also potential pitfalls. For example, it is concerned that a bank
should not seek to achieve diversification by "lending in unfamiliar
market areas to out-of-territory borrowers or by rapid expansion of new
loan products for which the situation does not have adequate
expertise." They are anxious that any new regulations will not create
false incentives for management that will unintentionally decrease the
soundness of the banking industry.

The proposal does not identify specific categories of non-traditional
activities that it proposed to monitor. The Federal Reserve recognises
that new developments in technology and financial instruments have led
banks to become involved in activities that have not been associated
with their traditional business. They are aware of claims that any new
regulations could limit the ability of institutions to compete with non-
bank competitors. However, they are concerned that the risks associated
with any new activities should be promptly analysed and that capital
should be increased appropriately. The ability of an institution to
manage such risks will be taken into account.

The Federal Reserve notes that "the final supervisory judgement on a
bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that
might be drawn solely from the level of its risk-based capital ratio".
In addition to those factors which influence portfolio diversification
and a bank's management skills, they will also be looking at factors
such as interest-rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks;
and the quality and level of earnings.

SEC PROPOSES RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR AUTOMATED TRADING SYSTEMS

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently proposed Rule 17a-
23 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act")
requiring brokers and dealers that operate automatic trading systems
(broker-dealer trading systems or BDTSs) to maintain participant,
volume and transaction records to be reported periodically to the SEC.

Under the 1934 Act, sponsors of BDTSs must register as broker-dealers
and are subject to its normal record keeping and reporting
requirements; they are not, however, required to identify separately
those transactions effected through the BDTSs, nor to summarise the
volume or type of activity occurring through the automated systems.
Additionally, numerous automated trading systems operate pursuant to no-
action letters obtained from the SEC at the commencement of their
operation.

In 1989, the SEC proposed a rule that would have required sponsors of
BDTSs to comply with a number of procedural and substantive
specifications. The SEC now believes, in light of the favourable
findings of its Market 2000 Study (See FT-FRR February, 1994 for a
description of that study), that enhanced record keeping and reporting
will be sufficient for purposes of detecting potentially or actual
fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative practices and protecting the
public interest in the automated trading arena.

The rule is intended to assist the SEC in evaluating the role of
computerisation and automation in the securities industry, with an eye
toward the goals of the national market system, to monitor the effect
of BDTSs on competition, and to reassess whether broker-dealer
regulation remains the appropriate method for monitoring these systems.

The proposed rule would apply only to those systems through which
actual execution or at least matching of orders occurs automatically,
excluding those systems which merely automate the collection of orders
or the routing of orders but do not provide for automated matching of
buy and sell orders within the system. BDTS sponsors will be required
to maintain records of daily summaries of trading; time-sequenced
records of all trades; information regarding system participants as
well as applicants who have been denied participation; and all notices
sent by the sponsor to the participants. The sponsors will be required
to file with the SEC an initial description of their system and its
operation; quarterly summaries of activity; and notification of
material changes or cessation of operations. The proposed rule
specifies no particular format for these submissions, in recognition of
the variance in internal procedures already established by BDTSs.

The SEC stated in its proposal that the anticipated costs to sponsors
in order to comply with these requirements "do not appear to be
significant," as many sponsors already maintain their own records and
the automated nature of the systems facilitates accurate and timely
data collection.

STOCK EXCHANGE FINALISES DISSEMINATION OF PRICE-SENSITIVE INFORMATION

More than 70 organizations responded to the Stock Exchange's
Consultative Document on the dissemination of price-sensitive
information (see FT-FRR November 1993 pp 7-8).

The following points raised have resulted in changes:

False market. Several respondents indicated that they were unclear
about the scope of the obligation in the Listing Rules to avoid the
creation of a false market in their shares. Are they obliged to correct
any errors in market perception which lead them to feel that their
shares are wrongly valued? Many companies consider that their
responsibility to correct errors in market perception should only arise
when the cause of the error originates - or appears to originate - from
the company or its agents.

Companies should not have to be "incessantly concerned" with comments
on their performance, their sector or their competitors. The Exchange
will be examining, in consultation with the Treasury and market
participants, possible changes to its Official Listing Rules to clarify
that a company which is keeping the market properly informed only has a
regulatory obligation to correct misconceptions in the market when the
source of the error is itself or its agents. Factual correction of
inaccurate information from a third party should be a matter of
sensible judgement and good practice by the company.

There will have to be further consultation by the Exchange on the basis
of the text of the revised rule. The present text of the guidance
reflects existing Listing Rules.

Confidential. Concern had been expressed that the draft guidance does
not fully reflect the situation where a company should not make an
announcement. There may be occasions when a company's duties to its
shareholders, employees and creditors conflict with any duty of prompt
disclosure to the market as a whole. In response to this, the Working
Party has included a new paragraph on the handling of confidential
information. The Working Party did not intend this guidance to imply
that companies could not keep commercially sensitive information
confidential until the appropriate moment for its announcement.

Responsibility for issuing information. The revised guidance makes it
clear that in the Working Party's opinion, policies concerning the
handling of price-sensitive information must be set by the Board of a
company, though the implementation of the policy may be delegated.

Annual General Meeting. Some commented that public occasions such as
Annual General Meetings were unsuitable for intelligent discussion
between directors and shareholders because they were so sparsely
attended.

The Working Party would "deplore" a situation where the public
proceedings at the AGMs remain anodyne, whilst influential audiences
are briefed privately on sensitive matters. Companies must remember
their obligation to announce formally - either before or at the time of
the meeting - any price-sensitive information which is to be given at
the meeting.

Significance. Some consultees have suggested that the guidance, if
taken to extremes, would require a company to monitor constantly all
comments about itself, its competitors and its marketplace to see if
they created the need for some statement of clarification. The guidance
has been amplified to stress that an assessment must always be made of
the significance of information. The guidance is not intended to lead
to a stream of inconsequential announcements.

Status of guidance. The Working Party was strongly urged to clarify the
status of the guidance in proceedings either in a court or as a result
of action by the Exchange as Competent Authority. The guidance cannot
constrain any regulatory body and compliance with it will not
necessarily constitute a defence in the event of regulatory action
being taken. However, the Board of the Stock Exchange has agreed that
the Exchange will take into account judgements made by companies in
accordance with the guidance.

List of what constitutes price-sensitive information. No respondent
believed that price-sensitive information should be defined by
reference to a given percentage movement in share price, but a few
suggested that a list of likely price-sensitive events might be
helpful. The Working Party has gone some way to meeting this request
but has emphasised that any list is inevitably deficient in those grey
areas where companies may be most anxious for guidance.

Making people insiders. Some respondents suggested that the very act of
asking a shareholder if he consents to become an insider will convey
price-sensitive information to him, in that he may well have a shrewd
idea of what he is likely to be told. If shareholders wish to avoid
being placed in this position and are reluctant to lose their ability
to trade, even for a short period, they should make this policy known.

Quarterly statements. In general, respondents did not wish this part of
the guidance to become prescriptive and endorsed the tone of the
consultative paper. Some thought that it was inappropriate for the
market to be given figures which had not been externally verified. The
Working Party disagrees that the market will be misled by such
information provided that its status is made completely clear at the
time of the announcement.

Analysts. The guidance now contains some observations on how analysts
should behave in the conduct of their relationships with companies.
Many analysts are employed by firms which are members of the Exchange
and, even if the Exchange has no statutory responsibility for their
conduct, it feels it should encourage best practice, especially as
companies are expected to handle their side of these contacts with
great care.

Small companies. The guidance is applicable to every size of company.
It is acknowledged that companies whose progress is followed by only a
few analysts will have particular problems if those analysts are wildly
wrong in their forecasts and may well need to consider whether they
need to make a correcting announcement.

SIB PUBLISHES CONSULTATIVE PAPER ON COMPENSATION FUNDING

The Securities and Investment Board has announced proposals to end
cross-contributions for SFA and IMRO members with regard to the
Investors Compensation Scheme.

The proposals have been drawn up in the light of comments which the SIB
has received in response to its Discussion Paper, "Financing Investors
Compensation", published in October 1993.

The proposals are as follows:

* to end cross-contributions, as of April 1 1994 for SFA and IMRO
members, and on recognition of PIA for members of FIMBRA, LAUTRO and
SIBRO;

* to set up separate contribution arrangements for SFA, IMRO and, if
recognised, PIA, with a cap of #100 million for each SRO;

* to treat SIBRO firms as belonging to the relevant SRO for
compensation purposes;

* to continue with a unitary scheme, administered, as now, by ICS, with
separate SRO funds;

* to change the basis for allocating management costs to an activity-
related basis, as far as possible;

* to give SROs increased control over, and responsibility for, looking
after their own arrangements for financing their own compensation
liabilities.

Cross-contribution
There was unanimous support for the proposed ending of cross-
contribution and the SIB proposes to set up separate contribution
arrangements for individual SROs, with no cross contribution between
them. However, there was concern about the proposal that there should
be caps of #100 million for each of SFA, IMRO and PIA.

The fact that an SRO has a cap of #100 million does not necessarily
mean that it has to levy the full #100 million on its membership in any
one year. It would be open to an SRO to avoid having to do this by
borrowing on its own credit.

Treatment of "SIBRO" firms
The ending of cross-contribution raises the question of how SIBRO firms
should be treated. The SIB last year indicated its preference that
direct regulation should be available only as a last resort. The
Discussion Paper proposed that, instead of remaining a separate
constituency with its own cap, SIBRO firms should be treated, for
compensation purposes, as belonging to the relevant SRO.

This was the only other proposal in the Discussion Paper which aroused
significant comment. Concern related to: the inappropriateness of
breaking the link between compensation and regulation; the requirement
in s54(3) that so far as practicable an SRO's contribution to ICS
should reflect claims experience in its own constituency; and the
practicalities of identifying the appropriate SRO.

However, the SIB did not find these arguments persuasive and remains
convinced that the original proposal is the most appropriate way
forward. Rather than breaking the link between compensation and
regulation, the SIB sees the proposed approach as emphasising the value
of community of interest as between investment firms in the three
eventual groups (SFA, IIRO and PIA) in effective regulation. Apart from
SIBRO members who are applicants for membership of a SRO, who will be
treated as belonging to that SRO's group, the presumption is that the
relevant SRO will be PIA (if recognised) unless a firm is predominantly
engaged in dealing (in which case, it will be SFA) or managing (in
which case, it will be IMRO).

Separate SRO funds
or separate schemes?
There was very little support for the idea of entirely separate SRO
schemes, each with their own administration. Accordingly, the SIB
proposes to proceed on the basis of a unitary scheme, administered by
ICS, but with separate SRO funds.

Management costs
The SIB proposes that the first #300,000 of management costs should be
treated as fixed costs and that these should be divided equally between
SROs. The SIB proposes that the variable costs element should be
allocated on an experience-related basis according to a 3-year rolling
index which takes account of the number of defaults occurring in each
constituency and the number of claims related to each constituency
handled by the Scheme in that three-year period.

Methods of financing
SRO members' liabilities
Under the present arrangements, SROs are given the status of
administrators of the Scheme for the purpose of the levy procedure
only. In other respects, they act as agents of ICS and it is the SRO
members, rather than the SRO, which owe the liability to the Scheme.

The SIB proposes to change the rules so that the SROs will be
constituted as the administrators of the Scheme for the purposes of
raising the amount required - whether by levy or otherwise - from their
members. The initial liability to pay ICS will thus fall on the
individual SRO, but ICS will retain a right over the SRO's members in
the event of a failure by the SRO to pay or collect and pay over the
sums due to ICS.

The SIB also proposes to enable an SRO to defer - at least, in part -
its members' obligation to pay for compensation liabilities by means of
borrowing.

Representations in respect of the proposals should reach the SIB by
March 25 1994.

THE TRADED SECURITIES (DISCLOSURE) REGULATIONS 1994

On March 1 1994, The Traded Securities (Disclosure) Regulations 1994
came into force, to give effect to Article 7 of the European
Community's Council Directive (89/592/EEC) of November 13 1989 which
sought to co-ordinate regulations on insider dealing.

Article 7 requires that:

"all companies and undertakings, the transferable securities of which
are, whatever their nature, admitted to trading on a market which is
regulated and supervised by bodies recognised by public bodies,
operates regularly and is accessible directly or indirectly to the
public, should be under an obligation to inform the public as soon as
possible of any major new developments in the issuer's sphere of
activity which are not public knowledge and which may, by virtue of
their effect on the issuer's assets and liabilities or financial
position or on the general course of its business, lead to substantial
movements in the price of the securities admitted to trading".


The regulations stipulate that the above will apply to securities
traded on any regulated market in the United Kingdom, except where the
recognised investment exchange, which regulates and supervises the
regulated market on which an issuer's securities are admitted to
trading, exempts the issuer from this obligation.  It may do so if
satisfied that the disclosure of the particular information would
prejudice the legitimate interests of that issuer.

The regulations go on to state that in the event of failure on the part
of an issuer to comply with such disclosure of information, the rules
of the recognised investment exchange (on which those securities are
traded) must:

* discontinue the admission of the securities to trading; and/or

* suspend trading in the securities; and/or

* publish the fact that the issuer has failed to comply with the
obligation; and/or

* itself make public any information which the issuer has failed to
publish.


The Regulations thus impose important reporting requirements on issuers
of securities traded on regulated markets, although those listed on the
Stock Exchange are already subject to similar rules set out in Chapter
9 of the Yellow Book entitled - Continuing Obligations.

THE VALIDITY OF CLOSE-OUT NETTING UNDER JAPANESE LAW

On December 27 1993, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance (MoF)
notified banks that there was no need to refrain from entering into
close-out netting agreements. It was said that the MoF had consulted
with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) and the MoJ had come to the
conclusion that close-out netting provisions would be held valid in the
existing framework under the Bankruptcy Act, the Corporate
Rehabilitation Act and the Civil Code. Strictly speaking, however, even
though Japanese banks are now allowed to enter into close-out netting
agreements with foreign counterparts, the question of validity will
ultimately have to be decided by the Japanese courts, this point being
acknowledged by both ministries.

There has been some substantial discussion among Japanese lawyers on
this issue. The main question appears to be whether a contractual
agreement entered into with a view to setting off, under certain
circumstances such as insolvency of one party, debts which are not due
and payable and are denominated in different currencies will be held
valid under the Japanese insolvency law. Two main points at issue are:

* whether a set-off will work on a cross-currency basis (the "currency
point"); and

* whether an agreement to set-off debts which are not due and payable
will stand under the Japanese insolvency law (the "timing point").

As to the currency point, Article 403 of the Civil Code provides:

"Any debt denominated in a foreign currency may be paid by the debtor
in Japanese currency, the amount of which shall be determined in
accordance with the exchange rate available in the place of payment."

There is also a rule established in a Supreme Court decision that, in
connection with a debt denominated in a foreign currency, the creditor
(not the debtor) may require the debtor to pay in Japanese currency.
The combined effect of these is that one of the parties to a swap
agreement will be able to convert all the outstanding foreign currency
debts into those in Japanese currency, thus enabling such party to
effect set-off as if they were in the same currency. Since this happens
by operation of law, it is argued that there is no reason why an
agreement to set-off on a cross-currency basis should be held invalid
under Japanese law.

As regards the timing point, there is a well established Supreme Court
authority which states that an agreement made between a bank and a
customer to set-off debts which are not due and payable will defeat the
claim of the customer's creditor who obtains a garnishee order over a
deposit which the customer has made with the bank. It is generally
understood that the above rule will apply where a liquidator is
appointed for the customer.

On the basis of these observations, there does not appear to be any
difficulty in affirming the validity of a close-out netting agreement
under the Japanese insolvency law. Such an argument has been advanced
by a leading academic lawyer in Japan and it appears that there has
been an implicit consensus of opinion on these lines among Japanese
lawyers.

Insofar as there are remaining objections, they are likely to relate to
the argument that, while a right to convert currencies is available
under ordinary circumstances, it would be quite another matter for it
to be available in an insolvency situation. The reason behind this is
that to allow creditors who have multi-currency mutual debts to
exercise such a right in an insolvency situation, would give them
further priority over those creditors who do not have such a right,
such as depositors (although the contrary argument can be that since
the right of set-off is firmly established and those creditors having a
right of set-off are given priority over other creditors, it will be
regarded as a relatively minor step to expand the scope to multi-
currency mutual debts). Another problem with the above argument is
that, since the argument is based on Article 403 of the Civil Code,
there is some uncertainty as to a close-out netting agreement embodied
in a contract governed by a legal system other than Japanese law.

It should be noted that the Supreme Court decision referred to with
respect to the timing point took a substantial approach, in which it is
considered that the majority opinion upheld the validity of contractual
set-off against the claim of the garnisher on the basis that such a
function of set-off would enhance convenience in trading and be of
benefit to society as a whole. Although the said Supreme Court decision
dealt only with the timing point, the basic idea may well apply to the
currency point. Such a consideration would probably strengthen the
conclusion reached by Japanese lawyers and would be useful to overcome
the difficulties pointed out above.

It is worth noting that in the Supreme Court decision referred to
above, one of the respected judges added, that if such a right of
contractual set-off was widely acknowledged in a business community,
its validity should be upheld in that business community. It is
interesting that the judge intimated that there could be a special
legal system which would govern a business community. Such an idea has
not been discussed in detail among Japanese lawyers, but would be
useful in this context.

If there is any concern about upholding the validity of close-out
netting, it would be that creditors will be able to erode the principle
of pari passu distribution easily by an agreement with the debtor.
According to the above intimation, however, the validity of close-out
netting will be limited to financial institutions active in the market
(if "business community" may be translated as "market"). It is true
that to protect those financial institutions in such manner would have
a negative impact on other creditors (such as depositors) when a
financial institution goes into liquidation. However, other creditors
(in particular, depositors) would be protected more properly by the
capital adequacy requirements, the deposit insurance scheme and other
regulatory measures.

Although it may still be arguable as to how the validity of close-out
netting should be substantiated, it must be emphasised that almost all
lawyers (including the officials of the MoF and the MoJ) who have
focused on this issue recently have come to the conclusion that a close-
out netting agreement should stand up under Japanese insolvency law. In
order to minimise or even remove the risk, however, it is advisable
that some steps should be taken, which now appear to be possible as
Japanese lawyers have almost reached a consensus. It may be considered
that some relevant institution should formalise the Japanese position,
but it is questionable whether there is any institution which would
perform such a function. More importantly, the Japanese courts, as a
matter of policy, resist being influenced by outside opinions. In such
a judicial climate as exists in Japan, it will probably be more
appropriate to introduce recognition of close-out netting by
legislation.

ASAHI BANK WILL BE FIRST CITY BANK TO OPEN SECURITIES SUBSIDIARY

The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has selected Asahi Bank as the first city
bank to establish a securities subsidiary. Asahi will be permitted to
open its subsidiary for business from July this year. Under the
Financial System Reform Act, enacted last April, the MoF removed the
original firewalls between commercial banking, trust banking and
securities industries.

Last July, Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ), Long-term Credit Bank of
Japan and Norinchurkin Bank set up securities subsidiaries. However,
the MoF delayed the establishment of subsidiaries by city banks because
of strong opposition from the securities industry. The city banks are
feared for their large financial resources, great influence over many
industries and highly trained staff. Because of these fears the MoF has
restricted the activities of bank subsidiaries to dealing and
underwriting bonds.

From the existing 11 city banks:

In July:

Asahi bank has the green light to commence securities operations
through a subsidiary.

In November:

Six other city banks will commence securities business. Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, Mitsubishi Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank, Sakura Bank and Sanwa
Bank.

In March 1995:

In the near future the MoF is expected to approve this date as the
entry point for Tokai Bank and Takushoku Bank to the securities
business.

Of the two remaining city banks, Daiwa Bank took over its securities
subsidiary "Cosmo Securities" last August in a rescue bid. Finally, the
Bank of Tokyo has no immediate plans to enter the securities business.

The MoF announced that it deliberately spread out the entry times so
that the securities industry would not be too disrupted by the
entrants. According to the MoF, by the end of January 1994, the
subsidiaries had underwritten approximately Y50 billion worth of
domestic corporate straight bonds, approximately Y3 billion worth of
domestic convertible bonds and some Y50 billion of overseas bonds.

Last month Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank came to the rescue of Kankaku
Securities by extending subordinated loans of Y70 billion. The two
firms already have close ties but Kankaku stated that it has no
intention of becoming a subsidiary of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank as a result
of the rescue. In the case of Daiwa Bank's bailout of Cosmo Securities
last August, Cosmo issued new shares that were bought by Daiwa, making
the securities firm its subsidiary.

TSE SENDS MISSIONS TO ASIAN EXCHANGES

The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) has sent two teams of delegates on a
fact finding mission, one to China and Hong Kong and the other to the
ASEAN countries (Singapore. Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippeans and
Indonesia).

The teams were to visit the region's bourses, accounting firms, legal
firms, institutional investors and local units of Japan's big four
brokerages. Among the issues investigated were the types of settlement
systems, the types of protection given to shareholders and disclosure
regulations. The TSE's aim is to collect information so as to decide
whether Asian shares are safe for Japanese investors. This is seen as
the first step along the road to listing other Asian shares.

CCPC'S FIRST YEAR

The Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company (CCPC) was set up in March
1993 as a joint venture between 162 financial institutions. So far 65
city banks, long-term credit banks, trust banks, life and non-life
insurers have used the CCPC to liquidate troubled debts. The number of
financial institutions using the CCPC is likely to rise in March 1994,
when many companies end their financial year. Estimates of the value of
bad debts that will be sold to the CCPC in March are put in excess of
Y1 trillion.

The banks sell bad debts to the CCPC at a discount, then charge the
loss against their profits, so cutting their tax bills. The CCPC is
then supposed to liquidate the loans by selling the underlying
collateral to private investors. So far it has only been able to sell
Y17 billion of collateral, due to weak demand for real estate. In
contrast the CCPC has bought Y1.33 trillion worth of bad debts with a
face value of Y2.86 trillion.

In the 1993/94 financial year the Ministry of Finance (MoF) restrained
the sales of bad loans to the CCPC, to avoid large tax losses. This
policy has now changed and the MoF wants to accelerate the banks' write-
offs dramatically. The goal of the MoF is to strengthen banks' balance
sheets in the face of unprecedented enormous bad debts.

LISTING RULES TO EFFECT RESTRICTIONS ON MULTIPLE APPLICATIONS

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has announced that changes to the Listing
Rules have been approved, which prohibit multiple applications for
public offerings of securities and which should limit the occurrence of
undetected multiple applications. The new rules came into effect on
March 16 1994.

The new rules require issuers, their sponsors and underwriters to take
responsible steps to ensure multiple or suspected multiple applications
are identified and rejected. In addition, any application form for a
public offering of securities will have to be worded in such a way that
the applicant is required to declare that only one application is being
made by him or for his benefit. The new rules also specify that any
application for more than 100 per cent of the securities on offer will
be deemed to be a multiple application, which will therefore have to be
rejected.

INCREASE IN SFC FEES

The Securities and Futures Commission has announced that as from April
1 1994 some of its fees will be increased. The increases do not affect
the main charges payable by intermediaries such as licensing fees. The
large increases of up to 36 per cent are only expected to affect a
minority of registered persons requesting approval for departure from
the normal requirements of the Securities Ordinance and the Commodities
Trading Ordinance or for the authorisation of immigration-linked

HKMA ACCEPTS WIDER DEBT INSTRUMENT RANGE

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) has announced that it will now
accept a wider range of Hong Kong dollar debt instruments as security
for repurchase agreements ("repos") for its overnight funds. Repos are
the means by which financial institutions may access the HKMA's
liquidity adjustment facility for short term liquid funds and it is
hoped that the inclusion of more debt securities acceptable for repos
will be helpful to the financial institutions in managing their
liquidity. The HKMA will now accept debt securities issued by the Mass
Transmit Railway Corp, the Provisional Airport Authority, bank issued
debt instruments with ratings of not less than A minus given by
Standard & Poor's or equivalent and other debt instruments with ratings
of not less than A, in addition to the Exchange Fund bills and
government bonds currently acceptable.

PROPOSED CHANGES ANNOUNCED IN ANNUAL BUDGET

On March 2 1994 the Financial Secretary, The Hon. Sir Hamish Macleod,
delivered his 1994 budget speech to the Legislative Council, proposing
the government's revenue and expenditure plans for the 1994/5 fiscal
year. The following proposed changes were announced as part of that
budget:

* Changes are proposed to the Stamp Duty Ordinance to facilitate the
practice of short-selling and stock lending in Hong Kong. The proposals
involve deferring the point at which stamp duty will first become
payable on loaned stocks from two weeks to one year.

* It is proposed that the rate of profits tax on company profits be
reduced by one per cent to 16.5 per cent. There are to be no changes to
the rates of depreciation allowances.

* It was announced that the government plans to introduce anti-
avoidance legislation to combat the use of service companies as tax
saving vehicles.

CONSULTATIVE PAPER ISSUED BY THE HONG KONG STOCK EXCHANGE

The Hong Kong Stock Exchange has recently issued a 38-page consultative
paper entitled "The Way Forward" as part of its current project to
develop a strategic plan for the three years up to the hand over of
Hong Kong to China in 1997 and beyond. It has invited comments on the
paper by April 22 and expects the strategic plan to be publicised in
mid-1994.

The consultative paper summarises discussions that have been held with
market participants of issues facing the market and possible ways
forward. It also indicates the Exchange's response to each of the
proposals, which ranges from specific measures, through inviting
further suggestions, to stating that it does not intend to take the
proposals further. The list of market participants with whom the
Exchange held discussions includes as well as issuers, stock brokers
and fund managers, a wide range of interested bodies and individuals
such as The Hong Kong Association of Banks, The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, The Hong Kong Society of Accountants, academics and
information providers. The stated purpose of the paper is to get an
indication of the market's general views. If the market shows support
for a particular course of action, the Exchange may conduct a separate
more detailed consultation at a later stage.

The main emphasis of the consultative paper is on identifying ways in
which the Hong Kong's stock market can maintain its competitiveness in
an international context, as well as facilitating its role as a source
of international funds for the continued economic expansion in China.
The paper identifies certain key issues which are facing the Exchange:
* the maturity of the Hong Kong market in terms of domestic listings
and the need therefore to attract more listings of overseas companies
in order to maintain growth;

* the significance of overseas investors to the recent growth in the
Asian markets and the need to maintain and promote this interest;

* the importance of China's economic development to the future of the
Exchange and the role the Exchange can play in helping to fund that
development;

* the increasing demand for sophisticated derivative products for risk
management purposes or as trading vehicles;

* the need to be up-to-date in the secondary market in terms of market
automation, to facilitate higher trading volumes and meet the
increasingly complex demands of investors;

* the competition from other Asian exchanges, and the need to stay
ahead or at least equal with their development of derivative products
and automated dealing systems; and

* the need to promote the growth of the bond market in Hong Kong,
possibly as an alternative means of raising funds for Chinese companies
rather than equity issues.

Recurring themes in the consultative paper are the need to provide a
market that has the highest level of transparency and efficiency and
the need for a market which attracts investor attention. In this
respect, the Exchange believes that the emphasis must now be on an
"international" rather than local solution, as had been the case in the
past.

The consultative paper outlines options for the development of the
Exchange which should meet the stated aims of transparency, efficiency
and international competitiveness.

Some of the options involve building on existing developments. These
include the introduction last year of the Automatic Order Matching and
Execution System (AMS) and the first direct listings of China
incorporated enterprises in Hong Kong, as well as the ongoing
development of a traded options market, expected to be launched in
early 1995, and improvements to the debt listing regime.

Other options involve establishing a new direction for the Exchange as
part of the search for international solutions. New developments which
the Exchange is considering further include:

* re-orientating the Listing Rules of the primary market towards the
international arena by basing them on a listing philosophy similar to
the US, which would rely on extensive disclosure and self-regulation by
issuers and financial advisors, backed by strong sanctions against non-
compliance;

* relaxing the rules that require overseas entities to provide
shareholders with the same standard of legal protection as under Hong
Kong law. It is suggested that the US approach of requiring compliance
with the overseas entity's domestic corporate governance regime but
with the US accounting disclosure and accounting requirements would be
attractive to overseas entities;

* strengthening the corporate governance regime for listed companies,
for example by making audit committees and properly qualified finance
directors and company secretaries mandatory;

* improving the current disclosure requirements, such as requiring more
detail in the annual report, involving the auditors in interim
announcements and requiring annual asset valuations in the accounts;

* establishing a formal regime for the regulation of sponsors and
financial advisors, which may be backed by legislation;

* including members' internal control systems in the Exchange's
inspection programmes and considering whether further measures are
necessary to improve members' internal control systems;

* improving the automation of the market and considering the
possibility of off-floor trading;

* improving the provision of real-time trading information to the
market and developing a "quality of market" function to monitor and
facilitate improvement in market transparency on a more formal basis;

* introducing appropriate training programmes and allowing the
interface of AMS terminals with members' in house systems to facilitate
the development of sophisticated trading strategies in the secondary
market;

* extending the trading hours of the market which may allow a short
over-lap with the start of trading in London;

* reforming the current disclosure regime arising from the Securities
(Disclosure of Interests) Ordinance, which is thought to be onerous in
some respects and inadequate in others;

* increasing the current requirements for the minimum public float of
securities in a listed issuer and improving monitoring procedures;

* abolishing the board lot system and the rules for spreads, in
conjunction with the full immobilization or de-materialization of share
certificates;

* dissolving the Fidelity Fund or merging it with the clearing house's
guarantee funds and increasing the size of the maximum payment of
compensation by the Compensation Fund in the case of member defaults;

* considering the appropriateness of penalties for misconduct and the
feasibility of establishing arbitration facilities for disputes between
members and between members and their clients;

* enabling listed issuers to include their repurchased shares in their
balance sheets as treasury stock held for subsequent re-sale; and

* reviewing the relationship between the Exchange and the Securities
and Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange to ensure
greater co-ordination of responsibilities and resources and
consolidation of the different statutory instruments and non-statutory
codes covering the securities market.

In addition, the paper identifies areas where improvements or new
measures might be welcome and the Exchange specifically invites
suggestions for future developments in these areas. They include:

* developing listed Hong Kong depository receipts on regional blue chip
companies; and

* measures, beyond those for streamlining the listing process currently
being considered by the Exchange, to develop the bond market further.

The paper identifies three proposals which the Exchange does not intend
to take any further. These are marketmaking for stocks, introducing a
second-tier board for smaller companies which do not meet the full
Listing Rules requirements and introducing a trading-only board, with
no compliance requirements for the issuers concerned.

Although in the Foreword to the consultative paper the Exchange
stresses that these are tentative proposals which are open to comment
at this stage, in the body of the paper the Exchange identifies the
direction of the strategy for the years to 1997 and beyond. This
direction is focused on attracting overseas issuers and investors,
possibly by moving towards a US style disclosure-based regulatory
regime, and increasing the role of automation and sophisticated
products in the secondary markets. Press response in Hong Kong to the
proposals has been favourable, although doubts have been raised as to
the feasibility of introducing a US style disclosure regime in the next
three to five years, and the appropriateness of such a regime, which
would include reduced vetting by the Exchange, for new issues in Hong
Kong.

PROBLEMS REMAIN FOR "BANCASSURANCE"

A joint approach to the supervision of "bancassurance" in the European
Union is still a far way off. While there is agreement on some basic
principles such as the need for transparency of group structures, the
exchange of information, the role of auditors and the monitoring of
intra-group exposures, the main point of contention remains the
question of group surveillance of capital.

Consolidation would be the "natural" tendency of bank supervisors;
however, it has not been conclusively shown that this method is
adaptable for the control of insurance groups. Insurance supervisors
propose the "solo-plus" approach, whereby pure solo supervision of each
of the components of a group is extended to include elements of group-
wide risk assessment. The issue was the subject of a "jumbo" meeting of
EU finance supervisors in Brussels on February 23, and discussed during
a seminar held at the Central for European Policy Studies (CEPS) on
March 15.

Financial conglomerates are defined as "group of companies with
specific control relationships or under joint management, and whose
activities consist largely or exclusively of providing services in at
least two of the following financial sectors: banking, securities,
insurance." This refers in practice to many different structures: they
can be horizontal or vertical, headed by a supervised or unsupervised
entity, which may be a financial or a mixed-activity holding. According
to recent data, there are more than 200 financial conglomerates in the
EU. Some Member States already allow consolidated accounts of
conglomerates, although it is far from clear whether this would be
permitted under EC legislation.

While the European Commission does not want to stop the development of
financial conglomerates, which they see as a source of strength for the
Union's financial services sector, Member States' supervisory
authorities disagree on the way to control the capital adequacy of such
conglomerates at the group level. Different regulatory rules and tests
are applied at national and Community level, and wide variations exist
in the accounting treatment. There is however agreement on two basic
propositions, as Patrick Pearson of the Commission's DG XV said at the
CEPS seminar: all solo supervisors should monitor the full risks of the
conglomerate; and sufficient capital should be appropriately
distributed and available in the group to cover risks.

Some "easier" issues regarding financial conglomerates have already
been dealt with in the draft BCCI follow-up Directive. This proposal
sets a 20 per cent participation as the threshold for the inclusion of
a company in a group. It requires group structures to be transparent
and says that the head office should be in the same Member States as
the registered office. It furthermore requires auditors to provide
relevant information to the supervisory authorities. However, the
definition of groups was criticized at the CEPS seminar by an industry
representative as an example of excessive regulation, and it was
questioned whether reporting obligations could be strengthened by law.
But there was agreement that further efforts should be undertaken to
lower the obstacles to the exchange of information among supervisory
authorities, and that a lead supervisor should be designated for the
control of conglomerates. Reference was in this respect made to the
"protocol" model applied by the Dutch authorities.

On the matter of how best to tackle the most striking problem in the
control of financial conglomerates, the prevention of double gearing,
the opinions of regulators diverge. Double gearing is the double use of
regulatory capital in the different entities of the group. Banking and
investment firms supervisors would adopt consolidated supervision to
tackle this problem, but it is not obvious that this is the method to
apply to control bancassurance groups, since it is not proven that the
capital requirement for both parts is identical. The way therefore to
deal with double gearing in the immediate future is the automatic
deduction of participations, or the deduction of a minimum solvency
margin. However, automatic deduction is not required under the EU
banking and insurance Directives.

Other prudential concerns should also be dealt with in the near future.
Capital requirements can be circumvented through the use of unregulated
entities, such as leasing and factoring firms. In the other direction,
the holding company controlling the group can be used to distort the
capital standards. The latter problem was partly addressed in the
amendments to the consolidated supervision Directive (92/30). However,
it thereby only applies to financial holding companies, controlling
credit institutions, and it does not include mixed-activity holding
companies nor insurance companies in the consolidation. One proposal is
to introduce "fit and proper" criteria for the shareholders of a
holding company, but it remains to be seen whether this is feasible. A
further problem is "incestuous capitalisation", whereby own funds
elements are purchased by other intra- or extra-group entities, a
practice which cannot be prohibited by regulators. Limits should also
be set for intra-group loans and large exposures. The latter limits
exist in the banking and investment services sector, but not in
insurance. It might for example bring the banking arm of a conglomerate
to place its large exposures within the insurance undertaking.

As a medium-term solution, it was proposed that the solo-plus approach
should be adopted, whereby extra elements are added to the solo
control, namely the exchange of information, the monitoring of intra-
group transactions and transparency, and a minimum solvency for the
parents' company capital. Banking supervisors will however continue to
push for full consolidation. As Jean-Louis Duplat, President of the
Belgian Banking & Finance Commission and Vice-Chairman of the European
Commission's Banking Advisory Committee, said: "The solo-plus approach
offers a suitable solution for the time being, . . . the principle of
supervision on a consolidated basis, completed with aspects of solo
supervision, and, if necessary, sub-consolidated per pole (banking and
insurance pole), should be the final objective."

CENTRAL BANKS HOLD FIRE OVER HEDGE FUNDS

Despite widespread speculation in late February that market volatility
may have been increased by activities of US hedge funds (in selling
bonds and trading financial derivatives), the central banks governors
decided at their meeting in early March against any immediate moves
towards curbing hedge funds' activities.

Hedge funds are not under the direct control of central banks, since,
although mainly managed in the US, they are normally based offshore.
However, their activities have still caused concern to the regulators
for a number of reasons:

* their activities appear to have added to market volatility;

* heavy losses following unsuccessful speculation (eg on currency
movement) might lead to defaults on loans from banks where a hedge fund
is highly geared;

* failure to settle a contract could lead to a chain of defaults
occurring throughout the financial system.

Any attempt to increase control over hedge funds would, however,
encounter difficulties, whether the chosen approach was one of direct
regulation or an increase of existing indirect control (via supervised
banks). Direct regulation would be difficult, since it would need to
tackle cross-border issues, define "hedge funds" and also try to
isolate the particular activities causing concern (given that short-
term leverage risk is in itself a common investment strategy). The
alternative of an indirect approach by the central banks would instead
focus on loans made by supervised banks to hedge funds for the purchase
of assets. Both the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board are
currently studying the implications of the ensuing credit risk
exposure, in light of the banks' common practice of only holding assets
to the value of the cash lent, with a margin of around 5 per cent or
less to cover risks. The concern here is that such margins would not be
large enough to cover sudden changes in hedge funds' positions,
particularly given that the credit risk of hedge funds is hard to
analyse, since they are not credit rated, have complex structures and
holders may also not provide net asset valuations. Additionally, recent
netting and market risk proposals by international supervisors seem
likely to reduce the requirement for banks to set aside capital against
such hedge fund exposures.

For the present therefore, the central banks appear happy simply to
monitor the situation, whilst keeping a closer eye on hedge funds'
activities. Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank and chairman of
the G-10 governors, summarised this approach, saying:

"We are willing to examine closely what is going on with these new
techniques, but we do not think that there is for the time being any
need for specific regulations. We think we have got to live with these
new techniques, but will follow closely what is going on."

REVISED INTERNATIONAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The International Accounting Standards Committee ("IASC") has issued a
revised proposed International Accounting Standard on financial
instruments (Exposure Draft E48) for comment. This draft results from a
reconsideration of an earlier proposal (Exposure Draft E40) issued in
September 1991.

The draft covers the accounting for the disclosure, recognition,
measurement and presentation of all types of financial instruments and
sets out the proposed treatment for the financial assets and financial
liabilities so created, in the accounts of the respective enterprises.
A financial instrument in this context is a contract that gives rise to
both a financial asset of one enterprise and a financial liability or
equity instrument of another enterprise. Financial instruments include
both primary instruments such as cash, receivables and equity
securities, and secondary or derivative instruments, such as options,
futures and forward contracts relating to financial instruments and
interest-rate and currency swaps. Various interests, such as those in
associates and subsidiaries and commodity contracts, were excluded from
E40. The new draft also proposed to exclude from the scope of the
Standard insurance contracts and assets held specifically to provide
funds for satisfying obligations under insurance contracts.

Other significant changes from E40 include:

* the criteria for recognising and subsequently discontinuing
recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability now refers to
the transfer of substantially all of the risks and rewards associated
with the asset or liability;

* a legally enforceable right of set-off must exist before a financial
asset may be offset against a financial liability and the net amount
included in the balance sheet;

* impaired monetary financial assets and impaired non-monetary
financial assets are now treated separately under the Standard ;

* hedge accounting is now permitted for price risk exposure where
expected future positions are highly likely to materialize;

* financial instruments that hedge currency (foreign exchange) risk are
now within the scope of the hedge accounting requirements of the
Standard.

ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL MARKET REGULATIONS UNDER THE EEA TREATY

The coming into force of the European Economic Area (EEA) Treaty on
January 1 1994 led to substantial changes in the regulation of many
commercial areas in Norway, including the regulation of financial
markets.

The changes relate both to the implementation in Norway of the general
principles of EEA law, like for example non-discrimination of EEA
nationals, and the implementation of the various EC Directives relating
to financial markets. There follows an overview of some of the changes
relating to both banking and investment business.

Banking
The Norwegian regulations contained various provisions regarding
nationality and residence of persons acting as board members of a bank
and the founders of a bank. Originally these persons had to be
Norwegian nationals and resident in Norway. These requirements have
been changed to cover persons who are nationals of an EEA state and
resident in such a state. The restrictions on foreign ownership of
Norwegian banks remain applicable since Norway can, according to the
EEA Treaty, benefit from a transitional period for its investment
controls until January 1 1995 when it has to lift its restrictions in
respect of EEA nationals.

The various EC Banking Directives have been implemented in Norway,
including the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive as a result of
which EEA Member State banks may provide services to, and establish
branches in Norway. The services provided for, relate to the taking of
deposits as well as the services set out in the Annex to the Directive.
The relevant regulations open possibilities for the imposition of
various rules on these branches to the extent that they are necessary
for the public good, as provided for in the Directive.

The Norwegian regulations in respect of banking activities have also
been amended in other respects to comply with the various EC banking
directives including regulations in respect of consumer credits and
money laundering.

Investment
As far as intermediaries are concerned, the rules now provide an
exemption for branches of EEA credit institutions in Norway to conduct
their securities activities through a separate legal entity. Norwegian
banks are under an obligation to organise their securities market
business in a separate legal entity. The activities must also be
separated physically from the other activities of the bank. Branches of
EEA credit institutions do not have to comply with these rules. The
legislation further provides a basis for the adoption of additional
requirements on EEA credit institutions offering securities services
through a branch in Norway.

In addition, the obligation on Norwegian residents to make purchases of
foreign securities through a Norwegian broker has also been amended.
The rules now provide that Norwegian residents can buy and sell
securities which are regularly traded in the EEA without the mediation
of a Norwegian securities broker. In addition, these securities no
longer need to be kept in the securities deposit of a Norwegian bank or
securities broker. Although the exemptions are mainly directed to
securities traded in EEA member states, the regulations also provide
that the exemptions can be made applicable to securities traded in
states which have supervisory standards similar to those of the EEA.

The listing requirements of the Oslo Stock Exchange have been amended
to comply with the various directives in this field, including the
rules in connection with the preparation and recognition of
prospectuses. The Norwegian regulations in connection with the offering
of non-listed securities have also been amended.

If the securities to be issued have a value of more than 5 million
krone and the offer is directed to more than 50 persons, then the
issuer has to prepare a prospectus which complies with detailed
requirements. The prospectus must be sent to the board of the Oslo
Stock Exchange, where the contents of the prospectus will be checked in
order to ensure that they comply with the relevant regulations. If the
securities are listed on an EEA stock exchange, a similar prospectus
needs to be prepared if the value of the issue is more than 300,000
krone or if the offer is directed to more than 50 persons.

Different prospectus requirements apply to issues which are directed to
more than 50 persons and have a value of between 300,000 krone and 5
million krone. In such cases, a less elaborate prospectus will need to
be prepared. The prospectus must also be sent to the board of the Oslo
Stock Exchange, however this is for filing purposes only. There are a
number of exemptions to these prospectus requirements which should also
be considered.

In addition, there are more general rules in connection with
invitations to subscribe or the corresponding acquisition of shares in
connection with the incorporation of a company or capital increases,
founder shares and bonds with a term of more than 12 months. In such
cases a prospectus must be prepared which complies with some basic
requirements. These rules apply only to the extent that a prospectus is
required pursuant to, for example, company law or when a prospectus is
issued in connection with the issue.

The regulations relating to investment institutions have been amended
and now also incorporate the UCITS Directive.

OPTIONS ON FUTURES CONTRACTS

Since the beginning of March, options on futures contracts have been
quoted on the Milan Stock Exchange for the first time on an
"experimental" basis. The wording of a standard contract for these
instruments is currently being settled by the management committees of
the "Mif" (Government Bond futures exchange) and by the "Mts" (the
Government on-screen trading market). It is expected that regular
trading will commence in earnest sometime in April 1994.

The underlying instruments will be futures contracts on ten-year
Treasury Bonds (BTp decennali) and will be based on the American model
(ie exercisable at any time from the date of purchase to the date of
exercise). There will be nine striking prices, exercisable at fifty
base-point intervals, and the premium will be payable upon maturity of
the option or upon its exercise.

In order to ensure the efficient management of the new instruments, the
Cassa di Compensazione e Garanzia (the national clearing house) entered
into a contract last August with the Options Clearing Corporation in
Chicago for the supply of specialised software which will also be used
for the other new products which are shortly to be introduced onto the
market, namely three-month Eurolira futures and stock exchange index-
linked futures.

SUPER PRIMARY DEALERS

In March, a Decree Law of the Ministry of Treasury introduced a new
player in the Italian markets namely, the "Super Primary Dealer", who
will operate in both the Italian primary and secondary markets in
Treasury Bonds.

The "Super Primary Dealer" is a Primary Dealer who is able to satisfy
certain strict pre-requisites (in particular, it must have assets worth
at least Lit. 75 billion, and have been awarded a market share
calculated on the basis of a year's trading, equal to at least one per
cent in respect of each category of bonds and no less than three per
cent of the of total volume of Treasury Bonds issued on the primary
market over the same period). Super Primary Dealers are expected to be
effective marketmakers and it is worth noting that they will have
access to certain Treasury Bonds auctions at which only Super Primary
Dealers will be permitted to bid.

BANK OF HAWAII ADDS SERVANTIS CASH MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

     Bank of Hawaii, headquartered in Honolulu, has licensed InfoVue
treasury management software from Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis
Systems Inc.  The bank hopes the system boosts its product offerings
for corporate accounts.   
     InfoVue provides corporate accounts with on-line treasury
management, account balance reporting, stop payments, E-mail and other
financial reporting services.  (Lynn Busing, Servantis Systems Inc.,

INNOVATIVE STRATEGIES FOR BUSTING FRAUD

     Credit card institutions must be more proactive in their fraud-
fighting strategies or risk significant losses from fraud, risk
management experts say. 
     To nip fraud losses in the bud, credit card departments must be
on the lookout for current fraud schemes, such as account boosting,
account takeover and counterfeit cards, say anti-fraud specialists. 
Issuers also should implement new procedures and programs for the
entire lifetime of an account to prevent these new forms of fraud.  
     Increased transactions are translating into an uptick in fraud
losses (Visa estimates that for 1994, it had $409 million in fraud
losses in the United States out of $290 billion total sales;
MasterCard's fraud figures are believed to be similar to Visa's).  

Reactive vs. Proactive

     The banking and credit card industries have, historically, had
more of a "reactive stance" to fraud, taking action only once the
cardholder alerts the bank to some fraudulent activity, such as a
stolen card or a charge-back item on a bill, said one consultant.  
     The more effective way to keep fraud losses down, however, is to
identify fraud schemes before they reach the individual cardholder. 
"Don't wait until the cow is out of the barn," advised Larry Hay, vice
president of risk management at Plainview, N.Y.-based Cardholder
Management Services, a firm specializing in card marketing, processing
and consulting.
     How can you become more proactive instead of reactive about
fraud?  Consider these strategies, offered by credit card fraud
experts:

Beware of Account Boosting

     Card executives need to be attuned to every kind of new fraud
scheme because they're faddish -- one form of fraud may be popular
today and virtually non-existent tomorrow, card industry observers
say.  Fraud schemes change 
frequently as law enforcement groups, card associations and financial
institutions devote attention to one type.  Subsequently, criminals
will look for new methods.
     Visa has begun to alert its member institutions about "account
boosting," a scheme where criminals obtain legitimate credit cards,
accrue balances, then send issuers, via overnight courier services,
stolen or counterfeit checks 
that exceed the balance amount, "boosting" the account's credit line. 
Federal law requires banks to post credit payments before checks
clear, so, the next day, the fraud perpetrators go to an automated
teller machine (ATM) and withdraw the excess amount on that card
account and the check later bounces.
     Visa has been helping the U.S. Secret Service and the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) track down one large account
boosting case in Los Angeles, which resulted in 41 arrests recently,
said Allan Trosclair, vice president of fraud control for Visa.  
     Some account-boosting cases also are being linked to bankruptcy
fraud -- individuals accrue massive card debt knowing they will file
for bankruptcy and have no intention of repaying the card debt.  

TIP:  Card executives should be wary of any payments coming in through
overnight services, Trosclair warned.  They also should watch for
large payments or payments that exceed what a cardholder owes.  

     "If I send in a $6,000 check, and my credit limit is only $5,000,
there's something wrong," he said.  Banks may also want to monitor for
bankruptcy fraud behavior, by keeping track of accounts that suddenly
have high purchase volumes or uncharacteristically extravagant
purchases.  "There are several systems available which develop a
profile of normal purchasing activity of an individual cardholder and
when that [behavior] is severely changed and warrants some attention,"
said Hay.  

Prevent Account Takeovers

     MasterCard has been alerting its member institutions to watch for
an increase in "account takeover" fraud in which a criminal obtains a
cardholder's basic information (address, phone number, account
number), sometimes through old receipts, records or by stealing the
real cardholder's mail.  
     The criminal calls the card issuer, assuming the cardholder's
identity, and requests that a new card and personal identification
number (PIN) be sent to a new address because the card was lost or
stolen and the cardholder has moved.  "What happens is that the [real]
cardholder may not get a statement for a couple of months, the
criminal may pay off the minimum balance [to avoid detection] and then
start [using the card]," said Nancy Elder, a MasterCard spokesperson.

TIP:  To reduce account takeover fraud, issuers can include a three-
digit code, determined by the bank, on the back of a credit card next
to the account number.  

     Account representatives should be trained to be suspicious for
the three characteristics of account takeover:  a request for a new
card, a new PIN and a change of address.  Representatives should ask
for the three-digit code.  "If they say they don't have the card on
them, respond by saying 'call us back when you have the card in
hand,'" said Elder.

Use Technology, Training To Stop Fakes

    Issuers also must be alert for another kind of fraud: 
counterfeit cards.  These illegal products declined in the early 1990s
with the advent of the hologram; however, fake cards recently have
gained in popularity as holograms have become easier to replicate,
according to James Steel, regional vice president of security and risk
management at MasterCard.  
    To prevent more counterfeit card fraud, both MasterCard and Visa
have implanted secret card validation algorithms in each card's
magnetic stripe.  MasterCard calls it a card validation code (CVC) and
Visa calls it a card verification value (CVV).  
    When a merchant swipes the card through an authorization
terminal, the code enables the issuer to detect if there has been any
alteration of the stripe, and if so, to deny authorization for the
transaction.  
    An increasing number of transactions, however, are suspectable to
counterfeit card fraud because of purchases made at retail locations
that don't have on-line authorization terminals, or by telephone where
cards cannot be checked.

TIP:  One of the best ways to reduce counterfeit card usage is to
ensure that merchants are adequately trained in counterfeit card
detection, fraud experts say.  

    MasterCard's Holiday Fraud Prevention Seminar Program, for
example, helps merchants understand different types of credit card
crime by touring U.S. malls and educating merchants.  Acquiring
institutions also should require that their merchants offer training
to telephone operators, clerks and sales associates to help them learn
how to detect credit card fraud schemes.

Implement a Review Policy

    Issuers can use proactive strategies even after the fraud has
occurred by having a purposeful chargeback review methodology, said
Hay of Cardholder Management Services.  

TIP:  Review a charged-off account for improper authorization codes
and irregular activities, such as major purchases.  

    Improper authorization codes may indicate merchant collusion,
experts say. Irregular activities also may offer leads to criminals --
a purchase of a piece of furniture, for example, may have an address
where the furniture was delivered.  (Nancy Elder, MasterCard, 914/249-
5439; Larry Hay, Cardholder Management Services, 516/576-0404; Gail
Murayama, Visa, 415/432-3645.)

                         Fraud Detection Tool

     Here's just one of the many proactive anti-fraud products
available:

     Wheb Systems Inc. of San Diego, offers FraudAlert as a module to
its Intelligent Forms Processing System (IFPS).  FraudAlert is
designed to reduce errors and fraud before data is entered into
databases.  
     The module, based on technology licensed from Security Software
and S.G. Schoggen and Company, can be updated quarterly or monthly. 
Detection capabilities include:

 *  whether a Social Security number (SSN) has ever been used;
 *  whether the SSN was issued at a time approximating the 
          individual's stated birth date;
 *  if the SSN matches the specified state of birth; and
 *  if the SSN belongs to someone deceased.

     IFPS scans hand-printed or machine-printed forms, extracts the
relevant data and automatically enters it into a database.  Costs of
the system were not disclosed.  (Julie Drake, Wheb Systems, 619-586-

BANK MITIGATES RISK WITH ASSET/LIABILITY SOFTWARE

    U.S. Bancorp of Portland, Ore., says  asset/liability management
software cut in half the time it takes for the bank to run monthly
analyses and simulations, thereby increasing by two weeks the time the
bank has each month for forecasting and strategic analysis.
    The system also allowed the bank to more than double the number
of random interest rate scenarios it can create and reduced the time
needed to meet regulatory reporting requirements, Bancorp executives
say.
    Asset/liability management software uses computer simulations
under random rate scenarios to monitor interest rate sensitivity,
liquidity position and capital adequacy.  Although such services are
offered by banks as part of their corporate services package, some
large companies have purchased asset/liability software for in-house
treasury management, consultants say.
    However, treasurers largely have shown lukewarm interest in the
software as systems can be costly, tough to maintain and difficult to
use, consultants note.

System Reduces Analysis Cycle

    Bancorp installed RADAR, a UNIX-based asset/liability management
application from Risk Management Technologies Inc., of Berkeley,
Calif.
    RADAR simulates up to 100 randomly generated, interest rate
scenarios and presents a statistical and graphical view of each
potential outcome.  Companies can use this data to look at statistical
probabilities and begin to generate strategies for the best balance
sheet mix.
    The system also analyzes product risks.  For example, banks can
use the system to look at commercial lending across their subsidiaries
and provide information to various business managers on optimal fee
structures and interest rates, explained Rick Simpson, asset/liability
manager at Bancorp.
    In addition, RADAR reduced by two weeks Bancorp's time needed to
conduct rate analysis and issue reports for different business lines. 
"Today we are performing the same reporting in two weeks, which gives
us the second half of the month to [plan] how to use the information,"
Simpson explained.
    Although Bancorp hasn't calculated the interest rate savings
RADAR has provided, trimming just one basis point on the spread
between assets and liabilities means an additional $1.8 million to the
corporation, he noted.
    Bancorp also can run a full balance sheet analysis for one of its
banking concerns in two minutes.  Simpson estimated it takes a few
hours for the bank to run a hundred different scenarios. 
    RADAR uses RAM-resident, interactive modeling and supports both
value-at-risk (VAR) and risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC)
analytical approaches.

Software Not a Hit with Corporations

    Sumitomo Bank Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, the world's fourth largest
bank, plans to implement a RADAR system for asset-liability
management, interest rate risk management, transfer pricing, strategic
and product planning and product and customer-service performance
management, its executives say.  
    Sumitomo will create a bank-wide data warehouse for use by the
system.
    National Computer Systems of Minneapolis offers DataWriter,
another software application for asset/liability management.  
    The Windows-based system generates detailed reports on any aspect
of an asset management operation, including specialized asset
management.  Treasurers can use DataWriter to produce multiple reports
simultaneously. 
    In addition, the system allows treasurers to use point-and-click
features to define data and maintain libraries for storing and
indexing reports.
    Asset/liability software is not widely used by corporate treasury
managers, notes consultant Jim Sagner of Sagner-Marks in West Orange,
N.J.  
    "Even the most popular software which does account analysis has
been purchased by only a few corporations.  Many of them use their
systems just once or twice a year, and probably are sorry they spent
the money," he said.
    Most treasurers use asset/liability software provided by banks as
part of their information systems and balancing and reporting
services, Sagner said.  He believes treasurers are reluctant to buy
custom asset/liability systems because banks are providing adequate
services at competitive prices.  "Banks usually cut deals on these
services to win other business with corporations," he explained.
    However, only banks with sophisticated treasury workstation
products offer asset/liability services as part of their standard
software package for corporations, notes Henry Waszkowski, head of
treasury consulting at Wachovia Corp. in Atlanta.  The packages
generally feature debt modules, funds need forecasting and investment
modules, which do little analysis, Waszkowski said.  
    He said corporations often have to buy asset/liability modules
from vendors to implement on existing treasury workstations.  Many
other companies gather rate forecasting information from consulting
firms or by polling banks they do business with and subscribing to
economic services, Waszkowski noted.
    "Full-blown" workstations that include asset/liability management
software make the most financial sense for corporations with more than
$1 billion in sales annually and operations expanding overseas,
Waszkowski said. 

Treasurers Scared Off by Price of Software

    Sagner said another reason asset/liability software gets a
lukewarm reception from corporations is that treasurers are afraid
vendors won't be able to provide long-term support for the systems. 
He also believes treasurers are turned off by the $10,000 to more than
$100,000 price tag for the software.  
    "The little bit of money treasurers have as discretionary budget
is used for industry conferences or visits to vendor or bank sites,"
he noted.
    Sagner recommended treasurers avoid asset/liability systems that
are not bank-supported.  Otherwise, there is a chance that the
software vendor will go out of business and its system will become
obsolete and tough to maintain.
    TIP:  If you are keen on buying custom software, get a handle on
vendor
installation costs, which inflate greatly the price of off-the-shelf
software.

Look for Flexible Asset/Liability Software

    Jeffrey Wallace of Greenwich Treasury Advisors in Greenwich,
Conn., suggests treasurers also avoid asset/liability systems that use
static gapping models, which compute debt-equity ratios without
factoring in the yield curve.  "The real issue is how the yield curve
impacts bucket limits," Wallace said.
    "[Treasurers] won't care if they are long on the three-month side
and short on the six-month side if the yield curve is relatively
flat," he said.  "But if the curve is inverted, they might be
concerned about their gap restrictions." 
    Wallace suggested treasurers look for asset/liability software
management software that allows them to simulate a variety of interest
rate scenarios.
    TIP:  Keep in mind that PC-based asset/liability packages are
limited by the PC's processing capacity, memory and storage capacity. 
To compensate, they use aggregated data, which is not as accurate,
Simpson cautioned.  (Jeffrey Wallace, Greenwich Treasury Advisors,
203/531-0835; Jim Sagner, Sagner-Marks, 201/243-1144; Rick Simpson,
U.S. Bancorp, 503/275-7277; Kib Shorey, National Computer Systems,

MECA SOFTWARE GAINS MORE FINANCIAL BACKERS

    Banks looking to support personal financial management (PFM)
software may have to consider another major player.
    Competition in the PFM software business continued to heat up
last week as three new bank-investors pledged their moneys to
Fairfield, Conn.-based Meca Software's Managing Your Money PFM
product.
     FirstBank Systems, Fleet Financial Services and the Royal Bank of
Canada all bought stakes in Meca, which is co-owned by San Francisco-
based BankAmerica Corp. and NationsBank Corp..  Each of the five
institutions will own a 20-percent share of Meca.
     The five Meca partners have a combined customer base of more than
40 million customers and represent more than $655 billion in assets,
giving Meca -- whose software is used by more than 600,000 consumers
and small businesses in North America -- a significant competitive
boost, industry analysts say.
     However, some banks do not believe the Meca partners will be able
to work together and create a competitive product.
     The overwhelming market leader for PFM software, with more than 8
million copies sold, is Intuit's Quicken.  Microsoft's Money PFM
product -- launched earlier this year -- is a distant third to Meca.

PFM Maneuvering

     The Meca deal continues a six-month trend, which has seen PFM
manufacturers aggressively seeking out bank partners to offer on-line
home banking.  Both Microsoft and Intuit have struck agreements with
more than 19 banks across the United States.  Many of these
institutions including Chemical Bank, CoreStates Bank and Wells Fargo
Bank will offer both Money and Quicken to its customers.

Advantages

     Meca's owners said the deal gives them an advantage in the PFM
marketplace over the Microsoft and Intuit banks because institutions
now can customize their PFM software packages.  Minneapolis-based
FirstBank, Providence, R.I.-based Fleet and Royal Bank of Toronto all
will create a branded Managing Your Money product with different
functionality.
     "This investment will enable Fleet to develop its own branded PC
[personal computer] product, designed to meet the specific needs of
our customers while providing them convenience and privacy," said
Michael R. Zucchini, vice chairman and chief technology officer at
Fleet.
     Fleet's version of Managing Your Money will provide Fleet
customers with an on-line link to open accounts, check and transfer
balances, apply for loans, track their investments and buy stocks and
mutual funds.

Avoiding Conflict

     Meca critics question whether the five large institutions can
agree on one software product.  
     "I just don't see why these banks, who compete against each
other, would want to join forces," said one Southeast banker.  "The
egos of the executives at these large institutions are bound to cause
problems."
     However, allowing each bank to customize may allow Meca to
sidestep any controversy.
     "I don't see a lot of potential conflict," said Stu Bloom, a
partner at the Hackensack, N.J.-based consultancy, Carmody & Bloom. 
"Banks are going to do what banks do -- offer basic financial products
to their customers.  There should be no great conflict in what will be
developed."
     Royal Bank of Canada will use Meca to launch a PC computer
banking system.  Its customers will connect directly to the bank's
host computer to pay bills, receive account balances, transfer funds
and access account information.  Royal will roll out Managing Your
Money nationally in late 1996 to its 10 million customers at more than
1,600 branches, according to Royal Bank officials.

The Future

    Industry analysts expect the strategical maneuvering of PFM
software providers to continue throughout 1996.
    In fact, Intuit recently announced its plans to provide on-line
banking over the Internet.  This is a change from its recent strategy
of signing up financial institutions.
    Intuit said it is developing a direct connection to the Internet
that will allow consumers to pay bills, check account balances and
transfer funds over the Internet.  Banks working with Intuit will have
the choice of offering customers Internet banking or banking solely
through Quicken.  

PFM Landscape

    The Intuit decision earlier this week proves that the PFM
landscape is changing on a daily basis.  
    PFM manufacturers will most likely continue to strike deals with
financial institutions.  
    However, do not expect banks to support solely one PFM product. 
Industry watchers believe banks want to offer their customers the most 
 choice  and   will   offer any  alternatives on the marketplace.  
    "It wouldn't be surprising for a bank to take an open systems
approach to these types of [PFM products]," said Bloom.  "In some
ways, it would be advantageous.  It won't surprise me [if some Meca
institutions offer Quicken or Money] even though they have taken an
equity position in Meca."  (Stu Bloom, Carmody & Bloom, 201/671-1700;

FIRST INTERSTATE BANK TAPS IMAGE-LOCKBOX PROCESSING

     First Interstate Bank, of Los Angeles, says it's the first bank
in the Western United States to offer image-based retail lockbox
processing.  It also claims to be the only bank to fully exploit the
opportunity to initiate true interstate banking.
     "We have installed a common lockbox image platform at all of our
banks which gives our customers the same consistent functionality,"
said Julie Stephens, product manager at the $56 billion asset-bank.
     A common platform allows First Interstate to offer same-day
automated clearing house settlement (ACH) across its Western state
affiliates or same-day cash concentration for customers who require
separate accounts, officials say.
     The bank's image-retail lockbox provides customers with
streamlined workflow, higher quality processing and improved customer
service, she said.       In addition, the system includes intelligent
character recognition (ICR), which allows matching payments and
coupons to be read by the system and processed without keying.  This
improves the speed and quality of processing.  
     Phase 2 of First Interstate's image-retail lockbox project will
include the ability to provide transaction images to customers for
receivables posting.
     The image system is expected to capture about 11 million items
per month.     

First Interstate Offers Common Platform  

     First Interstate also completed recently a multimillion-dollar
project to install common cash management systems across the bank's
13-state domain.  
     A provision of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking Act allows
affiliated banks to act as "agent" for one another, and act as an
agent itself.
     First Interstate offers common direct demand accounts (DDA),
account reconciliation processing (ARP) and account analysis
capabilities.  Customers can use the products to make same-day
deposits to a single account from deposit acceptance points in 13
Western states.  With fewer accounts to manage, customers can
determine cash positions faster and easier, bank officials say.
     "Many companies with multi-state operations will no longer have
to concentrate or reconcile funds," said Jan Cloyde, the bank's
executive vice president and manager of cash management.  She claimed
that competitor banks are well behind First Interstate in developing
multiple interstate banking options.

MAXWELL STIRS UP TROUBLE

The decision by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) (UK) to go ahead with
further Maxwell trials provoked as much reaction as the verdicts in the
first trial. The gasps that were heard in court as the defendants in
the Maxwell trial were acquitted on all charges were soon followed by
cries outside the court. Whether the shouts in court were of joy,
shock, or surprise, the comments outside were of a predictable nature:
critics slammed the use of juries in fraud trials and the record of the
Serious Fraud Office in prosecuting complex fraud.

Whenever a fraud case goes wrong - in other words, when defendants are
acquitted or those convicted receive light sentences - the reaction is
always the same. We were not disappointed in the case of the Maxwell
trial.

In contrast to the cries of 'abolish the jury' or 'scrap the SFO', one
of the most pertinent and sane comments came from George Staples,
director of the SFO. Although presumably bitterly disappointed by the
verdict of the jury, he said: 'It is our job to conduct a thorough
investigation and ensure that defendants are prosecuted fairly, and
that has happened. The jury has considered the verdict for many days
and has reached its verdict. The criminal justice system has functioned
in the way that it was designed to do.'

The truth - reinforced by the announcement of further trials - is that
at the moment the SFO is being forced to conduct political show trials
rather than trying to solve the serious problems of corporate fraud and
illegal acts in the City and elsewhere.

If there is trouble in prosecuting serious frauds, then creating
another agency or removing the people in charge will not solve the
problem. The law is a mess. In its report of July 1993, the Royal
Commission on Criminal Justice said: 'Those giving evidence to us have
suggested that fraud trials would be simpler to determine if the
substantive law of fraud were reformed. Apart from the common law
offence of conspiracy to defraud, there is no specific offence of fraud
in England and Wales, and fraudulent conduct has therefore to be bought
under the ambit of various offences.'

Pension law has been reformed as a result of the Maxwell trial - so
now, should the law on fraud.

CENTRAL GOVERNMENT FRAUD CASES UP 16% - VALUE BY 25%

Fraud in central government has increased by 16% in the last year,
according to the Treasury's own figures. The 1994-95 Fraud Report - an
analysis of reported fraud in government departments - the Treasury
revealed that government departments reported a total of 408 cases of
department staff fraud, an increase of 16% over 1993-94 and 35% over
1992-93. The total sum involved was #2.12m compared with #1.69m in 1993-
94 and #2.11m in 1992-93, although the report says that in a number of
cases the amount involved had not been identified or could not be
assessed.

The report was published in January 1996 just two months after the 1993-
94 report (see The Fraud Report, November 1995) which was released only
after a complaint to the Parliamentary Commissioner under the Code of
Practice on open government. The Treasury refused to speculate on the
growth of fraud in central government. It said: 'Whether the increase
in the number of fraud cases reported reflects a real trend is
impossible to say. It may be that greater fraud awareness and better
fraud reporting procedures in departments leads to more cases being
reported. What is undeniable is that the risk of fraud is not
diminishing. Staff at all levels need to be alert to these risks.'

Strangely out of the 58 central government bodies, including all
government departments, which submitted annual returns in 1994-95, 30
of them - just over half - submitted a 'nil return' saying there had
been no cases of fraud.

'CONCERTED ATTACK ON FRAUD IS REQUIRED,' CLAIMS AUDIT FACULTY

More concerted action by management, regulators, auditors and the
Government is needed to fight fraud effectively, according to a booklet
published by the Audit Faculty of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England & Wales (ICAEW). Peter Williams reports on a
recent initiative by accountants.

In a new booklet, Taking Fraud Seriously, authors Tony Bingham of
Coopers & Lybrand, Ian Huntingdon of KPMG and Martyn Jones of Touche
Ross, wrote: 'Crime and crime prevention evolve together and there is
no shortage of effective measures with which to counter the fraudster.
The real challenge is not a technical but an attitudinal one, the will
to make fraud prevention a priority.'

The role of directors and management

A company can minimise the risk of fraud if directors and senior
managers take a positive lead and set the tone from the top,
communicating clearly that fraud, corruption and dishonesty is not
tolerated. According to the booklet, directors and managers should seek
to establish a clear anti-fraud culture by:

- Leading from the top. Senior management must demonstrate commitment
to an anti-fraud culture and be seen to be subject to the same
procedural guidelines and investigation as the rest of the work-force.

- Implementing and communicating an anti-fraud policy, covering such
matters as giving and receiving inducements, reporting channels,
investigation of suspected fraud and dealing with perpetrators. There
should be a public pledge that allegations of fraud or other wrong
doing by employees or by a third party will be properly investigated;

- Developing a fraud contingency plan, setting out what is done and by
whom in the event of the discovery of fraud.

The booklet also calls for quoted companies to comment in their annual
report on their efforts to prevent fraud and, in particular, to discuss
their policies on the areas outlined above. This suggestion has been
opposed by some finance directors.

Taking Fraud Seriously also discusses the role of non-executive
directors suggesting that they should:

- be alert to the risk of fraud in a business, particularly top level
management fraud;

- be satisfied that internal control measures are given the right
emphasis within the organisation;

- be satisfied with the integrity of the organisation's public company
reporting;

- establish open lines of communication with internal and external
auditors and be prepared to spend time discussing the auditor's
concerns.

The authors also call on directors to consider their wider public
duties when deciding whether to report alleged fraudsters to the
public. At present, many directors feel it is in the best interests of
their organisation not to report fraud to the police but to quietly
deal with the matter themselves, often leaving the fraudster to strike
again.

Reform of the law

As well as calling for a change in attitude towards fraud, the authors -
 all of whom are auditors - suggest that legal changes are required.
Alongside wider legal questions - such as an examination of the pros
and cons of creating a legal responsibility for officers and employees
of public companies to report prima facie fraud to the police - the
booklet calls for enforcing and extending section 389A of the Companies
Act 1985. This section gives auditors rights of access to the company's
records and requires its officers to provide such explanations or
information as the auditors need to perform their duties. It also
contains the offence of misleading an auditor, which the report says is
useful but that it does not carry a stiff enough penalty to encourage
prosecutors to use it.

The report wants the maximum custodial sentence increased from two
years to five, and for the offence to be extended to any employee and
any organisation.

The role of the regulators

Regulators play a key part in the fight against corporate fraud.
According to the report, they need to guard against two main dangers.
First, increasing the length and complexity of their rule book imposes
a burden on the majority of members with well-run business and, second,
more complex legislation can damage the effectiveness of inspection
teams.

Regulators could increase their effectiveness by:

- reviewing their rule books to ensure emphasis on the prevention and
detection of management fraud rather than on minor offences

- making greater effort to cooperate with overseas and international
regulators

- passing on important information promptly to auditors. The authors
want the law changed to impose a duty on regulators to tell auditors
when a client is suspected of fraud. They say that auditors can often
be left in the dark about such suspicions. At the moment, auditors are
under a legal obligation to report their suspicions. Regulators have
opposed the opening up of a two-way street saying that, where possible,
information is often already passed on.

The Government's role

Taking Fraud Seriously calls on the Government to establish an
independent standing body - The Fraud Advisory Panel - with
responsibility for:

- providing a forum for discussion and improved cooperation between
Government, law enforcement, the private sector and other interested
parties;

- increasing the overall awareness of the problem of fraud.

The Panel's membership would be drawn from the legal and accounting
professions, law enforcement, regulatory agencies, business and
academia.

Secondly, the Government should designate a lead department for the
coordination of the its anti-fraud strategy. At the moment
responsibility for anti-fraud policy is scattered around various
Whitehall departments.

Copies of Taking Fraud Seriously are available from Tracy Gray, The
Audit Faculty, The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England &
Wales, Chartered Accountants' Hall, PO Box 433, Moorgate Place, London

FFIN WORKING FINE ON FRAUD

Mike Feltham, head of the London Stock Exchange surveillance
department, told the Taking Fraud Seriously conference (see opposite)
that great efforts have been made to ensure that information is
exchanged relating to any fraud or market abuse.

He said that one of the ways the Stock Exchange passed on and received
information was through membership of the Financial Fraud Information
Network (FFIN). Feltham said: 'FFIN was formed as a result of a
recommendation in a study commissioned by HM Treasury, as part of a
Government response to such cases as BCCI and Maxwell.'

Supervisors, regulators, investigators, law enforcers and Government
meet on a regular basis to exchange information and pool knowledge
about actual or suspected serious financial fraud.

Feltham said: 'FFIN has around 20 members but its feeder contacts go a
lot wider. The primary objective is to provide a framework for pooling
and disseminating information about financial fraud and other serious
criminal activity which pass through, and make use of, the UK financial
system.'

FFIN has no operational responsibilities as these remain with the
individual members. He added: 'There are three stages in the fight
against financial fraud: detection, investigation and enforcement.
FFIN's role is to assist principally with detection but it also helps
the transition of cases from the detection to the investigation stage.
FFIN tries to put together the different pieces of a jigsaw spread
around several players where the picture that emerges can be far more
significant than the individual pieces taken in isolation.'

Although each member has its own constitution and rules on
confidentiality there is normally a legitimate way in which to transmit
information within the membership when the need arises. Feltham said:
'To my mind, FFIN has already assisted the exchange by enabling it to
pass cases to the appropriate investigatory and prosecution agencies,
which has resulted in action being taken which would not have
otherwise.'

The London Stock Exchange and a number of other London regulators also
belong to an international inter-market surveillance group, ISG, which
provides a framework for the sharing of information and the
coordination of regulatory matters among market centres. Formed in
1983, ISG now has 22 North American, European and Australasian
organisations with a common interest in fraud prevention. Feltham said:
'Membership of ISG has assisted us in being able to track movements of
security trading and has allowed us to produce a much more broader
picture than was previously possible.'

FRAUD RISES ALONG WITH STANDARDS

Reported fraud has increased because expected standards of commercial
behaviour have risen, according to Ian Hay Davison, who was deputy
chairman and chief executive of Lloyd's from 1983-86. Davison said that
times change: acts once condoned are now regarded as fraudulent.

He said: 'That was the problem of the underwriters at Lloyd's: they
really had no idea that the ways of their fathers are today regarded as
not only unacceptable but as criminal. When I started in the City, the
provision of undisclosed benefits in kind to directors, the use of
insider information to deal before company news was made public, the
development of schemes solely designed to avoid personal taxation
rates, and what we would today regard as false or misleading accounting
practices, were rife. Year-by-year, case-by-case, statute-by-statute,
standards have been raised and offences created.'

But he added: 'Fraud is a serious problem. It has always been and there
is no point in raising standards if the new higher standards are not
enforced. There can be no doubt that the enforcement of law in the area
of fraud has been and continues to be lamentable.'

Davison also pointed to other reasons, such as more complex markets,
greater opportunities through the abolition of exchange controls, a
greater spread of wealth providing more smaller savers to be gulled,
and especially the greater power of computers.

He added: 'British white-collar crime has the quality that too often
its perpetrators persistently refuse to concede that what they have
done is wrong. One attractive quality of the Chinese, as I found in my
term as chairman of the Hong Kong Securities Review Committee, was that
while culprits at Lloyd's if caught red-handed consistently failed to
concede the enormity of what they had done, the Chinese accepted the
justice of the prosecutor's actions.'

THE CASE FOR THE DEFENCE?

The Government watchdog, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) (UK), has
expressed concern over the need for the Ministry of Defence (MoD) (UK)
to keep under review more effective arrangements to prevent and detect
fraud. In this article Rachael Church looks at the lessons to be
learned by the MoD and others.

The MoD spends #23bn a year on the nation's behalf, including #9bn on
procurement, yet it reckons that it is relatively free from fraud and
corruption. It has identified only #22m possible fraud in 1993-94 - a
mere 0.1% of its total expenditure, and a much smaller figure than many
private-sector organisations.

Three recent cases involving the corruption of former MoD officials
raises a number of issues of wider relevance, according to the PAC.
Since November 1993, three individuals previously employed by the
Department - Gordon Foxley, James Taylor and Bernard Trevelyan - have
been convicted of receiving corrupt sums. The Foxley case is the most
significant of the three and concerns the receipt of corrupt payments
from overseas contractors. The Department says that not all the corrupt
funds in the Foxley case have yet been identified - although he was
convicted of 12 offences totalling #1.36m. Much of the money is locked
away in Swiss bank accounts. Despite civil action the PAC said: 'The
Department could not give us any grounds for hope that they would
succeed in gaining access to these accounts, but told us they would
pursue every possible avenue.'

Three overseas companies involved in the Foxley case have been
blacklisted, and the MoD is taking steps to recover the corrupt
payments. It has demanded a public apology and a clear assurance that
they will not involve themselves in corruption again, as well as more
onerous oversight arrangements if contracts are placed with them in
future.

Rotating duties

The PAC says that the Foxley case illustrates the risks of fraud and
corruption where staff are in post for a long time and have influence
over contracts. The National Audit Office (NAO) identified cases where
staff had been in post at the same location for over 12 years. The MoD
says that the Foxley case was exceptional in its longevity. It now has
a firm policy of moving staff every five years, but could not say that
everyone who had served in a post for five years would be moved. In
these cases there was a balance between the benefit of long experience
and deep knowledge and the risk of someone knowing all the tricks of
the trade and therefore increasing the risk of fraud.

The MoD's vetting arrangements failed to identify Foxley's lavish
lifestyle which included nine properties in England. The Department
said Foxley had a good cover story that his wife was a medical
practitioner 'who was known to have money in her background'. It is now
considering adopting vetting arrangements similar to those used for
national security purposes to identify individuals who present a fraud
risk.

Gifts and hospitality

As a result of the Foxley case, the Department's rules concerning the
acceptance of gifts and hospitality have been strengthened, by
providing more specific guidance on their interpretation. It says that
large-scale, expensive and exclusive hospitality has now been largely
eliminated, and that hospitality books are now properly maintained and
scrutinised. Rules have also been tightened where officials leave to
work for defence contractors and the Department looks carefully at
precisely what individuals have been doing and who they have been
dealing with - although it still considers this an area of potential
risk. In the US there is a five-year blanket ban on such a switch, but
the MoD says that the UK would not be able to afford the loss of brains
that might be transferred in to income-earning, export-earning
activities.

The MoD has also set up a fraud unit, promulgated fraud indicators,
runs fraud-awareness courses, and has a 'hotline', so that people can
report frauds anonymously.

OTHER PROCUREMENT AREAS AT RISK..

The scope for fraud is higher where control systems are less
comprehensive or where changes in management arrangements have altered
the circumstances in which the controls operate. In the MoD's case
areas identified by the NAO include:

- computer systems

- non-competitive contracts

- local purchase units and

- the control of assets held by contractors.

As a result of NAO work, the MoD has drawn up an action plan to reduce
the risk of fraud.

Computer systems. The MoD increasingly relies on computer systems. A
review by the NAO of the payment systems at Liverpool had identified a
number of concerns which the MoD is addressing through risk assessment.

Local purchase units. Around 400 local purchase units account for about
#270m a year but the MoD acknowledges that it is harder to exercise
control over small local contracts than it is for large procurement
contracts. In some cases there was no separation of duties and the
MoD's internal audit team visited fewer than 1% of them each year. It
plans to extend auditing in this area.

Non-competitive contracting. In 'cost-plus' non-competitive contracts
the risk that costs may be overstated is obvious. The MoD says it has
reduced the level of non-competitive contracting and started
initiatives such as 'No acceptable price, no contract' and the Equality
of Information Statement, which aims to reduce the risk of poor value
for money, including fraud.

Control of assets held by contractors. Government equipment and spares
are held by contractors to enable them to carry out repairs and
maintenance contracts. Controls in this area are often poor with often
an absence of separation of duty, supervisory checks, stocktaking and
exit-gate checks. The MoD's response is that less and less equipment is
held in this way so the risk should diminish over time.

LOSING OUT IN THE NUMBERS GAME

'Calling cards' allow calls to be made on the move. They are a
necessary and valuable product for many businesses and individuals. But
the increased flexibility they offer comes at the price of increased
risk. Dean Smith of Fraud Management Limited outlines the problem.

Everyone knows of the most common mobile product - the cellular
telephone - but fewer people are aware of the increasingly popular
'calling card' - a product now supplied by most major
telecommunications companies across the globe. In the UK, major
operators such as BT, Mercury and Energis all offer card-based services
operating alongside other international players such as AT&T, MCI and
Sprint. The card's basic function is to allow a call to be placed, from
virtually any telephone, and charged to the account holder for that
card - ie a no-cash call. Billing may be to the user or, in a corporate
environment, to a cost-centre manager responsible for the telecoms
spending of a team of people. There are a number of flexible billing
options available which vary by supplier.

Calling cards offer a good means of cost control over telecoms spending
when users are away from home or office. Increasingly, such products
are being combined with payment cards as value-add features, American
Express being a good example. This evolution is sure to continue,
reducing the amount of plastic in the pocket and enhancing existing
card services. But increased usage means increased risk.

No flights of fancy

Picture this: you are on business in New York and about to catch a
flight to Los Angeles from JFK International Airport, when a delay of
two hours is announced because of bad weather. You decide to call the
person you are meeting to advise of your delay and find a suite of
payphones nearby from which to call. From your pocket, you pull out
your calling card and lift the telephone handset. As you do so, you are
aware of someone just behind and to the side of you, apparently waiting
to use the phone. You dial the free access number which connects you to
the automated operator of the service you use. Following a prompt, you
enter the card number, reading from the card in your hand. Following
another prompt, you enter your secret PIN followed by the telephone
number you are calling. As you enter these last digits, you notice that
the person behind you moves off to use a telephone just a little down
the line. 'Hello Jim, it's Phil here - just calling to say I'll be a
little late ...' As you end your call and move back towards the coffee
shop, you see the person who was behind you with a group of others, all
busily scribbling away in a huddle.

Three weeks later, back in London, your telecoms manager calls you and
asks why your calling card bill is so large. 'Nonsense, I only used it
a dozen or so times to call home and for business'. But on inspection,
you find the normal #200 bill has risen to #10,000. Calls to Mexico,
Columbia, Europe, the Far East and other destinations you know nothing
of. Even more surprisingly, calls were made from other countries while
you (and your card) were in the United States.

Another victim of 'shoulder-surfing'

The person behind you when you made that call at JFK was noting your
card and PIN details. When he went to another payphone, he called his
colleague in Amsterdam to test the card and pass on the numbers. Your
card details were then put onto the Internet as part of a well-
organised distribution network. What do they get out of it? A few
dollars per card number, free calls, and a few more dollars when they
sell the numbers to others waiting around the payphones to make calls
or obtain card numbers themselves.

This is one of the less sophisticated methods of obtaining card
details. High-powered binoculars, video equipment and sound-recording
devices (useful when speaking your numbers to a human operator) have
all been used in similar environments.

Similarly, there are risks when using calling cards from hotels or
other businesses that use call-logging equipment. Card numbers may be
captured in soft or hard copy for reference by prying eyes. Calling
cards might also be used for data transmission from portable PC
equipment, in which case card details may be stored within. And what of
that 'last number redial' button on the telephone you have just used?

It is fortunate, however, that the UK has to date suffered relatively
little from this type of fraud. The US remains the telecoms fraud
capital of the world, but trends in other countries are definitely on
the up. It makes sense, therefore, to take care when using a calling
card anywhere in the world, not just the US.

Shopping around for security

Most telecoms providers are aware of the risks involved with calling-
card products. As such, most have developed a degree of fraud
prevention and detection within the product configuration, operation
and call monitoring. Security features vary widely from operator to
operator and so it is worth exploring these with their agent during the
sales process. It is also worth establishing who would be responsible
for the bill should you be hit by fraud. On the whole, service
suppliers in the UK are reasonably good at fraud detection and should
be able to contact you if fraud is suspected.

The following checklist will help reduce the fraud risk. Take the time
to deliver these messages to appropriate personnel within your
organisation; users, telecoms managers and those responsible for paying
the bills. It could help reduce the trauma, wasted time and possible
expense of a fraud incident.

PIN security

- Once you have memorised the PIN, destroy the original PIN
notification.

- Avoid writing your PIN down. If you have to, note it so that it could
not be identified as a PIN.

- Never write the PIN on the calling card or anywhere that might be
associated with the card eg on any related literature.

- Do not disclose your card number or PIN to anyone except the calling
card operator when you need to make a call. You will never be contacted
and asked for your PIN (or password if one is used) by the service
supplier.

- If you think that someone might have noted your card and PIN numbers,
contact the service supplier to change them immediately.

- Avoid PINs (or passwords) that would be easy to guess - those running
sequentially (1234, 9876 etc) or with repeated digits (1111 etc). Also
avoid obvious keypad sequences like 1397 (clockwise) or 2580 (down the
middle), and your year of birth.

Card security

- Never leave your calling card lying around. Treat it as you would a
credit card.

- If your card is lost or stolen, report it immediately to the service
supplier - and always carry the supplier's emergency phone number.

- To prevent others noting your card number, never use your card as a
proof of identity.

Usage precautions

- Take appropriate precautions when using your card to avoid anyone
seeing the digits you dial (if using direct-dial via tone telephones)
or overhearing the numbers you speak (if calling via the operator).
Shielding the keypad from prying eyes will help significantly. When
passing your card details to the operator, make sure nobody is
eavesdropping. It is perhaps worth cupping your hand over the telephone
mouthpiece.

- If using telephones that display the digits you enter, ensure that
the numbers are not visible to others and that they are cleared after
use. Numbers can be cleared by lifting the telephone handset after your
calls are complete and entering a random digit. This will also help
avoid problems with the last number redial function available on many
telephones.

- Some hotels or organisations use call-logging equipment to help
manage or account for their telephone usage. These could record your
calling card details which may then be visible to others. This only
happens if you direct-dial calls using a tone telephone connected to
the logger. This risk can be avoided by making calls via the calling
card operator or using a telephone not connected to the logger.

- If using your card to make calls from a computer (eg data
transmissions), ensure that your computer is protected against
unauthorised access - your card details may be visible within the
system. If possible, do not enter your PIN as a default setting - enter
it manually for each call made.

- Never loan your card unless you are prepared to pay for the calls
made (which may be a lot more than the ones you know of).

HOW FORENSIC ACCOUNTANTS FACE GREATER LIABILITY EXPOSURE

Roger Parker, partner in the Commercial Litigation department of City
solicitors Richards Butler, considers accountants' increasing liability
exposure - and offers some remedies.

The Fraud Report has referred in recent editions to surveys suggesting
that fraud is on the increase - or at least that detection rates are.
The number of situations where forensic accountants are called in to
assist companies results in greater liability exposure for the
accountant - albeit with greater fee income as well.

This article summarises the basis of such liability exposure and
highlights certain practices which have led to a degree of concern
about risk-management techniques deployed by accountants. On the basis
that any litigation is symptomatic of a breakdown in communication this
should interest companies as well as accountants.

Common threads

A number of claims, across the professions, have common features:

- Complexity. The more complex the case the more for the development of
problems, be they caused by lack of appropriate communication,
expertise, diligence or resource.

- Late instruction. The forensic accountant will often be instructed
after a fraud has been committed. What is less understandable is if
there is an instruction given unnecessarily late, as happens from time
to time. If there is belated instruction in pressurised circumstances a
proper investigation is less likely to result.

- Fiscal control. Proper financial control of any consultant is
essential, but the thin line between budgetary control and imprudent
management should not be crossed.

- Access to the client. For a company this tends to be less of a
problem because of the proximity of the in-house lawyer to client. It
can be more of a problem where the client is further removed - for
example when the accountant is instructed by a solicitor. It is for the
accountant to ensure that he has all proper and necessary access to lay
clients and to those who may have direct access to material
information.

- Trends. Increasingly, disgruntled clients are 'having a go' at
professionals, sometimes because of their own deep pockets, sometimes
because of their insurers. Also, it is increasingly common for the
dissatisfied to seek to apportion responsibility. Somebody 'must' be to
blame - a human reaction that many (particularly US) courts have over-
indulged.

Sorting out communication

One of the fundamental principles of English and US contract law is the
rule that vague wording in a contract will generally be construed
against the writer (contra proferentem). Not surprisingly therefore,
professional liability cases in both jurisdictions have tended to give
clients the benefit of the doubt when liability is based on
misunderstanding. It is incumbent on the professional proactively to
seek out areas where clients may not have sufficient understanding.
This issue is the biggest single source of claims and is therefore
regularly of concern to professional firms. It is increasingly
important in complex fraud cases because:

- Investigations can be labour intensive involving many hours. Hours
are money. The client will not necessarily be well-placed to assess the
volume of hours or the complexity of the task. That is why he or she
instructs the accountant.

- Explanation of the substance of the problem can be complex and
results may only come toward the end of an investigation. This means
the patience of the client may be sorely tested as hours are spent and
fees incurred with no result until completion. It can be harder in
fraud cases for clients to know whether their decision to invest is
worthwhile. It may be even harder to explain to the client's commercial
management.

Contracts as reference points

Claims will sometimes be based on a retainer letter. The latter is
under-utilised. A perfectly adequate contract between client and
professional on a major instruction can be contained within a couple of
pages. It should be the reference point for identifying responsibility
for the purposes of both contract and negligence. Very few of the major
English legal authorities revolve around the retainer letter because
not enough attention has been given to defining the scope of services
that should be contained in it. More time has been spent in drafting
limitation clauses or costs schedules. There are important matters, but
there need not be an exclusion of the scope. This may seem a bit basic,
but how often have you seen a professional spell out precisely what he
or she is doing? What sources will the accountant be checking for signs
of malpractice? When will the accountant cease to follow a line of
enquiry? What if that line would have produced the answer?

The absence of at least a basic pointer to the scope of work is
inconsistent with the practice adopted by a number of other
professionals. Part of the historical reason for this is linked to the
absence of fixed fee in certain investigatory work. A fixed fee tends
to lead to a fixed definition of what is to be done with the
flexibility of additional services being provided upon request - for an
additional cost. An open-ended and potentially vague assignment is more
likely to lead to a vague brief. It is not suggested that vagueness can
be eliminated, but focus on the 'greyer' areas at least enables a more
accurate assessment of where the parties' risk exposure is.

Resisting negligence

It is clear from recent leading authority in England that if the
professional escapes liability in contract he or she may not
necessarily be so lucky in resisting a claim in negligence. To limit
the danger there should be, possibly to the advantage of both parties
to the arrangement, synonimity between contractual and tortuous
obligations. This can be done simply, by a statement to the effect that
the parties do not agree to there being any tortuous liability over and
above their contractual responsibilities as defined. What many will see
as unacceptable on policy grounds is the possibility of spending time
and money negotiating a retainer letter/contract only to find that some
other, judicially imposed, criteria determines responsibility.

Conclusion

It is easy with hindsight to apportion blame for conduct. It is not so
easy to think positively how to implement procedures to reduce the risk
of dispute. Perhaps predictably, one answer is to do with training, in
the basics - communication skills, drafting and straight thinking of
what each party to the arrangement is expecting to achieve and how they
are going to achieve it.

ADVANCE FEE AND PBI FRAUD - ALWAYS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE

Advance fee and PBI fraud continues to be a dramatically successful
form of fraud, despite warnings issued in recent years by bodies such
as the Bank of England, the Law Society and the Federal Reserve. Andrew
Keltie, a partner in Baker & McKenzie, London and a member of Baker &
McKenzie's Civil Fraud Group, reports.

With hindsight, advance fee and prime bank instrument (PBI) frauds seem
so obviously dishonest that it is hard to understand how anyone could
be deceived. But the combination of ostensibly authentic documentation,
and the skillful use of psychology, has led to many sophisticated
business people being defrauded of substantial sums. A recent example
is the loss (and subsequent recovery) of more than #6m by the Salvation
Army in 1992. In May 1992 the Army had been persuaded to pay $10m to a
Belgian bank for investment in 'prime bank instruments' which the
Salvation Army was duped into believing could be bought as a discount
and sold at a profit. In fact, PBIs do not exist and there is no market
in them, other than that conjured up by plausible fraudsters.

Advance fee fraud

This involves tricking the victim into believing that participating in
a transaction (the participation being dependent on payment of an
advance fee or 'commission') will give access to a low-interest or
interest-free loan, or the receipt of some other financial benefit. The
advance fee is usually a small percentage of the finance apparently
being provided. It may be suggested that the source of the finance is
'oil money', or that the funding is by means of a 'self-liquidating
loan'. Fraudsters will go to considerable lengths to compile a dossier
of correspondence and legalistic documents, purportedly authenticating
the availability of the funds and the credentials of the participants.
This will often involve the use of headed notepaper obtained from
banks, accountants and firms of solicitors. The growth (and increasing
acceptability) of fax documents means that genuine letterheads can be
used to create bogus documents which are difficult to detect if sent by
fax.

Once the victim is persuaded of the genuine nature of the transaction,
and the availability of low-cost or free finance, the next stage is
payment of the advance fee, often expressed to be the agent's
commission, the victim having been convinced that payment is the final
stage in obtaining the promised funds. In most cases as soon as it is
paid the fee will disappear along with the fraudster.

Prime bank instrument fraud

Advance fee fraud is still committed but its more sophisticated
exponents have moved on to PBI fraud, which rests on the use of bogus
financial instruments as being the source of the alleged loan or
profit.

PBI fraud is based on the mythical existence of a secret market in
which the world's largest ('prime') banks deal with each other, reaping
huge profits. The victim is enticed with a promise that he can share in
those profits, for a modest investment. PBIs are usually referred to as
'prime bank guarantees', 'prime bank promissory notes (or paper)',
'master collateral commitments' or 'discounted standby letters of
credit'.

The story is that the 'prime' banks lend huge sums to each other all
the time, and that there is a market in PBIs which the victim will be
able to tap into via a smaller bank at which the fraudster has a
contact. Unsurprisingly, the smaller bank will often appear to be
incorporated in Panama or Liechtenstein, and will rarely be found in
any banker's almanac or directory.

Although standby letters of credit do exist and are issued by banks,
they are a form of collateral security or performance bond. They are
not negotiable and there is no market in them. Prime bank guarantees,
prime bank notes and the like do not exist.

A veneer of respectability

Both advance fee and PBI frauds are invariably dressed up with a
variety of complicated legalistic (but incomprehensible) documentation,
all of which the victim is solemnly asked to read carefully and sign.
These usually include a confidentiality agreement and a 'certificate of
origin of funds', confirming that the victim's investment is of 'good,
clean funds of non-criminal origin'.

Another key feature is secrecy. It is frequently claimed that the
source of finance in advance fee fraud is the Middle East, because of
religious restrictions on earning interest on loans; or that disclosure
of the covert market in PBIs would lead to the market breaking down,
because it would no longer be confined to the elite few. The real
purpose of such secrecy is, of course, to prevent or dissuade the
victim from carrying out any form of due diligence and to explain why
the victim cannot meet the lender. It can also make action to attempt
to recover lost funds far more difficult.

Other devices used to reassure a victim include:

- returning a portion of the fee at the end of a week or month,
representing it as a form of profit, the aim being to persuade the
victim that the investment is profitable, and to commit more funds

- spurious references to organisations such as the World Bank, the
United Nations, and the International Chamber of Commerce

- the apparent involvement of professionals, particularly lawyers'
client or trust accounts

- supposed absolute security.

It is often said that transactions are on a 'bank-to-bank' basis and
the investment is as secure as the bank itself. As in the Salvation
Army case, a common device is to persuade the investor to open an
account at a foreign bank into which the profits to be earned from the
transaction will be paid. Before receiving any profit, however, the
investor must pay sufficient funds into the account to show that he is
in a position to participate in the investment - a so-called 'proof of
funds' transaction. Although the account will purportedly be interest-
bearing and under the control of the investor, fraudsters will ensure
that they have signing powers over the account to enable the funds to
be removed and normally routed quickly through several other
jurisdictions to make tracing and recovery more difficult.

Providing powerful remedies

The English courts are able to provide powerful assistance to victims,
such as orders which freeze asset and permit the search of premises,
the seizure of incriminating evidence, and the disclosure of
information (and in many cases a combination of all of these elements).
In addition, such frauds will invariably involve criminal offences and
the police in England and elsewhere now have considerable experience in
investigating these frauds, although the international nature of most
of them can cause difficulties for the police in piecing together
exactly what has happened.

Awareness heightened

Increasing awareness of advance fee and PBI frauds, particularly among
professionals responding to warnings from their professional or
regulatory bodies, has helped to reduce some of the most blatant
examples. Another improvement has been the introduction of anti-money
laundering legislation in many countries. However, it remains the case
that it is possible in some jurisdictions for corporations to be
established and call themselves banks. And the ingenuity and
imagination of sophisticated fraudsters has responded to the increasing
challenges posed to them by growing awareness and more rigorous
legislation. This type of fraud is still a real problem which continues
to claim victims.

CURRENCY SCAM INVESTIGATORS WITH A YEN FOR KNOWLEDGE

Farleigh Projects International, part of Group 4, specialises in
investigating complex, organised fraud for clients which include large
corporates and Government organisations. Managing director John Davis
and manager of investigations, Tony Ockmore - both former policemen -
talk to Peter Williams about Farleigh's role in investigating the
dollar-yen swap scam.

International fraudsters have netted at least $250m and maybe as much
as $500m over the last four or five years in the dollar-yen scam. The
victims of the fraud are rich individuals some of whom allegedly
obtained their millions in the first place through tax-evasion schemes.

The fraudster persuaded wealthy individuals to give them this 'black
money' on the promise that it would produce fantastic results and would
be 'white money'. Farleigh knows of one individual who invested $25m in
one tranche.

The fraud is simple: investors are told that their dollars will be sold
for Japanese yen and then sold back again. The promised return on this
arbitrage was fantastic - from $4m to $8m over a four-week rolling
period.

The documentation produced by the fraudsters was of a very high
standard and the names of banks and brokers used for the transactions
were reputable and legitimate. But there was no dollar-yen swap
programme - the money was simply stolen.

Dubious provenance protected fraudster

The fraudsters reckoned that many of the investors would not kick up
too much of a fuss because of the dubious nature of the origins of
their cash. Those that did protest were either given a first tranche of
a dividend or interest payment - stolen from other investors - or shown
a false statement of the profits to date. Others were dealt with more
simply - they were threatened.

Farleigh Projects now believes that this scam has been closed down, but
John Davis believes it has some important lessons for prosecuting
authorities, regulators and financial institutions. Farleigh became
involved when it was hired to trace funds and people by an Austrian
bank which was being sued by some of those defrauded. One of its
managers was corrupted by the fraudsters and over a number of years had
provided them with the banking and money transmission facilities they
needed.

This international scam started in the bank guarantee fraud in the late
1980s and moved into the dollar-yen programme as a sort of natural
progression in the early 1990s. The heat was put on the bank guarantee
fraud and they had to find a new outlet. They saw this as the perfect
follow on and in many ways they were right. The fraudsters got away
with so much for so long because different regulators and different
prosecuting authorities simply do not talk to or cooperate with each
other. Farleigh has managed to get authorities across Europe to talk to
each other, acting as a clearing house for information. It even had to
persuade three state prosecutors in different parts of Germany to pool
their knowledge.

Farleigh also believes the fraud has shown up weaknesses in UK
legislation. Money which is invested on the currency market or on other
spot markets is not regulated by the Financial Services Act. The
Securities and Investments Board is studying whether the FSA should be
extended to cover these activities.

Banks could do more

Some observers privately believe that criticism could also be levelled
at banks which still seem to welcome accounts which receive vast sums
of money from peculiar sources without asking too many questions,
although the banks would claim they have now tightened up considerably
following the introduction of money laundering regulations.

The other element that has made the fraud difficult to track down was
the way in which it was organised. Although Farleigh believes it knows
the prime mover in the fraud it was never masterminded in one place.
Instead different pockets of copy-cat frauds sprang up all over the
world - three operated separately out of Germany through Austria into
the UK, and others were based in Australia, Spain, France, Sweden and
Switzerland. Farleigh proved that they were connected because they have
traced at least one money flow between the various different
operations. Davis said: 'It is probably the most organised and biggest
fraud that I have ever come across in my life. The way it split itself
up has caused the police and the prosecutors major problems.'

Although not all of the alleged fraudsters involved are facing trial,
one person has already been sentenced to seven years by a German court,
two people are due to appear in court in the UK later this year, and
several other people have been charged in Germany and Austria - one of
whom committed suicide while in police custody.

THE FRAUD REPORT STATISTICS PAGE

The analysis of fraud in Government departments places frauds into
various categories - but in reality details are often complicated and
may cross boundaries, as this month's statistics show.

As in the previous two years, the largest category of frauds reported
in 1994-95 is travel and subsistence. These 105 cases represented for
over a quarter in volume but only 6% in value.

The second largest category involves theft of assets such as office
equipment, protective clothing and building materials. The number of
cases represent 15% of the total, while the value of the assets
represent a quarter of the total monetary loss. One case accounted for
#400,000. It involved the alleged theft of equipment due for sale or
disposal, by a staff member who is suspected of exploiting weaknesses
in receipt and stock control procedures. Collusion with outside
accomplices is suspected and investigations are continuing.

Misappropriation of cash came to #832,500, 39% of the total value of
frauds in the year. Two cases accounted for over half the loss in this
category. Enquiries are continuing in one case - value #298,000 - where
a new member of staff noticed irregularities in the accounts. The
suspect was arrested following a suspected arson attack on the office
containing the records in question. Cash books and other records were
allegedly found in the suspect's possession. A prosecution is pending.

In one case the actual loss to the public funds is estimated at
#41,000, whereas the gain to the perpetrators is believed to be between
#600,000 and #700,000. Over a number of years an embassy official
allegedly exploited currency exchange rates by manipulating the
difference between the local official market exchange rate and the
unofficial, parallel market rate, retaining the difference. The fraud
was carried out in collusion with a locally engaged accountant and the
officers are believed to have falsified embassy accounts by recording
only the lower, official exchange rate. The official is also alleged to
have been responsible for rigging local building contracts. He was due
to be charged with theft, deception and corruption but committed
suicide while on police bail.

The Treasury has warned departments to increase controls of access to
personal and sensitive data held on computer. It reports that
unauthorised staff access is on the increase.

Overall, in 38% of the cases, perpetrators were prosecuted, or were
awaiting prosecution or had been dismissed without prosecution. In a
further 22% of cases, the perpetrators were subject to internal
disciplinary action ranging from a reduction in grade through to a
formal reprimand. The lesser penalties were applied in cases such as
misuse of sick leave, official vehicle or telephones for personal
calls.

WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FRAUDSTERS?

The Government says that it takes all cases of fraud very seriously.
Set out below is what actually happened to perpetrators of fraud in
1994-95.

BY DEFINITION, A BIG PROBLEM

The rules concerning Government accounting requires departments to make
an annual return to the Treasury of all cases of suspected or proven
fraud - including attempted fraud - affecting their departments
including their agencies, within the following categories:

- Fraud perpetrated within the department by its own staff, including
the theft of assets and cases of collusion outside the department.

- Computer frauds, whether perpetrated by members of staff or members
of the public. A computer fraud is defined as one where IT equipment
has been used to manipulate computer programs or data dishonestly (for
example to alter or substitute records; to destroy or suppress records;
or to duplicate or create spurious records); or where the existence of
an IT system was a material factor in the perpetration of fraud (ie
where the fraud was unlikely to have occurred there had been no IT
system.) Departments are also asked to report any cases involving the
theft or fraudulent use of computer time and resources.

- Frauds by contractors arising in connection with contracts placed by
departments for the supply of goods and services.

- Any other frauds which reveal potentially significant system
weaknesses or exposures to loss of a nature which other departments
might face.

Data is not collected on external frauds perpetrated upon departments
by outside parties, such as tax or benefit frauds or those involving
grants or subsidies. Nor does the report include frauds occurring in
non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). Frauds in NDPBs are reported to
their sponsoring body rather than to the Treasury.

THREADNEEDLE SET FOR MAJOR EXPANSION OF OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT EUROPE

THREADNEEDLE Asset Management, the fund management subsidiary of BAT
Industries, is gearing up for a major expansion of its European
activities in 1996 and 1997. It is revamping its existing product
range, expanding its distribution network and embarking on a major
recruitment campaign that will result in the appointment of 20 business
development, client relationship and marketing executives to supplement
its existing Luxembourg operation.

At present Threadneedle's European activities are based primarily
around the Global Assets Fund (GAF), a Luxembourg-domiciled Sicav with
$500 million invested in 20 subfunds. This is distributed in Belgium,
the Netherlands and the UK, although a small amount of business also
comes from Germany.

The European venture is the first significant business outcome
following BAT's decision to consolidate the fund management operations
of Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star, its two life, pensions and investment
products subsidiaries, into a separate company in June 1994.
Threadneedle currently has around #30 billion ($45 billion) of assets
under management.

The European thrust will initially be based around a revamped GAF,
which was originally offered under the Eagle Star name. "We are
relaunching GAF in Belgium and the Netherlands during March 1996," said
Alan J Ainsworth, Threadneedle's managing director (retail). "The
relaunch will incorporate a number of significant changes. We shall
also be offering Belgian investors a new guaranteed equity Sicav."

Threadneedle currently distributes GAF through two Belgian banks,
Banque Commerciale Bruxelles and Bank Unie. It has recently signed a
third - and as yet unnamed - bank distributor. In the Netherlands it
relies primarily on independent brokers for distribution, a distinction
which will be reflected in a new pricing structure for the relaunched
umbrella fund. IFAs, together with Eagle Star, have also been used in
the UK to market the fund, although Threadneedle hopes to focus
increasingly on direct media.

The German market will be targeted later in 1996. "We have a major new
product initiative for the German market," said Ainsworth. As in the
Netherlands, Threadneedle currently relies on IFAs to distribute GAF.

Other markets earmarked for development are Spain - where Threadneedle
hopes to capitalise on its links with SAFEL, a Spanish retail
investment group in which BAT owns part of the equity - and France.

The new initiative is certainly well-timed. Global stockmarkets have
been extremely buoyant during the first few weeks of 1996, and the
omens for the rest of the year are propitious. The prospect of further
drops in interest rates and greater liquidity are expected to power
markets upwards, and this should help boost demand for the product.

In addition the relaunch is likely to benefit from the momentum
achieved during 1995. "Last year we grew the Global Assets Fund by
around $100 million," said Ainsworth."We also added three new
portfolios: a Latin American fund, a Japanese smaller companies fund
and a global bond fund."

Threadneedle has already made a number of key appointments to support
its European initiative. Robin Threadgold, previously at Fidelity, has
been made head of European Business. Tina Wilkinson joined the company
in January from Gartmore Indosuez in Paris to head European Marketing.
Another major appointment is expected in the next few weeks.

UK FUND MANAGERS CHASE RETAIL INVESTORS

THE PERIOD between January 1 and April 5, the end of the fiscal year,
is open season for new - or revamped - mutual fund product launches, as
fund managers attempt to take full advantage of the opportunities
presented by the UK's Personal Equity Plan (PEP) legislation.

This enables investors each fiscal year to shelter up to #6,000
($10,000) worth of equity and qualifying mutual fund investments from
the taxman in a "general PEP", plus an additional #3,000 in a"single
company" PEP.

This year investment companies have an additional incentive to increase
their marketing efforts. During January and February an estimated #12
billion of household savings will be seeking a new home as the first
Tax Exempt Special Savings Plans (TESSAs) mature. With interest rates
falling and the UK stockmarket generating total returns of around 20
percent in 1995, compared to around 6 percent on bank deposits, mutual
funds should be well placed to increase their share of the savings
market.

So far there has been no shortage of new product announcements. Two of
the largest players in the UK market - Perpetual and M&G - have
announced their intention of launching two new low-cost investment
trusts aimed firmly at the PEP market.

M&G is launching M&G Equity Investment Trust, a split capital
investment trust offering a number of classes of share, in February. A
unique feature of this trust is that it will be completely load free,
although at 1.25 percent the annual management fee is rather high and
this, on normal criteria, would pre-empt its sale to the non-PEP
investor.

On February 20, Perpetual will launch Perpetual Income and Growth
Investment Trust plc. Managed by Neil Woodford, whose other funds have
enjoyed outstanding performance, the trust has a lower annual
management fee (0.75 percent per annum) than M&G but imposes a 0.5
percent plus VAT charge for the PEP wrapper.

Low costs are clearly seen as an important marketing tool by many
companies. Fidelity has launched a range of four no-load funds,
including an index tracker, clearly aimed at the PEP market.

The Fidelity MoneyBuilder Index carries an annual management fee of 0.5
percent, which briefly was second to only River & Mercantile in the
low-cost tracker fund stakes. One of its rivals, Legal & General,
retaliated immediately by reducing the fees on its UK tracker to
exactly the same level.

Among other companies who have announced new product launches to cash
in on the PEP season are Schroders, whose top performing UK Growth
Investment Trust is issuing new shares, Hargreaves Landsdown (Optimum
Income & Growth Trust), Flemings and Jupiter Tyndall (Jupiter High
Income Fund).

PRIVATISATION SHARES INDEX PUBLISHED

NM ROTHSCHILD, a UK-based investment bank, and Privatisation
International, a specialist magazine, have launched a new Global Index
of Privatisation shares. This will enable investors to track in a
systematic way the performance of privatised companies on stock markets
around the world.

The index encapsulates around 175 different shares, and includes most
of the large privatisations initiated by way of initial public offer
since 1980. Denominated in US dollars and weighted by market
capitalisation, it will be added to as new privatisations occur.

Calculated back to 1990, the index shows that over the medium term
privatisation shares have significantly out-performed markets
generally.

Total privatisations in 1995 amounted to $73.2 billion, a record
according to Privatisation International, with at least 45 countries
engaged in active privatisation programmes. Total proceeds were about
15 percent higher than in 1994 and were split equally between public
offers and private sales to strategic investors.

ALL CHANGE AT M&G, PRUDENTIAL AND SCHRODERS

A NUMBER of prominent figures within the UK fund management sector have
either resigned their positions, retired or announced their impending
retirement during late December and January.

At M&G, there have been two significant departures. Tony Shearer, the
company's chief operating officer, resigned following "personality
clashes" with the managing director David Morgan. The failure to
consummate a joint venture with Hong Kong-based Dah Sing would appear
to have sealed A J Oddie's fate. His post of business development
officer has been phased out, so precipitating his departure from the
company.

With events at Dunedin still fresh in the memory there is inevitable
speculation that these departures might be followed by others. There is
also mounting concern that these departures could be symptomatic of
more wide-ranging problems at the company, which pioneered unit trusts
in the UK and is the largest provider of general PEPs.

Critics have pointed to the sharp fall-off in the company's investment
performance. There is concern that M&G is increasingly being driven by
marketing as opposed to performance criteria.

These claims are countered by assertions that recent market conditions
have not been conducive to the company's investment style, which is
value-driven and focuses on small-to-medium-sized companies. Taken on a
medium-term view M&G's is still above trend.

Prudential Portfolio Managers (PPM) is searching for a new chief
executive following the departure of Hugh Jenkins, who retired on new
year's eve. Prudential, with more than #75 billion ($110 billion) of
assets under management, is one of the largest UK fund managers.

Rodney Dennis, who currently manages PPM's UK and European operations
and chairs the company's asset allocation committee, will assume
control until a successor is found.

It could be some time before a new appointment is made."We will take
whatever time is needed to ensure that the right candidate is selected
for what is a vitally important job within the group," said a
Prudential spokesman.

Schroder's long-serving Ed Mercer, one of the pioneers of investment in
Japan, is seeking pastures new at Atlantis Investment Managers. Mercer,
who managed Schroder's Japan Smaller Companies and Japan Growth
Investment Trust, is succeeded by Andrew Ross.

WHO WILL BE NEXT IN THE UK FUND MANAGEMENT AUCTION?

There was no shortage of M&A activity in UK fund management in 1995.
Given the speculation and rumours surrounding the sector, the new year
could generate substantial further activity

THE MOST intriguing - and longest running - saga in the UK fund
management industry concerns the future of Hill Samuel following the
merger of its parent TSB Group with Lloyds Bank, which became effective
on December 28.

The long-term future of Hill Samuel, a UK-based merchant banking and
asset management group, has been a subject of debate ever since it was
acquired by TSB shortly before the stockmarket crash of 1987.

Encouraged by its new owners, Hill Samuel went on a commercial
property-lending binge at the time the market broke. Bad debts were so
large that in 1992, TSB had to establish a special loans administration
unit to manage them. More significantly, Hill Samuel's debts
compromised the profitability of TSB Group during the early 1990s.

Hill Samuel, however, has important and profitable fund management
interests. Hill Samuel Asset Management and Financial Services
currently claims to manage #28 billion ($42 billion) from its London
offices and a further #10 billion in the US, where it has two
subsidiaries. It also trying to expand in the far east. Fund management
activities contributed #21 million to group profits in 1994.

These interests dwarf Lloyds's asset management activities. Lloyds
Investment Managers, the bank's main asset management vehicle, only has
around #12 billion of funds under management.

Given the emphasis which Lloyds chief executive Sir Brian Pitman is
allegedly placing on the sale of investment products within the bank,
as well as improving earnings quality generally, both units should have
a future within the enlarged group, although it is not beyond the
bounds of possibility that the merchant banking interests will be sold
off. To all intents and purposes, Lloyds has exited from this sector of
the banking market.

Some commentators are not convinced, however. A former fund manager was
very critical about Lloyds's stewardship of Lloyds Investment Managers.
"Lloyds Investment Managers was very profitable. It had to be to remain
in the Lloyds Group," he told FI. "We were set a target ROE of 20
percent which was only achieved by squeezing costs and investment. Our
performance definitely suffered as a consequence."

For the moment both investment groups will operate as separate
entities, as will the other components of the TSB-Lloyds merger.
"Everything is in the melting pot. No decisions have yet been made
concerning the future and structure of the group," said a Lloyds
spokesman. A Hill Samuel spokesman was more cryptic. "We are constantly
getting enquiries about our future from the media. We just don't know."

At the moment all options would appear to be open. The two fund
management groups could be combined to create a large integrated group.
Alternatively, one of the units could be sold off. Given the length of
time taken to dispose of John Govett (see FI 14) and uncertainties over
the sale of Gartmore, the market for UK-based asset managers may no
longer be quite so buoyant.

In the mean time, Hill Samuel Asset Management's chief executive
Richard Bernays has decided to leave the company. He is joining Jupiter
Tyndall where he will replace Leonard Licht as vice chairman, following
the latter's retirement. Jupiter Tyndall was acquired by Commerzbank in
1995.

Bernays will be replaced by Peter Axten. Axten, who is a former Hill
Samuel employee, is currently chief executive of LIM. For the moment,
at least, it looks as if the merger option is being taken but, as
usual, time will tell.

Meanwhile there has been little progress made in resolving the future
of Gartmore, following Banque Indosuez's decision to sell its 75
percent stake in the company. The bank released a statement in January
to confirm that the sale would still go ahead and that a number of
parties were still interested in acquiring the shares. There had been
speculation that the sale could have been called off following
personnel changes at Indosuez.

It is understood, however, that a number of potential purchasers, such
as BAT, NatWest and Prudential, are no longer interested in the company
which is valued at around #370 million. Bankgesellschaft from Berlin
and NationsBank from the US are apparently still interested.
NationsBank already has what is essentially a call option on part of
Gartmore's equity.

Following the fall-out at Dunedin Fund Managers (see FI 12 and 13) Bank
of Scotland, the company's majority shareholder, is rumoured to be
ready to put its stake onto the market. An announcement is expected
shortly. Before the management defections, Dunedin was thought to be
worth around #100 million.

As usual there is no shortage of potential purchasers. All the large UK
fund managers are thought to be interested in the company. In practice,
however, it may be difficult to bring the shares to market. Despite
Standard Life owning a significant proportion of the minority shares,
as well as 34 percent of the Bank of Scotland, the investment trusts
managed by Dunedin also retain significant holdings. This could yet
constitute an effective poisonous pill.

One acquisition which has been completed was the purchase of CIN
Management (CINMan) by Friends Provident, a UK mutual life company. The
purchase will make Friends Provident the tenth-largest UK fund manager,
with total funds under management of #32 billion.

"The acquisition will take Friends Provident quantum leaps forward to
its long-term goal of becoming one of the small band of financial
services companies which will dominate the sector in the new
millennium," said its chief executive Michael Doerr.

CINMan's main business focus is the management of the UK coal
industry's pension schemes. The sale of the company to a private
institution was almost a logical consequence of the UK government's
decision to privatise the coal sector. CINMan currently has around #17
billion under management.

AGROBANKA TO BUY CREDITANSTALT INVESTMENT

AUSTRIAN bank Creditanstalt is to sell Creditanstalt Investment, its
Prague-based fund management business, to Agrobanka, a privately-owned
Czech bank.

Agrobanka has also made an offer to acquire Creditanstalt Czech
Investment Fund (CCIF), one of the two funds which Creditanstalt
established in the wake of the Czech privatisation programmes.
Agrobanka is making an offer of CK780 ($25) per share to CCIF's foreign
shareholders, which own around 14 percent of the fund.

Agrobanka's initiative is the latest in a series of changes in the
Czech fund management sector which has seen local banks assume a much
greater role. (See next month's FI for a full analysis.)

FRENCH TAX CHANGES

IN CONTRAST to other European markets, where governments are trying to
encourage long-term savings, the French government is attempting to
reverse the process. Capital gains realised throughout 1996 on the sale
of Sicav monetaires - or money market funds - will be exempted from
inclusion in newly introduced tax allowances, provided the proceeds are
invested in residential property.

Until the end of June capital gains will also be exempt from tax,
provided that a minimum of Fr3,000 ($600) of the proceeds is spent on
household appliances and electrical goods. Penalty and tax regimes on
other forms of long-term saving are also being changed to encourage
greater spending.

These measures reflect the attempts being made by the government to
reboot an ailing economy through boosting consumer spending. With
confidence low about future prospects, consumers have been reluctant to
spend. Whether the strategy works - much less results in an increase in
expenditure on French manufactured goods - remains to be seen.

TAX EXEMPTION EXTENDED

FOLLOWING an amendment to the Companies Act 1990, the range of tax
exempt investment vehicles has been extended to cover closed-end
investment companies. Although closed-end unit trusts have been
available within Dublin's International Financial Services Centre
(IFSC) since 1992, the closed-ended investment company permits for the
first time the establishment in a corporate form of certain types of
funds that are generally unsuitable for open-ended vehicles.

ITALY:  MUTUAL FUND MARKET

THE MUTUAL fund sector experienced a net inflow of funds in December
1995, according to Assogestioni, an industry trade association. This
reversed a year-long trend of net outflows.

Commentators claim that this marks a change in investor sentiment. The
prospect of falling interest rates, the recognition of real value in
the stockmarket, and the hope that things cannot get any worse are all
generating greater optimism about prospects for the new year.

At year-end, despite the launch of 103 new funds, the value of funds
under management in mutual funds was 3 percent below the figure for
December 1994. Overall, the 457 mutual funds operating within the
country closed the year with L124 billion under management.

ROBECO 1995 RESULTS

ROBECO Group benefited from a more benign market environment during
1995 to increase assets under management from $39.5 billion to $46.4
billion.

Bond markets around the world recovered from the falls sustained in
1994. This was reflected in the performance of the group's bond and
fixed-income funds, which all achieved solid gains. Rorento, the
group's tax-exempt global bond fund, achieved the best return - its
share price rising by 23.1 percent. Overall, Robeco's bond funds had
total assets under management of $11.5 billion.

Although equity market behaviour was less consistent, the Netherlands
market performed strongly, and this was reflected in the performance of
the group's equity funds. RG Hollands Bezit turned in a pre-tax
(dollar) return of 25.2 percent. Robeco and Rolinco, the group's
flagship funds, which invest on a global basis, generated total returns
of 15.7 percent and 17.3 percent respectively.

Regional funds, however, especially those with an emerging market
slant, performed poorly. Equity funds accounted for $11.2 billion of
funds under management.

had largely been discounted in advance by the markets, according to
Barings Asset Management, which manages the London-listed Barings
Emerging Europe Investment Trust.

Despite President Yeltsin's response, which has seen him replace
members of his government with hardliners, Barings is still optimistic
about the future, pointing out that this strategy may enhance the
chances of a reformist victory in the June presidential elections. As a
consequence, they remain overweight in Russian securities.

STAFF CHANGES AT CREDIS AND INTRAG

CHANGES may be afoot in the way mutual funds are distributed, following
the defection of prominent marketing executives from two of the major
banks to non-bank institutions. At present, as is the case in most
mainland European markets, distribution is almost monopolised by the
banks.

At Credis, the fund management arm of Credit Suisse, Andereas Spahni
has left to join an independent fund brokerage called AWF. Spahni
played a key role in establishing Credis as an independent business.
Prior to his departure he was working on a long-term distribution plan
for the company.

Meanwhile over at Intrag, the fund management arm of UBS, Reto Diezi
has left to join Zurich Insurance, where he is expected to establish a
mutual fund distribution company. At Intrag, Diezi had responsibilities
for strategy and marketing third-party products.

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR GERMAN FUNDS

The Third Financial Markets Promotion Law is one of a number of new
laws which are slowly transforming the Germany's financial marketplace.
Laura Covill reports

GREATER flexibility for their domestic funds industry will be the main
thrust of Germany's Third Financial Markets Promotion Law, the latest
in a series of deregulatory reforms.

Juergen Stark, state secretary in the Ministry of Finance, has promised
that the law will provide new opportunities for mutual fund companies
in Germany, especially as far as new products are concerned.
Anticipating the proposals, many German fund companies are already
working on new products which will be unveiled as soon as the
provisions become law in the spring of 1997.

In response to a long list of demands presented by the Association of
German Investment Companies (BVI), the industry's main representative
body, the finance ministry has already pledged that draft legislation
will include the following innovations.

The opportunity for German investment companies to provide custody
services to third parties. At present, German investment companies can
only offer custody services to purchasers of their funds. This can
cause problems for investors who deal with several companies who must
open - and pay fees on - several custody accounts. Some investors have
circumvented this by going to a Luxembourg-based bank, so helping to
undermine German-based business. "The German investors who went to
Luxembourg to get custody services would be able to think about coming
back," said Manfred Laux, managing director of BVI. The change would
also open a new source of earnings for the fund companies.

Greater opportunities for mutual funds to invest in liquid instruments,
especially money market funds. The range of liquid assets in which
funds can invest is still restricted to bank deposits, certificates of
deposit and certain classes of short-term paper issued by public sector
institutions. The money-market fund sector, which has grown to around
DM100 billion ($66 billion) in the 18 months since its introduction,
offers an alternative with the same high degree of liquidity and
yields.

Equal rights for closed-end funds on depreciation, so that they can
benefit from the special depreciation rates available in eastern
Germany and real-estate markets. There would also be tax advantages for
retail investors.

Approval for open-ended real estate funds to purchase shares in
property companies and thus invest more easily in non-German
real-estate markets. This would reflect a growing willingness on the
part of real estate companies to invest in the London and Netherlands
property markets, which offer relatively low currency risks and provide
better yields than the German market. This change would also allow
German mutual funds to avoid higher taxes on foreign investment through
acquiring property holdings indirectly.

Fixed-term equity funds, with guaranteed returns. One of the finance
ministry's objectives is to encourage share ownership by individuals in
Germany. Fixed-term equity funds may encourage private investors to
invest in equities as part of a retirement savings plan. Banks have
begun to market equity funds for this purpose. Commerzbank, for
example, recently launched an advertising campaign which described
equity funds as the "fourth pillar" of an optimal retirement plan
(after the state pension, company pension, and life assurance).
Investment companies contend that the idea would be more attractive if
there was a definite wind-up date and some form of guaranteed returns.

Laux points out that fixed-term bond funds were an immediate success
when they were introduced to the German market in 1985. "There appears
to be no pressing reason for the concept to be restricted to bond
funds," he said. "On the contrary, fixed equity funds would surely be
appropriate vehicles in which to attract a large number of new
investors because - given the right hedging instruments - the investor
will get at the very least his own investment back."

Approval for funds to invest in OTC options. This is a prerequisite for
fixed-term equity funds. "The indications are that OTC options will be
allowed and thus we expect limited-term equity funds to come too," Laux
said.

However, Laux is less optimistic about the prospects for a "general
licence" which would allow mutual funds to invest across the range of
derivatives. Under the current system, each type of derivative
instrument has to be approved separately.

"The existing legislation is too inflexible and sometimes
inappropriate, so that some of the more recent innovations are not
covered, thus frustrating the introduction of many interesting fund
structures," Laux said. "If new instruments have to be expressly
sanctioned by law, then there is always the possibility of a long-time
lag between their introduction and when they can by used by mutual
funds."

But Laux has been told by the finance ministry that the "general
licence" will probably not be granted until the Fourth Financial
Markets Promotion Act, which is due in about 1998. The same goes for
the BVI's final demand of approval for feeder funds. "I can't rule out
that feeder funds won't be passed until the Fourth Act, but they are
not our highest priority, he said. "I think the ministry wants to wait
for further discussion (of this) at European level. It doesn't want to
anticipate European law."

Nevertheless, Laux is not unhappy with the results achieved from his
lobbying efforts. "We know that the Finance Ministry has problems
because of a lack of qualified personnel. You can't get everything done
at once."

The BVI chief is in no doubt about Bonn's"strong political will to help
Germany become one of Europe's leading investment centres. The Finance
Ministry is going to great lengths to promote Germany as a financial
marketplace," he said.

Though German investment companies are already creating new products in
anticipation of the new legislation, delays are likely. The Third
Financial Promotion Act will also encapsulate EU directives on
securities and bank capital adequacy, and they must be implemented by
the end of the year if Germany is to avoid sanction.

Moreover, securities and capital adequacy take priority at the finance
ministry as well as with the regulators. So while the Third Act will be
passed in the autumn, the sections relating to mutual funds will
probably not reach the statute book until the spring of 1997.

FEDERATED'S OFFSHORE DRIVE

The US's eleventh-largest fund provider, Federated Investors, has
recruited a "dream team" to aggressively target international markets.
Sterett Pope reports

FEDERATED Investors of Pittsburgh has launched an ambitious global
investment strategy designed to catapult Federated to the top ranks of
US international fund investors. The firm will launch five new
international equity funds this quarter, which it will market to both
US and European investors. It will also introduce a convertible
currency product for its three off-shore money market funds, which are
primarily marketed to institutions in Europe.

The eleventh-largest US fund provider, with some $65 billion in total
assets in over 250 funds, Federated now has just under $400 million in
international assets. In the last five years, international assets have
grown from 1 percent to 5 percent at Federated, but the firm hopes that
figure will move to 20 percent by the end of the decade.

Given the recent US boom in international investing, and the imperative
of diversification, Federated sees its new global push as a necessary
step toward its goal of controlling 5 percent of the $3 trillion to $4
trillion US fund industry by the year 2000. At the end of November,
Federated had $63.8 billion in assets, or 2.3 percent of the $2.78
trillion US fund market, according to the Investment Company Institute
in Washington.

Federated now manages two international funds and a global utility
fund, but in December, Federated registered five equity funds with the
US Securities and Exchange Commission. It expects them to be approved
by February. The new funds include a European growth fund, an
Asia-Pacific growth fund, a Latin America growth fund, an emerging
markets fund and an international small company fund. The new products
will bring Federated's total global offerings to eight and its
international equity funds to six.

Last April, Federated created a new unit, Federated Global Research
Corp., in New York, under the direction of international fund pioneer
Henry Frantzen. Frantzen, 52, who brings 25 years' experience in
international fund investing to Federated, previously worked for Brown
Brothers Harriman, Oppenheimer Management and Yamaichi Capital
Management.

Frantzen began his money management career in 1971 at the $30 billion
College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF). He built CREF's international
department from scratch, increasing the fund's international assets to
$6 billion between 1978 and 1987. During that period, he achieved
annual returns of nearly 23 percent, beating the Lipper international
fund average by almost 3 percentage points.

At Federated Global, Frantzen received a mandate to recruit a "dream
team" of international managers. The idea was to create an investment
management capability that could launch and manage any and all
international funds demanded by Federated clients.

In September, the new unit began by replacing Fiduciary Trust as
adviser for Federated's International Fund, which had $196 million in
assets under management at the end of 1995. (Federated also manages an
International Income Fund with $184 million and a Global Utility Fund
with $11 million in international assets.)

In the seven months following Federated Global's launch last April,
Frantzen hired 25 staff for his New York office, including 12 portfolio
managers, several coming from CREF.

To give his new team full international flexibility, Frantzen has
organised Federated Global along lines of geographic specialisation:
for Asia and Latin America, Federated Global hired Alexandre de
Bethman, 33, away from CREF; Mark Kopinski, 39, from Twentieth Century
Mutual Funds for Asia Pacific investing; Frank Semack, 43, from Omega
Advisors for European equities; John Kowit, 50, from John Hancock
Advisors for international fixed-income securities; Tracy Stouffer from
CREF for small-mid cap international equities; and Jolanta Wysocka from
Parametric Portfolio Associates/PIMCO Advisors LP for emerging market
securities.

Given the collapse of the peso in late 1994, early 1995 might have
seemed like an inappropriate time to launch Federated Global in New
York. But nine months later, following an excellent year on the US
stock market and two lacklustre years for international equities, US
investors are looking overseas for investment opportunities, and
Frantzen believes he is launching his new line of international equity
products at just the right time.

"The general overlay for the entire investment world today is low
inflation, particularly in Latin America," Frantzen explained. "The
trend is being driven by the entry into the world market of 900 million
Indians who have become capitalists and 1.2 billion Chinese. The
opening of Russia and its extraordinary natural resources is another
factor."

Frantzen's enthusiasm is so global that he is hard-pressed to isolate
particularly promising regional investing opportunities for 1996. Latin
America looks very good, with inflation down from 428 percent in 1993
to an estimated 33 percent in 1995 and a projected 19 percent in 1996.
The regional as a whole is reaping the rewards of democratisation and
the continuing reduction of import barriers. Brazil's import tariffs
fell from 70 percent in 1989 to 14 percent in 1995, for example.

"In Latin America, we believe the markets are presenting us exactly
with a buying opportunity," Frantzen declared. He expects Latin
America's two recessionary economies, Mexico and Argentina, to recover
by 1997. He also projects regional GDP growth at over 4 percent in
1997, up from an estimated 1996 figure of 1.3 percent.

In the Asia Pacific region, Frantzen foresees a major turnaround for
Japan, which has suffered four consecutive years of falling earnings.
But he projects these to increase by 75 percent in the fiscal year
ending in March 1996, and another 50 percent in the following fiscal
year. One of the first investment decisions Frantzen made when he took
control of the Federated International Equity Fund in September was to
shift its weighting of Japanese stocks from 18 percent to 37 percent.

Following several poor years, Frantzen believes that Asian stocks are
now relatively cheaply priced. Growth and savings rates remain
extremely robust, and continuing deregulation "in almost every country"
augurs very well for the region as a whole. But Frantzen stressed
that"we have a healthy scepticism of some of the numbers you see coming
out of China, although it is certainly a big growth area". Frantzen
expects to place major investments in India, where Federated has not
placed money so far.

Frantzen is also bullish on the European Union, where he thinks falling
interest rates, relatively high unemployment and low inflation, will
drive growth in the coming phase. He appears less enthusiastic about
eastern Europe and the Russian Federation, at least in the short term,
however.

In the US, Federated will market its five new equity offerings through
its traditional client network of broker dealers and other financial
intermediaries. The company has no direct marketing arm and relies
solely on its client network for sales. The firm will pursue a similar
strategy in Europe, where it will push its international equity
products, and particularly its Latin American investment expertise, as
European institutions generally view Latin America as the strong suit
of US international managers.

While it sees equity investing, especially in the context of
defined-contribution savings plans, as the biggest long-term
opportunity in Europe, Federated will also stress its convertible
dollar money market products.

In 1987, Federated registered two dollar-denominated money funds in the
Cayman Islands, and then redomiciled them in Dublin, after it
established an office there in 1990. It has now registered three money
market funds (with $300 million in assets) and two long-term bond funds
($100 million), all dollar-denominated, in Dublin, which it sees as a
less expensive and more flexible regulated operating environment than
Luxembourg. Federated has outsourced custody and administration to Bank
of New York's Dublin operation, which has a funds servicing joint
venture with Allied Irish Bank.

This year, Federated hopes to launch a currency product, which will
convert its dollar-denominated money market funds into 22 different
currencies, with State Street Boston handling currency swaps for the
funds.

US-managed money market products are particularly attractive to large
European banks, big US custodian institutions and US multinational
corporations in Europe, given the growing demands for money market
instruments in Germany and the UK, and the lack of fully liquid
commercial paper markets in those countries. Federated now offers
institutions in Germany, for example, an additional 1.25 points of
yield over prevailing interbank rates.

Federated's convertible approach differs from that of Fidelity
Investments, which recently launched three money market funds in
Europe, denominated separately in dollars, pounds sterling and
deutschmarks. Federated believes that its approach offers far greater
flexibility in the 15 European Union markets, combined with advantages
of scale.

As in the US, Federated will rely solely on financial intermediaries
for its retail products. The firm cited the example of Fidelity, which
attempted to market its funds directly in France in 1988, and then
relaunched its funds marketing through a wholesale distribution
strategy last year.

In France, Federated is targeting large domestic banks, which still
control some 50 percent of retail funds distribution, as well as
brokers and insurance firms. In 1994, Federated began to advertise in a
range of French and international financial publications, including
Global Investor, La Tribune des Fosses, and Le Figaro.

MAGELLAN MOVES TO STATE STREET

IN LATE December, Fidelity Investments awarded State Street Boston with
a custody contract for its flagship Magellan fund, which has $53
billion in assets. State Street will replace Brown Brothers Harriman,
which had been Magellan's custodian since the fund's inception in 1963.

State Street had previously administered four small Fidelity funds with
total assets of some $4 billion. The bank's custody clients also
include Alliance Capital, Merrill Lynch, GT Capital and Invesco.

The addition of the largest US equity fund could provide State Street
with up to $10 million in additional fee revenue, where the bank
charges two basis points on assets under custody. The bank is already
the world's largest fund custodian with some $2.3 trillion in assets
under custody at the end of 1995, up 32 percent from the previous year.
(Assets under management in 1995 stood at $226 billion, up 41 percent
from 1994.) State Street reported total 1995 fee revenue of $297
million, or 73 percent of total revenues.

In late December, State Street announced the formation of a new custody
unit, which will unite all of the bank's custody operations, including
line and support areas and State Street's corporate systems and
technology group. The unit will be run by David Spina, whom State
Street promoted to president and chief operating officer in December.

MORE US FUNDS UP FOR SALE

CLAYTON DUBILIER & RICE, a New York leveraged-buyout firm, has hired
investment bank Goldman Sachs to sell Van Kampen/American Capital, an
asset management firm with $55 billion in assets under management,
including $37.8 billion in mutual funds. Analysts said the firm could
fetch up to $1 billion.

In late 1992, Clayton Dubilier bought Van Kampen Merritt of Chicago
from Xerox for $415 million, and later merged the asset manager with
American Capital Management & Research, which it bought in mid-1994
from Travelers for $430 million. The combination of the two groups,
which sell their funds only through broker-dealers, was intended to
complement Van Kampen's bond-heavy product line with American Capital's
stock funds.

But the combined assets of the two firms have lost market share,
falling from 1.52 percent of the US funds market to 1.37 percent in the
two years ending in the third quarter of 1995, according to Financial
Research Corp. in Chicago. While Van Kampen's municipal bond speciality
has lost its appeal due to the global bond correction in 1993 and more
recent expectations of US tax reform, American Capital's equity
offerings have failed to post the high returns that attract
performance-hungry US investors.

Meanwhile, star manager Michael Price has also hired Goldman Sachs for
the purpose of selling his money management firm, Heine Securities of
Short Hills New Jersey, which owns the $13 billion Mutual Series fund
group. Heine, whose accumulation of Chase Manhattan stock in early 1995
pushed the bank to merge with Chemical Banking last year, wants to sell
out so that he can"personally rattle the cages of stodgy companies",
according to sources quoted in Business Week in early January.

But Price's investment savvy is seen as Mutual Series's greatest
strength, and some investment bankers believe his fund group could
fetch $400 million if he continues to manage its assets -as much as
double the price Heine Securities might get if he leaves.

STATE STREET ENTERS BENEFITS OUTSOURCING

IN EARLY December, State Street Boston formed a joint venture with
Washington consultancy Watson Wyman Worldwide to provide "total
benefits outsourcing" to corporate clients.

The move is primarily intended to support State Street's
defined-contribution pension, or 401(k), business, by allowing the bank
to offer its pension clients additional employee services. State
Street's cross-town 401(k) rival Fidelity Investments launched an
in-house employee benefits unit early in 1995.

Whereas defined-contribution pension plans allow corporate clients to
dispense with investment risk and all pension servicing duties, "total
benefits outsourcing" allows them to dispense with health insurance
administration and other employee services. Employees and retirees of
corporations using such a service receive convenient and integrated
service through a single toll-free telephone number.

Through its new venture with Watson Wyatt, State Street hopes to
attract more corporate pension clients and fend off the competition of
insurance firms who are leveraging their mutual fund and 401(k)
operations with integrated health insurance services.

Watson Wyatt has been in the benefits outsourcing business since 1991
and now serves some 3 million employees from US firms such as Nynex,
Rockwell International and Westinghouse. The alliance will also allow
State Street to enter the benefits outsourcing business with a full
benefits technology infrastructure in place.

State Street is now the third-largest 401(k) provider in the US, after
mutual fund giants Fidelity and Vanguard Group (which together account
for some 20 percent of the entire US defined-contribution pension
market). According to Cerulli Associates in Boston, State Street
managed $28.2 billion in 401(k) assets at the end of the third quarter
of 1995, or 4.7 percent of the total market.

GIT POSTS PORTFOLIO ON INTERNET

IN WHAT may be the most detailed disclosure initiative ever by a fund
firm, GIT Investment Funds of Arlington, Virginia has begun posting the
complete portfolios of four of its equity funds on the Internet and
updating them daily.

GIT, which manages some $220 million in stock, bond and money market
funds, plans to post daily portfolios updates for its nine other
no-load funds as well. Investors who wish to follow GIT's portfolio
postings can access the firm's home page on the World Wide Web at
http://www.gitfunds.com.

At present, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires
fund companies to disclose their full portfolios only twice a year. The
agency also requires all funds to report daily changes in their net
asset value, meaning that they must already calculate the value of
their portfolios on a daily basis.

But the SEC is now considering a proposal to require money market funds
to disclose their holdings quarterly, and has asked for industry
comment on whether more frequent portfolio disclosure would help
investors. The advantages of more frequent portfolio disclosure were
highlighted in early December, when managers of Fidelity's flagship
Magellan fund were caught publicly praising securities they were in the
process of selling.

The Investment Company Institute (ICI), a funds trade group in
Washington, has opposed further disclosure on the grounds that it would
harm shareholders by adding a needless expense to fund management and
would reveal trading strategies to competitors. The ICI believes daily
disclosure would be especially burdensome for large fund families and
would hurt firms that must make big trades over a number of days to
avoid market turbulence.

Some fund executives have argued that GIT's daily disclosure policy is
relatively easy for a small firm, and serves primarily as a marketing
tool for attracting investor interest.

But GIT executive vice-president Charles Tennes responded that daily
disclosure serves the interests of his firm's shareholders by allowing
them to scrutinise the company's statements and strategies more closely
by evaluating them against its managers' market moves. Tennes also said
competitors cannot take advantage of disclosures of trades made the
previous day.

FIDELITY LAUNCHES JAPANESE FUND

FIDELITY Investments has launched its first domestic mutual fund for
Japanese investors, the Fidelity Japan Open-End Fund, making Fidelity
the first US firm to offer Japanese investors a yen-denominated
investment trust.

The fund was launched in late November, three weeks after Fidelity
received an investment trust licence from the Japanese government. It
is being marketed to Japanese institutions and individual investors by
Nomura Securities, which raised $400 million for the fund before the
initial offer period closed on December 20.

Fidelity said that over the next several years, it plans to launch a
variety of new Japanese investment trusts with different investment
objectives.

Fidelity's new investment trust will seek to achieve long-term capital
growth, using a bottom-up investment style. The fund's prospectus
requires that 65 percent of assets be invested in Japanese equities.
Fidelity named Shigeki Makino, who has managed the US-based Fidelity
Japan Fund since 1994, as the manager of the new investment trust.

Fidelity is positioning the new fund as a long-term investment vehicle
and has given it an unusual structure: the fund will be closed for the
first year, and will impose a 1 percent fee on redemptions in the
second and third years.

Fidelity is the second US firm to receive a Japanese investment trust
licence, following Morgan Stanley, which got its licence in October and
plans to launch a Japanese investment trust shortly. In addition, four
non-US foreign firms - SBC Warburg, Jardine Fleming, Schroders and
Invesco - have received licences and launched Japanese investment
trusts.

The new launches come at a time when Japanese investors are beginning
to look to foreign firms for superior investment returns, given the
relatively poor performance of domestically managed funds. But the
Japanese market presents foreign fund providers with some distribution
challenges.

Investment trusts are sold in Japan only on commission by
broker-dealers, a highly concentrated channel that forces foreign funds
to compete with the house products of distributors.

SMALL CAN BE BEAUTIFUL

Hong Kong has had a dreadful time since the boom of 1993. For one small
new investment partnership, however, falling markets have provided new
opportunities. Noel Fung reports

VALUE PARTNERS may be just a small Hong Kong-based fund management
boutique. But it beat the rest of the pack by grabbing the award for
best performing Hong Kong equity manager last year.

It managed to lose less money than its competitors in 1994, probably
the worst year experienced by the Hong Kong market since 1982.
According to Micropal, its flagship "A" fund fell by 11.9 percent
compared with the 30 percent sustained by the "average" fund manager
and the 31 percent fall experienced by the Hang Seng Index.

Value Partners has a single mission - value investing in Asia and
especially in Hong Kong. The key to its performance to date has been to
be unconventional. "We typically invest in weird and unpopular stocks
which people despise," said Cheah Cheng Hye, Value Partners's managing
director.

It considers itself an investment company which uses a distinct
bottom-up approach to identify undervalued companies rather than simply
following overall market trends.

Indeed Value Partners sees itself as something of an investment
pawnshop, soaking up stocks which sellers are desperate to dump. Shares
are sometimes disposed of almost discriminately by "top-down" and
"momentum" players desperate to exit the market at almost any price.
Value Partners will be only too happy to buy these stocks at bargain
basement prices and wait for the recovery, both in earnings and from
the recovery of stock prices.

Cheah Cheng Hye, a former financial journalist, has also been the Asia
head of research for Morgan Grenfell, the UK investment bank now owned
by Deutsche Bank. He quit the bank early in 1993 to establish a fund
management company with Yeh V-Nee, an executive director of Hsin Chong
International, a Hong Kong-listed construction company. Value Partners
was the result.

The ownership of the company is split three ways between Cheah Cheng
Hye, Yeh V-Nee and Holding Capital Group, a US-based association
comprised of businessmen, professionals and corporations, with offices
in New York and Florida.

Currently Value Partners operates with just six staff, including Cheah
and two analysts. "We rely exclusively on our own research to generate
stock selections," said Cheah. It searches for "bombed out stocks",
that is stocks where all the bad news has been fully discounted by the
market.

Investors in the "A" fund are typically US and Switzerland-based
investment professionals. The minimum investment is $100,000. To date
the fund has $32 million under management.

In addition to the "A" fund, Value Partners manages a number of
segregated portfolios for institutional investors and high net worth
individuals mainly drawn from the US.

The company's non-conformist style runs further than stockpicking,
however. Its own capital is also invested in the"A" fund. If its
clients lose, it will lose twice over. Not only will its fees - which
are performance-related - suffer. It will also lose its own capital.

JAPAN:  YEAR OF THE RAT

YATAKA NAKAI, an analyst at Daiwa Securities, is using more
unconventional criteria to predict Japanese market sentiment. He claims
that the start of the Chinese new year on February 19 is particularly
auspicious as it will usher in the Year of the Rat.

Mr Nakai has studied the links between the Japanese stock market and
the 12 animal symbols of the Chinese Zodiac. The average increase
sustained in the Nikkei Index during the Year of the Rat, which has
occurred three times since the end of World War 2, has been 54.6
percent. This tops the performance league table. The pig, rabbit, snake
and monkey years follow, with the ox right at the bottom of the heap.

TAIWAN:  TAX CHANGES

THE TAIWAN stockmarket, which performed poorly during 1995 as a result
of political worries, has been hit further by the government's decision
to reimpose capital gains tax on stocks and shares. A 14 percent tax
will be on imposed on capital gains realised by institutional, retail
and foreign investors. To encourage long-term investment, however, the
plan offers a preferential tax rate on capital gains realised on stocks
held for more than one year.

The re-introduction of capital gains tax, which was abolished in 1990,
has stunned many observers. Although the tax was first proposed by the
Ministry of Finance in January 1994, it was expected that no action
would be taken until after the presidential election in March.

FRANCE'S DISCOUNT BROKER PIONEER

Discount brokering is still something of a novelty within the French
market, but Cortal has found it profitable line of business, even
through difficult times. Jean Claude Broustra reports

THOUGH 1995 was not the most auspicious year for French fund managers,
this did not prevent Cortal, a bank, brokerage and investment house
which distributes exclusively through direct media, from making further
progress.

During the course of the year it increased funds under management by
Fr1.1 billion ($220 million) to Fr17.5 billion, as well as expanding
its customer base. At the end of 1995 it was servicing 171,000
customers, a 10 percent increase on the previous year. Of this total
136,000 were "exclusive" to Cortal. The remainder were introduced by
its business partners elsewhere within the Paribas and Compagnie
Bancaire groups, which it is part of.

Cortal's vigorous expansion over the last 18 months is mainly due to
the speed at which it has espoused discount broking, still something of
a novelty within the French market. Its discount broking service, or
"Centrale des Placements", which was introduced in mid-1994, enables
Cortal customers to buy directly any shares or bonds listed on the
Paris stock exchange. They can also purchase Sicavs (open-end funds)
managed by any French bank, insurance company or investment house.
Overall, dealing costs and commissions are substantially lower than
those offered by conventional brokers.

The remarkable success of the Centrale des Placements shows a clear
demand for this type of facility. In just a year, the volume of funds
Cortal manages through this service almost doubled and now accounts for
Fr2.6 billion in total. Of this Fr1.8 billion emanates from securities
(shares and bonds), and Fr0.8 billion from Sicavs managed by other
asset management institutions.

But the true extent of Centrale des Placements's popularity is
illustrated by the fact that it currently accounts for almost 70
percent of all new investments purchased through Cortal. 0f these the
vast majority are for stocks and shares. These account for 50 percent
of the 70 percent. The remainder come from external Sicavs.

The main reason for the success of discount brokerage is its fee and
commission structure. Unlike other bank brokerage operations such as
Credit Lyonnais (Fr63) and Societe Generale (Fr108), Centrale des
Placements doesn't impose a fixed minimum brokerage charge. Although
the minimum fee per order charged by Cortal (Fr46) is higher than that
of Societe Generale (Fr30) - though still lower than that of Credit
Lyonnais (Fr52.28) - commission rates (exclusive of tax) are
considerably less at Cortal, especially where large transactions are
involved.

Societe Generale charges a standard 1.3 percent on all transactions,
with Credit Lyonnais charging 1.22 percent for transactions below
Fr10,000, and 1.01 percent for anything above this figure. Cortal's
customers have to pay 1.15 percent on transactions up to Fr100,000,
0.75 percent on the part between Fr100,000 and Fr500,000, and only 0.1
percent on anything above this. This "sliding" fee scale was introduced
quite recently to attract big clients.

Custody fees are also lower at Cortal than at other brokerages. The
annual fixed commission per stock (including tax) is Fr38.18 at Societe
Generale, Fr33.56 at Credit Lyonnais, but only Fr15 at Cortal. Societe
Generale charges commission of just over 0.2 percent (including tax) on
the value of each portfolio held and Credit Lyonnais 0.19 percent.
Cortal only charges 0.15 percent.

In addition to the Centrale des Placements, Cortal offers its customers
a range of other investment services. These include Sicavs, managed on
its behalf by Credit du Nord, by Cardif, another Paribas subsidiary,
and by Paribas itself.

Cortal offers a range of fund money market, bond and equity Sicavs
which incorporate the entire maturity spectrum: short-term (investments
of less than two years); medium-term (between three and five years);
and long-term (more than five years).

Short-term consists of: the Compte Optimal and the Compte a Terme.
Medium-term consists of: Obligations Convertibles, France Rendement,
Mone 40, Interets Trimestries, Eurocap, France 40, Parfrance and
Objectif Monde. Long-term consists of: Cortal Pierre, Cortal
Capitalisation, Cortal Croissance Garantie and Contrat Majeur.

Among the new services which Cortal has introduced to its customers
since is Service Optimal Placements. This keeps customers informed,
through diagrams, graphs and pie charts, about the composition and
performance of their investment portfolios. The system used is known as
the "tableau de bord de l'epargne". It also provides customers with
expert personal advice, a regular assessment of the performance of
their Sicavs, and advice about establishing a personalised savings and
investment strategy of their own.

Another service called Contrat Majeur Independant Retraite, which also
dates from 1994, is targeted at members of the liberal professions and
other groups to build up a complementary tax-free retirement pension
within the framework of the Madelin law on social protection.

A third, known as the Compte a Terme Cortal, which was launched in
1995, offers guaranteed returns to investors. The return becomes
progressively higher in proportion to the size of the investment and
the length of time it is held for.

At its inception the Compte a Terme entitled the holders to a tax
allowance of Fr8,000. This has been withdrawn for 1996, but investors
still benefit from a more favourable tax regime. Nonetheless, with
interest rates beginning to fall in France, this option is less
attractive than before.

The most recent product launch was France Rendement, a Sicav that
invests exclusively in French government securities. It replaced a
similar product called Rendement Trimestriel. A major difference
between this and the new product is that Rendement Trimestriel provided
only one distribution option - a straightforward payment of dividends.
The new product allows dividends to be reinvested or capitalised.

Cortal also has operations in France and Luxembourg. Cortal Bank
Luxembourg is a subsidiary of the Cortal and Paribas Luxembourg banks.
It was established two years ago and offers a wide range of investment
products. Its main service is the Compte Optimal International. This
offers deposit accounts in a variety of currencies, and personalised
portfolio management.

Since 1992, Cortal has also had a 49 percent minority share in the
Cortal Bank Belgium. This also offers a wide range of investment and
financial services at very low prices. The majority shareholder is
Paribas.

WHY VALUE BEATS GROWTH

Fund managers seeking consistent above-average returns should adopt a
value-focused investment strategy, according to research carried out by
David Umstead of Boston International Advisors. Ian Orton reports

THE RELATIVE merits of value and growth-orientated investment styles
have generated considerable debate among both academics and
professionals. For the moment, at least, it would appear that
proponents of the value-orientated school would appear to hold the
advantage, especially in the US.

Apart from the impressionistic evidence provided by well-known value
investors such as Warren Buffet and Peter Lynch, there is also a
substantial body of statistical evidence to confirm the view that a
value strategy will outperform a growth-orientated strategy over the
medium to long term. The value-growth spread associated with the S&P
500 index, for example, has averaged 320 basis points per year over the
last 20 years.

According to David Umstead, managing director of Boston International
Advisors, similar results can be obtained in non-US markets. He has
developed a set of value and growth indices for 20 equity markets in
Europe and the Pacific Rim and tracked their performance over the
period 1974 to 1994. The system is known as the BIA Europe/Pacific
Value, Growth and Market Indexes.

The results, which he presented at the recent Global Investment
Management '95 Conference, are emphatic. "A dollar invested in the BIA
Europe/Pacific Value Index on December 31 1974 would have grown to
$24.96 by December 31 1994 - an unhedged annualised rate of return of
17.5 per year over the 20-year period. By contrast, a dollar invested
in the BIA Europe/Pacific Growth Index grew to only $11.11, an average
return of 12.8 percent. The value index outperforms the growth index by
an average of 470 basis points per year. Furthermore the spread is
quite consistent."

Examining the year-by-year performance of the two indices, Umstead
found that the value index outperformed the growth index in 16 years
out of 20 and produced lower volatility. The value index standard
deviation is 17.61 percent compared with 18.14 for the growth index.

The largest positive value-growth spread is 17.22 percentage points in
1988, and the largest negative is 7.13 points in 1980. The other years
with negative spreads occurred in 1984, 1986 and 1991. There is no
obvious pattern to the negative spread years. One occurred in a year
with phenomenal returns (1986), two in average years (1980 and 1991)
and one in a below-average year (1984).

To provide greater insight, Umstead has divided the geographical
components of his indices into three sub-groups: Europe; Japan; and
Pacific-ex-Japan. He found that the value-growth spread is quite
uncorrelated from region to region. Value-growth spreads are, however
much greater in Japan and the Pacific than in Europe.

The end value of 3.77 for Japan meant that the value half of the
Japanese market outperformed the growth half by nearly four to one. The
value half of the Japanese market delivered a return of 20.2 percent a
year over the last 20 years, compared with 12.5 percent achieved by the
growth half.

Umstead has identified five reasons why value beats growth. The first
two are consistent with rational behaviour and simply maintain that
investors may be concerned with attributes other than pre-tax risk and
return.

"1. Value stocks have an inferior tax status. Because of this, taxable
investors demand a higher return for value stocks.

2. Value stocks have an inferior comfort-level. This also leads to the
need for value stocks to offer a higher return."

The last three relate to various types of behavioural errors which stem
from the fact that value stocks tend to be from companies with weak
balance sheets and income statements. "3. This leads to pessimistic
extrapolations of future earnings and dividends which in turn leads to
pleasant earnings surprises.

4. The weak financial statements also lead to the conclusion that the
company is a bad company and therefore the stock is a bad investment.
This in turn also leads to pleasant surprises.

5. And finally this real financial record makes value stocks much more
susceptible to Monday morning quarterbacking, It is more difficult to
externalise blame if value stocks perform poorly."

But how do active investors identify value stocks? Umstead uses an
extremely straightforward approach when it comes to constructing his
indices. The key variables are the price-to-book ratio and market
capitalisation. Companies are ranked in ascending price-to-book ratio
until their combined capitalisation amounts to half of total market
capitalisation. These are value stocks. The remainder are growth
stocks. The process is repeated annually and the indices are
reconstructed accordingly.

Within the BIA Europe/Pacific Indices, countries are
capitalisation-weighted, as are the stocks within countries.

INDIA BECKONS

India is becoming increasingly popular as a destination for both direct
and portfolio investment. Dr Shanta Acharya reviews the government's
progress in making the country more investor-friendly

THE STRUCTURAL adjustment programme begun in July 1991 by the
government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao has been successful in
stimulating the scope of the private sector, as well as expanding trade
and attracting foreign investment in India.

The economic liberalisation of India was initiated partly in response
to structural problems in the economy. The Indian government faced
serious fiscal and external imbalances which had generated double-digit
inflation at the beginning of the decade. Despite significant
assistance from multilateral and bilateral agreements, foreign exchange
reserves had fallen to $1 billion - or two weeks of imports - by June
1991, pushing the country to the verge of defaulting on its external
debt obligations.

The reform programme precipitated by this crisis focused on the capital
intensity of India's historical growth process and was aimed at
curtailing its dependence on the unsustainable and unproductive
expansion of the public sector. The country's relatively high
investment rate had failed to show a matching, much less a sustainable,
growth in output and employment.

The aim of India's new economic reform agenda is to reverse this
vicious cycle by policies that will usher in a virtuous cycle of growth
through higher productivity and investment.

Over the past four years, we have seen a commendable improvement in
India's current and capital external accounts, accompanied by
structural reforms. To sustain the momentum of this process requires a
concerted effort to strengthen public finances, improve investment in
infrastructure, and encourage private investment to flow into crucial
areas of the economy.

It is also of crucial importance that the reform agenda filters down to
state government level. In the next stage of reform, fiscal prudence at
the centre needs to be complemented by individual states. In this
respect the forthcoming general election will be crucial in
consolidating the success of the government's initiatives to date. The
government's consensus-building approach in instituting economic
reforms will ensure that the liberalisation process, though slow, is
also irreversible.

Capital market reforms

Mr Narasimha Rao's Congress government started to liberalise the Indian
economy with an agenda for reform that attempted to address the
structural inefficiencies that militated against investment. This
focused on trade policies, the financial sector, taxation and public
enterprises.

This has resulted in a planned transformation of the Indian capital
market to enable it to assume an integral role in the allocation of
capital within the nation's growth plans for the future. Though
frustratingly slow, change is discernible.

Policy reforms covering the free pricing of new issues, the flotation
of Euroissues, foreign institutional investment in Indian companies,
the establishment of private sector mutual funds and the privatisation
of state-owned companies are starting to have a discernible impact on
the capital market and the investment environment.

The key issue of setting up a central depository to facilitate a smooth
transfer of the ownership of shares will have a dramatic impact on
trading when it is put in place. A high level of poor delivery,
issuance of duplicate shares and problems relating to share transfer
and registration, particularly after a stock market scam in 1992,
continues to plague the market. This limits confidence in the market
mechanism.

Long-standing troubles in India regarding stockmarket infrastructure
continue to thwart portfolio investment. This has made it difficult for
foreign direct investment to flow into the country.

It is inevitable that in this process of transformation of the economy,
there have been more losers than winners. Nonetheless, it is expected
that over the next five years, the newly elected government will be
more able to address the vital issue of infrastructural constraints to
facilitate the smooth flow of capital within the economy.

Any investment decision, however, is ultimately linked to the
risk-reward ratio that the individual investor determines for himself
or is prepared to tolerate over a stipulated period. This is partly
influenced by rational expectations within an economic framework that
enables the investor to identify the opportunity early enough to use it
advantageously. The need to distinguish between the performance of the
economy and that of the stockmarket requires a high level of
discipline.

While a long-term investment horizon is always desirable, it is
especially prudent to take into account the overall valuation of the
market when swimming in the rough seas of emerging markets. Overheated
markets are best avoided. Market fundamentals are often distorted by
short-term money flows. With the increasingly international nature of
capital flows, it is vital to understand the various cycles in the
movement of funds flowing into the real economy as distinct from the
stock markets.

Volatility can provide opportunities. In illiquid markets, active
trading may not prove to be such a winning strategy, however. For those
fund managers, asset allocation strategists and individuals interested
in investing in India, the critical task is understanding the economic
opportunity and timing one's entry into the market accordingly.

Poor stock market performance

While the fundamental resilience of the Indian economy is reflected in
a series of economic data - from industrial output growth, export
performance to corporate earnings - the stockmarket has been in the
doldrums due to a lack of liquidity.

The Bombay Stock Exchange 30 Index declined about 30.7 percent in
dollar terms in 1995 but at the current level is offering investors
good value. Valuations are reasonable at 12 times March 1996 earnings,
with EPS growth of 20 percent estimated for the year to March 1997. The
impending general election, which is expected to take place in April
1996 will continue to restrain market sentiment but will also provide
good buying opportunities for the long-term investor.

The economy has responded positively to the structural adjustment
programme but macroeconomic stresses pose fresh challenges to policy.

Real GDP growth recovered from 1 percent in 1991-92 to 4.3 percent
between 1992 and 1994, and over the next two years is expected to
maintain the 6 percent achieved last year. Industrial production, after
remaining stagnant in 1991-92, recovered to grow by a modest 2.3
percent in 1992-93 before surging by 8.5 percent in 1994-95. It is
expected to rise to around 9 percent to 10 percent over the next two
years.

Exports, having declined marginally in 1991-92, rose by 20 percent in
1993-94 and by 18 percent in 1994-95, and are also expected to sustain
this pace over the next two years. Imports were severely hit by
recession and the structural adjustment plan in 1991-92. Both impacted
adversely on industrial captilisation rates, leading to a contraction
of 18.8 percent. They recovered quickly to grow by 11.9 percent in 1992-
93 and by 6.5 percent in 1993-94, before surging by a further 21.3
percent in 1994-95. Imports continue to show a strong rising trend,
reflecting the recovery of demand in the economy and are expected to
rise by 25 percent in 1995-96.

India's current account deficit also improved substantially to a mere
0.1 percent of GDP in 1993-94 and 0.7 percent of GDP in 1994-95. The
deficit is expected to rise to 1.5 percent of GDP in 1995-96 but then
recover marginally in 1996-97.

At $4.1 billion, foreign investment (of which portfolio investment was
$3.13 billion) rose sharply, resulting in a rise in the foreign
exchange reserves to $15 billion by March 1994 and $20 billion by March
1995. The subsequent slow-down in foreign investment may have been a
blessing in disguise for India's policymakers, as management of foreign
exchange reserves was posing a serious challenge.

External competitiveness was beginning to be compromised. The rupee had
been virtually pegged at 31.37 to the dollar until mid-September 1995
when the authorities allowed it to rise to 33.7. The rupee rate
currently stands at 34.5.

The monetisation of reserves has produced a sharp expansion in the
money supply. This resulted in a growth rate of 22.2 percent between
March 1993 and March 1993. Coupled with increases in administered
prices, the inflation rate rose from a low of 7 percent in mid-1993 to
10 percent in March 1994. As a consequence the real exchange rate
appreciated. With industrial recovery in place, non-oil imports started
picking up at a faster rate, and the larger current account deficit put
downward pressure on the currency, leading to the devaluation of the
rupee.

The current trade and current account deficits do not pose any real
concern as foreign exchange reserves remain high at $17.5 billion in
December 1995 or approximately six months of imports. Money supply has
been running higher than planned for some time, however. It increased
by 17.5 percent during 1994-95 but the slow-down in foreign exchange
inflows helped in restraining subsequent growth. Money supply growth is
expected to amount to 16 percent for 1995-96.

Inflationary pressures have abated in the short term. Inflation is
unlikely to rise above the 10 percent level.

While the government is vigilant and the Reserve Bank of India has
responded by maintaining tighter liquidity conditions at present, the
inflationary battle can only be won by streamlining the financial
position of the states and the public sector enterprises. The
politically sensitive reforms required to address restrictive labour
laws, formulating bankruptcy laws etc can only be dealt with after the
elections.

Increased spending in an election year has forced the government to
issue ad hoc treasury bills to fund the budget deficit, however,
despite an agreement concluded with the central bank in September 1994
to end the government's automatic access to such a form of financing by
March 1997.

The planned phasing out would have significantly enhanced monetary
control and severed the link between the expansion of bank credit and
the budget deficit. This reversal of government policy implies that the
fiscal adjustment process will take much longer than anticipated.

Stabilisation policy

In July 1991 the prime objective of the government was to stabilise the
economy. This was achieved primarily through cuts on subsidies,
defence, capital expenditure and loans to states and public
enterprises. The government deficit was reduced from 8.4 percent of GDP
in 1990-91 to 5.7 percent of GDP in 1992-93.

Much of this progress was lost in 1993-94 as the fiscal deficit
escalated to 7.7 percent of GDP against a target of 4.7 percent, as a
result of revenue shortfalls and expenditure overruns. The gross fiscal
deficit stood at 6.6 percent of GDP in 1994-95 and is unlikely to
improve significantly over the next year.

The worse-than-expected fiscal performance could undermine the
credibility of the economic programme. Interest payments claim about
half of the central government's revenues. The financial sector
reforms, as well as the declared intention of the government to reduce
its borrowing from the central bank over the next three years, will
increase the rates of interest currently being paid on government debt,
further aggravating the situation.

While the reneging of its commitment to reduce its dependency on the
central bank for cheap credit for deficit financing during this
financial year may help in the short term, it does not inspire
confidence in the government's ability to contain its fiscal imbalance.
More importantly, it tends to crowd out private sector borrowing,
investment and the subsequent growth of the real economy. In addition,
a limited fiscal adjustment has passed the burden of economic
stabilisation onto monetary policy.

The government's ability to curb expenditure is seriously hampered by
the fact that interest payments, defence, wages and grants and loans
account for almost 70 percent of non-plan government expenditure.
Furthermore, these are mandated by the constitution.

The government's expectation of economic recovery in its last budget
seems to be paying off; the fiscal deficit will be lower than last
year's level. Lower excise duties and interest rates have resulted in
recovery in household consumption as is evident from a lower savings
ratio and healthy sales in consumer durables. A rise in imports
similarly signals a recovery in private sector investment. If, however,
equity-raising by companies continues to be thwarted by market
conditions, the tide of investment into the real economy may not gather
sufficient momentum over the medium term.

Taking into account the infrastructural constraints of the economy,
however, this may not be such a problem in the short term. Besides,
constant fundraising by companies via issuance of shares not only leads
to EPS dilution but investor fatigue as well.

Boosting private investment

The fiscal deficit continues to be the government's main challenge and
a real threat to India's economic prospects. The 1996-97 budget will be
Manmohan Singh's sixth. While continuing with the structural adjustment
process, his last budget emphasised a shift towards stimulating
investment so that economic recovery would help consolidate the
government's fiscal position.

To lower the user cost of capital, import tariffs on capital goods were
significantly reduced, corporate taxes were lowered and the excise duty
regime was reformed. The removal of barriers to private sector entry in
areas previously reserved for the public sector was also initiated,
although the progress achieved has been limited.

The irony is that what has withheld private investment is not so much
the high cost of capital but high idle capacity in sectors where
private investment could have been used, such as manufacturing.

Meanwhile in areas where there is mounting urgency to expand capacity
(this is particularly the case in relation to infrastructure), a policy
and institutional framework supportive of private investment has yet to
fully evolve. While Indian firms have raised capital through GDR
issuance and convertibles, not all the amounts raised have found their
way back into the real economy to stimulate output and employment.

As these funds get invested slowly, the recovery of the economy to the
6 percent to 7 percent GDP growth level is sustainable only as long as
policy continues to attract and stimulate investment. There is little
scope for the Finance Minister to accelerate the pace of reform until
after the election.

While the budget in February will provide an excellent forum for the
Congress to highlight its achievements since 1991, politically
sensitive policy decisions cannot be taken in an election year.

Although India's saving rate is running at around 20 percent of GDP,
the heavily regulated financial system has meant that savings have not
necessarily flown into the most productive sectors. The government has
taken steps to address this issue by reducing the extent to which
commercial banks are forced to hold government debt, rationing
subsidised credit to priority sectors
- so bringing it more in line with market rates - and relaxing controls
over banks' lending decisions.

The inflationary impact of the fiscal deficit is the key issue for the
government. Thus any savings made by the central and state governments,
together with nationalised industries, will not only help contain
fiscal imbalance but reverse the anti-investment bias of the fiscal
adjustment programme. This has produced a declining trend in public
investment since 1991-92, the year in which the programme commenced.

As a result, the generation of employment opportunities by the public
sector has not been feasible and, as mentioned earlier, the private
sector has not been investing as a result of excess capacity in
industry. Gross domestic capital formation declined from 24 percent of
GDP in 1991-92 to 20.4 percent of GDP in 1993-94.

While the annual growth rate between 1981 and 1991 was 16.3 percent per
annum, gross domestic capital formation grew at only 4 percent per
annum between 1992 and 1994. The whole question of labour reform can
only be addressed seriously when the government is in a position to
generate greater investment and employment.

Investing in India

A country's economic performance is usually judged over decades rather
than the over latest business cycle. A nation's economic strength is
gauged not only by its macroeconomic performance and the profitability
of its corporations but by the overall prosperity of its people. With
population growth at 2 percent and an annualised real growth in
national income of around 4 percent since independence, growth in
Indian per-capita income has lagged behind that of other East Asian
countries.

In the Indian context, the investment case rests on the fact that past
performance provides no true guide to future prospects. India is poised
to enter a phase of sustainable GDP growth of around 6 percent to 7
percent a year. With population growth expected to decline further from
the current 1.9 percent per annum, per capita income should rise
substantially over the next decade.

With 20 percent of the world population and the sixth-largest economy,
India cannot be ignored. Her democratic ideology, the availability of
existing legal and accounting infrastructure along with the prevalence
of English as a common language provides for a level of investor
comfort not to be found in either China or Russia, for example.

No shortage of funds

THERE IS no shortage of investment funds which provide foreign
investors with equity exposure to India. According to Micropal, there
are 37 funds which invest in India and nine which invest in the Indian
sub-continent. Within the last six months these have been joined by
another six funds. With one or two exceptions most funds are
denominated in dollars.

Indian funds have benefited from the emerging markets boom of 1993.
Prior to 1993 there were only four specialist India funds, two of which
- India Fund A and India Growth Fund Inc - were managed by Unit Trust
of India, the largest domestic investment manager owned by the Indian
government. Morgan Stanley and ANZ Bank were the other institutions
which managed India funds with the India Magnum Fund and Second India
Investment Fund respectively.

Batterymarch (Commonwealth Equity Fund), Indosuez (Himalayan Fund) and
Jardine Fleming (Jardine Fleming) offered Indian Subcontinent Regional
funds.

Most management companies with global investment management pretensions
either offer India funds or are set to offer them in the near future,
although both Fidelity Investments and Templeton are currently notable
by their absence from the listings.

The largest players currently active in the market include Advantage
Advisors (India Fund Inc.), Morgan Stanley (MS India Investment Fund,
India MagnumFund and India Investment AG (with Bank Julius Baer),
Foreign & Colonial Emerging Markets (Indian Investment Company),
Indosuez (Himalayan Fund) and Jardine Fleming (JF India Fund Inc. and
JF India).

As a result of poor Indian stockmarket performance none of the funds
has provided outstanding returns, especially over the last 12 months.
The two GT funds which concentrate on the smaller company sector have
provided the best - albeit negative - returns.

TREASURY REPORT SAYS BYE-BYE TO INSURED BICS

The U.S. Treasury's report on modernizing the financial system calls
for the elimination of deposit insurance coverage for bank investment
contracts.
    The Treasury's report says BICs are an example of how "pass-through"
insurance can create competitive inequities.
    "In recent years, banks have begun to offer a product similar to GICs
(guaranteed investment contracts), called bank investment contracts, or
BICs, which explicitly take advantage of pass-through deposit insurance as
a marketing tool," the report said.
   The report acknowledges that banks can effectively manage the greater
degree of interest rate risk from BICs through contract limitations and
hedging strategies.
    The problem remains, however, that BICs are fully insured by the
government.
    "This provides banks with a new opportunity to attract large deposits
by expanding the use of the government's guarantee," the Treasury said.
    "Meanwhile, insurance companies offering GICs totally outside of the
safety net do not have this competitive advantage," it said.
   The Treasury report also said banking organizations should be permitted
to offer BICs to pension fund managers, but without extending to them
federal deposit insurance.

U.K. REGULATOR MAY WIDEN MORTGAGE-BACKED MARKET

Britain's building societies and mortgage lenders are confident that
the Building Societies Commission will reverse its proposals for the
continued exclusion of sterling mortgage-backed securities from the list
of instruments that thrifts can hold as liquid assets.
    A favorable decision will provide considerable new support for the
mortgage-backed securities market in Britain, giving greater placement
depth to the market and increasing overall market liquidity,
securitization specialists say. The ban was originally proposed in a
consultation paper issued by the Commission, the industry regulator for
thrifts, late last year. It proposed several amendments to the Building
Societies (Liquid Assets) Regulations of 1987, which sets the assets that
building societies may hold as liquid, easily divested assets.
    Mortgage-backeds were among the securities it ruled were not suitable
to be classed as liquid holdings. It said the mortgage-backed market in
Britain was not sufficiently developed to provide "an appropriate" medium
for thrifts' liquidity management.
    The Commission determined that assets must provide maximum capital
certainty and must be fully marketable. It said this must be achieved by
the assets having daily quoted, freely available prices and should be
traded on a recognized money market or stock exchange.
    Mortgage-backed securities tend to be held by institutional investors
to maturity, resulting in relatively low levels of trading and, therefore,
limited market liquidity, specialists say. When the mortgage market was in
its early stages in the mid-1980s, it was easy to understand why the
product should not be included as a liquid asset. But the market now
totals 9.5 billion pounds ($18 billion) in outstanding issues and is
considered well established, its promoters say. The Commission has asked
its members to give their views on the liquidity issue and these responses
are now being studied. An official announcement is expected within three
months.
    The Council of Mortgage Lenders, keen to see the development of
mortgage-backed securities, has previously voiced concern over the
Commission's ruling. Council members believe that mortgage bonds should
fully qualify as liquid assets, as Class-1 securities which carry the
highest rating.
    "Given the depth, quality, trading activity and number of market
making brokers in mortgage-backed securities, there seems no reason why
they should not be treated as first-class assets," a source at one
mortgage lender said. When the Commission was reviewing last year whether
mortgage-backeds should be reclassified as Class-1 assets, thrifts and
other mortgage lenders were convinced the regulator would decide to
include the securities. A substantial amount of lobbying has been taken
place on the issue, which should result in the Commission agreeing to
overturn the proposal, specialists say.

SWISS BANK GROUP BACKS $500 MILLION MICHIGAN NOTES

Karen Pierog
Michigan last week sold $500 million of general obligation notes that
featured an unconditional standby note purchase agreement provided by a
consortium of three Swiss banks.
    The standby agreement with Union Bank of Switzerland, Swiss Bank Corp.
and Credit Suisse obligates the banks to provide funds for the principal
and interest payments on the notes in the event that money in the state's
set-aside fund for the issue are insufficient. The banks' participation in
the note issue is split into thirds.
    Susan Kish, a vice president at UBS, said that unlike a normal standby
purchase agreement, the pact between the banks and Michigan is
unconditional.
    "In a normal standby purchase agreement, there are usually conditions
that have to be satisfied before the facility can be drawn, such as no
event of default or bankruptcy," she explained. "In this agreement,
neither of those is applicable."
    Kish said the only conditions the state must meet are legal ones
involving the state's obligation to repay the banks.
    The notes were priced last week by a Prudential Securities Inc. group
to yield 4.60% to the Sept. 31, 1991 maturity. The were originally priced
to yield 4.65%, but strong investor demand for the notes enabled the
underwriters to trim the yield by five basis points.
    State officials made the decision to place a credit enhancement on the
issue about two weeks ago. The state had originally planned to sell the
note issue unenhanced last month but delayed the pricing because of a Feb.
6 state appellate court decision that called into question $450 million a
year of the state's single-business tax revenues, according to Nick
Khouri, the state's deputy treasurer.
    Khouri said when Gov. John Engler, on March 5, proposed a revenue
neutral amendment to the tax that would counter the fiscal effects of the
court ruling, the state decided to proceed with a credit-enhanced cash
flow borrowing to speed up the process.
    "We wanted to do the deal as quickly as possible at the highest
rating," he explained, adding that arbitrage considerations, which would
earn the state $25,000 a day, were also a factor in moving quickly on the
deal.
    The state also had to contend with the fact that on January 23,
Standard & Poor's Corp. placed $3.14 billion of state debt on CreditWatch
with negative implications, after the state Legislature and the Engler
administration reached an impasse over dealing with a current year budget
deficit.
    "We believe the use of this credit enhancement should negate that
impact in the market," said Wayne Workman, a senior vice president at
Tucker Anthony & R.L. Day Inc., the financial adviser on the deal.
    And the state - with a credit enhancement mechanism from the Swiss
banks that resembles a hybrid between a direct-pay letter of credit and a
standard standby purchase agreement - received the highest short-term
ratings of SP-1-plus from Standard & Poor's, MIG-1 from Moody's Investors
Service, and F-1-plus from Fitch Investors Service Inc.
    "The whole gist of the deal is that it walks and talks like a letter
of credit, but it's not," said Kevin Burke, a public finance director at
Prudential Securities Inc., the senior manager on the deal.

HOW MOODY'S ANALYZES BOND INSURANCE FIRMS

The following is excerpted from Moody's Investors Service's Global
Credit Analysis, published by IFR Books in London. In this excerpt,
Moody's describes some of its credit analysis methods for rating
individual corporate guarantors.

Organizational Structure

    A corporate financial guarantor's overall structure is an important
consideration in determining its ultimate ability and willingness to meet
policyholder obligations. As a starting point, Moody's analysts review all
of the company's operating units on a consolidated basis and examine any
intercompany reinsurance that may be in effect.
    To understand the true economic risk profile of the operation, the
company's reinsurance assumptions and cessions and the expense allocations
of individual companies are reviewed on a consolidated basis. This
analysis recognizes that most insurers have sufficient financial
flexibility to move corporate resources to individual subsidiaries, giving
them the ability to support weak units. Despite company-specific
restrictions which may be in effect, the confidence/sensitive nature of
the public debt market provides the insurer with a major incentive to make
good on claims of all its affiliated operating corporations.
    The activities of non-operating insurance units are also reviewed. For
example, the debt-to-equity ratios of holding companies or other
subsidiaries that have issued debt are examined, as are their debt service
capabilities. Potential demands under expected and stress conditions
should permit the company to meet its obligations and still allow adequate
subsidiary capital growth for business expansion. The key objective of
this analysis is to determine the insurer's true economic costs; amount
and type of affiliated reinsurance; and amount and holders of any debt.
Management has sufficient discretion within the regulatory structure to
permit the obligations or resources of affiliates to affect the insurer's
own ability to perform on policyholder obligations.
    While asset quality has primacy over other financial factors, earnings
are critical to a bond insurer's long-term creditworthiness because they
will dictate the company's ability to generate sufficient capital
internally or to maintain access to external sources of capital to meet
future needs.
    Corporate bond insurers do not generally have a standard premium
structure dictated by regulations. The starting point in analyzing the
quality of earnings is an assessment of the company's statutory accounting
compared with existing practices elsewhere in the financial markets. In
the U.S. markets, bond insurance premiums are typically priced in relation
to their value in reducing the debt issuer's total debt service cost.
Accordingly, while large up-front premiums are common in the municipal
bond insurance market, the predominance of shorter-term and amortizing
debt service in the corporate markets has meant that more premiums are
received annually. In essence, premiums represent a contractually agreed
rate multiplied by the periodic balance of principal (or debt service)
outstanding. It is not uncommon for corporate bond insurers to charge a
larger first-year premium with subsequent renewals at lower rates.

Capital Adequacy

    This key factor is best measured by relating the insurer's loss
potential to total capital (surplus plus contingency reserves). New York
State has established standards for the maximum risk-to-capital ratio;
risk is defined as aggregate policyholder limits or insured par. For most
bond insurers, this equals total debt service, or the entire amount of
debt issued. These regulations differentiate various types of underlying
insured obligations, with capital requirements varying between $300 of
risk to $1 of capital (municipal), to $100 of risk to $1 of capital
(corporate). Note, however, that from the credit analyst's point of view,
this gross measurement of risk has several major shortcomings.
    First, reported statutory risk for partial bond coverage versus 100%
coverage need not be consistent with true loss potential. This risk
measurement problem is similar to that experienced by first-loss letters
of credit or subordinated securities; although the dollar volume of the
obligation is important, it does not necessarily reflect the likely losses
on a pool of assets in the event of default.
    Second, the loss potentials of transactions, even within a particular
category defined by regulators, can vary dramatically. Third, neither
repayment sources nor temporal, geographic or originator diversification
is captured by the statutory risk measurement.
    Many other factors can vary significantly among companies and should
be considered within the unique context of a particular management
strategy, including the size of the unearned premium reserve, composition
of revenue between renewal and up-front premiums, the term of existing
insured exposures, and the quality of investment assets. Because of the
interactive nature of portfolio losses, revenue generation and the
historical position of a company, the impact of these factors frequently
can be clarified through computer simulation. Simulations are viewed as
only one of many tools necessary to assess the risk profile of a company
even when transaction quality estimates are available.
    Moody's model for corporate bond insurers incorporates historical
statutory balance sheet and income statements for an individual company,
company specific insured portfolio characteristics related to sector, and
the quality and contractual elements of reinsurance. The model can also
project a variety of outcomes depending on assumptions on key variables
such as premium rates, volume of business written, loss development and
quality, seasoning, and sector characteristics unique to the company.

FDIC INSURANCE STUDY OUT

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. released a study on bank deposit
insurance that includes sections on how the private sector might
participate in the program in the future, according to George E. French,
chief of the financial markets section in the FDIC's research department.
    "The private insurer would set the premium rate and the FDIC would
base its premium level on the private insurer's risk estimates," French
said. He added that the full premium might not be downstreamed to the
private reinsurer.
    The FDIC has met with the staff of Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., who has
proposed legislation to reform deposit insurance, French said.
    The FDIC's report does not contain an extensive discussion of state
insurance systems or moving to a purely private insurance system, French
stressed. Moreover, the technical aspects of how contracts should be
written has not begun.
    The Treasury report's suggestion for the FDIC to do a pilot project,
which would include several banks and insurance companies, was favorably
received, French said. "We've already met with members of the municipal
bond insurance industry and their ideas are very useful," he said.
    Financial guaranty industry executives interested in receiving a copy
of the report can contact French at 202-898-3929. Industry representatives
interested in participating in any pilot projects can contact FDIC
chairman L. William Seidman or W. Roger Watson, director of research.
    "We're presented with an opportunity to become a part of history by
cooperating with the U.S. government and helping form policies that will
guide the financial services industry into the 21st century," a senior
executive of a financial guaranty company said. "I think the industry may
shake its head in disbelief, years from now, if we miss this opportunity."

QUALITY, NOT QUANTITY, STRESSED BY ENHANCE UNIT

Guaranty Risk Services Inc. acted as financial adviser on about $58
million taxable and tax-exempt principal and interest last year that was
insured by Asset Guaranty Reinsurance Co., according to Kenneth C.
Sherman, GRS senior vice president in charge of originations.
    While GRS acknowledges the dollar amount is not large compared to the
amounts insured by the major monoline financial guarantors, the firm is
pleased with the high quality of the deals it did. "Given the real estate
markets, we could have done a ton of deals, but not with the same credit
quality," said a GRS spokesman.
    GRS, a subsidiary of Enhance Financial Services Group, was formed last
year to originate and underwrite deals that are subsequently insured by
Asset Guaranty. That insurance is rated triple-A by Duff & Phelps Inc.
    "The differential between unenhanced and Asset Guaranty enhanced
transactions has been roughly 200 basis points," Sherman added.
    To date, deals originated and underwritten by GRS have all been real
estate related. GRS is interested in smaller, middle-market transactions
that have a high credit quality.
    "We do not originate deals that primary insurance companies would
insure," Sherman said.
    Currently, GRS has about $60 million in deals in its underwriting
pipeline and several should appear in the market during April. GRS'
average deal size is between $3 million and $10 million.
    Most of GRS' deals have been multifamily housing transactions that
refund or restructure existing debt.
    "GRS will not accept construction, lease-up or refurbishing risks,"
Sherman stressed. Issues can be structured with these risks if an approved
third party is willing to take the risk instead of GRS, he said.
   GRS is finding its business growing at a fast pace because regional
investment banks around the nation are trying to find credit enhancers
following the pullback by banks and savings and loans in providing letters
of credit. Additionally, the government enhancement programs are moving at
a "sluggish" pace, Sherman reported.
    Not only are regional investment banks welcoming GRS, Sherman said,
but the investment community is referring deals to it.
    "Investors are doing their due diligence, and the depth and level of
GRS' underwriting has prompted some investors to send deals to us," he
explained.
    GRS' underwriting department has several criteria that must be met.
First, underwriters look at the cash flow and demand debt coverage of
greater than 1.25 times. Additionally, the loan to value ratio must not
exceed 75%. "These two criteria work together because a deal with a 90%
loan to value is not going to have 1.25 times the coverage," he said.
    Finally, GRS requires an equity contribution from the developer,
typically at least 10%, Sherman said. This equity contribution makes it
harder for a developer to walk away from any deal. GRS-approved
transactions usually have a maturity of 10 to 12 years.
    During 1990, GRS acted as financial advisor to Asset Guaranty, which
insured the following transactions:
    * $9.36 million multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for
Mankato, Minnesota. The placement agent was Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood Inc.,
and the underlying credit support was provided by the Highland Hills of
Mankato Limited Partnership Project.
    * $1.7-million industrial development revenue bonds for the
Development Authority of Cartersville, Georgia. The sole underwriter for
the transaction was Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Co. The bonds are
supported by the Nantucket Industries Inc. project and are subject to a
mandatory tender for purchase on April 1, 2001.
    * $8.9-million industrial development refunding revenue bonds for the
Illinois Development Finance Authority. Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette
Securities Corp. and Young Capital Corp. were co-underwriters. The $8.5
million tax-exempt series-A refunding bonds and $400,000 series-B revenue
bonds are supported by the Orleans-Institute Place Associates Project.
    * $6.78 million of multifamily housing revenue refunding bonds for the
North Dakota Housing Finance Agency. The deal was managed by Dain Bosworth
Inc.
     * $6.8-million Series-1 commercial development revenue refunding
bonds and $470,000 Series-2 taxable commercial development revenue
refunding bonds for the Port Authority of St. Paul, Minn. Dain Bosworth
was sole manager. Fort Road Medical/Irvine Park Towers Project provided
the underlying credit support.

FSA-BACKED PROGRAM BOOSTS AUSSIE SECURITIZATION

    An Australian special-purpose corporation that carries credit
insurance from Financial Security Assurance is planning to sell its second
and third offerings of asset-backed securities.
    The corporation, known by its acronym, SAFE - for Secured Asset
Funding Entity Ltd. - was set up last year by Bankers Trust Australia Ltd.
to offer a quicker way for issuers to securitize both mortgage and non
mortgage assets through a standardized format.
    Securities issued through SAFE are backed by FSA and the State
Government Insurance Commission of South Australia. FSA is the senior
guarantor of the pro-gram, and securities issued through it are triple-A
rated. South Australia is rated double-A-plus.
    So far, one issue has been done through SAFE - last November, a $100
million (Australian) offering by Town & Country W.A. Building Society was
backed by residential and commercial mortgages. That deal consisted of
five-year fixed bullet bonds.
    In the latest transactions, retailer David Jones is planning to
securitize credit card receivables, and the St. George Building Society is
offering mortgage-backed bonds. FSA would not confirm that either deal is
in the works.
    The Jones securitization is a resurfacing of a financing plan that
France's Societe Generale was putting together last year. Originally
planned to be launched internationally out of Hong Kong, the A$180 million
transaction will be now be issued through SAFE in the Australian domestic
market.
    A dealer group of seven banks is participating in the transaction,
with Societe Generale acting as arranger.
    St. George is pressing ahead with a mortgage-backed transaction,
totaling about A$200 million. When the SAFE concept was first announced,
it was expected that St. George and Beneficial Finance would launch issues
early in 1991. But Beneficial's plans are on hold, apparently due to loan
loss problems among affiliates in the Australian banking system.
    Sources say the new transactions will help popularize the concept of
securitization after some recent setbacks in Australia, including doubts
over a special vehicle devised by Schroders Australia Ltd., which would
have been Australia's first internationally rated vehicle for securitized
mortgages. The entity was named PUMA, for Pooled Unlisted Mortgage Assets.
Schroders initially hoped to raise A$50 million through it by the end of
1990. But the difficulties in the Australian bond market prompted
Schroders last month to cancel its plans to enter the secondary mortgage
market.

MUNICIPAL MONITOR

MOODY'S COVERS THE SECONDARY

Moody's Investors Service has begun a new publication that tracks bond
insurance activity on a weekly basis, publicly divulging, for the first
time, the par amounts of specific secondary market deals.
    Secondary market insurance data have proved elusive because financial
guarantors felt publication would give their competition an unnecessarily
frank glimpse of single-risk capacity limits.
    Complete capacity information will remain a mystery, but the data in
Perspective on Bond Insurance will help round out the industry's yearly
assumption of risk.

SHORT TAKES ON HIGH YIELDS

Rickel Home Centers filed with the U.S Bankruptcy Court in
Delaware to restructure its outstanding 13.5% senior notes through a
Chapter 11 proceeding. The proposal called for the exchange of its $126.5
million in outstanding senior notes due 2001 for $63.25 million in new
13.5% notes, roughly 84% of the reorganized company's common stock and cash
equaling approximately 7% of the original notes' principal balance. Over
two-thirds of the noteholders had agreed to the swap, company officials
said.
     The plan, which also provided for the payment of vendors
and other unsecured creditors, must now receive the approval of the
company's creditor committee and the bankruptcy court`

     Moody's Investor Service placed Spreckels Industries'
senior secured notes under review for possible upgrade. Any ratings change
would affect $70 million in 11.5% securities due 2002 which currently carry
B2 ratings. The issuer recently announced the imminent sale of its
unprofitable sugar unit to Imperial Holly for $24 million and will
concentrate on its material handling equipment business, Moody's said. The
notes were rated B+/developing by S&P.
     Separately, Spreckels rejected an unsolicited acquisition
offer from American Enterprise LLC`

     Trump Hotels & Casino Resorts Inc. will augment its real
estate portfolio with the acquisition of the Taj Mahal casino from Taj
Mahal Holding Corp. The purchase will result in the retirement of $726.4
million in outstanding Trump Taj Mahal 11.35% first mortgage bonds due in
1999 at par plus accrued interest. Bondholders will also be able to redeem
780,242 shares of Class B common stock at $0.50 per share. A debt offering
of up to $750 million would generate the funds necessary for the merger and
retirement of outstanding debt, the company said.
     In addition to the Taj Mahal casino, Trump Hotels & Casino
Resorts operates the Trump Plaza Hotel in New York and the Trump Indiana
riverboat, which is scheduled to open in Michigan in April. Trump Castle
stands as the last remaining Trump property outstanding and is widely
expected to be folded into the public company in the near future.
     Despite the combination of the various facilities within a
single corporate structure, several market players expected the fortunes of
the underlying properties would continue to drive credit perceptions.
"Investors will continue to look through to the fundamentals of each
subsidiary, so they'll still trade like separate non-recourse entities,"
said John Barnes, assistant vice president at Prudential Securities`

     Standard & Poor's withdrew Maxtor Corp.'s B corporate
rating and CCC+ rating of the company's $100 million in outstanding
subordinated debt. The moves resulted from Maxtor's ongoing discussions
with unrated Hyundai Electronics of America concerning the purchase of all
of Maxtor's outstanding stock, the rating agency said`

     The U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of Louisiana
approved the sale of Crescent City Capital Development Corp. to Mirage
Resorts. Parent company Capital Gaming International, Inc. sold its
bankrupt Louisiana subsidiary to the Mirage for $55 million plus the
assumption of $6.5 million in equipment debt`

     Moody's also assigned a B3 rating to Alvey Systems Inc.'s
first public issue. Due in 2002, the $100 million in senior subordinated
notes will be used to fund a buyout/acquisition of the company by a portion
of its current management. The notes will be subordinated to a $30 million
secured bank facility and future senior debt`

     Primeco Inc. reached an agreement to purchase fellow
equipment rental and sales company Vibroplant U.S. for approximately $67.5
million. The transaction will be funded by Primeco's credit facility as
well as an additional $10 million equity investment from shareholders
including Investcorp S.A. Primeco currently has $100 million in senior debt
outstanding carrying BB- ratings from S&P`

     Benton Oil and Gas Co. agreed to sell the bulk of its
domestic properties to Shell Offshore Inc. The Shell Oil Co. subsidiary
will purchase the stock of Benton's wholly-owned subsidiary Benton Oil and
Gas Company of Louisiana for $35.4 million.
     Benton will devote the subsequent pre-tax gain of roughly
$10 million to the development of its Venezuelan operations and de-
leveraging roughly $10 million in debt, according to company officials. The
transaction was expected to close before the end of the first quarter.

JOHN HANCOCK CONSTRUCTIVE DESPITE CREDIT CONCERNS

Flush with cash from retail investors, John Hancock
Advisers has accelerated its high yield purchasing while jockeying to guard
against declining credit fundamentals.
     Indeed, the Boston-based mutual fund has kept pace with
increased cash inflows even as senior vice president Fred Cavanaugh has
scaled back high yield holdings as a percentage of the firm's Strategic
Income Fund.
     "The technicals are in fantastic shape," said Cavanaugh,
who manages the Strategic Income fund and oversees all of John Hancock's
junk purchases. "There's a lot of interest [in high yield bonds] from
cross-over buyers from the high-quality corporate sector and we've seen a
tremendous amount of interest from retail investors."
     Faced with looming credit concerns, however, Cavanaugh has
reduced the diversified portfolio's high yield allocation to roughly 40%
from the "high to mid-40's" a year ago. Beyond some $200 million in
domestic high yield securities, the Strategic Income fund also contains
international debt, governments and preferred stock.
     John Hancock holds nearly $1 billion in high yield bonds
among its Strategic Income, High Yield and High-Grade Bond funds, the
latter of which currently holds some 15%-20% in junk bonds. All told, the
firm manages pver $16 billion in assets for retail  and private investors.
Bullish Near Term
     Despite rising default rates and the reduction of exposure
levels, John Hancock's expectations for the coming year in the high yield
market aren't especially dire. Cavanaugh remains "constructive" on credit
fundamentals for the first half of 1996 and is "more cautiously optimistic"
regarding the latter portion of the year.
     "We should see sufficient economic activity to support cash
flows, even in the cyclicals" during the first portion of the year,
Cavanaugh said.
     This view has been bolstered by the recent price increases
posted by several steel and paper issuers. "A little bit of inflation can
be good" because it indicates healthy demand and bolsters short-term
profitability, Cavanaugh said.
     Away from cyclical issues, Cavanaugh looked for each sector
of the telecommunications market including cable and paging to continue
posting strong performances as their product offerings and user markets
steadily mature.
     Despite this generally positive outlook, Cavanaugh has
taken several moderate steps to reduce credit risk by shortening high yield
maturities and turning to higher coupons.
Reining In Credit Risk
     "Higher coupons tend to temper the pricing change needed to
get a particular yield," Cavanaugh said. "But if you run into a distress
situation, [the security] will begin trading strictly on a price basis, so
it offers little or no protection" in a default scenario.
     Otherwise, the firm has gravitated toward the stronger
names and more senior paper in the cyclical sectors. Hancock hasn't pushed
credit quality above the single-B level since cross-over buying has
inflated double-B pricing and driven down yields, Cavanaugh said.
     Hancock has also rotated into overseas debt, which has
risen from roughly 30% to 40% of the Strategic Income fund. International
purchases have included some sovereign issues from Western Europe and high
yield corporates such as the UK cable offerings.
     "It's in a growth stage comparable to where we were eight
or nine years ago, and there are some fairly well-heeled investors
involved," Cavanaugh said of the set of UK cable deals.
     Meanwhile, Cavanaugh has avoided the retailing and
restaurant sectors of the domestic high yield market, where he predicted a
difficult operating environment going forward.
     "I would want to see the fourth quarter numbers,
particularly for the retailers, before I'd change my view," Cavanaugh said.
"I'm not expecting robust results out of any of them, so it could be a
sector to avoid this year."

PUERTO RICAN BANK TAPS MARKET VIA 144A OFFERING

After eyeing the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of
Puerto Rico became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated
debt last December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100
million offering of 10-year subordinated notes with a coupon of 7.625% at
99.277 to yield 7.730%, or 200 basis points over Treasuries.
     The bank's first independent bond offering carried a split
rating of BB+/Baa3 and was packaged as a Rule 144A transaction, enabling a
public-style execution of the offering without SEC registration.
     Lead Jefferies & Co. teamed with co-manager Smith Barney to
place the deal with roughly 15 insurance companies.
     The transaction closely followed the initial subordinate
offering from fellow Puerto Rican bank BanPonce Corp., which placed $125
million in BBB/Baa2 securities through lead CS First Boston. o

KCS Cues 144A Deal
     KCS Energy Inc. began marketing a $150 million Rule 144A
transaction through lead Smith Barney with pricing expected late this week.
     Rated B1 by Moody's Investor Service, the senior notes will
carry a four-year non-call period with a seven-year maturity and a $35
million equity carve-out, sources said. Pricing information was
unavailable.
     The rating reflects KCS' long-standing gas contract

litigation with the Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, Moody's said. Moreover,
the above-market contract had contributed to the KCS' steady growth in
earnings, the rating agency added.
     KCS will use roughly $120 million of the proceeds to repay
outstanding debt and an additional $25 million to repay a bridge loan from
Nomura Securities, sources said. Bqsed in Edison, N.J., KCS explores for,
develops, markets, and transports natural gas and crude oil.

CHEMICAL RAISES $2.2 BILLION FOR RIVERWOOD PURCHASE

Chemical Securities has arranged a $2.2 billion financing
for the purchase of Riverwood International by a group of investors led by
leveraged buyout firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice (CDR).
     The funds will be raised through the issuance of $650
million of debt and $1.55 billion in bank loans slated for the syndicated
market, sources said. Officials at both Riverwood and CDR couldn't be
reached by press time while Chemical declined comment.
     Currently a subsidiary of 81% shareholder Manville Corp.,
Atlanta-based Riverwood is involved in the packaging and manufacture of
packaging equipment for the beverage industry. The transaction was
originally announced in October and is expected to close by the end of the
first quarter, Manville officials said.

UPGRADE RATIOS IMPROVE, BUOYING '96 CREDIT OUTLOOK

The ratio of high yield rating upgrades relative to
downgrades improved during 1995, suggesting that credit deterioration
should remain relatively muted during the coming year.
     Standard & Poor's lowered its marks for 126 domestic
speculative grade issues totaling $93.8 billion and upgraded 142 series
worth $108.5 billion during 1995. Moody's Investor Service, meanwhile,
downgraded 123 speculative grade securities equaling $25.3 billion while
granting higher marks to 100 issues of $37.26 billion.
     The figures compared favorably with those seen at the end
of the last economic expansion and should bode well for delinquency rates
during 1996, several analysts said.
     "Further deterioration seems likely. However, the magnitude
of the losses should fall well short of the numbers seen in 1989 and 1990,"
said Moody's senior economist John Lonski. During that period, downgrades
more than doubled upgrades in dollar terms, Lonski said.
     S&P's 1995 results reversed the previous year's totals, in
which downgrades outpaced upgrades in terms of both number and dollar
volumes. Although the number of Moody's downgrades exceeded upgrades in
1995, the ratio of upgrades relative to downgrades improved on a dollar
basis and reached its highest level in 12 years. (See table, page 3.)
     "If it weren't for the retailers and the manufacturers of
non-durable consumer goods, we would have had many more upgrades than
downgrades" in 1995, Lonski said. Indeed, Moody's downgraded 70 such issues
totaling $23.6 billion while uprgrading 24 issues worth $16.4 billion last
year.
     Moreover, the dollar amount of fallen angels dropped to
$9.83 billion from $12.9 billion even though the number of issues increased
to 12 from a record-low nine in 1994, according to Moody's. The rating
agency promoted 24 issues totaling $10.8 billion from speculative to
investment grade, compared to 17 issues representing $10.8 billion in 1994.
     These high yield numbers coincided with an overall
improvement of corporate credit quality during 1995, according to S&P.
Overall, the rating agency upgraded $210 billion in industrial debt and
downgraded $118 billion. Upgrades were concentrated in automotive,
chemical, health care and high tech industries while media and
entertainment, consumer products and retailers bore the brunt of the rating
reductions.

Gradual Credit Decline?
     Despite these encouraging numbers, both agencies registered
a higher number of speculative grade downgrades for the third straight
year. Moreover, the dollar amount of S&P high yield downgrades climbed for
the fourth time since 1991.
     While these trends have more recently coincided with higher
default rates, most observers linked the increased downgrade activity to
the issuance of smaller parcels of riskier debt.
     "You have had a significant increase in single-B debt, so
that would contribute to the higher numbers," said Diane Vazza, director of
fixed-income research at S&P. Vazza added that the abundance of first-time
issuers over the past several years also contributed to the accelerated
downgrade activity.

MARKET SURVIVES TOUGH WEEK;  GROWING CALENDAR NEXT OBSTACLE

The high yield market survived yet another week largely
unscathed despite the fact that the long bond jumped from 6.04% to 6.15%
and the Dow skidded by over 100 points by Thursday's close.
     Replete with fresh insurance allocations and new inflows
from mutual fund buyers, the high yield sector welcomed its first issuance
of the year and once again weathered downturns in other capital markets and
the continuing budget standoff.
     "Most people have a lot of money to put to work right now,
so they're buying yield first and credit second," one high yield trader
said. Indeed, several dealers reportedly lightened their positions in
anticipation of rougher market conditions later month.
     Following light trading earlier in the week due to the
blizzard conditions along the entire East Coast, secondary volumes reached
moderate levels by mid-week. Aggregate high yield prices lost roughly a
quarter point on Wednesday as the 30-year bond widened to yield 6.19%
before tightening on Thursday following a slight comeback by both the stock
and Treasury markets to finish essentially unchanged for the week.
     Typical January favorites casinos and steel continued to
lead the gainers, although several market players questioned the latter
trend given recent declines in auto sales. "People bulled up [on steel]
with the price increases, but the demand for autos will determine whether
that sticks or not," one trader said.

Issuance Resumes
     The continued strength of the high yield sector relative to
other markets could be short-lived with upwards of $5 billion in issuance
expected during the coming weeks.
     Merrill Lynch priced the first deal of the year, launching
$125 million for Young Broadcasting with co-manager JP Morgan. Originally
sized at $100 million, the offering bore a 9% variable-price coupon and
comes due in January 2006.
     Further issuance failed to materialize, although deal flow
was expected to begin in earnest this week with 21 road shows totaling over
$5.2 billion reportedly underway or scheduled before the end of the month.
     "That's a lot of issuance for this market to get through,
so I wouldn't be surprised to see a correction," one high yield trader
said. "The second half of this month should be a lot tougher than the
first."
     Heavy deal flow could stretch into February and even March,
several market players said, as issuers rush to lock in the cheaper funding
afforded by low rates.
     Moreover, the rumored closing of the SEC due to the budget
impasse could spur issuers to crowd the market during the next six weeks,
several traders added.

Deals, Deals, Deals
     Salomon Brothers will burst from the blocks with a full
slate including $100 million from APS, $450 million from MFS
Communications, an $800 million multi-tranche offering from Sprint Cellular
and a $175 million transaction from Miami-based Telemundo, several sources
said.
     Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette should also post a big January
with a jumbo $1.1 billion, six-tranche offering from El Paso Electric Co.
The Texas utility will issue five series of BB-/Ba3 first mortgage bonds
and a sixth level of preferred stock to finance its reorganization
following bankruptcy, sources said. DLJ will also reportedly lead $120
million in nine-year senior subordinates from Doane Products with a five-
year non-call period.
     Merrill Lynch was expected to return with a $150 million
offering from Rogers  Communications that was originally slated for last
week but pushed back to Friday or early this week by the blizzard.
     Otherwise, the underwriter also reportedly held the books for
three Rule 144A offerings: a $115 million deal from steel producer Bar
Technology, a $200 million offering for Hollinger Publishing and $75
million from BE Aerospace.
     Hotel issuers expected before the end of the month included
Prime Hospitality with $120 million through Smith Barney, a $127 million
deal from Courtyard Marriott via Lehman Brothers and a $165 million
offering from Coast Hotel & Casino lead by Bear Stearns.
     Smith Barney also held the reins on a $100 million offering
from financial company First Nationwide, sources said.
     The issuance calendar will apparently be rounded out with a
$100 million offering from Chancellors via Bankers Trust, a $120 million
deal from Dynacare through Citicorp, $150 million from InterCel through
Morgan Stanley and $650 million in Riverwood International debt led by
Chemical Securities. (See related article, page 3.). Viking Star subsidiary
Teekay Shipping Corp. was also in line with $225 million in shipping
mortgage bonds through Goldman Sachs.

DTTI TO SPLIT ACCOUNTING AND CONSULTING INTO SEPARATE ENTITIES

DELOITTE TOUCHE Tohmatsu International looks set to split its
accounting and consulting businesses into two new, distinct legal
entities along the same lines that Arthur Andersen did in 1989.

The consulting arm will be called Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group,
while the accounting practice will be known as Deloitte & Touche. The
process will begin in 1996 and over time, it is intended that the new
structure will comprise all of the national practices around the world.

The aim is for the consulting group to be a unified global entity with
its own profit centre, owned by all of the group's consulting partners.
However, the accounting practices will continue to organise their
profit centres along national lines.

Late last year, DTTI announced that the UK and US consulting practices
were to join forces as the first stage in the creation of the new
consulting group (IAB 175). Last September, D&T's US member formally
announced the establishment of Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group, and
the UK firm will make a similar announcement in London on February 1.

A spokesman for DTTI said that "delicate ongoing" negotiations are
taking place with other European members but it could be two years or
more before those firms sign up to the global entity. Other
geographical regions are having similar talks, he said, although all of
the areas are at "different stages" of negotiation.

Both Deloitte & Touche Consulting Group and Deloitte & Touche will
continue to operate under the international administrative umbrella of
DTTI.

Serge Audouin, DTTI's head of management consultancy for Europe, said:
"Initially, this is a management integration; the financial split will
come later. This is driven by the need to globalise our practice in
line with the way clients are operating." The move depends on the
approval of the partnerships in some countries, including the US.

Meanwhile, Touche Ross, DTTI's UK member, is considering following the
lead of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young by converting to a limited
liability partnership (LLP) with its legal base in Jersey (IAB 177),
sources within the firm said.

But, since the necessary changes to Jersey law have yet to be enacted,
the firm is unwilling to make any public announcement. The sources said
Touche is hoping the prospect of seeing accounting firms set up
offshore will prompt the UK Government into changing UK law to allow
LLPs, preventing the need for a move to Jersey.

Touche is also set to change its name. The firm will be known as
Deloitte & Touche. Until now, the Deloitte name in the UK has belonged
to Coopers & Lybrand after the worldwide merger of Deloitte Haskins &
Sells and Touche Ross fell through in the UK in 1990, and the DH&S
practice was snapped up by C&L.

Originally, the Deloitte name was not to be available to Touche until
the end of 1996, but C&L agreed to an earlier date.

ACCA TO CHANGE NAME

READERS WILL recall that the UK's Chartered Association of Certified
Accountants (ACCA) sought to change its name to the Association of
Chartered Public Accountants so members could use the coveted
"chartered" title.

Well, the ACCA's best plans were partially scuttled when the Privy
Council, which oversees bodies with a royal charter, refused it
permission to use the word public. Members, however, were given the
go-ahead to use the chartered title.

The ACCA spent the Christmas holiday chewing it over and duly announced
that it is changing its name to the Association of Chartered Certified
Accountants, or ACCA for short.

Following the Privy Council's decision, the ACCA hierarchy decided that
it would be best for members to be known as Chartered Certified
Accountants, hence the new corporate name. The proposal goes to members
at the AGM in May, after which Privy Council approval will again be
sought.

Is it any wonder the public has problems distinguishing between the
various qualifications?

lexicon on January 1 when AGN International came into being.

AGN comprises CKL International, Intercontinental Accounting Associates
and a federation of firms in the US which abbreviates to CACPA. The AGN
stands for Accountants Global Network. Awfully Good Name, lads.

COOPERS & LYBRAND

PARTNERS AT Coopers & Lybrand in the UK will no doubt have taken notice
of a small ad which appeared in the Financial Times on January 8.

The ad read:"Do you have an outstanding claim against Coopers &
Lybrand? Do you have a Paramount claim against Cork Gully [C&L's former
insolvency arm]? Would you be prepared to appear in a TV documentary
about Paramount claims? If so, please send brief details initially to
Box B4181, Financial Times . . ."

It should be interesting viewing.

HONG KONG TO CONSIDER IMMUNITY FOR AUDITORS REPORTING FRAUD

A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY working party is being set up in Hong Kong to
consider a controversial government proposal to give statutory
protection to auditors who report fraud at client companies.

Formation of the working party was announced at the annual general
meeting of the Hong Kong Society of Accountants (HKSA) in December.

The group will include representatives from government, market
regulators, law enforcement agencies, the business community and other
interest groups. It will also consider the wider issue of combatting
corporate fraud.

The government first proposed giving statutory immunity to auditors who
report suspected fraud in 1994. The immunity, which would be similar to
that currently enjoyed by auditors of banks and securities houses,
would enable auditors to report their suspicions to the authorities
without fear of being sued by their clients.

Originally, the law was to have applied to both listed and non-listed
companies. But, in a progress report issued last autumn, the government
said it would narrow the scope of the legislation because of the
"highly complicated issues" involved.

According to Louis Wong, HKSA executive director and registrar, the
government has now decided that the law should apply to quoted
companies only.

Wong stressed that the new law will not put auditors under any
obligation to report fraud. "It only applies in the event that they
report it," he said.

But accountants are still worried that the immunity will create
problems for their relations with clients.

"We are concerned that an expectation might be created to seek out
fraud and that it might unfavourably affect the trust between the
client and the auditor," outgoing HKSA president Nicholas Etches told
the AGM.

A survey conducted by KPMG last year shows that fraud is a growing
problem in Hong Kong. The firm found that 80 percent of responding
companies thought the incidence of fraud would increase, compared with
70 percent a year earlier. Some 77 percent said fraud is a"serious
problem", up from 62 percent in 1994.

BKR SIGNS UP MEMBER FIRM IN TURKEY

BKR INTERNATIONAL has expanded its global coverage by signing up a
member firm in Turkey. The firm, ISIK Yeminli Mali Musavirlik, which
was previously unaffiliated, provides BKR with Turkish representation
for the first time.

ISIK, which joined the BKR network towards the end of last year, posted
fiscal 1995 revenues of TL16 billion ($270,000), an increase of just
over 52 percent on 1994.

The six-partner firm operates out of one office in Istanbul and employs
12 professionals and three support staff. Fifty-five percent of fee
income comprises audit and accountancy work, with tax contributing 30
percent and other work the remaining 15 percent.

BKR targeted Turkey because of the steady growth in its economy as well
as its growing links with the European Union. "Turkey has developed
close links with the European Union and may one day be a full member,"
said Charles Tucker, BKR's London-based secretary.

There was a growing demand among BKR's European members, particularly
in Germany, for representation in Turkey.

BKR's search for a suitable firm took 12 months, according to Tucker,
who said ISIK was selected from a short list of two. The firm was
chosen because of its size and profile, and the fact that it
has"definite expansion plans" outside Istanbul played a key role in the
final decision. It is also longer established than the other firms
which were under consideration.

Many of ISIK's clients are in the textiles, shipping and consumer
products industries. Work for multi-national clients currently accounts
for about 25 percent of its revenues. No list of clients is available.

In IAB's annual world survey last month, BKR ranked 20th with revenues
of $341 million, an increase of 10.7 percent on 1994.

NEXIA TO RECRUIT TWO MEMBER FIRMS IN SOUTH AFRICA

NEXIA INTERNATIONAL is set to recruit its first member firms in South
Africa following several months of negotiations. The group has all but
formalised arrangements with Levitt Kirson, the CKL (now known as AGN
International) member firm, and Josman & Seidel, one of three HLB
affiliates there.

The two firms, which will give Nexia coverage in Johannesburg, Durban
and Cape Town, are forming an association of independent firms with a
third member likely to be added in Port Elizabeth later this year.

The combined fee income of the firm will add about R13 million ($3.6
million) to Nexia's global revenues. Levitt Kirson's Johannesburg
operation, which has eight partners and around 45 staff, had 1995
revenues of roughly R6 million, according to managing partner Lennie
Furman, while the firm's Durban office, which has two partners and
around 12 staff, had revenues of between R1.5 million and R1.8 million.
The two are separate profit centres.

Josman & Seidel, meanwhile, has revenues of roughly R5.5 million. The
firm has eight partners and a total staff of around 50.

Each of the firms will use the Nexia name in conjunction with their own
- the first time that Nexia has allowed its affiliates to use its name.
Previously, the Amsterdam-based group prohibited the use of its title
so as to shield the network from any possible litigation.

Nigel Hodges, Nexia's executive director, said the change of heart
followed legal advice. "We have taken legal advice both from the US and
the UK and the lawyers said there would be very little extra exposure
by having a link name used by members," he explained. "We just have to
make it clear that we are an international firm of separate independent
accountants."

Nexia's board of directors will meet in South Africa on March 10 and 11
to rubberstamp the use of the Nexia name, and to formally approve both
firms' applications.

Initially, the local firms will operate independently of each other.
According to Furman, the firms will have a common staff training
policy, undertake joint marketing campaigns and tender jointly for
certain work.

Furman cited dissatisfaction with CKL as its reason for quitting. "We
were unhappy with the CKL situation," he said. AGN, into which CKL has
merged, has "still got a long way to go to reach the size of Nexia", he
added.

Nick Blake, AGN's chief executive, said he was "disappointed" at the
news of Levitt Kirson's departure although it was not "totally
unexpected". He has arranged a meeting on January 18 with an
unaffiliated firm in Cape Town in the hope that it may fill the gap.

Sonny Josman, Josman & Seidel's managing partner, said the local firms
may eventually merge."I would think we will make a decision on that
within the next three years," he said. According to Josman, the
federation may expand into Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe if suitable
firms can be found.

HLB's chief executive, Peter Frost, said incompatibilities between
Josman & Seidel and its Johannesburg member, Freedman Scher, resulted
in the split of its federation.

In addition to losing Josman & Seidel, Alleson & Company, HLB's Durban
affiliate, has also given notice to quit. Frost said replacements in
Cape Town and Durban have already been lined up, although he declined
to name them. He was planning to meet with at least one of the
prospective firms on January 15 in Johannesburg.

Nexia has never had a presence in South Africa, although one of its
predecessors, Spicer & Oppenheim, was represented by Fischer Hoffman
Stride until 1990 when the local firm switched to Pannell Kerr Forster.

US BILL ELIMINATING FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS IS PASSED

THE PRIVATE Securities Litigation Reform Act, which among other things
will eliminate frivolous lawsuits against accounting firms, has been
passed into law despite being vetoed by President Clinton.

The passing of the bill has been welcomed by the US accounting
profession. Ernst & Young chairman Philip Laskawy said: "Frivolous
lawsuits in the past have drained resources from economic activities
such as research and development and new investment that fuel business
growth. Those with legitimate securities claims still have recourse
through our legal system. By eliminating meritless lawsuits, the new
bill will make the American economy more productive and efficient."

A statement from the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants
said: "The passage of this legislation is testament to the widely-held
belief that the tide of frivolous securities litigation in this country
must be stopped and sanity restored to a legal system clearly out of
balance.

"This bill is a fair balance between the rights of truly- defrauded
investors and those start-up companies and outside professionals who
have become victims of a small group of entrepreneurial lawyers abusing
the legal system."

The bill had been awaiting the signature of the US President when IAB
went to press with the final issue of last year (IAB 177), and
proponents of the reforms were confident that Clinton would sign it
into law.

However, he chose to veto the legislation under enormous pressure from
consumer groups and trial lawyers.

In the end, the veto was too late as both houses of Congress were able
to override his decision. The House of Representatives had backed the
bill by 309 votes to 100 - 29 votes more than needed for the override.
The Senate vote, 68 votes to 30 in favour, eventually proved sufficient
to override the president's decision having originally fallen just
short of the total required.

The new law is designed to eliminate routine filing of class action
lawsuits against public companies with no more evidence than a sharp
drop in stock price. It will also prevent the targeting of defendants
with"deep pockets", without regard to their culpability.

The legislation provides a new safe harbour provision for
forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide
prospective information without fear of litigation so long as those
statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by
meaningful cautionary statements identifying factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected.

KPMG STOKES KENNEDY CROWLEY DROPS LOCAL NAMES

KPMG STOKES Kennedy Crowley, Ireland's largest accounting firm, has
altered its identity by dropping the local names from its title.

The change, which took effect on January 1, is part of a worldwide move
by KPMG members to standardise the group's identity. In February of
last year, KPMG's UK affiliate dropped the Peat Marwick name from its
logo (IAB 157).

"Our new name will provide us with a single strong identity worldwide
and help us to assist our clients to compete even more effectively in
both the Irish market and overseas," said managing partner Jerome
Kennedy.

The SKC partnership was founded in 1972, although the firm's roots can
be traced back to 1876 when Stokes Brothers was formed. It became the
Irish member of Peat Marwick International in 1980, and became the
Irish representative of KPMG in 1987 following the global merger with
KMG.

SKC operates as one partnership in Ireland, unlike most of its Big Six
rivals which have separate entities north and south. The firm operates
out of four offices, employs over 800 people, and had fiscal 1995
revenues of IR#36.2 million ($58 million), a drop of just over 1
percent on the previous year.

KPMG's move means that Craig Gardner Price Waterhouse is the only one
of the Big Six in Ireland to retain the local firm's name as part of
its identity.

AGN INTERNATIONAL SELECTS FIRST BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AGN INTERNATIONAL, the new network formed on January 1 from the merger
of CKL International with Intercontinental Accounting Associates, has
appointed a ten-man board of directors, five from each group.

Six of the board members are based in Europe, three in North America
and one in South America. The CKL members are: France's Guillaume de
Saint-Gerand, CKL's last chairman; London-based Leon Nahon; Peter Grote
from Switzerland; German Rainer Schmidt; and Julio Pilon, who is based
in Uruguay.

The IAA contingent comprises: Louis Philips from France; Thomas
Harbrecht, IAA's last president, Raymond Falconetti and Gary Seehoff
all of the US; and Steven Jeffcott from the UK.

CKL's Nick Blake fills the position of chief executive and continues to
be based in CKL's headquarters in London, but no chairman has yet been
chosen. Blake said a decision is unlikely until the board holds its
first full meeting in mid-March in Miami.

DUTCH MEMBER'S LEAD PARTNER MADE ACPA EURO CHAIRMAN

ACPA INTERNATIONAL has appointed a new European chairman. Wiendelt de
Lange, managing partner of ACPA's Dutch member, Eshuis Groep, took on
the role of chairman on January 1. His term of office will last for two
and a half years.

De Lange's aims for his term include increasing the network's coverage
in continental Europe and Africa, which is currently linked to the
firm's European region. Africa will be split into a separate region
when the number of members there is increased.

In Europe, ACPA hopes to extend its coverage into northern Italy,
France and Germany. It is also looking for new members in Norway,
Finland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

De Lange replaced Daniel Faura, managing partner of ACPA's Spanish
member, Faura Casas. Faura served as chairman for around 18 months.
According to de Lange, Faura's term was cut short because of his
obligations to the Spanish firm. Faura Casas recently formed an
alliance with Audiberia, the Summit International member, in a bid to
maximise services throughout Spain.

ACPA's European secretariat has been based in the offices of Eshuis
Groep since September 1994, following a decade of being located in
London. "Among other reasons, this makes it easier to develop eastern
Europe," de Lange said. ACPA has 29 members in 15 European countries,
while fee income for the region totals more than $50 million.

PW HUNGARY CREATES SEPARATE LEGAL ENTITY FOR REAL ESTATE UNIT

PRICE WATERHOUSE in Hungary has spun off its real estate division into
a separate legal entity. The company, Real Partners, was set up on
January 1 following a year of negotiation.

PW holds a 60 percent stake in the company while the other 40 percent
is held by Karoly Flaskay, a local real estate specialist. Profits,
however, will be divided on an equal basis. No predicted fee income for
the new unit has been released.

Real Partners, set up as a limited liability company, resulted from a
need to create an independent unit to cope with demand. "Demand for
asset valuation and real estate was continuous although fluctuating,"
said Andrew Terner, PW's head of corporate finance and co-managing
director of Real Partners. "It is an important area in a market which
is asset rich and cash poor," he added.

The company already has an established list of clients. Some were
clients of PW's real estate division, while others were clients of
Flaskay.

The services provided by the company include evaluation of real estate,
real estate development projects and brokerage services such as
searching for investors. Real Partners' only office is based in
Budapest, where Flaskay is backed up by five professional staff and one
administrator.

FEELING AT HOME

It's been a hard five years, but western accounting firms are starting
to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reports

IT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, and
only now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients to
western fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with the
local Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.

Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to do
business. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keeping
control of that growth and turning it into profits is a different
matter.

Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,
the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, with
fiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking even
currently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according to
managing partner Duleep Aluwihare.

"We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some of
our more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage to
continue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,
we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run out
of investment opportunities."

Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one of
the few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although it
plans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice or
Cracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In order
to set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going to
maintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve in
this marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.

This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,
but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticket
items," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basic
work, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.

Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,
Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clients
include Poland's Finance Ministry.

Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.
Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrand
and Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived in
Poland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess when
the firm should start making a profit.

Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking to IAB last July before
returning to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're
not just here for a financial return on investment, we're here to make
sure that Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."

C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking at
opening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.

Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of the
market, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,
Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firm
has acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bank
and of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successes
include the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which
raised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing group
Okocim.

PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgeted
to start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,
the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After five
years in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-national
company investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growth
is running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.

PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where the
firm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clients
include Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.
One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatised
Bank Gdanski.

Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some time
are KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.

"We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner Bill
Drysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where we
are largely self-sufficient."

Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at Barents
Group, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of new
clients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firm
recently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run its
German practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have a
fully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said.
"Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."

KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics group
Siemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polish
clients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,
Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurance
companies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices in
Cracow and Poznan during the last year.

At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits gets
short shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm has
always been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financial
support from outside, other than very small amounts. All the other
firms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they have
X amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.
They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."

In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440
employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of its
rivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw and
Szczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is a
headache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line.

"Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It's
difficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated into
a corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standards
right way."

E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as much
business as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when it
hired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &
Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.

Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T.
"These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speak
only with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Often
you'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,
all the rest will follow."

The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in the
Polish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is the
smallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strong
position in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firm
took action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz as
head of the Polish business (IAB 151). Leslaw Paga was head of the
Polish Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.

Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is sure
that Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitely
enhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said.
"There've been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."

Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its position
in Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industries
and service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong position
in financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say we
were latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"
he explained.

Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bank
and of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's
64-percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in the
banking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3
million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.

D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk and
Cracow during 1995.

Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.
Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four other
mid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co-ordinating
partner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "the
sort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging with
another firm.

He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name the
prospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to another
network. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we are
looking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with a
heavy UK or English language capability," he said.

Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switched
international affiliations from CKL International to Alliott Peirson
International during 1995 (IAB 171). Baltic Accountants continues to
also represent RSM International and GMN International.

The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issue
for many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firms
like to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to local
clients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing in
Polish equity partners than others.

Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firm
holding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and US
affiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has been
given the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, while
KPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or
"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.

According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managed
firm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly owned by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent from
the start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the local
practices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."

Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agree
that fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gap
between what western firms are charging and what local clients are
willing to pay is narrowing.

One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment must
pay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet the
market half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper local
firms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it first
arrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.
Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in
"strategic situations".

Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of a
western-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came into
effect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accounting
procedures more into line with International Accounting Standards and
to move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on tax
compliance.

Another area where western accountants are making more encouraging
noises is in relations between the international firms and the local
Chamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when the
chamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.
Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted to
the chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners that
Poland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shutting
new blood out of the profession.

Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences being
mended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciak
said. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of course
there will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.
Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bit
frightening to them."

While the situation regarding audit training and exams remains
unacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamber
will rethink its approach.

Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous in
admitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems to
have gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably be
reviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said.
"And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."

After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all part
of the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make sure
the chamber is a strong and active body."

Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and that
the growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feels
that this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We all
experience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."

CAPTURING THE '90S SPIRIT

Spencer Lanthier, KPMG Canada's chairman and chief executive since
1993, talks to Gundi Jeffrey about the firm's increasing emphasis on
consulting services, as well as the shift to a new corporate culture
that better reflects the spirit of the 1990s

AFTER SEVERAL years of flat and even declining revenues, KPMG in Canada
is poised to regain healthier growth. Much of this is due to a wide
range of new service initiatives - mostly consulting-based - aimed at
meeting the needs of an increasingly- sophisticated and demanding
marketplace.

Spencer Lanthier, 55, has been with the firm since 1960, becoming a
partner in 1972, managing partner of the Toronto office in 1984 and
vice-chairman of the Greater Toronto region and deputy chairman of the
partnership board in 1989. He has also served on various committees of
the Quebec and Ontario institutes and, in 1993, was a member of the
Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants' corporate governance task
force. He took on his present role with KPMG in 1993.

IAB: Your revenues in the year to February 1995 were stagnant, but
KPMG's worldwide results were up by more than 13 percent in fiscal
1995. What do you expect your fiscal 1996 results to be like?

Lanthier: We expect our fiscal 1996 top-line to be up about 5 percent.
This is after four years of flat or negative growth, which has been
consistent throughout our business in Canada.

The reasons for this low growth relate to some major shifts in the
market for our services. Regulatory changes to audit requirements
continue to hit all the big firms. Two years ago, for example, the
Canada Business Corporations Act removed the requirement for
privately-owned companies to have audits. And more recently, the
Ontario Government eliminated the audit requirement for companies with
revenues of less than C$100 million ($73.66 million).

Another issue is the high degree of corporate consolidation that has
taken place in Canada. For example, in 1994, one of our major clients,
Rogers Communications, took over the publishing company Maclean Hunter.
I can assure you that the fees for the combined company are a lot less
than what they were separately.

So all in all, the market for large-corporation audit services has
shrunk substantially and continues to decline. In that context, we're
quite pleased with the growth of 5 percent in Canada this year.

A lot of the growth internationally is coming from emerging markets
such as eastern Europe and the Far East. But, in some of the more
mature economies, the growth hasn't been that significant.

IAB: The international firm has started reporting total billings to
clients rather than net revenues. Will Canada follow suit?

Lanthier: Internationally, our firm - and other firms also - is now
reporting our total billings per client. We've moved in that direction
because we believe it more closely reflects the way we do business.

For many years, the majority of our billings were based on the time we
spent on the job. But now, we have more alliances and co-venture
arrangements. Often, we act as prime contractor in projects that
involve various sub-contractors. In the past, we would have treated our
sub-contractors' billings as expense reimbursement and deducted them
from total billings to report our net fee income. We've concluded that
it makes more sense to reflect our total sub-contractors billings as
revenues. In summary, like most other major businesses, KPMG's revenues
simply reflect our total worldwide invoices to clients.

In Canada, however, we'll continue to report on a net fee income basis
for the time being. The reason for this is that the Canadian firms have
agreed for many years on a set of precise guidelines for reporting
income to ensure compatibility.

IAB: KPMG Canada has launched quite a few initiatives and service areas
over the past year. Can you tell me about them and what you are hoping
to achieve with them?

Lanthier: The first is KPMG Investigation and Security Inc. This new
group, headed by the former Royal Canadian Mounted Police Commissioner
and past Interpol president Norman Inkster, offers a full range of
impartial investigative services to businesses in Canada and around the
globe (IAB 176). KPMG ISI assists companies in cases where traditional
policing agencies are no longer able to help.

It's really an extension of the forensic accounting division. We're
continuing to offer traditional forensic accounting services, but we're
also expanding into the corporate security field. We did this because
we knew that most [Canadian] police forces have been forced by cutbacks
to place white collar crime very low on their list of priorities.

Not only do we investigate white collar crime, but we also look at the
whole security arrangements companies have in place, not just the
traditional internal controls. For example, are they protecting their
executives adequately? Are their facilities secure? In the wake of last
year's Oklahoma bombing, we received several inquiries from clients
interested in reviewing their security.

Also, as Canadian companies expand offshore, there is a need for them
to review the viability and integrity of potential joint venture
partners. We can help in this area.

We've been delighted with the results of this division already and
we've hired, at last count, six more former police officers.

Another success story is our ISO 9000 practice, launched in early 1995
in six centres across the country. KPMG Quality Registrar is one of
only 12 accredited ISO 9000 registrars in Canada. And so far, we are
the only Big Six firm that has obtained this accreditation.

We have two major services. First we certify that clients have
processes that comply with ISO standards. Then there is an annual
compliance report, that ensures they continue to be in compliance.

This work is really a natural extension of our audit services and we've
been very successful with it in Canada. In the first full year, our
fees were about C$2 million.

Next, very recently, we established a strategic alliance with MD
Management, the financial services subsidiary of the Canadian Medical
Association. This will allow KPMG to provide physicians and their
families with accounting, tax and business advice. We were the only
national accounting firm to participate in this alliance.

KPMG's benchmarking initiative was launched in 1995, with the firm's
first national benchmark study of the corporate finance function. This
study examines the role of the finance department in large companies -
those with revenues of more than C$150 million - and middle-market
companies, with revenues of C$15 million to C$150 million, in the
manufacturing, retail and distribution sectors.

By focusing on performance measures such as cost, productivity and
quality in finance, the study aims to help our clients better gauge
their relative performance and identify opportunities for improvement.

KPMG's new Centre for Risk Assessment and Control Design was
established to help organisations develop and implement cost-effective
control and risk management systems, and to exchange best practices,
particularly in the area of control and risk assessment.

In February 1995, we rolled out our forest management practice, and it
has grown steadily. Three provinces, Ontario, British Columbia and
Alberta, have in recent years passed new forestry legislation requiring
companies to comply with cutting standards, reforestation, and so on.
We help them ensure that they have the processes in place to comply
with the regulation and help them with their reporting to the
regulatory authorities. It's not a huge practice yet, but one where
there is a real client need that we're trying to meet.

We also have a rapidly-growing SAP and Baan implementation practice.
SAP has really taken off in the industrialised world and has become the
dominant software standard and dominant software platform for financial
management systems. We, together with others, are registered suppliers
and implementers of SAP. Baan is something similar.

I believe our Aboriginal services practice has also been a big success.
More than 20 offices provide a range of financial and management
consulting services to Aboriginal communities across Canada. With
continuing progress in land claim settlements, Aboriginal people are
becoming a major economic force in Canada, so the growth potential for
this service area is significant.

IAB: I understand that KPMG has developed something called"Project
Globe", which has identified 14 service areas for growth. What does
that mean for the Canadian firm?

Lanthier: Project Globe is a framework that gives our consulting
practices around the world a common set of priorities. We adopted it a
year or so ago and it involves our focusing on three broad areas of
service.

The first is enabling technologies, which include services such as
information technology strategy and systems implementation. The
performance improvement area includes human resources and quality
management services, among others. Strategic financial management
includes capital transactions, treasury management and similar
financial consulting services.

IAB: Now to an old favourite that won't go away: professional
liability. What is KPMG doing in terms of risk management strategy to
dampen the threat of legal action?

Lanthier: The number of lawsuits against accounting firms in Canada has
dropped over the past five years. Whether that's a result of improved
risk management or a result of a better economy is hard to say. Most of
the big lawsuits that we've seen in Canada happened as a result of the
real estate melt-down of five or six years ago. They had nothing to do
with audit failure. Since the real estate markets have stabilised,
there haven't been any other major lawsuits coming forward.

We have three simple rules for risk management: be careful about who we
work for; be careful about what we do for them and be careful about
whom we assign to do the work. I think we all pay closer attention to
those rules than we did a few years ago. IAB: What do you see as KPMG
Canada's biggest challenge in the next few years?

Lanthier: I am focusing on two major areas. We have to grow our top
line. You have to grow to be successful in our country. We're obviously
the largest firm, with the largest market share, which makes it more
difficult to grow.

That brings up the question of our core services. The audit is a
declining market. So is tax compliance.

More and more taxpayers are buying tax preparation software for C$100
or so, rather than coming to us. In the future, they could be
downloading tax software from the Internet for free.

However, the total market for consulting services is expanding rapidly.
That's why we've put a big emphasis on developing new,
consulting-oriented services at a fairly rapid rate.

Our second challenge is human resources - our people. Twenty-five years
ago, firms like ours were the employer of choice for a lot of the
people going through business schools and other faculties. But
recently, we've become a less attractive option. Some of our human
resource policies, cultures and practices simply aren't up to date. We
recognise that.

To that end, in June, we brought on board a human resources change
management person at a very senior level. John Ellsworth brings years
of global HR experience, having worked in general management consulting
and with major corporations.

John joined KPMG as a senior partner and a member of our management
committee. He is working closely with me and other people in the firm
to help us change our culture. We want to ensure that we can attract
the best people, that we reward based on competence and not just on
seniority. In the past, we have operated as a rather militaristic
hierarchy. We are determined to break down some of the barriers that
have existed, to move people forward, allow them to progress when they
are ready.

It will take a long time for us to change and upgrade and get away from
the sweatshop mentality that has dominated the accounting profession in
the past. You don't change a culture that's been ingrained for 75 years
over six months or a year, but we're determined to make progress.

These are my two priorities - to change our culture over the next few
years and to grow our top line. The two go hand in hand. If you have
the best people, you'll grow.

DAILY NEW YORK ANALYSIS

The American recovery is proceeding at an uneven pace, according to
the Federal Reserve's Beige Book, led in those regions where the
upturn is most pronounced by industrial production in part driven by
export demand.  The compilation of reports from Fed districts
confirmed the prevailing view of an economy lurching along in low gear
with consumer spending anemic and the housing sector faltering.  The
credit crunch, said the Fed report, is still with us.  The data in the
eight-times-a-year report was collected before September 9 and so
offered a relatively recent snapshot of the US economy.  If it was not
an inspiring view of the economy, it was by the same token not
alarming either, and was consistent with the consensus view of
affairs.  As recent data have suggested, the Fed likewise found
manufacturing to be the strongest sector.  "Industrial production has
provided considerable impetus to recovery, reflecting in part export
demand and a reduced pace of inventory liquidation," the report said.
"As yet, there is little sign of a sizeable rebound in consumer
spending that will contribute to a strengthening business recovery,"
it added.  Bank lending is still soft in most areas, often because of
reduced demand for loans, said the report, which is issued in advance
of meetings of the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee.
Although mortgage interest rates are sharply lower, home sales have
slowed in San Francisco, Chicago and elsewhere, and commercial
construction has virtually halted in many of the reporting Fed
districts.

Elsewhere, a small rise in August housing starts gainsaid expectations
on the part of Wall Street economists of a slight decline.
Construction starts on single-family homes and apartments rose 0.6% to
an annual rate of 1.07 million when the consensus among economists had
been for a 1.06 million rate.  That was the fifth straight rise for
the homebuilding industry, feared to be falling back into a slump.
Nevertheless, the 0.6% rise was less vigorous than July's revised 2.4%
gain, itself toned down from an earlier estimated 3.7% rise.
Construction in the first eight months of this year was off 21% from
the 1990 period.

Political events were also driving the markets on Wednesday.  There
was a report from Tass, the Soviet news agency, that Boris Yeltsin,
leader of the ascendant democratic forces in the ex-Soviet Union, had
suffered a slight heart attack.  That gave additional tone to the US
dollar but did not have any noticeable impact on the Treasuries
market.  Markets also were watching a faceoff between President Bush
and Saddam Hussein of Iraq.  Bush said US Air Force units would go to
Saudi Arabia to provide better protection for the kingdom and, if
necessary, to force Iraqi compliance with a UN resolution calling for
inspection of weapons stocks.

US CREDIT MARKETS

The Treasury market, which has become accustomed to having things go
its way, did not like look of the housing starts data and sold off to
a small extent but bounced right back.  That was typical of the
session, during which US government securities prices were mildly
buffeted by a series of factors but showed resilience.  The market
also turned down a bit when the December Treasury bond futures
contract ran into some tough resistance at 99 and fell back to 98
18/32.  Prices also declined on news that US Air Force units will be
sent to Saudi Arabia.  The Beige Book, however, was almost completely
ignored.  The benchmark 30-year bond finished the day about 1/8 point
lower in price to yield 7.92% after 7.91% at the close on Tuesday.
The 10-year note moved up slightly to yield 7.59% compared with 7.60%.
Bills were virtually unchanged.

The worst that could be said for the market right now is that it is
indecisive.  However, sentiment is still positive in the absence of
any data seriously challenging the thesis that the economy is not
making any headway and that inflation thus poses no danger.  As we
said yesterday, the market is unlikely to be perturbed by mildly
positive data.  But the durable goods figure coming out September 25
has it a bit worried.  The last one, for July, rose 10.7%, and a
similar surprise could test the mettle of fixed-income investors.  It
would not surprise us if the market took some profits ahead of that
figure, particularly if the trade and employment figures on Thursday
suggest economic quickening.  Money supply, out late Thursday, will
also be closely watched.  Nonetheless, the bias is towards further
price rises and yield declines.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKETS

Everyone in the market keeps avowing bearish sentiment, but the
dollar's behavior on Wednesday suggests otherwise.  Short-covering on
Yeltsin's heart trouble and the Bush-Saddam confrontation had
something to do with it.  But from our point of view the news breaks
just amplified the stirring of the dollar.  With many participants out
for the Yom Kippur Jewish holiday the market was thin and volatile,
making it hard to draw firm conclusions.  But the dollar looks more
biddish.  In Europe it was supported at DM1.6650 and capped at
DM1.6775, but in New York the news gave it enough punch to reach
DM1.6940 before falling back to close at DM1.6850 after DM1.6750
Tuesday.  Players will probably sell it again, but may be getting
tired of working the downside.
The reasoning behind bearish sentiment all this week has been that the
Fed is going to ease again, which as we have noted before should not
be taken as a foregone conclusion.  Even if that turns out to be true,
is the market likely to spend its time between now and Thanksgiving
looking for that ease?  More likely it will focus on something else,
and that could be US economic numbers.  The indicators out on
Wednesday were not great news, but they were not bad news either, and
somewhere along the line here the data may swing market sentiment.
For now, though, the numbers are indecisive, and so the market is
likely to work in a range for a while, eventually testing DM1.70 but
probably not cracking it decisively.  Therefore we would modify our
advice to suggest that if the dollar explores the bottom of its range
again, it looks like a good buy, but should not be held too far into
the DM1.6850 area -- unless the market shifts resistance up to DM1.70
sooner than expected.

TURKISH BOT PROJECTS EMERGE DESPITE POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES

Financing for Turkey's first two build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes
has been tied up after a decade of delay.

But project and trade financiers are keeping Turkey under tight
scrutiny following the inconclusive general election on 24 December, in
which the pro-Islamic Welfare Party topped the polling with just 21 per
cent of the vote.

Bankers say that signs of a turnaround in the economy was a key
determinant in finally closing the long-awaited limited recourse deals,
which have lingered on the drawing board since the mid-1980s, when they
figured among the first ever blueprints for BOT-style infrastructure
projects.  Other countries have since left Turkey far behind.

ECAs take on risk

Export credit agencies (ECAs) and commercial banks have taken on
substantial risk for the $1.4bn hydroelectric power and dam project at
Birecik on the Euphrates River and the $865m water supply and treatment
plant at Izmit, some 80 miles east of Istanbul.

A new readiness among commercial lenders to take on Turkish risk was
borne out by the oversubscription of unsecured commercial loans, priced
at 225 basis points (bp).

A dozen more BOT projects are awaiting approval, mostly in the power
sector, where the government has forecast growth in demand for
electricity of almost 250 per cent over the next 15 years.  Prior to
her resignation, prime minister Tansu Ciller said that BOT projects
worth $16bn were needed in Turkey over the next decade.

These include the 1,200 MW Ilisu Dam on the Tigris River, expected to
cost some $2.5bn, for which tenders are expected soon.

``It should certainly be quicker to do deals in future as there is now
a reference point for the Turkish market'', says Mr Howard Lack, the
director at London-based Chase Investment Bank, the arranger for
syndicated lending at both Birecik and Izmit.

``Before Birecik, the Treasury had no previous experience of a complex
structure that involved some 40 documents, but they will understand the
issues and the risks that are being asked in the future'', Mr Lack
says.

Banks' analysis

Analysts are examining the conflicting signals coming from Turkey to
weigh the extent of their participation in future operations.

``We are mindful of the election result, and like most banks, are
adopting a wait-and-see approach'', Mr Alan Paton, head of trade and
export finance of Societe Generale's London branch tells ITF.

``These are early days -- it is far from clear how things will go'', Mr
Paton adds.  SocGen took a strong hand in syndicated lending finalised
late in 1995 for Birecik and Izmit.

Adding complexity to western views of an increasingly important market
where the political situation may lay unresolved until February was
Turkey's entry into the EU customs union on 1 January 1996.

``The EC vote was a positive factor, but we are continuing to monitor
the progress of the Turkish economy following the elections'',
Mr Dennis Kennedy, NCM Credit Insurance's underwriter for the Middle
East, North Africa and Turkey tells ITF.

A series of recent economic and financial crises that came to a head in
1994 has drawn comparisons with Mexico from some quarters.

NCM said that Turkey represented ``a market with enduring economic
problems'' in a country summary issued in September.

The ratings agency, Standard & Poors, revised down its country outlook
from ``positive'' to ``stable'' in October.

Recent estimates suggest the budget deficit for the first quarter of
1996 will be greater than for the whole of 1995.

The market fell under close scrutiny in 1994, when massive capital
flight led to plummeting sovereign debt ratings, an inflation level of
126 per cent and currency devaluation of over 50 per cent.

Reserves up

However, the economy began to grow in the first quarter of 1995 and
foreign reserves had risen to $16.3bn by September, compared to $3bn in
April 1994.  Inflation is also seen as less of a danger.

As the macroeconomic situation improves, Turkish borrowers are
returning to the international market to borrow on longer maturities
and narrower margins, which are creeping back to pre-1994 crisis
levels.

Turkiye Garanti Bankasi secured a benchmark two-year $150m facility in
October at 65bp over Libor, marking the first loan over one year for a
Turkish bank in 1995.

ECA support

ECAs took 64 per cent of the risk in the ground-breaking 672MW Birecik
scheme, providing 151/2-year cover that includes a 51/2-year construction
period.

Germany's Hermes insured DM585m (#256m) to support the principal
developer, Philipp Holzmann.

Also involved were Belgian, Austrian and French ECAs, which guaranteed
around DM803m in bank loans to the sponsor Birecik Company, which
provided DM327m in equity towards the 15-year concession.

Eight-year commercial lending worth DM462m made up the senior debt
package.

Co-arrangers were Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau, Bayerische
Landesbank, Girokredit, Generale Bank and Societe Generale.

Forty-four banks participated in the two tranches, which were
oversubscribed by 30 per cent.  Margins were 100bp over Libor for the
ECA loan and 225bp for the commercial deal.

Given that aspects of the legal situation attaching to BOT schemes in
Turkey remain unresolved -- all concession-type contracts fall under the
jurisdiction of an administrative court -- lenders have extracted
government guarantees insuring them against force majeure or default by
Birecik Company.

The Birecik Company has protected itself against default on tariff
payments by the offtaker, the state-owned Turkiye Elektrik Uretim
Iletim (TEAS), by obtaining government guarantees.

``Future deals will need less support, with more risk being borne by
the commercial parties and banks'', says Mr Lack.

Water project

The UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has taken the
leading ECA role in Turkey's second BOT scheme: a 15-year concession to
improve the supply of drinking and industrial water to the Turkish city
of Izmit.

ECGD is providing a 100 per cent guarantee for $236m in commercial
lending, which secured about $803m in bank debt.

France's Coface has extended insurance for a $180m tranche, with
Japan's EID/MITI supporting a further $40m in loans over seven years.

The combination reflects ECGD's growing collaboration with its French
and Japanese counterparts (ITF 252/11).

Untied lending worth $180m has been agreed by the Export-Import Bank of
Japan (Jexim).

Banks have provided $167m on an unsecured basis, split into a $116m
seven-year facility and a $51m five-year standby facility.  These were
oversubscribed by 15 per cent.

Co-arrangers were National Westminster Bank, Fuji Bank, Sumitomo Bank
and  SocGen -- the latter lending over $83m.

Repayments to the project company, Izmit Su, are to be made in dollars.

Project security resides in offtake agreements and guarantees provided
by the Municipality of Izmit backed by the Turkish Treasury.

The sponsor -- which has injected some $139m in equity and comprises the
local companies Guris and Gama and the Municipality of Izmit, alongside
the UK's Thames Water and Japan's Mitsui & Co and Sumitomo Corporation
-- will commence its operating period in December 1998.

Breathing space

Most ECAs have taken a watching brief in the immediate post-election
period.
ECGD had planned a cover review in 1995, but this was postponed because
of the December polling.

The UK agency has ``one or two reasonable-sized deals in the
pipeline'', according to a spokesman, ``but, as always, these may take
awhile to come to fruition.  Following Izmit, almost all the cover
available in the market has been committed''.

``The two deals both went well, but took quite a lot of the available
appetite out of the marketplace'', SocGen's Mr Paton observes.  ``There
would be an appetite for the right project, but ECAs form a very
important leverage aspect for commercial banks''.

Private markets

Turkey remains a popular market for forfaiters.

The London-based Standard Bank will look at 360-day paper, principally
for commodity-based short-term deals.  Standard is doing business up to
three years for capital goods transactions.

``Margins have moved slightly upwards due to the uncertainty after the
election, but have otherwise been quite stable since the market
recovered in 1995'', says a spokesman.

Standard will look at paper from a range of banks, including two of the
public sector institutions, TC Ziraat Bankasi and Turkiye Halk Bankasi.

Bankers and insurers are generally agreed that Turkey's private sector
banks may offer more scope for trade finance.

NCM highlighted the local private sector as a much better risk for
exporters in its September report, pointing out that the majority of
foreign exchange reserves are held privately.

``Public sector companies, currently comprising about half the legal
economy, are in the main loss-making and debt-ridden'', said the
report.

NCM's trading terms extend to a maximum 180 days, with open account
business acceptable where buyers, mainly private, can show a good
recent track record or a visible hard currency trading surplus.

Analysts have noted that this is more commonplace as economic
liberalisation has freed companies from political interference.

Most businesses require the security of a letter of credit or bank-
endorsed bills of exchange.

RUSSIAN GOLD FINANCING SET TO TRIGGER MORE PROJECTS?

The completion and disbursement of a ground-breaking $100m gold mine
financing has triggered hopes among western financiers that more
Russian projects will move ahead as the government gradually eases the
regulatory environment.

The move complements activity by western financiers in Russia's
hydrocarbons sector, where protracted manoeuverings have eventually led
to the provision of US export credit guarantees for projects under the
oil and gas framework agreement (OGFA) (ITF 247/6).

The arranger of the limited recourse gold deal, Deutsche Morgan
Grenfell (DMG), took two years to structure and negotiate the
transaction with the Russian authorities and the lenders.

The deal ``sets a precedent for international debt financing for such
projects in Russia'', says a DMG director closely involved with the
project, Mr Andrew Seton.

Funds for the project in the far eastern Magadan region were released
in mid-December, following the signature of loan agreements in June
between the Omolon Gold Mining Company and the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the US' Overseas Private
Investment Corporation (Opic) (ITF 240/3).

Opic contributed guarantees worth $52.5m and will also extend $60m in
investment insurance.

Omolon, a joint venture between the Denver-based Cyprus Amax Minerals
Company and Russian (mainly mining) concerns, is the first joint
venture to receive a licence to mine gold in Russia.

The company will use the loan proceeds to develop the Kubaka lode gold
deposit, located some 200 miles off the Arctic Circle.

Repayments from the sale of the mine's output will be channelled
through a licensed offshore account.

Security for the lenders is based on a series of long-term contracts
that have replaced Russian government payment risk with contractual
risk.

In return for mixed hard currency and rouble payments, the Russian
government will be allocated first claim on the mine's output,
anticipated at an annual 300,000 ounces of gold and 200,000 ounces of
silver.

If payments do not ensue, the Russian Foreign Trade Bank, in its role
as agent for the government and the joint venture, will export the
metals to western buyers.

``People were not prepared to lend or invest on the basis where the
government held a monopoly over gold production and exports'', another
banker specialising in CIS minerals tells ITF.  ``Lenders are happy
with this deal -- and the structure is likely to be replicated for other
gold projects''.

DMG's activities in Russia and the former Soviet Union have raised
nearly $4bn in project finance to date.

Further EBRD activity in Russia includes support for short-term trade
finance under its Trade Facilitation Programme (ITF 248/2).

INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES FUND PAKISTAN IPP

A new independent power project (IPP) is going ahead in Pakistan's
Punjab state backed by the Export-Import Bank of Japan (Jexim) and the
World Bank's International Finance Corporation (IFC).

As its contribution to 12-year Japanese buyer credits worth Y18.2bn
(#115m) for the 365MW Lal Pir II scheme in Muzzafargagh, Jexim is to
provide Y10.9bn as a direct loan on its own account.  Around Y4bn of
this is dollar-denominated.

The remaining Y7.3bn is being co-financed with a syndicate of 15
commercial banks, nine of which are from Japan.  Arranging the
facility, which is priced at 240 basis points (bp) over Libor, is the
scheme's financial advisor, Bank of Tokyo, with Sanwa Bank, Deutsche
Bank, Dresdner Bank and ING Bank.

The political risk in this tranche will be insured by EID/MITI.

The deal was reportedly well over-subscribed, principally reflecting an
appetite from banks that missed Lal Pir I (ITF 234/3).

The proceeds will be deployed by the sponsor, AES Pak Gen Company
(AESPG), to finance the purchase of equipment from Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, to be supplied through the trading house Nichimen
Corporation.

Jexim's security in the project pivots on the government of Pakistan's
guarantees for currency conversion and transfers; the purchase of
generated electricity over 30 years by the Pakistan Water & Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) and the supply of fuel by Pakistan State
Oil Company.

IFC role

The IFC has agreed an A-loan/B-loan structure worth $70m for the $349m
oil-fired scheme, which is to be implemented on a build-own-operate
(BOO) basis.

A $20m A-loan has been extended over 15 years.

The $50m B-facility has a 12-year tenor and a margin of 275bp.  IFC has
also taken a portion of the $95m equity injected by AESPG, which was
created by the US' AES Corporation in June 1995.

The participation of the World Bank's investment arm follows an A-
loan/B-loan facility agreed for a $138m project in Karachi last July
(ITF 242/5).

Jexim and the IFC have worked together in Pakistan's power sector on
Lal Pir I and the country's first limited recourse power financing, the
ground-breaking Hub River scheme (ITF 222/1).

The Lal Pir II project will help to alleviate power shortages in
Pakistan estimated at around 2000MW.  Completion is expected near the
end of 1997.

EXPORT CREDIT INCLUDED IN UKRANIAN PAYMENTS SUPPORT PACKAGE

The Export-Import Bank of Japan has included a Y6bn (#37m) export
financing facility in its new Y24bn economic stabilisation support
package for Ukraine.

The package, signed in late-December, is part of the international
effort to underpin the former Soviet republic where the president,
Mr Leonid Kuchma, remains confronted with daunting problems putting his
reform programme into effect.

``By helping to stabilise the economy, the loan is intended to uphold
the government's intention to dismantle its nuclear weaponry system'',
Jexim said in a statement.  The question of the Chernobyl nuclear power
plant is also high on governments' agendas.

Jexim observed that the G7 and EU nations had agreed in mid-1994 to
provide $4bn or more ``over the next two years'' and remained ``united
in their recognition that the Ukraine's economic stability is important
to world peace, in view of its nuclear capabilities''.

The Y18bn untied loan element of the package -- intended as co-financing
with the World Bank -- is part of the $200m in balance of payments
support, drawn from Jexim's funds for the development initiative,
committed last March by Mr Tomiichi Murayama, the Japanese prime
minister.

Other governments to commit export credits include the US, Germany,
Italy, Canada and France.

The IMF has approved an SDR1.5bn standby package; the World Bank has
already committed loans worth around $720m; and the EU an Ecu225m loan
for balance of payments support.

During a visit to Kiev last summer, Mr James Wolfensohn, the World Bank
president, said the bank could provide over $1bn in the next three
years.

But these loans could be in jeopardy if a rebellious parliament has its
way over issues such as privatisation and farm reform -- and Mr Kuchma's
reform programme is blocked.

ECAS MOBILISE SUPPORT FOR EGYPTIAN/ISRAELI OIL REFINERY

Export credit agencies (ECAs) are preparing to mobilise cover for an
Egyptian/Israeli joint venture scheme, the Middle East Oil Refinery
(MIDOR).

Sponsors have yet to choose between Banque National de Paris (BNP) and
National Westminster Bank to head supplier credit arrangements, but a
financial close is expected by construction start, at the end of
March 1996.

Export credit cover from Israel worth between $100-$150m has been
secured.

Further ECA-backed loans for the scheme will total an anticipated
$600m.  The eventual choice of agencies will depend on the sources of
construction equipment, but agencies from France, Germany, Japan,
Belgium and the UK have expressed interest.

A construction contract has been signed with a European consortium
comprising Italy's Technipetrol and France's Technip, following a hard
fought tender.

Spain's Tecnicas Reunidas has been awarded a large subcontracting deal,
which involves the provision of supplier credit guarantees worth $100m
by Compania Espanola de Seguros de Credito a la Exportacion (CESCE).

Regional banks, including the National Bank of Egypt, Misr Bank and
Israeli General Bank are to provide working capital worth about $370m.

The European Investment Bank has also committed around $300m.

Some $240-$250m of equity is to be injected into the project.  A stake
may be offered to the winner of an imminent contract for management and
operations.

MIDOR's shareholding comprises two 40 per cent stakeholders -- the
Merhav group, owned by Israeli businessman Mr Yosef Malman, and
Egyptian entrepreneur Mr Hussein Salem -- and Egyptian General Petroleum
Corporation (EGPC).

EGPC will supply crude oil and has undertaken to purchase 20 per cent
of MIDOR's production.

The refinery will be built at Alexandria near the Suez-Mediterranean
pipeline terminal, at a site designated as a 40-year renewable free
trade zone by the Egyptian government.

Project processing capacity is slated at 100,000 barrels a day, with a
refined offtake of around five million tonnes annually to be targeted
at markets in Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Palestine and several other
eastern Mediterranean economies.

MIDOR is examining transportation options and the possibilities for
constructing two new regional terminals to receive the refined produce.

WORLD BANK OFFERS POWER PROJECT GUARANTEES

The World Bank has offered to use its revamped guarantee programme to
assist Egypt's plans to build its first three concessionary power
projects.

The bank's partial risk guarantee would offer shelter for commercial
banks in the event of any difficulties relating to contracts, including
fuel supply commitments and payments by the Egyptian Electricity
Authority (EEA).

The EEA is examining bids from six consultants to prepare tender
documents for the build-operate-transfer (BOT) schemes, which comprise
a 100MW wind farm at Zaafarana, a 240MW scheme at Ataqa and a 660MW
thermal plant.

BIS TRACKS RISE IN SHORT-TERM TRADE FINANCE FOR EMERGING MARKETS

The growth of short-term trade finance to developing countries is a key
factor fuelling increased commercial bank lending to these markets, the
Bank for International Settlements (BIS) says.

Based on January-June 1995 data, the Basle-based BIS reports
significant growth in total lending from the developed world.  This
rose to $25.6bn, up from $19.9bn in the first half of 1994.

Particular note was made of banks' claims up to 360 days, which rose as
a percentage of total claims.  A growing volume of trade finance and
banks' reluctance to expose themselves longer term were among reasons
for this.

The favoured target region for commercial lenders was Asia, where
lending jumped by $33.7bn, compared to $15.6bn in 1994.

The report noted a ``greater selectivity'' in lending to Latin America,
which fell by $4.2bn, although it seemed ``too early to say'' whether
the Mexican crisis had impacted on this trend.

A greater global dependence on short-term capital flows has led
commercial banks to assess their portfolios on a more frequent basis.

GRIFFIN LAUNCHES EXPORT INVOICE DISCOUNTING SERVICE

Griffin Factors has opted to follow its main competitors and launch an
export invoice discounting service to cater for larger export
companies.

Exporters with their solid in-house credit control unit will now be
offered finance, without the obligation to accept a traditional ``full
factoring'' arrangement.

An offshoot of Midland Bank, Griffin was one of the first factors to
offer domestic clients an invoice discounting service (under which
finance is provided against invoices without direct involvement by the
finance house in the process of collection, unless a payment falls
seriously overdue).

But it stood back from the industry-wide move into invoice discounting
of exports, continuing to trust to traditional full factoring -- under
which it retains responsibility for collecting all payments.

And this approach seemed to be justified, because in most recent years,
it managed to remain in second place in the league table of
international business handled by the UK's factors -- last year the
volume of exports it factored was up by 25 per cent at more than #90m.

Griffin management was also concerned about the practical difficulties
of getting involved in collection of overdue invoice-discounted
payments.  A particular worry was a German law that allowed buyers to
refuse to allow their debts to be assigned.

Market pressures

But market pressures on Griffin to follow competitors, such as
International Factors, into the invoice discounting of exports
increased.  There was strong demand for the service from clients and
industry figures showed that the spectacular growth in invoice
discounting was far outstripping the more measured expansion of
traditional factoring.

There was, particularly, an increased number of larger exporters -- who
were not prepared to involve a factor in their routine payment
collection -- seeking trade-based finance.

Last year, Griffin dipped a toe quietly into the water.  It also
equipped itself to cope with a change, recruiting specialist language
staff who could chase up foreign payments.

And, with fortunate timing, the law in Germany was clarified to allow
foreign export suppliers to promise repayment to their financiers.

There was clearly a risk that Griffin could lose clients who wanted
discounted finance, if it continued to stand aside from this trend.
 But it still remains committed to further development of the
traditional factoring operation.  Recently, it set up an EDI service
that will allow clients to send in invoices electronically, without the
need for paper back-up.  Restricted for now to domestic business, this
will eventually be available to exporters.

WOLFENSOHN RINGS ORGANISATIONAL CHANGES AT WORLD BANK

Mr James Wolfensohn, World Bank president, has restructured top
management posts at the bank in a drive to improve efficiency and to
build incentives and accountability into the organisation's culture.

In the first significant management initiative at the bank since he
assumed control last June, Mr Wolfensohn has increased his team of
managing directors from three to five and created a new Executive
Committee.

The changes became operational on 1 January 1996.

In a memo circulated among more than 6,000 World Bank personnel in
December, the president explained the initiative as part of his
overriding aim ``to enhance the quality and effectiveness of the Bank's
work and its objectives'' by providing ``a framework for liberating the
energies and skills of the rest of the organisation''.

The managing directors, who will become directly involved in specific
day-to-day management tasks, have been allocated the following roles:

* Mr Gautam Kaji will be joined by Mr Caio Koch-Weser, former vice-
president for the Middle East and Africa, for a joint controlling role
in charge of the bank's operations, policies and programmes.

Moving into the Middle East and Africa seat is Mr Kemal Dervis, who has
worked before on the Middle East.

Mr Koch-Weser, a Brazilian, was a very familiar face across the region,
including at various stages of the Middle East peace process.

Mr Spiros Voyadzis, another Middle East expert, has been named the
World Bank's special representative to the EU and manager of the bank's
new Brussels office.

* Mr Sven Sandstrom assumes charge of Human and Information Resources
and Management, in addition to Corporate Planning and Budgeting.

Mr Wolfensohn has identified personnel and training as the bank's
greatest problem areas.  According to the memo, Mr Sandstrom has been
given a two-year brief to turn around the bank's traditional ``armlock
of bureaucracy'' -- where task managers are reportedly separated from
upper levels by five management layers -- and to create a ``results
culture''.

* Ms Jessica Einhorn has been promoted to manage activities in finance
and resource mobilisation, supervising vice presidency functions
previously covered by the treasurer, the Controller, Financial Policy
and Risk Management and Cofinancing and Financial Advisory Services.

She will also assume the chairmanship of the bank's Finance Committee.

* Mr Richard Frank is to chair the Private Sector Development Group,
with responsibility for working with senior managers of the Bank Group
and to evolve the bank's overall private sector strategy, which is
making greater use of commercial markets through instruments, such as
its revamped guarantees (ITF 248/10).

Mr Frank has previously been responsible for working on the Bank's
future policy direction.

The moves will ``provide clear lines of authority for the main areas of
our business and to strengthen the Group's ability to address major
strategic issues'', said Mr Wolfensohn.

Committee launch

The five managing directors will form part of a new 10-strong Executive
Committee, which is to hold meetings on a weekly basis.

The Committee includes Mr Mark Malloch Brown, promoted from director to
vice-president of External Relations, and chief economist Mr Michael
Bruno, also elevated to vice presidential status.

Mr Malloch Brown has long links with non-governmental organisations and
the media.  His arrival in 1994 gave the bank a fresh approach to
public relations.

Mr Bruno is a widely respected former governor of the Central Bank of
Israel.

Where matters are related to the larger World Bank Group, the committee
will be enlarged to accommodate the executive vice president of the
International Finance Corporation (IFC), Mr Jannik Lindbaek, and the
executive vice president of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
agency (MIGA), Mr Akira Iida.

This fits a pattern profiled at the October 1995 World Bank/IMF annual
meeting in Washington, where exploratory strategies were announced for
greater co-ordination within the Group.

Further changes in 1996 will involve the uptake by 50 top executives of
management courses and the secondment of executive staff into industry
and private sector banks.

Mr Johannes Linn, whose experience at the bank includes several senior
economics posts, became the World Bank's vice-president for Europe and
Central Asia on 1 January, following the retirement of Mr Wilfred
Thalwitz.

Mr Timothy Thahane, the World Bank vice-president who narrowly missed
out becoming president of the African Development Bank, occupies a new
vice-presidency for United Nations affairs.  This office is intended to
better co-ordinate the World Bank's relations with the UN system.

He is replaced as vice-president and World Bank group secretary by Mr
Shengman Zhang, executive director for China since November 1994.

Mr Wolfensohn stressed in the memo that the goal of the bank continues
to be the promotion of sustainable development ``in the broadest
sense'', in particular the alleviation of poverty and assisting
countries in transition.  ``I have made it clear that I expect the
management to work with me at top pressure'', he concluded.

KLEINWORT TO EXPAND CROSS-BORDER REACH WITH LEASING UNIT ACQUISITION

Kleinwort Benson has moved to extend its cross-border reach through the
purchase of the leasing finance and advisory arm of SBC Warburg for an
undisclosed fee.

The acquisition of S G Warburg & Co (Leasing) comprises Warburg's
leasing portfolio and a ten-strong executive team, led by Mr Michael
Hardwick.

The Warburg team has acted as adviser and arranger to several big
ticket projects, including aircraft transactions involving Boeing,
Cathay Pacific and Air France; and the acquisition of Eurostar trains
for the Channel Tunnel.

Ongoing activities include negotiations with Malaysian Airlines.

``The international side of the business is mainly OECD-based, but is
developing fast in several Asia-Pacific countries'', Mr Hardwick tells
ITF.

Mr Hardwick says that his team's cross-border lease financing
activities have focused strongly on France, Germany, Finland, Denmark
and Japan.

The move adds some $500m to Kleinwort's existing leasing assets.

COFACE LAUNCHES NEW CROSS-BORDER FACILITY

Groupe Coface has initiated an innovative trade credit insurance scheme
in the UK -- and expects to extend the concept across, and possibly
beyond, Europe in response to the growing cross-border requirements of
multinational companies.

The French-based international credit insurer launched the pilot for a
new range of products entitled Globalalliance on 3 January through its
London-based Coface LBF arm.

Coface's pilot Euro Trader policy permits UK-based firms with
subsidiaries in EU countries to provide both domestic and international
cover for their group operations under one, singly worded policy chosen
from Coface LBF's Open Trader or Top Trader range.

``Euro Trader has been made possible by the highly integrated
information technology resources of Coface's Credit Alliance network'',
says Ms Bridget Taxy, head of Coface LBF.

``It enables a finance director, through a single negotiation, and with
a single point of contact, to arrange and manage closely-tailored
international cover backed up by practical local support throughout
Europe''.

Euro Trader makes use of the EU's ``Freedom of Services'' legislation,
which allows for cross-border insurance throughout the Union.  ``We
hope to go outside EU legislation eventually'', Ms Taxy tells ITF.

Innovative reach

Euro Trader's most striking innovation is its facility for operational
documentation in the currency, and often the language, of the local
subsidiary.

The parent company may also select varying degrees of centralisation or
decentralisation.  Choice is offered between a group wide strategy or
terms and conditions that more closely reflect individual subsidiaries'
needs at three different levels:

* rates for premium and service;

* indemnification levels;

* the ``excess'' threshold below which losses are for the account of
the policy holder.

For UK-based multinationals wishing to develop a gradual group wide
credit insurance strategy, the scheme can be initiated through just one
or two subsidiaries and extended at a later date.

Euro Trader is the latest in a series of product developments from
credit insurers battling for UK market share (ITF 251/4).

It also marks a further stage in a trend increasingly discernible in
the single European market whereby intra-EU deals are helping to fuel
the expansion of short-term political risk cover capacity among
insurers (ITF 252/13).

EAST EUROPEAN TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING ON HOLD

The European Union assistance programme to the CIS countries is
currently on hold, following opposition led by Spain to the way the
contracts are awarded.

The TACIS programme, with funds of about Ecu500m, provides technical
assistance and know-how for economic and reform programmes proposed by
the governments of the 12 former Soviet countries and Mongolia.

Spain has blocked the programme for 1996 because it wants reform of the
way the contracts are tendered and different criteria used in their
allocation.  Privately, officials say Spain is opposed to the programme
because their companies only win about 2 per cent of the contracts.

Last March, officials proposed new guidelines for the TACIS programme
to start this year, which would permit TACIS funds to be invested in
small and medium-sized enterprises and in infrastructure projects.

These funds are intended to be strategic investments that would
catalyse much larger funds from the World Bank, European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and other institutional investors.
Similar investments have been made successfully in Central Europe.

New formula

This new formula, extending the traditional mandate of the TACIS
programme, has already been approved by Parliament, but was blocked in
the Council of Ministers.  Officials plan to put it before the Council
again, but say that an ``educated guess'' would anticipate it being
rejected again.

The most likely outcome, say officials, is that the Council will
eventually approve a continuation of the former programme, restricting
funds to technical assistance and know-how transfer for one more year.
The new programme is likely to be postponed until 1997.

Meanwhile, officials are continuing to work on the programmes approved
using the 1995 budget.  Assuming the Council finally approves the TACIS
funds before the summer, officials are confident that all the funds
could be committed before the end of 1996.

DG BANK SETS UP FORFAITING OPERATION IN LONDON

Deutschegenossenschafts (DG Bank), the central business and investment
unit for Germany's popular and co-operative banks, has set up a trade
finance unit to market trade paper to the London forfaiting community.

Acting as the provider of corporate and international services for
almost 3,000 local institutions, DG Bank should be well placed to feed
a stream of export deals to forfait traders and investors in the
secondary market.

The new operation is being headed by Janine Barber, recruited from
Standard Bank London's forfaiting team.

Ms Barber's specialist knowledge of eastern Europe will be particularly
useful for DG Bank:  many of the small and medium-sized German firms
that form the core client base of the Volksbanks (popular) and
Raiffeisen (co-operative) banks are selling to the former communist
countries that lie across Germany's eastern border.  Indeed, during its
first weeks, DG's London trade finance operation has handled deals for
exports to Russia, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Slovakia.

The fact that DG felt the need to set up a forfaiting presence in
London -- to supplement the forfaiting service already offered by its
head office in Frankfurt and enhance its ability to take on risks that
it would not want to keep for its own portfolio -- bears witness to the
central role that the UK's capital continues to play in the market for
trade paper.

London hub

Although the biggest users of the technique are probably Italian rather
than UK exporters, London remains the hub of the secondary trading that
has gradually expanded forfaiters' ability to do business over recent
years.  Indeed, the range of country risks that can now be sold on the
market is probably wider than at any previous time.

Confidence seems to have ridden out the shock of Mexico's late 1994
financial crisis;  large volumes of Latin American risk are still
traded.

And there are even signs of a renewed willingness to support deals with
Bulgaria -- whose credibility was shattered several years ago by its
readiness to take on new loans when it was on the verge of default.

During 1995, specialists, such as Hungarian International Bank (HIB)
and London Forfaiting Company (LFC), began to do Bulgarian short-term
deals;  and in recent weeks LFC has actually quoted three year terms,
albeit for a transaction of only DM1m.

What remains to be seen is how the market will evolve following the
announcement that HIB is to close.  The bank has been one of the
leading forces in the market, with a strong reputation in pioneering
the acceptance of deals with the more difficult ex-communist countries,
such as Croatia, or the Baltic states.

HIB will have a successor institution:  the Hungarian national savings
bank OTP is to set up a trade finance company in London -- based in the
same premises and using many of the same staff.  Capitalised at about
#1m and hoping to chalk up #50m or so of deals in the first year, this
should be able to build on the legacy of east European expertise.

All the clearers continue to offer forfaiting services, but at Barclays
and Lloyds these are integrated into the main trade finance operations,
alongside conventional export credit:  the aim is to put forward the
most competitive technique for each particular deal, whether it be
forfaiting or supplier credit (or something else).  Forfaiting is often
combined with export credit, particularly as a means of dealing with
the 15 per cent uninsured ``front end'' component of Export Credits
Guarantee Department deals.

Midland Bank Aval forms an integral part of the HSBC group and was one
of the first to spot the potential for combining forfaiting and export
credit in the same operation -- but it does maintain a large team of
forfaiting specialists in London and the Far East and generates a big
flow of deals from its own exporting customers in the UK, Italy and
elsewhere.  It uses the technique to finance a lot of trade between Far
Eastern countries.

West Merchant Bank is another leading export credit house which offers
forfaiting as an alternative or complementary financing option.

CHINA SECURES ECGD SUPPORT FOR POWER FACILITY, AIRPORT CONTRACT

The UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) has agreed a major
new power-related facility for China, the boom market which absorbed
the largest volume of ECGD guarantees for any single country in the
agency's 1994/95 financial year.

ECGD has also backed the commercial portion of a UK mixed credit
package for the new airport at Nanjing, and is gearing up to mobilise
additional cover for a $2bn-plus power complex in Shandong.

ECGD announced on 20 December that it will provide a 15-year repayment
guarantee for a #351.5m commercial loan in support of a contract won by
GEC-Alsthom to design and supply equipment for the Ling Ao power
station, better known as Daya Bay II, in Guangdong province.

GEC-Alsthom was a leading supplier for China's first nuclear power
station at Daya Bay (ITF 249/3).
  At Ling Ao it is responsible this time for the turnkey design, supply
and supervision of commissioning of two 900 MW turbine generator units
and plant, scheduled for completion by 2003.

The commercial lending syndicate is led by West Merchant Bank (WMB),
acting as arranger, principal lender and agent bank.

The borrower is State Development Bank of China (SDB), the specialised
infrastructure financing institution established in early 1994.  ECGD
says it envisages further borrowing by SDB for nuclear power
transactions.

Airport take-off

Concessional funds from the UK's Overseas Development Administration
and ECGD-backed commercial lending have enabled Siemens Plessey to win
a #22.4m contract to design and equip Nanjing's new international
airport, in Jiangsu province.

WMB and Standard Chartered Bank are providing 65 per cent of the Aid &
Trade Provision financing, in a tranche fully guaranteed by ECGD.

The balance will be met by an ODA grant from the #55m Third
Concessional Financing Arrangement signed in September 1994 between the
UK and China.

ECGD is expected to participate in a $2.2bn-$2.5bn power project at
Shandong, for which Industrial Bank of Japan Asia, NatWest Markets and
Societe Generale Asia have been appointed as lead arrangers for the ECA-
backed financing.

Also taking a role is the Export-Import Bank of the US (Eximbank).

Both agencies were considering whether to extend favourable interest
rates for the scheme as ITF went to press.  ECGD and Eximbank had set a
mid-January deadline for a preferential rate of 5.95 per cent already
rolled over previously.  All parties were understood to be anxious to
avoid the proposed new rate of 7 per cent.

The sponsor, China Power Company -- a joint venture involving a 49 per
cent foreign stake from China Light & Power and Electricite de France --
anticipates raising some $800m through international syndication to add
to equity that may total as much as $600m.

The project encompasses four plants.  The international funding will be
channelled to the 1,300 MW Liaocheng and 700 MW Heze complexes.
Equipment is to be supplied by the US' Westinghouse Electric
Corporation and the UK's Babcock Energy.

Remaining funding is likely to be tapped domestically.

ITF COMMENT:  Rapid growth in the huge Chinese market means the country
will remain the most active trade finance market in 1996, especially as
Beijing is expected to relax its credit squeeze, imposed since mid-
1993.

The economy remains mined with problems associated with everything from
a sometimes opaque legislative framework and a commitment to obtaining
rock-bottom pricing to political risk factors, which include the
succession to Mr Deng Xioping and the People's Liberation Army's recent
threatening gestures towards Taiwan.

But the macroeconomic numbers and market's potential still dazzle -- and
ECAs continue to take a positive view in the ``national interest'' to
give companies a chance in the market that everyone wants to crack.

China's foreign trade grew by 18 per cent in 1995 to $280bn, producing
a trade surplus of over $20bn.  This compared to $5.35bn in 1994,
according to preliminary statistics released by Beijing on 5 January.
Foreign exchange reserves were estimated at $70bn at end-1995.  Foreign
investment grew by 11 per cent last year, reaching $37bn.

The pattern of ECGD's business is replicated by other ECAs.  The UK
agency's concentration on the fiercely contested Chinese market was
reflected in its 1994/95 annual report, which showed exposure totalling
#1.54bn (ITF 251/7).

China accounted for over 40 per cent of ECGD's commitments to the so-
called Amber Zone of priority markets in 1994/95.

Exposure is building, but there is more support to come.  ECGD's chief
executive, Mr Brian Willott, has confirmed that further capacity is
available for UK exporters to China.

China will remain a buoyant market provided its political problems do
not get out of control.  But it will be a market whose pitfalls can
upset even the most careful investors for years to come.

One not so happy New Year message came from State Economic & Trade
Commission official Mr Xu Ming, who complained that domestic firms were
being pushed out of joint ventures when profits increase and local
partners cannot match the new investments in equity made by their
foreign partners.

This apparently widespread trend is giving foreign partners majority
holdings -- and, Chinese officials complain, monopolies in some domestic
industrial sectors.

``It is almost unanimous -- when returns become high, foreign parties
will scramble to nudge their Chinese partners out of holding status
with their overwhelming funding power'', Mr Xu said. Local firms should
``stand up against the aggression of foreign partners'', he said.

The language of international capitalism, which investors and creditors
so like to hear, will continue to suffer problems of translation in
China.

BANKS LINE UP CHINESE PROJECT FINANCINGS

International and locally-based banks are lining up a raft of new
Chinese projects.

Standard Chartered Capital Markets is lead arranger for the non-
recourse financing of a gas-fired power plant in Zhabei, Shanghai.

The sponsors, GE Capital Corporation and the Shanghai Municipal
Electric Power Company, are looking to raise around $120m over 10
years.

China International Capital Corporation is seeking to raise around
$750m for an oil project in the north-east.  CICC has been appointed by
Jilin Oil and Gas Development to tap overseas funds over the next five
years to lift annual production at the Jilin field to 2m tonnes.

Official sources have indicated that a project financing, including a
substantial equity stake from a foreign partner, would be looked upon
favourably.

CICC is the country's first joint venture investment bank, involving,
among others, the US' Morgan Stanley.

China is apparently turning towards public/private sector development
even of social infrastructure.

Hong Kong-based commercial lenders, including Hongkong & Shanghai
Banking Corporation, are participating in a $550m private placement to
finance large-scale government subsidised housing projects in Chinese
cities.

The initiative, which has targeted Beijing, Guangzhou, Nanjing and
Wuhan, marks an innovative tie-up between the private sector and
municipal housing authorities.

Korean venture seeks funds

The South Korean conglomerate Hyundai Group and a local partner plan to
borrow the bulk of the finance for a $450m joint venture petrochemicals
project in China's Shandong province.

A formal contract will be signed in the coming months for the venture
to start work.  Hyundai, which will take 70 per cent of the equity, and
its local partner, Jinan Honghua Group, have already registered capital
of $119m.

The remaining finance, to build a plant to produce 50,000 tonnes of
chemicals for use in the production of nylon, will come from borrowing.

The local partner is a subsidiary of Jinan Petrochemical Bureau, which
has applied to the Chinese State Planning Commission to have the plant
included as a priority project open for foreign borrowing.

Next Challenge: Keep the Data Flowing

   Now that RTC has appeased Congress by publishing its initial real estate
inventory on time, the agency can turn its attention to the more important
task of delivering updated data to investors on a frequent basis.
   In unveiling the nationwide listing of 30,123 properties, RTC Executive
Director David C. Cooke said his agency will soon begin making asset
information available more often than the required semiannual reports.
However, he did not specify whether that meant quarterly or monthly
updates.
   Demand for detailed listings of RTC's holdings seems to be overwhelming,
based on the 22,000 written inquiries received by the agency in recent
months and the heavy order volume for the inventory report last week.
   As a result, entrepreneurs in the technology, publishing and marketing
industries are circling - hoping to help the bailout agency disseminate
fresh data on new properties assumed by RTC, as well as results of recent
sales.
   "The inventory will also be made available through a variety of
computer-compatible media," Cooke said.
   In fact, a consortium of reputable technology companies, not yet willing
to publicize its effort, is working to create a system which would allow
subscribers to use a personal computer to "dial in" to a central database
and conduct sophisticated analysis of RTC assets.
   In addition, the bailout agency has been approached by publishing
ventures that are eager to repackage the property listings to fit specific
needs of various investors.
   Rather than select one or two companies to deliver the information, RTC
will probably make the raw data on properties available to all potential
publishers and let users determine which of the competing services best
meets their needs.
   American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp., a unit of Dallas-base AMR
Corp., has seized one of the first inventory-related assignments. RTC hired
the firm to process orders for the three-volume property listing, which is
priced at $50.
   Later this month, AA Direct Marketing Corp. will begin operating a 900-
number telephone line, which will allow investors to order specialized
property listings for a nominal fee that will be charged on their regular
monthly telephone bill.
   For example, a caller reaching RTC's new asset information center could
request a listing of all single-family homes in the Phoenix area, and the
order would be processed and mailed within 24 hours. The phone number has
not yet been announced.
   Would-be investors and others needing to closely scrutinize each asset
say they hope the agency eventually expands its data collection effort to
include more than just basic information on each property.
   The new report on commercial properties, for instance, provides only an
address, square footage, a one-line description, the property's age, a
contact name and - in some cases - a list price.
   Congress' requirement that the inventory be rushed into print before
Dec. 31 made it impossible for RTC to include information on all of its
holdings. Instead, the report listed only properties with clear titles that
were held by the 283 thrifts under RTC control on Sept. 30. It does not
include assets held by S&L subsidiaries, or assets of institutions placed
in the conservatorship program during the fourth quarter.

Workout Firms Eye Louisiana Portfolios

   RTC's Baton Rouge field office is looking for private-sector help in
managing and disposing of nonperforming loans and real estate left over
from the resolutions of six Louisiana conservatorships.
   "We would like to have the bid packages out this month," said Jay
Hambric, who runs the Baton Rouge operation, one of four consolidated field
offices in RTC's east region. The assignments, which could be awarded
sometime in February, will be one of the first disposition contracts handed
out since RTC opened its doors five months ago.
   Roughly $300 million in assets will be put out for bid after the agency
packages them by type, size and quality. Categories will include real
estate, real estate loans, student loans, second mortgages and other types
of consumer credits. There is also expected to be more than one quality
category, including delinquent unsecured loans.
   Packages will likely be awarded to firms with experience and expertise
in managing assets in those particular categories. RTC officials in
Washington are deciding on the fee structure for the assignment.
   RTC also retained commercial loans from the six resolutions, but Hambric
said his office would concentrate on disposing of the consumer debt first
since there was so much more of it.
   He said his office would contract separately with a firm to conduct due
diligence reviews of the assets before they are packaged.
   By the time bids are invited, RTC expects that most interested parties
will have completed the agency's newly issued registration forms. Bids will
be accepted from only those firms whose registration statements meet RTC's
criteria. RTC still hasn't decided how it will publicize the request for
proposals.
   The targeted assets were on the books of the following six Louisiana
thrifts, whose deposits were transferred to healthy institutions on the
resolution date shown in parentheses:
   * Acadia S&LA FSA of Crowley (Oct. 6). Assets: $108 million.
   * River City FSB of Baton Rouge (Oct. 6). Assets: $73 million.
   * Enterprise FS&LA of Marrero (Sept. 8). Assets: $64 million.
   * Elmwood FS&LA of Harahan (Sept. 8). Assets $58 million.
   * Evangeline FS&LA of Lafayette (Aug. 18). Assets: $37 million.

Final Blueprint Still Lacks Specifics

   RTC's policymakers last week unveiled a strategic plan that acknowledges
key concerns of real estate and asset management professionals, but in some
ways fails to spell out precisely how the agency will address those
matters.
   Industry and government observers agreed that the three-member Oversight
Board placed the greatest emphasis on disposal of marketable assets as
quickly as possible.
   But the Board, headed by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, was far
from specific in addressing the need for incentive-based compensation for
contractors. It said contractors could be paid "as a percentage of proceeds
net of expenses, with the percentage increasing as proceeds increase
relative to the estimated market value of assets."
   While that description acknowledges the industry's rejection of fixed
fees, it failed to state exactly whether RTC would be willing to pay base
fees - to cover a management firm's costs - in addition to performance-
based fees.
   The industry's desire to perform the asset management, or general
contractor, role in liquidations was mentioned - but not directly addressed
- in the strategic plan.
   On Capitol Hill, the document drew early applause. Rep. Bruce Vento, a
Minnesota Democrat who heads a House task force monitoring the thrift
bailout, said he was pleased with the Board's decision to quickly dispose
of the assets. "Procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have to
pay to manage [the assets]. The stuff doesn't get better with age," Vento
said in a wire service article.
   Anticipating accusations of dumping, the Board justified its pledge to
move swiftly, saying that "holding properties off the market for an
extended period of time may increase the ultimate costs of asset
disposition because of the expenses associated with managing and financing
the property." It also noted the risks of deterioration if properties are
held in RTC's portfolio for long periods.
   "It is, therefore, important to begin returning assets to the private
sector as soon as feasible," the strategic plan states.
   Oversight Board President Daniel P. Kearney attempted to silence charges
of dumping real estate on depressed markets by explaining that it would
take several years for RTC to complete the "arduous" legal process of
taking clear title to its properties and readying them for the market.
   Christopher Kallivokas, president of Real Estate Recovery Inc., an asset
management firm based in Sterling, Va., agreed that fears of property
dumping were unfounded. Kallivokas argues that the RTC for the most part
won't be delivering new properties to the market. "Virtually every property
in the RTC's inventory has been available [to buyers] for some time under
their former ownership, whether it was a former S&L or FSLIC," he said.

Two S&Ls Added to Program

   RTC closed the year by taking over two small thrifts: the $70.9 million-
asset Columbia FSA, Webster, Tex., and the $27.5 million-asset Silver SA
FA, Silver City, N.M.
   During 1989 the agency resolved 37 institutions, as shown in the
breakdown below. Another 11 were advertised for sale in November, and those
transactions should be completed shortly.

Crafting the Rescue Process

   The Oversight Board's strategic plan instructs RTC to take specific
steps to assure that it resolves failed thrift institutions quickly and
inexpensively without threatening local financial and real estate markets.
Those instructions include:
   * Limit any new lending or investments by conservatorships to low-risk
assets.
   * By Jan. 15, develop a prioritization schedule for institutions to be
marketed and resolved.
   * By Jan. 15, develop plans for soliciting bids from all interested
qualified buyers, including procedures for encouraging the participation of
women and minorities in the bidding process.
   * By Jan. 15, develop procedures for making available to all potential
bidders full information on each institution under RTC control and for
notifying rejected bidders within 30 days.
   * By March 30, establish a national sales program to coordinate the
disposition of any financial assets held in conservatorship.
   * By March 30, report to the Oversight Board on the feasibility of
hedging RTC's overall interest rate exposure.
   * By Aug. 31, report to the Oversight Board and Congress on the review
of case resolutions entered into by FSLIC between Jan. 1, 1988, and Aug. 9,
1989.

RTC Fills Key Housing Post

   RTC has named Stephen S. Allen, a veteran of the non-profit housing
community, to serve as director of the agency's low-income housing program.
   Allen takes the helm of RTC's most politically sensitive area after 13
years with the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corp., where he was an associate
director in charge of neighborhood preservation projects. In that position,
he directed the group's development efforts in designing model
public/private partnerships for affordable housing.
   At his new post, Allen will direct and coordinate the sale of RTC's
residential properties to eligible buyers nationwide. An RTC statement said
he and his staff plan to work closely with state housing finance agencies,
various national non-profit housing organizations and governmental
associations to identify eligible buyers.

RTC Writes a Best Seller

   If only demand was this strong for RTC's real estate...
   The company handling inquiries and orders for the agency's newly
published property listings was flooded with more than 15,000 toll-free
calls in its first two days on the job.
   Those placing orders by phone last week were told by harried operators
that they probably would not receive their books for about a month - quite
a long time considering that RTC's Oversight Board just instructed the
liquidation agency to "avoid deferring the marketing of properties."
   Some calling the 800-number that leads to the Dallas headquarters of
American Airlines Direct Marketing Corp. received the following recorded
message: "Due to the overwhelming response to the Resolution Trust Corp.
program, all of our agents are busy. Please call back later." Others were
simply asked to hold for the next available agent.
   "It's very hectic" said one weary operator, who couldn't offer an
estimate for the number of orders placed by the 15,000 callers during the
first two days.
   Copies of the inventory report may be ordered by calling (800) 431-0600.
    The reports are priced at $10 each for the commercial and land volumes,
and $15 each for the single-family and multi-family residential reports.
The complete set is available for $50. Check, credit card or C.O.D. orders
are accepted.
   The same toll-free number may also be used to inquire about locating the
reports at one of 1,400 depository libraries throughout the country.

GRAPEVINE

   RTC's Dallas staff underwent a growth spurt last week when nearly 50
employees of the defunct Federal Asset Disposition Association joined the
bailout agency's regional office. The new recruits are filling asset
management, contracting and support positions at various levels. Among
those assuming key RTC posts will be former FADA contracting staffer Janie
Thomas, who will serve as senior contracting specialist in Dallas. Many
staffers from FADA's Atlanta office have joined RTC in that city, too.
   Asset managers are hoping RTC will sharpen its definition of "competing
properties" in the agency's conflict-of-interest rules. As currently
worded, the provision could preclude a contractor from managing West Coast
apartment buildings if that firm owned "competing" apartment buildings on
the East Coast. The industry's recommended solution: RTC's conflict rules
should concern themselves only with similar properties in the same
immediate, geographic market.
   Staffers at the RTC Oversight Board are zeroing in on appointees to
chair the national advisory board and each of six regional advisory panels.
The seven, who will comprise the national board, will help select the
remaining regional advisers. After sifting through scores of nominating
letters, the staff will soon eliminate the runners up and ask the Oversight
Board to okay their selections. The seven are expected to be named within
the next month or so.
   It looks like RTC's consolidated office network in the western region
may not be operational until spring, despite what was originally a January
target. The Denver-based operation, which was initially dealt a larger sum
of thrift assets than any other region, has been slow in establishing its
three field offices slated for Denver, Phoenix and somewhere in Orange
County, Calif. By contrast, the east region has already opened its four
field offices, and begun staffing. The Baton Rouge, La. office, for
instance, already employs 55.
   Staffers in the Baton Rouge field office are trying to remove the
mystique from RTC's registration process for aspiring contractors. Agency
officials will spend the next two Monday's conducting educational seminars
for firms in Louisiana and Mississippi.
   New England's real estate lenders took another pounding in the third
quarter. Veribanc Inc., a financial statistics firm in Wakefield, Mass.,
said real estate-related loans and real estate repossessed by New England
banks increased for the thirteenth consecutive quarter. At southwest banks,
however, the situation seems to have stabilized and - by some measures -
improved. Third-quarter figures for the S&L industry are still to come.

RTC's Regional Office Network Takes Shape

   It will take a few more months for RTC to finish staffing its regional
offices, though most key management positions have already been filled at
the four locations.
   Next on the agenda is building a network of consolidated field offices,
where much of the contracting work is expected to take place. The east and
central regions have begun organizing field offices, while the southwest
and west regions have not yet announced sites or managers for their
outposts.

Arbs Pan Bergen Brunswig/Ivax Deal

They Say the Transaction May Fall Through, or at Least it Should
Bergen Brunswig Corp.'s $1.66 billion stock deal with generic drug manufacturer
Ivax Corp. has some arbitrageurs scratching their heads, although analysts are
more positive on the deal.

The deal for financially trouble Ivax-a rare example of a drug wholesaler
buying a drug manufacturer-led to tumbles in both companies' stocks after it
was announced Tuesday. Bergen Brunswig fell $5.125, or 15.6%, to close at
$27.625, and Ivax dropped $3.75, or 21%, to close at $12.50, a 52-week low.

The deal followed Ivax's disclosure earlier this year that earnings would be
lower than anticipated and that the company would therefore violate its bank
covenants.

"It's a terrible deal and Bergen is nuts," said one arbitrageur.
"If the deal breaks, we think Ivax goes down considerably and Bergen Brunswig
won't move much," the arb added, giving the deal even odds of collapse.
"There's a lot of shareholder anger out there," he said.

Another arb said Bergen Brunswig is sure to annoy a lot of its suppliers and
will have to choose between their products and Ivax's. "Bergen Brunswig is
buying a company that does a lot of business with people they compete with," he
said.

If Bergen Brunswig shareholders vote against a deal with Ivax, it won't be the
first time Ivax got left at the altar. Shareholders of Halfslund Nycomed of
Norway rejected a stock swap with Ivax late last year.

But because insiders at both Ivax and Bergen Brunswig hold large amounts of
shares, any anti-deal sentiment doesn't much matter, a third arb said.

"If I'm a Bergen shareholder, I'd be very upset about the transaction," the arb
said. "But I don't think it's a deal killer."

The arb explained the Ivax drop as simple mathematics, offering that the .42
shares of Bergen Brunswig shares Ivax shareholders would receive for each of
theirs valued the stock at 11.6025, less than its trading level at the time.

"Maybe that's all Ivax could get," he said.
Not everyone was negative on the transaction. Analyst Kevin Silverman of Everen
Securities had good things to say about it. He suggested Ivax would give Bergen
Brunswig additional profits that would otherwise go to its suppliers.

"They're buying products from existing manufacturers and earning 15%,"
Silverman said. "The manufacturers are making 40%.

Combined with Bergen Brunswig's $2 billion in generic drug sales, the addition
of generic drugs manufactured at Ivax could add another $600 million to the top
line, he said.

"It makes perfect sense to me."
Silverman said Bergen Brunswig stock dropped because the deal brings dilution
of 30 cents per share and 30 cents times 15 equals $4.50.   "That's about what
the stock dropped on the first day," he said.

Another reason for the stock drops, Silverman said, is that such a deal has
never been done before. "People don't particularly like change and that's what
they're getting here."

Olympic Continues Search for Gold

But Followers of its Situation Suggest Only Fools Would Bite
Olympic Financial Ltd. continues to insist publicly that its search for a buyer
is moving ahead, but the search for a new CEO, the resignation of a board
member and the adoption of a poison pill have left observers wondering whether
Olympic will sell.

Minneapolis-based Olympic, the nation's largest independent provider of
automobile financing, is moving full speed ahead with its search for a new CEO.
Jeffrey Mack resigned as CEO on Aug. 26, the same day Olympic announced it was
entertaining an offer from an interested party.

Bob Ollech, an analyst with Principal Financial Securities, said he just
received a call from the headhunter employed by Olympic looking for leads for
its search. "According to her, they were in the early stages, still looking
around," Ollech said.

Mack was said to have balked at the idea of selling the company, according to
Ollech, but the board that he chose proved to be more powerful than him and
decided to move ahead with the plan despite his objections. Ollech added that
the search for a new CEO makes any sale even less likely.

"It certainly makes you think it's less likely to happen, only from a common
sense standpoint," Ollech said. "If they were to offer the CEO position to
someone, and in the same breath try to sell the company, they'd have a hard
time selling that job. On the other hand, they need a strong CEO to run
day-to-day operations in the event that they can't sell it anymore."

Jennifer Wykert, investor relations consultant for Olympic, described Olympic's
decision to step up its search as a "prudent action" to avoid having to start
from ground zero if a suitor with the right price fails to materialize.

The resignation of board member Rick Zona, which came around Oct. 22, after the
initial buyer declined to make an offer, raised even more eyebrows and
concerns, according to one analyst who asked not to be named.

Ollech speculated that there could have been a number of circumstances that
could have led to Zona's untimely departure. As the first theory goes, First
Bank Systems Inc. may have been looking seriously at buying Olympic, and Zona,
who is vice chairman of finance at the regional bank holding company, resigned
to avoid any possible conflict of interest. The second possibility was that
Zona had a "falling out" with the board about selling.

Third, Ollech continued, because Zona was on Olympic's audit committee, perhaps
there was something afoot in terms of the company's financial condition, or
credit quality. Another possibility is that he resigned for personal reasons.

In any case, the tumultuous activity has not helped Olympic's already volatile
stock, which hit a high of $26.625 in September. At presstime, Olympic's stock
was $15.75, which was a modest recovery from a recent $13.50 low.

Last month, Olympic announced that a first round of buyers had decided against
making definitive offers for the company. But it said a second group of suitors
that had been waiting in the wings were stepping in with their proposals,
including an outright sale, an equity infusion and a strategic alliance.

Then, on Nov. 4, Olympic adopted a poison pill to thwart any attempt at a
hostile takeover.

Pat McGurn, director of corporate programs with Institutional
Shareholder Services, said this move is not unusual. "Diana Corp. went through
a well-publicized shopping of itself and, in the end, decided not to do it at
all, and then adopted a poison pill," McGurn said.

One arbitrageur saw it more as a move of desperation. "Their stock tanked.
They're afraid somebody could come in and buy them on the cheap," the arb said.
"They may well be talking to people, but if they couldn't find a good buyer
when their stock was in the low $20s, how can they expect it when the stock is
at $15."

Meanwhile, an analyst who asked not to be named raised questions about
Olympic's ability to find a buyer. He said, "Olympic has a $2.20 per share
[earnings] estimate for '97. If someone really believed that $2.20 estimate,
why would they not be able to get someone? That's 12 or 13 times earnings."

A number of other analysts agreed that a sale does not seem to be in Olympic's
immediate future.

Robert Evans, an analyst with John G. Kinnard & Co., said Olympic is still
talking to three or four parties regarding the sale of the company, but, "I
don't know if it's at the same pace and sense of urgency as it was. In my
opinion, the company is probably not going to be acquired at least in the next
few weeks."
In its latest move, Olympic hedged its position by saying it had reevaluated
its price objective, leaving the door open to a slightly lower bid.

Nice-Guy Strategy Improves Zell's Odds

The Gravedancer Drops His Lawsuit and Goes After the Votes
Sam Zell is still zealously pursuing Chateau Properties, Inc., but now he's
using sugar instead of vinegar to catch his fly.

By dropping a lawsuit and his hostile tender offer via his Manufactured Home
Communities, Inc. (MHC), and tailoring his $387.3 million bid to management's
needs, he's revealing whose favor he's courting: the holders of operating
partnership (OP) units.

Sources debated whether the tactic would work. At presstime, Chateau announced
its rejection of MHC's bid, but that surely will not stop Zell in his tracks,
sources said.

"If anything, the likelihood of his succeeding has increased to say 75%/25%,"
an analyst said.

MHC currently is under agreement to merge with ROC Communities in a $TK million
deal. Chateau would have to reject Zell's offer or pony up a reported $10
million to $12 million break-up fee for its merger with ROC.

"[Chateau Chairman John Boll] may just be posturing to get the decks clean" by
betting shareholders won't approve the ROC merger. Then he would be free to
pursue the Zell offer.

Indeed, the outcome of ROC's and Chateau's proxy votes this week will play a
large role in whether the Chicago investor ultimately will attain his goal.

On one side were those who saw Zell losing out if he couldn't accomplish the
task of convincing shareholders to vote down the merger. On the other side were
those who believed shareholders would indeed disapprove the merger, leaving
Clinton Township, Mich.-based Chateau vulnerable to his advances.

The Chateau/ROC merger was universally panned by analysts. "This is a unique
situation where one plus one equals less than two," said one who declined to be
named. "I can't imagine two-thirds of ROC holders approving the deal," he
added, giving a higher probability to an eventual Zell win.

The latest MHC strategy consisted of a choice of $26 cash or a convertible
preferred security "designed to address the needs of Chateau OP Unit holders,"
according to a press release. The former bid offered to exchange $26 in cash or
1.15 MHC common share per Chateau share. Taxes would have removed about $4.50
per share from the cash offer, which is what the OP unit holders would have had
to take, sources said.

The initial plan also would have consumed resources that sources said are
better spent enticing Chateau.

"The tender offer would have dragged on for months. This was Zell's effort to
reach closure, a desire to merge sooner rather than later," said Louis Taylor,
an analyst with Prudential Securities.

Sources did agree that the new bid was superior and had a better chance of
success, but one said he'd hold off judgment until Englewood, Colo.-based ROC
holds its vote.

The dialogue surrounding the triangle-formerly a square when Sun Communities
weighed in with a bid for Chateau-has been decidedly one-sided, said
Christopher Hartung, an analyst with Montgomery Securities.

"MHC is the only one we've heard from," he said. "They've got a great marketing
machine. Because Chateau and ROC have been limited as to what they can say, we
haven't heard the whole story," Hartung added.

Additionally, the MHC line has been that its bid offered a generous multiple in
an undervalued industry. But with Chateau's stock price at $24.375 at
presstime, Zell's bid confers on Chateau a premium of only 6%, hardly the 21%
of the original offer.

That said, now that Chateau turned down Chicago-based MHC's bid, it could face
shareholder charges that it breached its fiduciary duty. "They'll have to ask
if management is making decisions based on economics or emotions," said Taylor.
"Are they fighting for the company or for their long term employment?" he
added.

Officials at the three companies, all of which own and operate mobile home
parks, did not return phone calls *Kate Maletz.

Restructuring  Coming For Fitzgeralds Gamin:

A prepackaged restructuring seems to be in the offing for beleaguered
Fitzgeralds Gaming Corp., as both debt and equity are held by fewer than a
dozen groups, sources said.

As the private, Las Vegas-based operator of hotels and casinos, heads into
December with an $8 million interest payment looming large, interest coverage
is barely one to one, sources said. And while Fitzgeralds CFO Fernando
Bensuaski said the company "intends" to make the payment, he could make no
assurances.

He added that the company is in the process of trying to secure financing from
institutional investors, whom he would not identify. And while Bensuaski flatly
denied a bankruptcy is impending, sources didn't buy it.

The culprit, sources said, is the usual one: a combination of too much debt on
a company in an out-of-favor, and highly competitive industry.

One distressed source saw one of three scenarios likely: the bondholders will
gain equity in a new company, the casinos will be sold off piecemeal, or a
combination of the two will occur.

Fitzgeralds' bonds-$123 million in 13% senior secured notes due 2002-are thinly
traded and last sold for 72 in mid September. The issue was a year old on
Saturday.

Management owns about 80% of the common stock. The company also has issued $20
million in preferred stock and $25 million in mixed tranches including $18
million in notes secured on the company's Reno property with interest at prime
plus one.

The 13%s are owned by "less than half a dozen" holders, with Putnam Investments
possessing the bulk, a source said. Putnam's analyst Herb Wagner declined to
comment.

The concentration of notes in few hands could mean a quick end to Fitzgeralds'
suffering. "Maybe they [the holders] could force a restructuring that's
beneficial to them," said Kevin Pilot, the president of Phoenix Capital. And
while Bensuaski insisted no talks about bankruptcy have taken place, the market
was saying a restructuring was in the offing.

"As long as they can make payroll, it makes sense for them to make some kind of
deal," with the bondholders, said Andrew Susser, an analyst with Moody's
Investors Service, which downgraded the 13%s from B3 to Caa Nov. 7.

"The question is, can they compete long term?" Susser said. "That's a call the
noteholders have to make."

A gaming analyst who requested anonymity said, "Long term, it's a tough
company. There is a future in this company."

Fitzgeralds has made some significant capital expenditures recently, including
hotel rooms in its Tunica, Miss., satellite and new restaurants in its Las
Vegas and Tunica locations. Sources said the investment could pay off.

But in the meantime, the company's "high leverage, low liquidity, weak cash
flows, heavy amortization schedule, and competitive pressures in each if its
key markets," remain a problem, according to Moody's.

Bensuaski said Fitzgeralds' plans include seeking capital with the help of
Southcoast Capital Corp., an investment bank it hired in August. It could not
be determined why Oppenheimer & Co. was no longer representing Fitzgerald.

The company hasn't released its third quarter numbers yet, but "we don't expect
great results," said the gaming analyst. He added he expected earnings would be
flat compared with last year.

Fitzgeralds' troubles hang against a backdrop of an industry saturated with
players. The entire gaming sector is hurting, sources said, especially in
Tunica, where the company just completed construction on a 507 room hotel,
Fitzgeralds Tunica. Competition in the area is fierce, Susser said, and the
addition of Harrah's Mardi Gras and Grand Casinos earlier this year have
increased the number of gaming positions by 40%.

The Reno, Nev. outpost, Silver Legacy, saw steep room-rate discounting and
lower margins due in part to the absence of a major bowling tournament. Bowling
events, though, should draw people to the area in 1997 and 1998, but room rates
could drop further as more hotels are scheduled to open in the city *Kate
Maletz.

Reconfigured Deal For FoxMeyer

McKesson Corp. renegotiated the terms of its purchase of bankrupt
FoxMeyer Corp., working out a deal that a source said "won't even cover
lawyer's fees."

A Delaware court approved the transaction whereby McKesson pays $20 million to
$23 million in cash to the bankrupt estate. Then, the first $20 million that
the company collects in receivables would go to McKesson, and the next $10
million in receivables will be split 50%/50% by McKesson and the estate,
according to the source who was present at an auction hearing on Nov. 8. The
remainder would go to the estate, and would pay off professional fees.

The former deal saw McKesson paying $80 million in cash, which would be held in
escrow for about six months, sources said.

The source said vendors complained about the new arrangement and that the money
would be difficult to collect. Robert Peiser, the company's vice chairman and
CEO, theorized that with the outstanding receivables amounting to $90 million,
and McKesson skimming off the first $25 million, the receivables could reach
$70 million to $75 million.

"I think that's insane," the source said. "It's complex, it's not that easy to
recover."

The unsecured trade claims dipped back to the 10 to 12 range from the 15 to 20
they were at the week before on the news of the reconfigured deal. "Rumors that
another company would come in [with a better bid] had held up the unsecured
trade claims," the source said *Kate Maletz.

DOj takes new Mergers approach

The Department of Justice's Antitrust Division's broadening of traditional
legal reviews of anticompetitive issues allows for fairer analyses of
horizontal mergers, the acting head of the division said in a recent speech.

Speaking earlier this month before the American Bar Association in Washington,
Joel Klein said the DOJ now looks beyond the two traditionally recognized
methods of antitrust analysis: "per se" and "rule of reason."

According to the Supreme Court, per se mergers, which account for a small
minority of cases, are those "because of their pernicious effect on competition
and lack of any redeeming virtue are conclusively presumed to be unreasonable.
Rule of reason analyses require a comprehensive market analyses of pro- and
anti-competitive effects.

"A reasonable mode of antitrust analysis needn't always require full-blown
assessments of market effects," Klein said. "Some middle ground between the two
traditional approaches often makes sense.

"Matters that are too complex for per se condemnation sometimes get shoe horned
into that category, while some  anticompetitive practices without any
demonstrable virtue escape condemnation because of insufficient evidence to
satisfy the requirements of a full-blown market analysis," he said.

Rather than restrict itself to the per se and rule of reason  polar
alternatives, the DOJ, Klein said, uses a three-step approach when considering
whether horizontal mergers would directly limit price or production competition

The first step, he said, is to decide whether the deal would be a per se
violation, such as an agreement to fix prices, curtail output or divide
markets. Once the DOJ concludes a horizontal deal is not per se illegal, he
continued, the agency then asks the parties involved whether there's a
"procompetitive justification" for the agreement.

"We expect a response that doesn't merely speculate about the existence of
efficiencies, but rather comes forward with real world factual and expert
economic evidence to support the claim," he said.

If the DOJ finds significant procompetitive benefits to a deal, Klein said, the
agency then looks at whether likely anti-competitive effects would outweigh
them. "The key point I want to stress," he said, "is that only if there are
real procompetitive benefits should there be any need to show actual
anticompetitive effects."

Using such analyses, Klein said, should open the door to at least some
additional consideration of procompetitive justifications for horizontal
mergers. On the other hand, he added, the approach also ensures that facially
anticompetitive, but potentially justifiable, agreements are not automatically
given green lights simply because they can't be condemned as per se illegal.

"By requiring proof of procompetitive benefits, we're lessening the burden of
proving a violation compared to what we'd have to show under a full-blown rule
of reason analysis," he said *Richard Rubin.

Arbs Miffed at AIM's Abstention

Arbs were seething that one Wallace Computer Services, Inc. shareholder
abstained from a Nov. 6 vote on whether shareholders have a voice in takeovers.

AIM Strategic Income Fund, a closed-end management investment company,
abstained, after initially signaling it was in favor of the proposed bylaw
change that would require Wallace's board to hold a shareholder vote within 90
days after it received a qualified bid in order to keep up a defensive posture
against the offer. An AIM spokesman verified that the fund abstained on the
vote.

The absence of its four million votes prevented a quorum and ensured a victory
for Wallace's board, which has defended its refusal to consider a 1995 bid from
Moore Corp., an arbitrageur said.

Now some investors are protesting by refusing to buy AIM funds, the arb said.
"In no way was AIM acting in the best interest of its shareholders by taking
its stock out of play," he added *Kate Maletz.

TI May Sell off Defense and Electronics Units

While Texas Instruments denies it, the industry was abuzz with rumors that the
Dallas semiconductor giant would sell off its defense systems and electronics
business subsidiaries.

A decline in U.S. defense spending and consolidation in the industry are
reasons Texas Instruments would be looking to rid itself of the operations,
said Michael Geran, an analyst with Pershing Investment Research.

"The equipment side of their [the Pentagon's] budget has been whacked. You've
got a situation where the whole industry is changing and you have to put up the
crown jewels to see what they're worth," he added.
Possible acquirors for the units are McDonnell Douglas Corp., Raytheon Co.,
Northrup Grumman and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes Electronics.

Texas Instruments declined to comment on the speculation, saying only that the
company had not made any announcements.

TI posted a third quarter net loss of $148 million, or 78 cents per share
(including a one-time $192 million acquisition-related charge) on revenue of
$2.8 billion, compared to net income of $289 million, or $1.48 per share, on
revenue of $3.4 billion the year-earlier period.

According to the company, revenue for the businesses was up slightly over the
year-earlier period and margins remained stable.

Without the charge, net income was $44 million, or 23 cents per share.  The
company would not break out numbers on the units.

Griffon Exits Hardware Biz

Focusing on its core operations, Griffon Corp. has decided to sell its
specialty hardware business as part of an effort to eliminate divisions that do
not fit into its long-term growth plans.

The specialty hardware business, together with the synthetic batting division,

break-even level, according to the company. The two businesses had been
reclassified as disconfrom the sales, estimated at
$8 million, will be used to acquire shares und60s," the
spokesman said. "They have been marginally profitable. In fact, we haven't even
publicized them as part of our division for many years. It was just time. They
don't have anything to do with our three major divisions."

Griffon, noted for its diversity of products, has businesses that manufacture
garage doors, specialty plastic films used in diapers and other personal
products, and information and communication systems.

Champion Builds Future With Redman

Cited by Fortune as one of the "100 Fastest Growing Companies in America,"
Champion Enterprises, the second-largest manufactured housing producer in the
U.S., grew another 75% in October when it acquired number three Redman
Industries  in a $367 million stock swap.

The new company, with 1995 pro forma sales of $1.4 billion, is nipping at the
heels of industry leader  Fleetwood Enterprises, with sales of $2 billion.

Champion, based in Auburn Hills, Mich., has grown from being No. 5 to No. 2 in
three years through high internal growth as well as acquisitions, said
Jacqueline Dout, Champion's CFO. Dallas-based Redman was Champion's seventh
acquisition in two-and-a-half years, she said.

"It was a tremendous acquisition," said Troy Ussery, an analyst at Rauscher
Pierce Refsnes. "It brought Champion to the position of being one of the
largduct line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "We
are similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing in
housing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different price
points so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,
explained Jeoff Stern, Champiobig percentage of
the industry. Fleetwood holds about 20% and the next four share the next 40% to
50% of the market. The remaining 30% of the industry is split among another 100
companies.

Making a Geographic  Fit
In addition to the growth factor, the other major motivation behind the
acquisition was geographic: a natural merger of two similar, regional companies
that, together, would serve almost the entire country.

"Their product line complements our product line very nicely," Dout said. "We
are similar in the fact that we focus on mid- to high-end manufacturing in
housing, but in most areas of the country we're at slightly different price
points so we complement each otherd financial advisor to Redman. At that time,
explained Jeoff Stern, Champion's advisor and a managing director at Donaldson
Lufkin & Jenrette, Champion was a much smaller company, Redman was private, and
the two CEOs shared a strong mutual respect.

But it wasn't until June 5 of this year that Alexander, on Redman's behalf,
approached Young at an industry conference about a possible deal. It would be
the only company Redman would talk to.

"I approached no one else" but Champion, said Alexander. "It was Sturgess'
view-and he had spoken with members of his board-that the commonality of focus
in terms of business strategy, and yet the differences in the physical
locations of facilities, made this a combination that was a win-win for both
sides, which doesn't happen often today."

Young met with Sturgess and the financial advisors of both companies almost a
month later to pursue the stock transaction. After that, things moved rather
quickly.

A rumor of illness at the top of Redman may have contributed to the speed with
which the deal was done, according to one source who asked not to be
ideh. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,
and its quality and depth of management," U diligence, the group met again to
discuss a range of exchange ratios, the midpoint of which was 1.24 Champion
shares per Redman share. The ratio and the deal were soon settled upon.

A pooling transaction was important to the deal, Dout said. "By merging the two
companies together, it makes us stronger financially and operationally. This
way both shareholders win. We always go for a win-win proposition."

Although analysts uniformly agreed that Champion paid a higher multiple of
operating profit for Redman than previous acquisitions-6.4 times EBITDA
compared to an average 3.9 times-they also agreed that Champion got its money's
worth. "Redman deserved a slightly higher price because of its sheer magnitude,
and its quality and depth of management," Ussery said.

"The big question is: 'What's next?,'" said Ussery. "Champion will clearly
benefit in the upcoming year from the Redman acquisition, but we have several
other major competitors who will run out of steam in 1997 without an
acquisition. This is the tip of the iceberg."

Ussery added that when using the same evaluation as the Redman acquisition,
Belmont Homes, the nation's eleventh largest manufactured home builder, would
be around $16 a share; so at its current price of $10.50, it's bound to be
raising eyebrows-with Champion or other industry players.

"With Redman, the immediate need for more acquisitions isn't as great for
Champion, but Walt [Young] has never been one to pass up a bargain," Ussery
said Alena Joy Berenblatt.

FANNIE LIMIT MOVE TO $207,000 IMMINENT

Fannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conforming
loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to
$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industry
sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its customers to raise
its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect Jan. 1,
sources said. And the agency, which had maintained that would fully
consider the views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make
its announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of the agency's higher limit.
        However, those occurrences may not have qualified as a trend.
Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie raised
its limits, and a Freddie spokesperson couldn't confirm whether the company
had actually seen an increase in commitments, offering that it had no
updated data to support that conclusion.
        But in talks with its customers over the last month, Jeffers said
Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the change in the
marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew that to be a real
possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to Freddie, "though it's
too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be surprised."
        Freddie Mac decided to raise its limits in December to match a rise
is the Federal Housing Finance Board's home price index. Both Fannie and
Freddie's loan limits are statutorily tied to the index, but Fannie opted
not to raise its limits, thus making the conforming loan limits different
for each agency for the first time ever.
        The debate over raising the limits revolves around the FHFB index,
an economic indicator that has declined each of the last two years. Despite
declines in 1993 and 1994, neither government-sponsored enterprise lowered
its loan limit, decisions that garnered criticism from Congress and HUD
Secretary Henry Cisneros. But declines in home price index are considered
anomalies, so when the index rose for the first time in three years in
November, Freddie lifted its limit to match the increase; Fannie kept its
limit at $203,150. Freddie's critics immediately charged that agency had
raised the limit without considering the previous year's decreases.
        Freddie's decision also  sparked the ire of some in the thrift
industry who contended that the agency is encroaching on the lower crust of
the jumbo loan market niche it has carved out. Freddie Mac argues, however,
that that is not the case, noting that only 1% of all its 1994 loan
purchases were for the loan limit maximum.
        Lawmakers chided Freddie for its decision and praised Fannie for
maintaining its limit. Privately, House Banking Committee sources
acknowledged that the market was likely to force Fannie to raise its limit.
        Freddie's decision also affected the Federal Housing
Administration. Although Freddie's loan limits are tied to FHFB's index,
FHA's limits are tied to Freddie Mac's conforming loan limit. So when
Freddie upped its limits, it inadvertently raised FHA's. HUD pondered
whether it had the statutory authority to avoid raising the limits, but
after a week of review it concluded that it too had to make an increase.
Minus the statutory authority to force Freddie or FHA to maintain its
limits, one House Banking Committee staffer expected the issue to be taken
up by Congress early in 1996.
        The differing loan limits has caused problems for lenders, the
biggest of which are the costs associated with having to split their
portfolios between Fannie and Freddie, said Vicki Vidal, director of
government agency relations for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "Anything
above the Fannie limit must be segregated from Freddie pools and that takes
manpower and diligence," she said. "In some cases a (computerized) system
can tell you, but some for some lenders the actual physical shipping and
handling has to be done."
        Some Fannie-exclusive lenders also faced the additional costs of
switching to Freddie Mac's system. One mortgage industry lobbyist said that
with mortgage origination margins thin anyway, some lenders weren't look
fondly upon switching, primarily because of the costs associated and the
time it would take to retrain their staffs.

SEC ISSUES DERIVATIVE ACCOUNTING RULE

The Securities and Exchange Commission said its proposed
regulations on derivatives disclosure are aimed at closing three kinds of
problems it found during an extensive review of company reports, but the
initial reaction of some thrift lenders is that the rule may be redundant.
        The SEC proposed amending its regulations to clarify and expand its
existing requirements for financial statement footnote disclosures about
registrants' accounting policies for derivative financial instruments.
Specifically, the proposed rule changes would affect SEC Regulations S-X,
S-K and various forms including Form 20-F. The proposed amendments were
published in the Jan. 8 Federal Register; comments are due to the SEC by
May 7.
        "This rule appears to be much farther reaching than one would
initially conclude," said Marti Sworobuk, accounting manager for America's
Community Bankers. ACB's accounting committee hasn't reviewed the proposed
regulation yet, but Sworobuk offered that "it doesn't appear to be so much
as a derivative disclosure as it is a document intended to require
financial institutions to disclose how they manage interest rate risk," she
said.
        Under the proposed rule, she said, SEC-regulated institutions would
be required to disclose of whatever they are doing to manage risk, such as
hedging risk by using loan portfolios or by matching the terms of their
funding sources. "It doesn't just involve derivative instruments," she
said.
        Sworobuk said ACB may be interested in how much additional burden
the rule would put on thrifts--if any. "The SEC should recognize that some
financial institutions are already submitting the same kind of information
to banking regulators," she said, speaking of the Consolidated
Maturity/Rate Schedule, or CMR, that thrifts are already required to submit
to the Office of Thrift Supervision. Other banking regulators are expected
to implement similar disclosures later this year, Sworobuk added, possibly
as soon as June.
        "These disclosures provided to the agencies under FIDICIA 305 would
meet the requirements initiated by the SEC," she said.
        The SEC amendments would only affect publicly traded institutions,
but it is also likely to have an effect on the business strategies of
acquisition-minded commercial banks, mortgage banks and thrifts. Merger
activity among banks has been strong over the last year, and SEC-regulated
lenders may have to more closely consider the derivative accounting
practices of any institution they've targeted for acquisition.
        "The proposed amendments were developed after extensive review by
the SEC staff of disclosures made by approximately 500 registrants and
consideration of the findings of studies published by various public and
private sector organizations," said SEC Chief Accountant Michael H. Sutton.
"The commission is hopeful that the proposed disclosures are responsive to
concerns of investors and will head to more useful disclosures about
derivatives and other related instruments."
        The SEC wants to improve what it considers inadequate disclosures
about companies' accounting policies. Its proposal would require "enhanced
descriptions in the footnotes to the financial statements of accounting
policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity
instruments," the agency said.
        The agency is also looking to improve companies' disclosures of
market risk, which the SEC said applies to financial instruments other than
derivatives. Here the agency said it wants to see both quantitative and
qualitative disclosures. For quantitative disclosures, the agency is
proposing three alternatives from which firms would be free to choose.
These are:
         Tables showing expected cash flows and related contract terms
categorized by expected maturity dates.
         Sensitivity analysis showing the possible loss in earnings, fair
values or cash flows of market risk sensitive instruments from certain
hypothetical changes in rates or prices.
         Value at risk disclosures showing the  potential loss in earnings,
fair values or cash flows of market risk over a selected period of time
from events with selected probabilities of occurrence.
        The qualitative disclosures about market risk would cover how a
company manages its exposures with "a description of the objectives,
general strategies and instruments, if any, used to manage those
exposures."
 The third kind of problem the SEC wants to correct occurs when firms do
not provide information about derivatives tied to other activities that are
disclosed.
        "For example, when the information is required to be disclosed in
the footnotes to the financial statements about interest rates and
repricing characteristics of debt obligations, registrants should include,
when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives," the SEC said.
        "Similarly, summary information and disclosures in Management's
Discussion and Analysis ("MD&A") about the cost of debt obligations should
include, when material, disclosure of the effects of derivatives."
        In light of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995,
the SEC said it would look at ways provide a safe harbor where appropriate
in the derivatives disclosures. These particular proposals would generally
not apply to mutual funds or small business issuers, although some of the
disclosures could be required under separate regulations.
        The SEC said it will take comment on the proposals until May and
expects to revisit the rules after five years.

IRS FINALIZES DEBT FORGIVENESS REGULATION

The Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of discharge
of indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than the
proposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for comment
in 1993.
        America's Community Bankers reacted to the new rule by saying it
"substantially mitigated" the compliance burden on the lending industry
imposed by the temporary rule. For example, said James O'Connor, tax lawyer
for the ACB, the "indebtedness" on which reporting is required to limited
to stated principal and does not include interest and penalties.
        Rick Steinegar, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association's tax
subcommittee and director of taxes for GE Capital Mortgage Corp. said the
rules "are an improvement over the proposed rule." For example, it gives
entities covered by the regulation until Dec. 26 to gear up to comply.
Moreover, it gives specific instances where disclosure is triggered, unlike
the proposed rule, which provided a less-specific "facts and circumstances"
criteria that would have made it more difficult for institutions to
determine if compliance was required.
        Steinegar also noted that the final rule will only apply to
"applicable financial entities," such as direct or indirect units of bank
or thrift holding companies and government-sponsored enterprises. That does
not cover independent mortgage bankers, he said.
        Independent mortgage bankers would be required to comply only when
they acted as a servicer for a government-sponsored enterprise, such as
GNMA, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the VA.
        "It is much more specific and easy to comply with," he said.
        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, require
financial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C information
returns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600
or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders because
they say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven in
excess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.
        But lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating
the need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS
for several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need to
forgive debt.
        The final rules are effective for discharges of indebtedness
occurring after Dec. 21, 1996. No penalties will be imposed by the IRS for
failures to file until then, O'Connor said.

NOTEBOOK


HUD Finalizes Reg
For HECM Endorsements
        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage program will now find processing these loans without approval from
the department easier.
        HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approved
lenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its direct
endorsement program. Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17,
but the final rule, which appears in the Dec. 21 Federal Register, makes
the change official; it also completes one of many streamlining procedures
HUD has initiated over the last several months.
        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECM
that lenders have not issued a conditional commitment is eligible for
direct endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insured
before Sept. 15, 1995 must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUD
office for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance.
        If HUD deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it
will give the lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE
program. o
Freddie Revises Rules
For Balloons and Resets
        Freddie Mac seller/servicers will need to contact reset and balloon
mortgage borrowers about 50 days earlier than they're used to, according to
revisions that Freddie Mac has made to its seller/servicer guide.
Under the revised guidelines, which were announced in Bulletin 95-13,
lenders must now notify borrowers between 100 and 110 days before the
loan's maturity date, if not required sooner by law. Under Freddie's
previous guidelines, lenders were required to contact borrowers at least 60
days before the balloon maturity date. Additionally, Freddie said it has
added information that servicers must include in the notification, and has
also provided more guidance to lenders in working with borrowers who do not
meet reset conditions and can't pay off their balloon/reset mortgages.
Freddie said the new requirement would take effect June 1. o
HUD Reaches Accords
With Nine FHA Lenders
        Nine FHA-approved lenders reached settlement agreements with HUD
for a variety of irregular actions involving Federal Housing Administration
programs, the department announced Dec. 12.
        The department's Mortgagee Review Board, which investigated the
lenders based on suggestions from HUD field offices, cited The Money Store,
Sacramento, Calif., for violations of HUD-FHA Title I property improvement
loan requirements. Specifically, the board said TMS failed to properly
service Title I loans, did not submit timely FHA insurance claims and
failed to report timely the sale of Title I notes and transfers of
insurance reserves. As a settlement agreement, TMS agreed to pay HUD
$35,000, cancel insurance on several loans and submit to future reviews by
the department.
        Among the other eight lenders HUD reached settlements with in
December was the New England National Mortgage Corporation, Andover, Mass.,
which was cited for permitting non-exclusive employees to originate FHA
loans, and First American Mortgage Co., Sulphur Springs, Texas, which was
cited for permitting borrowers to hand-carry verifications of employment
and failing to perform face-to-face interviews. New England National agreed
to pay an undisclosed civil money penalty and First American agreed to
indemnify HUD for claim losses. Both also agreed to implement corrective
actions.
        Other settlement agreements included: Western Fidelity Mortgage
Co., Salt Lake City; Pacific Inland Mortgage Corp., Anaheim Hills, Calif.;
Interbank Funding Group, San Diego; Mortgage America Nationwide, Grand
Terrace, Calif.; Unifed Mortgage Corp., San Diego; and Z and Z Funding
Group, San Diego. As part of the settlement, the lenders do not admit to
any fault or liability. o
Fed Offers Video
On Home Buying Process
        The Federal Reserve Board is offering an educational video for
consumers it hopes will enlighten prospective home buyers on the nuances of
obtaining a mortgage.
        The video, entitled "Both Borrower and Lender," is designed for
first-time home buyers and is divided into four segments: Financial
preparedness; types and terms of mortgages; the mortgage application
process; and settlement and closing. The entire program is roughly two
hours long with each segment runs about 30 minutes.
        The video can be reviewed on the American Bankers Association
satellite network, American Financial Skylink, Jan. 30, and is available
for single or bulk purchase from VIDICOPY at a rate of $12.95 each for
orders of 30 or fewer copies; orders of above 31 or more copies are
available for $11.45 each.
For more information, write to: VIDICOPY, 650 Vaqueros Ave., Sunnyvale
Calif., 94086, or call (800) 708-7080. Information on Skylink is available

FANNIE JOINS RURAL HOUSING SERVICE'S AMERICAN INDIAN PILOT PROGRAM

Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certain
American Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated with
lending on tribal trust lands. Starting in January, Fannie will begin
taking part in the Rural Housing Service's Rural Housing Native American
pilot, but will limit its initial participation to 10 tribes.
        The eligible tribes include: Gila River, Arizona; Navajo Nation,
Arizona; San Juan Pueblo, New Mexico; Pala Band of All Mission, California;
Salish-Kootenai, Montana; Chippewa-Cree, Montana; Seminole Nation, Florida;
Cheyenne River Sioux, South Dakota; Lac Courte Oreilles, Wisconsin; and
Omaha, Nebraska.
        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed
$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they have
a good working relationship with RHS and the Bureau of Indian Affairs,
although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added later in the
pilot.
        RHS has also determined that these tribes have a judicial system
that supports mortgage lending and are receptive to using debt refinancing
for new and existing homes. They are likely to approve the required legal
documents without extensive changes, and have at least 10 tribal members
who have sufficient income and credit histories to qualify for a mortgage,
Fannie said.
        In a related issue, Fannie (Announcement 95-21) has clarified that
it does not place a limitation on the number of Section 184 Indian Housing
Authority mortgages it will buy. In Announcement 95-06, the company said
those loans would be considered as being secured investment properties.
This prompted questions, the agency said, about whether a borrower
financing a number of properties is eligible.

Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit


Washington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, First
Franklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.

Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around its
mortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.

First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold the
company to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.

Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now.

"A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not get
a good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," a
senior mortgage official said.

One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - which
controls First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,
"but likely won't.

"They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the broker
said, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd take
it."

The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ bought
the company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't going
to look good."

One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I think
the merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."

First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin Mortgage
Corp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,
servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.

In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestation
repo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.

Low-Mod Mortgage is Freddie's Largest


Far Rockaway, NY-The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has purchased its
largest mortgage loan ever, a $44.43 million multifamily mortgage secured by
Wavecrest Gardens, a 1,657-unit complex here.

Larson Financial Resources, a Program Plus lender based in Somerset, NJ, was
the originator of this mortgage, which was made to Goldfarb Properties, the
owner of the complex.

The mortgage is a 20-year fixed-rate loan with a gross spread of 175 basis
points over Treasuries, with a loan-to-value ratio of 75% and a debt service
coverage ratio of 1.38.

Freddie Mac's previous largest loan purchase was for $30 million in the
Chicago area.  Its average loan size for multifamily is $5 million.  It
traditionally has made loans on smaller properties.

Wavecrest Gardens is affordable to households with income of $34,000 or less,
which is 80% of the local median income.  The complex has no subsidized
apartments.

Thus this loan helps Freddie Mac meet its affordable housing mandates as
established by Congress for both low and moderate income families and for
central cities.  Far Rockaway is part of New York City.

Leland Brendsel, chairman and chief executive of Freddie Mac, said this
transaction "shows our strong commitment to multifamily lending."

The company has found that contributing to the deterioration of multifamily
housing are situations where owners are under economic distress.

It is important to create an economic situation where the owner can maintain
the building, Mr.  Brendsel said.

Freddie Mac is looking to work with high quality lenders like Larson and high
quality owners like Goldfarb that are committed to maintain the properties
they own, he added

Thomas J.  Watt, senior vice president, multifamily housing, added that the
deal is "tangible evidence of Freddie Mac's ongoing commitment to New York
City."

He likened Wavecrest Gardens to a community, with medical offices in a number
of buildings, an adjacent shopping center and even housing the local office of
Rep.  Floyd Flake, D., NY.

Rep.  Flake, whose tenancy mirrors the nearly 10 years that Goldfarb has
controlled Wavecrest Gardens, said the owner's "commitment far exceeds what
they've put in in dollars."

Since acquiring the complex, Goldfarb has done massive renovations to 70% of
the apartments.  The new loan will allow the owners to continue renovations
and make other improvements.

"Freddie Mac's financing of such a sizable, multifamily apartment complex
demonstrates its commitment to the stability of New York City's rental housing
market and to urban communities that have a vested interest in affordable
housing," Mr.  Flake said.

As of the end of November, Freddie Mac had purchased $180 million of
multifamily mortgages in the New York City area.

Mr.  Brendsel said the company expects to purchase $2 billion in multifamily
loans during 1995.

FASB Report Details Derivatives Disclosures


Norwalk, CT-Federal Accounting Standards Board disclosure of derivatives
holdings by several businesses - including several mortgage industry players -
are available in a recent 100-page report by the agency for $11 a copy.

Among the institutions studied are:  Astoria Federal Savings, Bank of America,
Chase Manhattan and Chemical banks, Citicorp, Crestar Financial, First
Chicago, Hibernia Savings Bank, Huntington Bancshares, J.P.  Morgan, Merrill
Lynch and Nationsbanc.

The report details several institutions' compliance with the 1994 FASB
Statement 119 that required business holdings such as swaps, options, futures
and forwards to record the fair value of these financial instruments in
certain ways on their balance sheets.

Statement 119 set new disclosure requirements for many futures market
derivatives that are not mortgage instruments, but often trade in the same
circles.

Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan


Washington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association last
Wednesday announced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that
sent the company's stock up 5.25 points to $125 a share.

Fannie Mae stock has gained 15 points since Dec.  18.

"It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investors
at the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith Barney
Inc.

"And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.
It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.
O'Donnell said.

The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.

First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion in
preferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere in
the range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.

Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to the
Fannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activities
through the end of this decade.

FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but this
contribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordable
housing to $50-$70 million a year.

Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, but
analysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandated
affordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses going
forward.

Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of the
shares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believe
these buybacks will take place in 1997.

"With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably above
the statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand our
commitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive James
Johnson said.

Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.
Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion.

"The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae a
more diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have more
than one funding source," he added.

FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,
also gave its stamp of approval.

"Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company's
compliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that is
withdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirements
for core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Mac
currently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.

A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stock
split.

Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in the
four-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.

Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split
"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individual
investors."

Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996
per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target price
on Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases.

"With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock should
perform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.

FNMA, NBA Teams Join Up for Rehabs


Boston-The Federal National Mortgage Association has formed partnerships with
10 National Basketball Association teams to rehabilitate housing in the
surrounding neighborhoods of the various teams.

Rehabilitation has begun on the second of five properties in Boston where FNMA
teamed up with the Boston Celtics and the city government to provide
renovation funds.

The rehabilitation will be financed with a grant of $125,000 from the Fannie
Mae Foundation, an undisclosed sum from the Boston Celtics and $100,000 from
the city of Boston.

The project is managed by Nuestra Comunidad, a nonprofit organization that
provides housing for low- and moderate-income families.

Employees of Fannie Mae and the Celtics will work together on the rehab.

Fannie Mae recently formed its partnership with the Atlanta Hawks.  It will
involve Hawks players and staff and Fannie Mae employees in consumer education
efforts to promote homeownership.

The Hawks Home Team along with Fannie Mae staff will participate in the
rehabilitation of two homes for low-income families in Atlanta's Martin Luther
King Jr.  historic district.

The project is managed by the Historic District Development Corp.  and funded
with a $75,000 grant from the Foundation.

As part of the Hawks partnership, Fannie Mae will become a broadcast sponsor
of the Hawks' games, airing advertisements that offer viewers free information
on becoming a homeowner.

Fannie Mae's partnership with the Houston Rockets will sponsor the
construction of two homes in Houston's Fifth Ward neighborhood.

The construction will be managed by the Fifth Ward Community Redevelopment
Corp., a local nonprofit.

The Foundation provided a grant of $75,000.

Fannie Mae also became a broadcast sponsor for the Rockets' games.

In addition to the Celtics, Hawks, and Rockets, Fannie Mae has formed
partnerships with NBA teams in Seattle; Oakland, CA; Cleveland; San Antonio;
Milwaukee; Charlotte, NC:  Portland, OR; and Washington, DC.

By the end of the 1994-95 season, Fannie Mae's Home Team partnerships with NBA
teams have built or rehabilitated 29 homes in inner-city communities and the
Foundation has made more than $900,000 in grants to local nonprofit
organization to support the effort.

GSE Stocks Seen Staying High in '96


New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been trading
near or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,
should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.

Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for both
stocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The question
is whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100
stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."

Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies to
numerous factors.

"Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could be
because a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end of
the year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble while
the financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both represent
conservative financials - a good place to be.

Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are very
good, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondary
market.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been very
positive, and this attracts investors."

Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,
according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that the
stocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doing
reasonably well in recent weeks.

But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlook
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.

Asset Disposition Roundup


Washington-The Federal National Mortgage Association is consolidating all of
its property management and disposition functions to the Southwestern Regional
Office in Dallas.

The change will allow the secondary mortgage market company to dispose of
acquired properties "more quickly and efficiently," said Robert Engelstad,
senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards.

It also will enable the agency to offer lenders a full range of services "that
were previously available only in areas where we had large concentrations of
properties," Mr.  Engelstad said in a recent lender-letter.

However, Fannie Mae has elected to keep the post-foreclosure underwriting and
servicing review functions performed by each regional office in those offices.

"To assure a more consistent application of our underwriting and servicing
policies, we feel it is more appropriate to assign the responsibility ...  to
the servicer's leader regional office, particularly since that office is the
one that is already performing post-purchase underwriting reviews and
monitoring a servicer's delinquent loan servicing performance," the letter
explained.

The Dallas office will assume responsibility for managing and disposing of
properties acquired in the Midwestern region on or after Feb.  1.

Effective dates for further consolidation have not yet been set, but Fannie
Mae has targeted the Southeastern region for the first quarter of 1996, the
Northeastern region for the third quarter, and the Western region for early in
1997.

Smith Barney & Others Named in EA Suit


Washington-The government is suing Smith Barney Inc.  and an affiliate for
negligence in the sale of WESTSAV Mortgage Corp., Phoenix, a $2.2 billion
servicer that was sold by the Resolution Trust Corp.  in 1991.

Several other defendants were named in the case, including the winning bidder
for WESTSAV, Robert W.  Stallings, who renamed the company Express America
Mortgage Corp., and transformed it into an aggressive wholesaler with $6.5
billion in servicing.

In September 1994, Mr.  Stallings sold Express America's servicing to
NationsBanc, Charlotte, NC.  Express America no longer is in the mortgage
business.

The RTC charges that Mr.  Stallings and Robert H.  Brown, senior vice
president of Rauscher Pierce Refsnes Inc., Dallas, engaged in "bid
manipulation" that allowed Mr.  Stallings to buy WESTSAV at a significant
discount.

Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, the broker of record on the sale, was an affiliate of
Smith Barney, a relationship that was not known to the RTC, the lawsuit says.
Smith Barney served as the government's adviser on most of its mortgage
banking sales.

The government charges that the defendants' conduct, "resulted in the RTC
receiving many millions of dollars less for WESTSAV than it would have
received in an arms-length bidding process."

The agency believes it could have made at least $15 million more on the deal
if Smith Barney and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes had acted properly.

The RTC sold WESTSAV through a stock deal to First Western Partners Inc., Mr.
Stallings' company, in May 1991.  The net purchase price was about $26
million, according to the lawsuit.

Before buying WESTSAV, Mr.  Stallings worked for two S&Ls that later failed.
He served as chief executive of WESTSAV's parent Western Savings and Loan,
Dallas, before resigning in February 1990 to bid on WESTSAV.

In October 1990 four firms made final bids for WESTSAV:  First Financial Group
which bid $27.3 million (net to the RTC); First Western $31.8 million (net);
Maximilian $40 million (net); and Standard Federal/AMSI, $29 million (net).
The lawsuit did not specify their locations.

The RTC says First Western had no real financing lined up to buy WESTSAV but
the deal got pushed through by Mr.  Brown who was a long-time friend of Mr.
Stallings.

One Rauscher official, Tom Lykos, questioned First Western's financing but was
told by Mr.  Brown "not to worry about it," the lawsuit says.

The agency says Mr.  Brown gave "inside information" to Mr.  Stallings on the
pending sale.

The RTC also charges that Rauscher evaluated the bids incorrectly which
benefited First Western and Stallings.

"While RPR (Rauscher) reduced the First Western bid by the amount of WESTSAV's
liabilities, RPR also reduced the competing bids by the WESTSAV liabilities
which was wrong because the competing bids were submitted on a net basis," the
RTC charges.

The RTC investigated the case for at least two years.  The law firm bringing
the case on behalf of the government is Morris & Hecker, the same firm that
won large settlements in the government's case against Charles Keating and
professional defendants including several prominent law and accounting firms.

Mr.  Stallings could not be reached for comment.  Smith Barney also could not
be reached for comment.

Rauscher and Mr.  Brown released a statement saying the lawsuit is "without
merit."

The statement adds that, "based on our own investigation into the matter we
have no reason to believe that any RPR employee did anything illegal or
unethical in the course of the WESTSAV transaction."

Editorial:  Credit Where It's Due


The fact that a governor of the Federal Reserve Board got turned down for a
credit card is almost laughable.  And the fact that it was Lawrence B.
Lindsey, the central banker most involved with consumer credit, who has been
warning of the dangers inherent in bankers and other lenders turning their
decision-making responsibilities over to automated systems, makes it even more
ironic.

According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Mr.  Lindsey applied for a
Toys 'R' Us card through Bank of New York, Delaware, which uses a strict
credit-scoring system.  The Federal Reserve official had refinanced a
mortgage; extended a line of credit and had several "routine reviews" of his
credit files over the past year.

So in spite of the fact that Mr.  Lindsey has a perfect payment record and
adequate income for the credit card account he wanted to open, the number of
lenders just looking at his background disqualified him under BofNY's credit
scoring.

And it seems, at the Delaware-based credit-card operation, while a human being
reviews all approvals, no one looks at the rejections based solely on score.

Of course as soon as the bank learned that it had rejected an application from
a VIP, it offered to issue a card with the full amount of credit Mr.  Lindsey
had been seeking.

The point is that no consumer who pays all of his bills on time should be
denied appropriate credit based on some arbitrary, non-thinking system.

We know of mortgage lenders where senior management reviews every rejected
loan application.  At these companies the question is can the application be
rescued and a means found of providing a mortgage.

Unfortunately the trend is in the other direction, toward arbitrary systems.
We don't think there's anything inherently wrong with credit scoring.  But
where it is allowed to make final judgments without any human, subjective
oversight it can get out of hand, as the incident with Fed Governor Lindsey
demonstrates.

Wisconsin had variable-rate mortgages before almost any other state.  The
state's former Sen.  William Proxmire, who was to become chairman of the
Senate Banking Committee, as a young man saw a family member foreclosed
because of the over-rapid increase in payments on a VRM.

That incident probably delayed the implementation of adjustable-rate lending
by Federal financial institutions by eight to 10 years.

New technology must be programmed to serve people.  If we become subservient
to the technology we will have lost a lot more than we possibly can gain from
the workload it assumes.

Land Investor Turns from Selling to Developing Properties


Washington-When Eastern Realty won the bidding for a $99 million land
portfolio from the Resolution Trust Corp.  in late 1993, the exit strategy
called for selling off most the portfolio over time.

But times have changed and "now we find ourselves developing the larger
properties," ER president Jay Rollins said.

Eastern Realty, McLean, VA, and its capital partner are developing four
residential tracks it acquired in the land offering known as MACO III, named
after RTC's Mid-Atlantic Consolidated Office.

MACO III is an equity partnership and Eastern Realty is the general partner in
charge of managing, developing and liquidating the assets for RTC.

At a development site near Frederick, MD, Eastern Realty has delivered 12
finished lots to production builders and it is under contract to deliver
another 65 lots.  When completed, the MACO III land asset will have 300 home
sites.

Prior to starting ER, Mr.  Rollins was director of finance for NVR, a large
homebuilder based in McLean.  And his long-term goal is to expand ER's land
business with builders.

"Our business focus in the future will be equity joint ventures with
residential builders and developers," Mr.  Rollins said in an interview.

But right now, Eastern is concentrating on managing and working $400 million
in land and commercial assets it has acquired over the past 30 months with its
capital partners.

The partnerships have purchased raw and finished land, including residential
and commercial land, from New Jersey to Tennessee.

When Eastern Realty opened its doors in early 1993, land assets were plentiful
and capital was scarce.  "Return expectations on pure equity capital were in
the 40% range," Mr.  Rollins.

But the market for land has shifted dramatically, he said, after capital began
chasing the available product.

"Return expectations still are in the low 20's but it is very common to
leverage those returns with a debt component," he said.

With these changing market conditions, Mr.  Rollins has changed his approach.

In its most recent deal, Eastern Realty and a capital partner acquired a $31
million pool of hotel, office and land assets from First Fidelity Bancorp.,
Newark, NJ.

"We expanded our reach beyond land assets and purchased subperforming hotel
loans and a commercial office condominium project," Mr.  Rollins said.

He also pointed out that banks are starting to sell smaller pools of assets.

"We think the large portfolio sales are winding down," he said.  "We are
looking to buy single asset notes, primarily land, and smaller pools of
assets," Mr.  Rollins said.

As part of its operations, Eastern Realty also services land and construction
loans for banks and other investors.  The company currently services $40
million in land and construction loans.  Its biggest client is Nomura Asset
Capital Corp., New York, the land financing arm of Nomura Securities.

MBS Roundup


Chicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significant
off-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as a
reason for comfort in its capitalization levels.

This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" rating
to a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.

Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the country
during the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-month
period, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at
$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.

The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenue
for Norwest Corp.

"The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reported
profitability over the past year.

"Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at high
levels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through the
seasonally slow winter months," DCR said.

But Credit Availability Keeps Growing


New York-Credit availability for the nation's construction contractors
continues to expand, according to an annual survey conducted by the
Construction Financial Management Association, Princeton, NJ.

Eighty-four percent of respondents said that access to credit had improved
this year, up from 78% last year, and 38% said their working capital line of
credit had increased in 1995, versus 29% last year.

Danny B.  Parrish, national president of CFMA, said, "this is terrific news.

"Lenders' confidence in the construction industry - evidenced by their
granting easier access to credit and larger credit lines - should mean higher
volume and revenue in 1996."

The survey polled 5,000 companies with annual revenues greater than $1
million.  But despite their easier access to credit, respondents were not as
optimistic about future contract revenue as they were last year.  Fifty-five
percent in 1995 anticipated an increase in next year's contract revenues, down
from 64% last year.

CFMA is the only nonprofit organization dedicated to serving the financial
profession within the construction industry.  Established in 1981, its general
members include all types of contractors, developers, construction managers,
architects, engineers and principals.  It currently has 5,800 members and 74
chapters throughout the United States.

Effort to Save LIHTC Gets Bipartisan Support


Washington-Proponents of the low-income housing tax credit have lined up a
majority in both houses of Congress to save the tax credit from the budget ax.

The budget balancing bill vetoed by President Clinton would have phased out
the LIHTC in fiscal year 1997 and saved the Federal government $3 billion by
2002.

But the negotiations to rewrite the budget bill are giving LIHTC proponents a
second chance to preserve the tax credit that currently produces 100,000
rental units each year and approximately 90% of new and rehabilitated
affordable housing nationwide.

"The program works," Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse D'Amato, R.,
NY, said at press conference in which a bipartisan group of congressmen,
mayors and business leaders urged Congress to keep the program alive.

"There is very solid support for the low-income housing tax credit program,"
Sen.  Paul Sarbanes, D., MD, said.  "It desires to be retained."

Sales of the tax credits to corporations and individuals raises equity to
finance the construction of affordable housing.

At the press conference, the Enterprise Foundation, Columbia, MD, and the
Local Initiatives Support Corp.  here announced that they plan to raise $4.5
billion in equity from selling tax credits and develop more than 100,000
affordable housing units over the next seven years if the credit is preserved.

"To sunset the most effective tool ever found to attract private capital to
the housing needs of working families is contrary not only to good policy, but
to common sense," said LISC president Paul Grogan.

While cutting the LIHTC program is a budget game, the program has its critics
because the sales of the tax credits involve syndication fees and it is
estimated investors expect a 15% return on their investments along with the
tax advantages.

Syndicating limited partnerships to individuals is technically complex and
expensive and the U.S.  General Accounting Office estimated several years ago
that syndication costs consume 27% of the equity raised.

In addition, the Internal Revenue Service and state housing agencies are
supposed to monitor compliance with the LIHTC requirements, but IRS is not set
up to administer a housing program.

The LIHTC program has become threatened many times before and it is an easy
target for congressional budget cutters.

However, advocates of affordable housing are aware that Congress is reducing
the Federal government's role in providing low-income housing and LIHTC
program is one of the last and most popular housing programs left.

"Subjecting, the credit to a year-by-year review creates a disincentive for
investors and developers, and could ultimately destroy what has become one of
the most effective programs for producing low-income housing in America," said
Enterprise Foundation chairman and chief executive Barton Harvey, IL.

Even critics agreed that year-by-year extensions of the tax credit is the
worse way to administer the program.

It increases the risks to developers and drives up the risk premium investors
demand when they purchase the credits, a budget analyst said.

Letter to the Editor


To the Editor:

I was misunderstood and sequentially misquoted in a front page article in the
Nov.  20th issue of National Mortgage News.  Reporter Brad Finkelstein quoted
me as saying:  "More and more companies are turning away from brokers.  There
is a cumulative amount of evidence that loans from brokers are not as high
quality and (the wholesalers) are taking action.  There is a lesson in this
for mortgage brokers."

I hadn't seen or read the article before I stood accused of being "too close
to the banks" and unfair to brokers.

Brokers need to know that the reporter got part or my remarks to him right,
part wrong.  I clearly said some of those things, but there were three
separate ideas in separate contexts.

By linking two ideas, the flight from wholesale and a lesson, with a third,
loan quality, in a single paragraph, the reporter mistakenly attributed to me
something Jim Johnson said.  I don't think brokers originate inferior quality
product.  To the contrary.  Let me explain.

When the reporter called recently and asked what I knew about PNC, I said two
things:  1) there was a change in management and 2) the company closed its
table funded broker operation.  A contact at the company had days earlier
confirmed these developments upon my inquiry.

I told the reporter that PNC is the forty-second "name" to exit wholesale the
past 18 months.  (Wholesale Access keeps the scorecard via The Wholesale
Directory, so we know.)

We talked about Jim Johnson's remarks in San Diego.  I raised the subject,
having read an article about the conference in September's Origination News.
I said I thought Johnson probably had it wrong.

What I believed was that brokers don't determine quality - wholesalers do,
they underwrite.  What I heard was that the data Fannie Mae have probably only
shows the recent economic misfortune of the country's two largest markets,
California and New York/New Jersey.

Property values, home prices and activity are soft in these areas right now.
Unfortunately, both are markets where brokers are the pre-eminent originators.
They get well over 50% of total originations in these markets.  So, guess
what, a downturn occurs and a correlation between brokers and higher
delinquency surfaces.  Hardly a surprise.

Frankly, I believe that Johnson linked the two developments together before
MBA audiences in order to justify adopting tiered pricing based on type of
originator.

NAMB needs to deal head-on with the TPO issue Fannie Mae's chairman raises.
Otherwise, it will miss an important opportunity to set the record straight.
This was the lesson - not broker quality, or the disappearance of a myriad of
names from wholesaler ranks.

EDS:  AU Removes Bar to Direct GSE Lending


Arlington, VA-Nothing currently prevents the secondary market agencies from
lending direct to the consumer, says Larry Walker of EDS.

Speaking at a conference here, he said, that is why "the term 'rip our face
off' comes to mind," when the industry assesses the significance of the
agencies' recent automation efforts, including automated underwriting.

Despite the fact that the agencies say their charters don't allow them to lend
direct to the consumer, Mr.  Walker said, neither agency's charter expressly
prohibits consumer lending.

"Their charter doesn't provide for them to act as technology vendor either,"
he added, echoing a point which others have made to National Mortgage News.

"Fannie and Freddie between them account for more than half of the technology
dollars spent so far this year in the U.S.," Mr.  Walker said in a follow-up
interview, referring to the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.

He had given an address entitled, "The effect of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's
technology on the marketplace," at an electronic mortgage lending conference
run by AIC.

In a subsequent discussion, Mr.  Walker said, "of course Congress could
prevent it, but - while the agency charters don't provide for direct lending -
there is nothing there to stop it."

As to why the agency charters are widely perceived as direct lending
obstacles, it is possible that many may not have looked at the actual
documents, he said.

The Mortgage Bankers Association shares his interpretation of the agency
charters, Mr.  Walker said.

Despite painting an ominous scenario, Mr.  Walker said of the agencies, "at
this point we probably should believe them."

But, since, he continued, "the agencies have all the keys" he counseled
lenders to position themselves so as to be less dependent on the agencies.

Besides the specter of the government-sponsored agencies replacing lenders,
Mr.  Walker - who directs the real estate and mortgage industry group EDS, a
Plano, TX, technology vendor - said in his address, "there is a fear the GSEs
will replace software vendors."

He was particularly critical of Fannie Mae which he said "has gone further"
than Freddie Mac.

Fannie Mae had less financial need to get into technology sales and has
offered technologies which extend beyond its legitimate need for upholding
credit quality (something for which automated underwriting is used), he said.

Additionally, Fannie's network is less open to censorship than Freddie's, he
said.

He also questioned recent advertising campaigns in consumer publications by
Fannie Mae.

"If they're not going direct to the consumer, why are they running ads in
Ladies Home Journal?," he asked the audience.

Also regarding motivation to enter the technology arena, he said Freddie Mac
was somewhat forced to change its function.  That's because the agency was
formed to serve thrifts but the thrift crisis eliminated much of its customer
base.

"So, the only ones we could give credence to would be Freddie Mac," Mr.
Walker continued.

Noting that Fannie Mae goes beyond offering automated underwriting, to Desktop
Originator, an origination system for brokers, and to Desktop Trader, he said,
"Fannie Mae seems to be going down the path of software writer again."

He was referring to Fannie's purchase, in the 1980s, of Servantis Systems
Inc., a Norcross, GA, firm which it subsequently sold.

Servantis, which lately goes under the name of SSI, provides origination and
servicing software.  (Fannie used to market the origination product as
MORTRACKS, Mr.  Walker noted.)

Last August, a Fannie Mae representative publicly said "we're a technology
vendor.".

Regarding the agency networks, Mr.  Walker contrasted Fannie's silence with
Freddie's announcement that it does not monitor traffic through its network.

Unlike Fannie's Mornet, Freddie's Goldworks is run by a third party (Advantis
Inc.  of Schaumburg, IL).

Although both agencies have likened their electronic network to a mall, in
which they are but one store, Mr.  Walker argues the analogy doesn't hold well
for Fannie.

"The difference is that Fannie owns the mall - and the security system -
whereas Freddie rents," he said.

HUD Sale Features Nonperforming


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development's next sale will
feature $700 million in nonperforming single-family loans, with 40% of the
houses in California, Colorado and Texas.

The bid date on the 16,700 loans is scheduled for March 20 and HUD is trying
to make its second single-family sale more attractive to regional lenders and
small investors.

HUD wants to lower the minimum bid requirement from the current $5 million and
create pools in terms of performance/delinquency status and by location.

But the final structure of the sale has not been determined yet and bid
packages are not expected to be ready until early February.

The Federal Housing Administration-assigned loans in the sale have already
gone through a 36-month forbearance period and the entire pool has a weighted
average coupon of 10% with remaining maturities of 15-20 years.

Hamilton Securities Group here is advising HUD on the March sale; it also
worked on the October sale in which four winning bidders divided $524 million
in FHA one-to-four-family loans.

Home Building Slows for Three Quarters


Washington-The home building industry slowed down nationwide during the first
three quarters of 1995, with the number of single-family building permits
issued dropping in 24 of the top 25 most active major markets - and in 47 of
the top 50 - according to the National Association of Home Builders.

Jim Irvine, president of the NAHB, said, "builders across the country are
experiencing a somewhat slower year.  Housing starts in 1995 have been
leveling off since a strong 1994.  Builders should see some slight improvement
in 1996, if interest rates remain in the current 7.5% range and the overall
economy shows some growth."

Atlanta was the only market among the top 25 in the nation to increase its
single-family permits through the first nine months of 1995.  In Atlanta, the
most active market, there were 26,886 single-family housing permits issued, a
5.8% increase over 1994.

Only two other markets in the top 50 showed increases in single-family housing
starts through three quarters.  They are Memphis, which increased 1.9%, and
Grand Rapids, MI, which increased 7.8%.

The second most active was Phoenix/Mesa, which despite its high ranking,
experienced a 3.5% decline in the number of permits issued.  Rounding out the
top five, the third most active was Chicago, down 8.8%, fourth was Washington,
DC, down 16.7%, and fifth was Las Vegas, down 5.9%.

However, the NAHB said that the nationwide decline in the number of
single-family housing permits issued was somewhat offset by an increase in
permits for multifamily units, as multifamily construction continued its
increase from its depression of 1993.

Overall, of the top 50 most active markets for issuing single-family permits,
27 declined more than 10% through the first nine months of 1995, with five
declining more than 20%.

Equity Roundup:  GSE Stocks Haven't Seen Their Best Days Yet


New York-Smith Barney asks the question, "are Fannie and Freddie's best days
behind them?"  Its answer, "No.  In fact, we think that there is no credible
evidence that the profitability of the two housing-related
government-sponsored enterprises has passed a peak."

Smith Barney said some investors have expressed concern that the recent run-up
in the stock price of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  might have left their shares susceptible to
a free-fall.

But fear that the two GSEs have become too big and are due for a downfall is
nothing new.  According to Smith Barney, since 1991, doubters have been saying
that the two companies are so big, and so dominant, that their profitability
has peaked.

The most commonly stated reason for their contention, Smith Barney said, is
that almost 60% of all mortgages have been securitized - one of Fannie and
Freddie's two basic businesses.  Doubters fear that if more than half of the
market has already been securitized, there simply cannot be much more room to
grow.

But Smith Barney is upbeat regarding the GSEs, saying, "we see a business that
should be trending upward on a structural basis - leaving cyclicality and rate
movements aside - in coming years."

Smith Barney cites the following:  a trend toward global funding which will
broaden the market for GSE debt and reduce funding costs, a new lending
criteria to serve the vastly underserved affordable housing market,
technological initiatives which should widen the housing market by increasing
speed and reducing origination costs, and increased expense control which will
be helped by technology.

Smith Barney, however, did caution, "neither we nor our model have been able
to detect GSEs' business in a structural decline.  But, of course, the past is
prologue and the bear case could prove right, going forward.  However, we
don't think so."

Glenfed Withdraws Goodwill Settlement Offer


Glendale, CA-Unless the government shows signs of negotiating seriously by the
first of the year, Glendale Federal Bank said it will withdraw its proposal to
pledge settlement funds to public policy investments.

Stephen J.  Trafton, Glendale Federal's chairman and chief executive officer,
said the government's seeking of "an appeal to the United States Supreme Court
of a very strong U.S.  Court of Federal Claims decision in favor of Glendale
Federal that was affirmed overwhelmingly in a 9-2 ruling by the U.S.  Court of
Appeals for the Federal Circuit could represent another lost opportunity."

He warned that "the amount of the bank's damages grows each day that the
litigation continues, and with a final judicial resolution of the liability
issue, we may be compelled to accept nothing less than unconditional cash
payment for damages."

Glendale Federal had offered to commit $1.5 billion, an amount it says it can
document having lost as a result of the government's breach of a supervisory
goodwill agreement involving Glendale's bailing out a failing Florida thrift.
As a result of the government reneging, Glendale says it was forced into a
massive and costly recapitalization.

"Now that the government has filed its appeal to the Supreme Court, we must
limit the time for acceptance of our settlement proposal," said Mr.  Trafton.
"Damage to the bank continues to grow as the government extends the
litigation, and a final judicial resolution of the government's liability
would cast the entire issue of settlement into question."

The Supreme Court may decline to consider the government's appeal, in which
case the liability judgment against the government in the Court of Federal
Claims would stand without possibility of further appeal.

Glendale Federal Bank is one of the largest savings institutions in the United
States, with 148 bank offices and 22 loan offices in California.

REIT '96 Outlook:  Steady Performers


San Francisco-In 1995, the yields on top stocks left even the leading real
estate investment trust issues in the dust.

But in 1996, say a variety of observers, fund managers increasingly will tuck
away 1995 profits in REITs, which, though not spectacular, can be counted on
to perform reliably.

Paul Puryear of Raymond James & Associates in St.  Petersburg says his firm
remains bullish on REITs for 1996 because "REITs are developing a track record
of delivering on earnings."

Predicting that the stock market as a whole will slow down, Mr.  Puryear told
NMN that low interest rates, low inflation and a probable slowdown in the
economy will make REIT earnings look more attractive in 1996.

"Twelve to 18% total returns look good in that environment," he said,
predicting that more utilities will invest in REITs.

REITs allow real estate investment without the management headaches.  Because
the underlying fundamentals for real estate are very strong right now, mutual
fund managers will look to these investment vehicles for the "hedge factor,"
A.G.  Edwards analyst Arthur Havener said.

A low-interest environment offers REITs cheaper capital, noted Mr.  Havener,
predicting the availability of 10-year financing in the 6%-7% range.  He said
leading REITs will want to amass cash in the bank "in anticipation of the
acquisition market picking up again."

This year, Mr.  Havener said, a number of real estate sellers are sitting on
the sidelines awaiting the outcome of the capital gains issue.  With or
without capital gains tax relief, many will sell, and REITs will share in the
harvest.

The highly fragmented and undermanaged self-storage industry will offer a
number of acquisition targets that could roll up into "one big REIT," said
NAREIT's Virginia Wade.

Chicago-based Real Estate Research Corp.  says pension funds in particular
will look more favorably on REITs in the coming year.  RERC surveys show that
55% of pension funds intend to increase their REIT investments in 1996.

"REITs have matured in the last several years," says RERC researcher Robert
Bergson.  He said they have increased their attractiveness to traditionally
conservative institutional investors, despite the funds having been burned by
REIT investments in the eighties.

Cindy McHugh of Equity Residential Properties Trust concurs that REIT
investments by pension fund will increase in 1996, but said the increase will
be "very, very slow.  Their due diligence process is very extensive."

And REITs are increasingly using the Internet.  NAREIT - very much involved in
making the public more aware of REITs - has a web site, and Kranzco Realty
Trust, a shopping center REIT and pioneer in using the World Wide Web, told
NMN its Web experience has been very positive.

"We've gotten a lot of feedback from analysts, investors, brokers and
tenants," said Michael Kranzdorf, the company's director of information.  He
said he expects more REITs to tout themselves on the Web because it has proven
more effective than any other medium in drawing direct inquiries from
investors.

"In 1996, for the first time in several years South West Property Trust
expects the supply of new apartments in its markets as a whole to modestly
exceed demand," said a September SWP report.

That potential softness in rental markets for cities like Dallas has drawn
considerable attention, but Mr.  Puryear said people in the apartment REIT
industry "are watching apartment start data very closely" in those markets and
"there is a definite constraint on supply."

Despite talk of an overabundance of apartment REITs, he expects the leading
residential REITs to remain strong performers.

Some apartment REIT stocks that "stagnated all year" are now "setting new
highs every day," said Mr.  Havener.  "Bay Apartments has taken off; it's now
in the $23 and change area."

As REIT managers maneuver to enhance unencumbered revenues to achieve growth,
1996 will continue to be a year of the balancing act.  REITs are not
structured to amass war chests.  The attractive feature of them for investors,
as Ms McHugh points out, is the dividend.  Major investor Ken Heeber, who has
been exiting REITs this year, has been quoted as grumbling that they are
showing FFO growth of 10% to 15%, with dividends lagging at 5%.

Grumbles like that can hurt.  To increase or not to increase dividend yields
may be a big question for REITs in 1996.

Duff & Phelps Likes Selloff of PruHome


Chicago-The sale of Prudential Home Mortgage Co., Clayton, MO, should result
in reduced consolidated financial leverage for its parent company Prudential
Insurance Co.  of America, Newark, NJ, according to a report from Duff &
Phelps Credit Rating Co.  here.

On the other hand, by selling the mortgage operation, Prudential loses the
benefits of "good, long-term returns" and would have to replace those to
maintain its historical corporate-wide earnings potential.

"It is anticipated that business opportunities to expand existing businesses
with less interest rate sensitivity and lower earnings volatility would
eventually be sought as the strategic direction of The Prudential under its
new chairman, Art Ryan, becomes more focused on the company's core insurance,
health care and investment management businesses," DCR said.

Mellon Bank Is Set to Buy Source One


Farmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing Source
One Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.

The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjusted
book value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million at
the end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.

Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.

Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say it
has signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."

The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for Source
One, the spokesperson said.

Mellon said it had no comment.

A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.

Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, with
excess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organization
growing its servicing, added the spokesperson.

During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject to
severe run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make up
earnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.

Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, but
failed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had also
served as adviser in that attempt.

Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of the
third quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter last
year, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.

But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund American
spokesperson said.

The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with a
portfolio of $45.67 billion.

On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemical
merger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry's
seventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.

What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears about
run-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule that
equalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

"Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry.

"But that is not a major consideration here.

"In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that
(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.

Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,
of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.

Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with its
most significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,
Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for
$165 million cash.

In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicing
portfolio.

Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3
billion servicer.

Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for Lomas
Mortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.

Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retail
production manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.

He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he was
production manager), and will remain based in Portland.

Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production offices
nationwide.

Construction Contracts Fall by 4%


New York-The value of new construction contracts fell 4% in October to an
annualized $289.7 billion, according to the F.W.  Dodge Division of
McGraw-Hill.

Each of the construction industry's three main sectors - nonresidential
building, housing and nonbuilding construction - showed modest declines from
relatively healthy levels.

Robert A.  Murray, vice president for economic affairs for F.W.  Dodge, said,
"following the generally strong level of contracting during 1995's third
quarter, the loss of momentum in October did not come as much of a surprise.

"It's consistent with various signs of a slower pace for the economy, and it
continues a pattern which has been present throughout this construction
recovery of strengthening activity followed by a pause."

F.W.  Dodge reported that during October, nonresidential building decreased 7%
to $104.8 billion from September, a lackluster amount by recent 1995 standards
but still a 4% increase over 1994's average rate.

The most pronounced downturn was felt in the institutional building categories
where slower contracting for schools, hospitals and detention facilities led
to a 14% decline from September.  Mr.  Murray said that while institutional
building has been a steady source of expansion during the past 18 months, the
October decline is suggestive of a slowdown in growth in the near future.

Other nonresidential building, such as office construction and industrial
plants, also fell from recent levels.

Residential construction, at $125.6 billion, fell 1% in October.  F.W.  Dodge
said that four of the nation's five major regions reported moderate
reductions, while the South Central region boasted a 5% increase.

Nonbuilding construction dropped 3% in October to $59.4 billion, entirely due
to a sharply reduced amount of utility construction, which on a month-to-month
basis can be volatile.

Overall in 1995, total construction was up 1% over the first 10 months of
1994.

o The Manufactured Housing Institute, Arlington, VA, announced that during
October manufactured home shipments topped 30,000 homes for the fourth time in
1995.  The shipment of 32,663 manufactured homes was a 15.6% increase over
October 1994.  Through the first 10 months of this year, there were 286,013
homes shipped, a 12.4% increase over last year.

o Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association, Chicago, announced in their
Survey of Building that total building permits for new homes and multifamily
housing in the Chicago metropolitan area dropped 6% during October from the
level reported in 1994.  Home permits fell 2% and multifamily permits fell
16%.

Throughout the metropolitan area, 2,094 permits were issued during October for
single-family homes compared with 2,130 in 1994, with the city of Chicago
nearly doubling from 75 to 140 while the suburbs fell from 1,884 to 1,776.

In the seven-county metropolitan area 757 multifamily permits were issued
during October, down from 904 last year.  Multifamily housing permits dropped
9% within the city of Chicago and 19% in the suburbs.

Permits issued for both single-family homes and multifamily units through the
first 10 months of 1995 totaled 25,248, a 4% decrease from the 26,356 reported
through October of 1994.

DejaVu Half-a World Away


New York-When the Japanese government moved just before yearend to vote a
modest amount of public money to help deal with a mountain of bad real estate
and housing loans, we felt the early 1980s had come 'round again.

There is a strong public reluctance in Japan to the use of taxpayer money and
strong sentiment for leaving the mess to the banks involved (and those that
are not) to clean up.

The decision to seek a taxpayer bailout has been politically divisive and
there is speculation that Japan's Finance Minister will resign as a result of
the uproar.

What the Japanese have done is to allocate $6.8 billion in public money to
create an agency which will use the funds and loans from banks and other
financial institutions to dispose of all the bad assets (did someone say
Resolution Trust Corp.?).

There are eight jusen, or housing loan funds, which were created essentially
as affiliates of other financial institutions.  The big money-center banks,
many of which owned large shares in the mortgage firms, have agreed to write
off a big chunk of the $64 billion in losses that are expected from the
liquidation of seven of the eight mortgage firms.

According to Thomson BankWatch, the stumbling point for some time has been the
allocation of the substantial losses among the creditor group, and whether the
government would provide direct assistance.

There are two aspects to the plan.  The allocation of approximately '6.3
trillion in "first round losses" from jusen problem loans.  Second, is the
establishment of the Jusen Resolution Corp.  (JRC) to liquidate, over a
10-year period, approximately '3.3 trillion in problem assets backed by some
form of collateral and '3.5 trillion in performing assets.

Regarding the allocation of the first round losses, founding banks of the
jusen will write off 100% of loans, or '3.5 trillion.  Other bank lenders will
write off from 40% to 60% of their loans, to total '1.7 trillion.

The agricultural credit sector will write off an amount equal to less than 10%
of their exposure, or '530 billion (this is the interest earned on loans made
to the jusen since initial restructuring plans started in 1993).

Finally, the government will provide '685 billion in the 1996 general budget
into seven special accounts (one for each of the housing loan companies) in
the deposit insurance authority.  These funds will also be used to cover first
round write-offs of unrecovered loans.

The JRC will acquire the remaining '6.7 trillion in loans, of which about half
are nonperforming, but backed by some collateral.

These assets will be purchased by the JRC at face value, with funding in the
form of low-interest loans from the founding banks, the agricultural credit
sector and other lenders.

The JRC will be capitalized at '100 billion by founding banks and the deposit
insurance corporation (the latter using funds provided by the Bank of Japan).

The JRC will maintain the loans in seven separate accounts - one from each of
the original housing loan companies.

Founding banks, together with the government, are expected to share ultimate
losses on these assets, in a yet undefined ratio.

The JRC, with an expected life of 10 years, will be staffed by housing loan
company employees as well as law enforcement officers, prosecutors and tax
officials.

The proposal has split the ruling coalition in Japan's legislature, the Diet.
While most observers expect the Diet to approve the proposed bailout as it is
spelled out in the government's budget, that approval is not assured.

There is a huge volume of bad loans piled up by the country's eight mortgage
companies.  For the most part, these unrecoverable debts were put on the books
in the 1980s when the companies took on huge property deals, most of which
went bad as the Japanese economy tanked early in this decade.

Finance companies and agricultural cooperatives also were substantial
investors.

The banks and other investors in the jusen had about $130 billion invested in
them as of last March.  The seven troubled companies reported bad assets
between 40% and 70% of total assets.

The government had encouraged formation of the jusen.  Loans from banks and
others accounted for an increasing portion of the housing market and the jusen
took their surplus loan funds into highly speculative real estate deals, in
much the same fashion as did many of the "high-flier" thrifts which ignored
housing to take advantage of expanded powers at both the state and Federal
level.

Most economists believe that on the whole, bad loans at these institutions
account for more than half the total.

The forgiveness of loans by the big banks will be accompanied by some new
lending by agricultural cooperatives and assistance from other financial
institutions.

In addition to the $64 billion already recognized as unrecoverable, some
estimates are that the mortgage companies have $12 billion additional in loans
that will have to be written off.  But this is just the beginning of the
process of cleaning up Japan's bad-debt problem.

The Japanese financial system is believed to have more than $400 billion in
bad debts, and the country's banks have been retreating from aggressive
foreign investment to a more insular approach.

As a result, Japanese banks have been taking big losses on real estate
investments in the U.S.  In many cases, the percentage of loss for Japanese
investors has equaled that of the RTC when it was selling properties acquired
by failed savings and loans.

In Japan, the farm cooperatives will fare better than any of the other groups
involved in the government-sponsored solution.  They will be asked to make
grants and low interest loans to the new agency totaling about $5.3 billion.

In exchange their $5.5 billion in claims for loans to the mortgage companies
will be repaid.

Prime Minister Tomichi Murayama made no bones about the fact that it is the
social and political importance of agriculture that shaped the decision to
favor the cooperatives in structuring the workout plan.  But the decision was
political with the Agricultural Ministry winning out over the Finance Ministry
on the issue.

This is in sharp contrast to the policy followed by the U.S.  Government,
which beginning in the early 1980s followed a policy favoring the commercial
banks in each phase of the savings and loan and real estate workout, but never
has enunciated the reasoning behind its actions.

Nonbank financial institutions in Japan, which have about $17 billion on loan
to the mortgage companies, can kiss that amount good-bye and are being asked
to provide both capital and loans to the rescue agency.

Observers suggested that the $6.8 billion in public money may be only the
beginning for the Japanese taxpayer, particularly if the economy worsens
and/or real estate prices decline further.

But it seems to us that the Japanese have made a pretty good start on their
problem in contrast to a dozen years ago, when politics in this country
produced a policy of inaction.

The Federal Home Loan Bank Board had asked for $15 billion to be charged to
the thrift industry as a means of tackling the problems that were emerging in
Texas, California, Arizona and Ohio, among others.

The S&L industry balked, both at the size of the payment and at the idea of
the FHLBB having that much money with which to close down institutions.

Looking back, the $15 billion would not have solved the problem, but it
probably would have saved $50 billion or more of the eventual cost.
Institutions that could have been shut continued to operate - and to bleed -
until 1987, or even later.

The industry's cost went well beyond $15 billion and if the Savings
Association Insurance Fund legislation is any guide, the price will go up
still further.

By short-circuiting the politics and reaching down for public money in the
initial phases of its workout, the Japanese Finance Ministry likely is
reducing the long-term cost to that nation's citizens.

GlenFed Selling $2B in CMOs


Glendale, CA-Glendale Federal Bank recently put $1.8 billion in fixed-rate
collateralized mortgage obligations up for sale in a move that will mean
taking a $30 million after-tax loss for the quarter ending Dec.  31.

About half of Glenfed's CMO portfolio had been sold by mid-December and the
bank reported that it expected to complete the sale by early 1996.  Glenfed
then plans to replace the fixed-rate securities with adjustable rate assets.

The CMOs are all short-term securities that were categorized as having an
average life of two to four years when the bank purchased them about two years
ago, according to retail bank operations staff.  Most are first tranche
investments but a few are second tranche, issued from at least 20 different
sources and backed by a diverse, nationwide base of loans.

Bank president Stephen J.  Trafton said the bank took advantage of a one-time
window of opportunity covering a 90-day period between mid-November and Dec.
31, 1995 to reclassify the assets.  The move was allowed under Federal
accounting standard 115.

"These sales will improve our capital ratios, thus freeing up capital for
possible use in pursuing additional merger and acquisition and other
reinvestment strategies," he said.

The reclassification is designed to make Glenfed's portfolio more "flexible,"
Mr.  Trafton said.  A bank analyst has recently named Glenfed a takeover
candidate, but a bank spokesman said Mr.  Trafton's comment about mergers and
acquisitions "has nothing to do with fattening ourselves for somebody else."

In addition to putting the CMOs on the market, the bank simultaneously
recategorized $1 billion of its adjustable rate pass-through securities
portfolio as "available for sale," but has no immediate plans to sell them,
officials reported.

The bank has been selling off loans and loan products since last year, when it
made plans to achieve a goal ratio of 70% deposits to 30% borrowings for its
conversion.  The bank's ratio of deposits to borrowings was 60% to 40% as of
its last earnings report on Sept.  30.

In preparing for conversion, the bank also is bracing itself for an upcoming
$47 million loss that will hit when the Federal budget reconciliation bill
passes.  The loss is a one-time assessment Glenfed is being charged to
recapitalize the Savings Association Insurance Fund when it converts.

Fleet Selling Mortgages To Fund NatWest Buy


Boston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will put
billions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market as
it sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own to
fund the move.

Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages and
securities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.
About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes to
retire debt.

"We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms of
certain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chief
executive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he was
pleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction and
financing largely internally."

Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combined
Fleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,
president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of New
York's president and chief executive.

Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bank
plans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice president
Eugene McQuade.

"In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doing
both at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostly
investment securities and residential mortgages," he said.

"Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yielding
assets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial and
industrial loans and consumer loans."

Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment about
the composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be selling
to finance the acquisition.

But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions of
dollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.

Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans at
that time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman said
that Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired Shawmut
National Bank.

Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backed
securities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had
$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified as
held-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBS
represented about 40% of their total securities holdings.

Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be saved
when Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plus
branches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in Long
Island, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cuts
will be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half the
positions are expected to be lost through "attrition."

After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closing
slated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eight
years to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million in
payments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annual
payments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.

Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400
million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorp
has agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  The
British company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loans
and repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.

Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a few
have expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next few
years.

In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also could
potentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to
"positive" from "stable."

"While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from a
better earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhanced
revenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.

The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening its
market in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and New
Jersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging with
Shawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."

Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe the
acquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company's
credit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuild
capital.

"The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reserve
coverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisition
reduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheet
clearly has a higher risk profile."

Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.

The Haves and Have-Nots


by William J.  McDonough President, Federal Reserve Bank of New York

Mr.  McDonough recently spoke about the business community's stake in
improving inner-city areas.  His remarks were delivered at the winter
management conference of America's Community Bankers and have been excerpted
as our Open Forum.

In the long-run, I am convinced, economic development can be sustained only if
the growing economic pie is shared by all parts of society - rich and poor,
urban and rural, skilled and less skilled - and by all racial groups.  Unless
all parts of society share in and therefore have a stake in economic growth,
we cannot have the social and political cohesion that is essential to sustain
growth.

I will not dwell on what government can and should do.  Those debates are
going on in Washington, and elsewhere, and we are well aware of the issues.
Broadly, I think there is widespread agreement that efforts by Federal, state
and local governments to reduce regulations can lead to lower costs, making it
easier to do business and create jobs.

Moreover, it is also clear that government is a key player in improving our
public education system.  But government action alone is not sufficient.
Government efforts require the essential underlying support of the private
sector.  Private sector participants need to redouble their efforts to bring
job growth and prosperity to all levels of our society.  This is a task the
government simply cannot shoulder alone.

Private sector involvement is important not only for philanthropic reasons but
also for reasons of raw self-interest.  A recent report of the Committee for
Economic Development summarizes in a concise and persuasive way why each of us
- particularly those who are business leaders - have a stake in the inner
cities.

First, inner-city blight undermines the fiscal and operational health of major
cities because distressed neighborhoods contribute little to a city's tax base
yet impose heavy demands on public services.

Second, cities possess significant national economic assets in the form of
productivity-enhancing infrastructure and unique cultural institutions, as
well as anchors to the economic growth of their suburbs.  Inner-city distress
weakens the value of those assets.

Third, employers must rely for their future workforce on groups heavily
represented in inner cities.  The inadequacy of educational preparation in the
inner cities can diminish the quality of this nation's human capital, a key to
economic growth and prosperity.

Fourth, the costs of inner-city problems fall on taxpayers wherever they
reside.

Finally, there is an inconsistency between the isolation of our distressed
urban neighborhoods and our national ideals of equality of opportunity for all
persons.

I commend the CED report to you and its recommendations for greater
business-sector involvement with community groups in rebuilding areas where
economic blight is most concentrated.  I share many of the views expressed in
the CED report and believe the time is short to act upon them.

I know that you as community bankers play a particularly important role in
providing financing for local communities.  I also know that many of you are
currently involved, as we are at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, in a
wide range of educational and community development initiatives.

For example, I am well aware that banks have accomplished a great deal in
activities encouraged by the Community Reinvestment Act.  I am also well aware
that many in this audience generously support development efforts through
philanthropic and civic organizations.

In fact, I sometimes think that too little attention is given to the many
successes that have emerged from partnerships between business and community
groups around the nation.  There are several key elements in those successful
efforts that provide lessons for the types of involvement that the private
sector might undertake.

First, by their support and active involvement, mainstream corporations can
provide well-organized community groups with the ability to leverage the
necessary resources to initiate comprehensive community-building strategies
that will be sustainable over the long-term.

For example, the members of the South Bronx community development corporation
in collaboration with such partners as the New York City Partnership and the
Local Initiatives Support Corp., and with the support of financial
institutions and the active participation of community residents, have
transformed their part of the South Bronx from rubble-strewn lots to a vibrant
community.

Second, the private sector can provide part of the financing required for
community development, and I believe that banks can and should play a greater
role in this area.  Communities need access to capital to improve their
infrastructure, create housing, and attract the businesses that create jobs.
While financial institutions are a critical part of a comprehensive strategy
and a source of capital to communities, it is important to look to other
institutional players as well.

Third, the private sector can provide critical technical assistance.  My
institution, as most of you know, cannot provide capital to local communities.
Nevertheless, volunteers from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have
provided technical assistance to community-based organizations by sharing
expertise in financial analysis, computer system design, and strategic
planning.

As another example, our Bank prepared a guide for small business owners
intended to facilitate communication between entrepreneurs and bankers, as
well as identify other sources of finance and assistance.  Over 140,000 of
those pamphlets have been distributed nationwide through our offices in the
last year.

Fourth, the private sector can play a key role in training our future work
force as well as retraining the adult population in the skills needed in
today's high wage industries.

At my Bank, we have a team that recruits staffers to serve as mentors for
local high school students and to speak in classrooms - thereby attempting to
bridge the gap between the workplace and school.  One group has had so much
success helping elementary school pupils improve their academic performance
that the students' parents have asked for a tutoring program, too.

Finally, private industry can work in partnership with established local
community groups.  These grass-roots are the people who know their
neighborhoods and know what is most likely to work or not work.  What these
groups do not need is others telling them what to do; what they do need is the
willingness of businesses and individuals to work in partnership with them.

Commercial Builder Withdraws From Soft California Market


Irvine, CA-Kitchell Contractors Inc., Phoenix, a leading commercial and
industrial construction firm, is closing its 40-person Irvine office - just as
a major U.S.  homebuilder comes roaring into Orange County from Florida.

Ranked 17th on this year's Business Journal list of commercial/industrial
construction firms, Kitchell found its Orange County revenues from operations
dropping 38% this last fiscal year, from $34.5 million to $21.5 million.  At
its peak in the 1980s Kitchell employed nearly 100 people at the Irvine
office, with annual revenues pushing $120 million.

Kitchell characterized its withdrawal from Irvine as an "office consolidation"
and said it is actually hiring additional project managers for construction
projects handled from its Phoenix and Las Vegas offices.

A Kitchell spokesman said fierce competition for a shrunken pool of Southern
California building starts has created a profit squeeze that makes other
Southwestern markets more attractive.

The spokesman said the company will retain its Sacramento office, which
manages lucrative public sector construction.  Kitchell is a leading criminal
justice construction manager, "with 100,000 prison and jail beds delivered."

Meanwhile Florida homebuilder Lennar Corp., the seventh-largest homebuilder in
the nation, has headed in the opposite direction, staking out a Southern
California toehold following a major expansion into Texas, where it plans to
build 1,000 homes next year.

Having gained control of one bankrupt Orange County builder, Lennar has been
in negotiation to take over another.  Lennar has acquired $160 million in old
debt of Bramalea of California Inc.  and is in negotiation with bondholders of
Baldwin Builders.

A U.S.  Bankruptcy Court judge has given Baldwin a brief extension on the time
it can keep its doors open by paying operating expenses out of funds earmarked
to repay a $70 million debt to its former lender G.E.  Capital.

Miami-based Lennar is known for gaining market share by buying land cheaply
and leveraging its purchasing power to get volume discounts on materials to
build low-priced entry-level homes.

SEC Eases Prospectus Delivery Requirements for MBS


New York-The Securities and Exchange Commission has reduced its prospectus
delivery requirements for mortgage- and asset-backed investments as it
re-examines its rules.

The SEC no longer requires dealers and brokers to deliver a preliminary
prospectus 48 hours before confirming a transaction as long as purchasers get
a final prospectus before or simultaneous with their confirmation.

Exemptions from the 48-hour notification only apply to investment-grade
asset-backed securities with no more than 25% of their principal balance held
in the prefunding account.

The relief from the 48-hour requirement will be available for a two-year
period while the SEC studies the rule, which it has begun to re-examine at the
request of the Public Securities Association.

The 48-hour preliminary prospectus requirement dates back to 1969 when it
originally was designed to offset "concern with perceived sales abuses arising
in connection with initial public offerings of companies with no reporting
history, many of which were of a 'highly speculative' character," according to
PSA reports.

Although asset-backed offerings "generally involved an issuer which, at the
time of the offering, has not been filing periodic reports," PSA argued that
"the absence of such reports ...  should not be construed to imply between the
asset-backed securities market that the offering falls into the 'new or
speculative' category that originally led to adoption of the rule."

RTC Auction Gets High Return on Performing SF Loans


Kansas City-The Resolution Trust Corp.  sold $577 million in performing and
nonperforming loans at its eighth and final national loan auction, recovering
$404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.

The open outcry auction included residential, commercial and consumer loans,
but residential mortgages accounted for half of the recoveries.

Bidders paid $105.5 million on the sale of $109 million in performing
one-to-four-family conventional loans or 96.6% on the dollar.

This recovery rate is slightly higher than the 90% RTC secured in the last
national loan auction held in May.

But the recovery rate on nonperforming one-to-fours dropped significantly.
RTC got 69 cents on the dollar for nonperformers in May but only 61.9% in the
December auction.

Bidders at last month's auction paid $41.2 million for $66.6 million in
nonperforming one-to-four-family conventional mortgages.

First Financial Network, Oklahoma City, conducted the May and December
auctions for RTC and in each auction the loans were divided into very small
pools and bid individually.

RTC did nearly as well in the sale of performing condominium loans as in
one-to-fours.  The auctioneer sold $29.4 million in performing condo loans for
94.9 cents on the dollar.  Some $12.9 million in nonperforming condominium
loans sold for 52.6 cents on the dollar.

The auction featured only $5.4 million in FHA/VA loans and the performers sold
for 99.8 cents on the dollar and nonperformers sold for 72.2 cents on the
dollar.

In terms of commercial mortgages, RTC sold $39.9 million in office loans and
recovered 65 cents on the dollar and $59.3 million in multifamily loans and
recovered 70.1 cents on the dollar.

Developed land credits made up $103.4 million of the loans auctioned off that
started Dec.  13 and RTC recovered $67.3 million or 65 cents on the dollar.

The three-day auction in Kansas City started Dec.  13 and it attracted 233
bidders.  There were 101 winning bidders, RTC said.

RTC Closes its Doors After Resolving 747 Failed Thrifts in 6 Years


Washington-The government's effort to deal with the savings and loan crisis of
the 1980s came to an end last week when the Resolution Trust Corp.  closed its
doors.

The agency had resolved 747 failed S&Ls and sold off $465 billion in assets.

The six-year, $90 billion effort marks the greatest liquidation program ever
undertaken and the resolution of the most costly financial crisis since the
Great Depression.

When RTC started out in August 1989, many believed it would take at least
until the year 2000 to clean up the debris of the S&L industry.

And others feared the agency would be consumed by mismanagement and
corruption.

RTC quickly became a political football for Congress as the Bush
Administration, and later the Clinton Administration had to beg for additional
funding to resolve the growing number of "brain dead" thrifts.

Each mistake the agency made was magnified in a fish bowl of constant
criticism.

Now the agency that couldn't do right in the eyes of many has completed its
mission ahead of schedule.

"In retrospect you can always say it could have been done better," Federal
Reserve Board Alan Greenspan said.

"But let me tell you, if you look at the size of what has been done, the
efficiency in which it was done, this is one of those extraordinary
achievements," Mr.  Greenspan said at the last RTC oversight board meeting.

"You have a great success on your record.  Be proud of it," former RTC chief
William Seidman told an auditorium full of RTC employees last month, many of
whom now are being laid off.

Led by then FDIC chairman Seidman, a cadre of Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
executives built an asset management and sales organization that grew to 9,000
employees despite relying extensively on the private sector.  During its six
years, RTC issued 158,000 contracts to private firms worth $5 billion.

"We had a tough time getting the operation going," Mr.  Seidman admitted.  RTC
had a convoluted command structure and Treasury Department officials kept the
agency bound up in a confusing approval process.

RTC was criticized for holding assets and was criticized at the same time for
selling assets.

"For every Congressmen that told us to sell a property now there were those
who said hang on to it," Mr.  Seidman said.

The collapse of much of the S&L industry coincided with mounting bank failures
and a real estate market that was depressed and caught in a credit crunch.

To get its sales efforts going, RTC had to restart the markets and find new
ways to sell failed S&Ls.

This took innovation on the part of RTC executives, including president David
Cooke, thrift resolution chief William Roelle and asset sales chief Lamar
Kelley, who were willing to experiment and learn from mistakes.

RTC began by breaking up S&Ls franchises and selling the branches separately
from the assets.

The agency adopted a wholesale strategy for selling assets that included large
public outcry auctions of real estate and loans, securitizations of performing
and nonperforming loans and structured transactions that allowed RTC to sell
real estate or loans in $100 million multiples.

RTC entered a fledgling commercial mortgage-backed securities market in 1991
and issued $16.5 billion in CMBS over the next four years.  RTC also
securitized $23.7 billion in one-to-four-family mortgages.

What was considered risky and controversial in these areas a few years ago now
is considered standard practice.

RTC just concluded its eighth and last national loan auction where it sold
$577 million (book value) in performing and nonperforming and nonperforming
loans for $404 million or 70 cents on the dollar.

And RTC just issued its last CMBS, a $325 million offering, with barely any
mention or notice in the press.

But many of RTC's early initiatives were not as successful.

In a public relations flop, RTC had to cancel its first $300 million real
estate auction because the auctioneer failed to put up $2 million for
marketing expenses.

RTC also tried blind sales, because it had problems finding and identifying
assets for bulk sales, and creative financing schemes, like cash-flow
mortgages, so it could sell empty office buildings and hotels.

These experimental transactions evolved into bulk sales, called structured
transactions that commercial banks and insurance companies later adopted to
get rid of the problem real estate assets in their portfolios

But RTC's first structured transaction, a $180 million offering of
nonperforming commercial mortgages, raised a stink in the press because the
winning bidder Maxxam chairman Charles Hurwitz formerly owned a thrift that
failed.

Last week FDIC sued Mr.  Hurwitz for $250 million in damages, alleging he
contributed to the failure of United Savings Bank of Texas, Houston.

In most instances, the buyers who stepped up to the plate first, walked away
with the best deals.

For example, G.E.  Capital Corp., Stamford, entered into an agreement with RTC
to buy $1 billion in nonperforming commercial mortgages and share 25% of the
profits with RTC.

The RTC Inspector General estimates that GE will make an 70% gross profit
margin on its investment.

RTC learned from these transactions, however.  More buyers came to the table
and RTC got better prices once the risk takers like GE showed the way.

But political fights over RTC funding and a parade of scandals and snafus took
its toll on RTC executives.  As a scapegoat, David Cooke was forced out in a
political deal to get additional funding for RTC.

The refusal of Congress to confirm President Clinton's nominee to run RTC put
thrift resolution chief Roelle in a position of getting tarred in the
Whitewater scandal.

As the remaining executive, Mr.  Roelle briefed acting RTC chief and Treasury
under secretary Roger Altman about RTC's investigations into President
Clinton's ties with a failed Arkansas thrift, Madison Guaranty.

Revelations that Treasury officials passed this information to the White House
forced Mr.  Altman to resign from Treasury.

Mr.  Roelle was forced to take a less visible position at RTC and he returned
to FDIC.

Mr.  Kelley, who guided RTC's asset sale program, was able to leave RTC
without a cloud.  But like, Mr.  Roelle, he left quietly and with little
thanks.

One of RTC's most persistent Congressional critics has been Rep.  Bruce Vento,
D., MN.  He continues to give RTC bad marks for failing to develop an
information system to keep track of assets and contracts.

And as the chairman of an RTC oversight task force for the House Banking
Committee, he was instrumental in getting RTC to adopt many management
reforms.

Nevertheless, Rep Vento hopes the expertise RTC developed with its "on the job
training" will be transferred to the FDIC and he believes a Federal asset
disposition agency should be created to protect the taxpayer's dollars and
assets.

"The Federal Housing Administration is an example of why the Federal
government ought to have this expertise," he said.

FHA is in the process of selling off billions of dollars of nonperforming
single-family and multifamily loans and it has adopted many of RTC's sales
practices.

"They have obviously moved the assets," Rep.  Vento said.  But he cast doubt
on RTC's claim that it recovered 87 cents on all the assets it sold.

"How they come up with these figures with such a high return is sort of
questionable," he said.

The RTC figure does not take into the account the fact that the thrifts had
already written down the loans before RTC took over the institutions.

"While there will always be critics pointing to places where RTC tripped or
stumbled, anyone who looks at the whole picture will be impressed, Mr.  Cooke
claimed at the RTC pep rally.

"You successfully balanced the conflicting demands to sell assets quickly and
at the best price.  At the same time, we opened up housing opportunities for
lower-income families and provided new opportunities for minority contractors
and small investors," he said.

"Congratulations for a job well done," Mr.  Cooke said.

Lenders Expect FHA Loans to Be Covered


Washington-As the partial Federal government shutdown enters its third week,
lenders continue to make Federal Housing Administration loans with the
understanding that the Department of Housing and Urban Development will
process and insure the loans once it reopens.

FHA's handling of the first shutdown gave a lot of lenders comfort, according
to Mortgage Bankers Association staff vice president Brian Chappelle.

"But it is getting a little more nerve-racking as this shutdown goes on week
after week," he said.

However, the Veterans Affairs mortgage program becomes a bigger problem
starting Jan.  1 because Congress failed to extend lenders' authority to
negotiate interest rates.  As a result, VA officials set the interest rate at
7% late last week.

So lenders will have to make VA loans at 7%, which is a bit low and the buyer
cannot pay the points.  "It is going to raise a myriad of processing
problems," Mr.  Chappelle said.

Meanwhile, the Government National Mortgage Association continues to guarantee
securities for issuers that purchased commitments prior to the Dec.  16
shutdown.

After the first shutdown around Thanksgiving, "a number of issuers came in the
door to purchase commitment authority so they would not be caught during the
shutdown period," according to the GNMA president Kevin Chavers.

But a couple of issuers didn't make it through the door.  "There is nothing we
can do for them.  There is no commitment authority to be purchased," Mr.
Chavers said.

Meanwhile, FHA is not processing endorsements, according to Sarah Rosen
special assistant to the FHA commissioner.  "So lenders are taking some risk
if they close a loan," she said.

However, lenders can still obtain loan case numbers through CHUMs lender
access system and get credit checks electronically, she said.

Although HUD has no funding, the Senate did confirm the nominations of Mr.
Chavers to be Ginnie Mae president, John Knubel to be HUD's' chief financial
officer, Dwight Robinson to be deputy secretary for housing and urban
development and Hal DeCell 3d to be assistant secretary in charge of
Congressional and public affairs.

Brazos Fund Closes Kemper Deal


Dallas-The Brazos Fund L.P.  has completed the purchase of $1.5 billion in
distressed real estate assets this year, including a huge transaction
involving Kemper Finance Services that closed just before Christmas.

The size of the Kemper insurance company portfolio is believed to be about $1
billion and the assets have been divided between the newly created Brazos Fund
and the Argo Fund, which is another real estate investment fund managed by
J.P.  Morgan & Co., New York.

Investor Robert Bass created the Brazos Fund and its limited partners include
public and private pension funds, endowments, family trusts, commercial banks
and insurance companies.

The fund started its acquisition train in March with $140 million in capital
and Brazos has completed 13 acquisitions ranging from a $25 million
acquisition from Home Savings of America, Los Angeles, to a $1 billion
portfolio acquisition from a Canadian thrift called North American Trust Co.

Brazos had a Canadian pension fund as a capital partner in the North American
Trust transaction, according to Brazos Partners president Rob Gidel.  John
Grayken is the managing director of the fund.

Brazos also has a strategic alliance with BlackRock Asset Investors, New York,
which invests in commercial mortgage-backed securities.

Brazos is currently in the process of restructuring its portfolio to see which
assets can be sold as whole loans or in securitizations.  Mr.  Gidel expects
that the sales strategy will be set early this year.  "Our business is not to
accumulate assets under management," he said.

If they are securitized, Brazos intends to retain and service the "B" pieces
through its asset management affiliate, Brazos Advisors L.L.C., which is in
the process of being rated as a special servicer.

Brazos Advisors services all of the Brazos Fund assets, including all the
assets from the North American Trust deal and its share of the Kemper deal.

Those deals exemplify Brazos' preference for negotiated deals and why it stays
away from competitively bid transactions such as the multifamily sales by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.

"When you get into those controlled auctions it's just not going to meet out
pricing objectives," Mr.  Gidel said.  "The pricing is too rich for us."

However, Brazos participated in the last Resolution Trust Corp.  loan auction
in Kansas City and actually "picked up an asset," he said.

"We do try to understand what is going on at these controlled auctions and see
what the pricing is.  You never know, you may end up buying something after
the auction from the people that win it," he said.

Brazos also looked at the recent Sanwa Bank portfolio that the Japanese bank
sold to Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, W.  Palm Beach, FL.  The Southern
California portfolio included $160 million in performing and nonperforming
mortgages.

Mr.  Gidel expects the Japanese banks will be selling more assets this year.

"We have done three deals with Japanese banks.  We obviously think that's
going to be an opportunity for us in the future," he said.

Through the alliances with co-investors and leveraging its capital, the Brazos
fund still has $100 million to invest.

"We see some exciting opportunities up in Canada.  The dynamics up there look
very similar to what we saw in the states a couple of years back," Mr.  Gidel
said.

But he expects to see fewer sales by U.S.  banks and insurance companies this
year.

"However, there are interesting opportunities among operating companies that
are looking to divest themselves of real estate," Mr.  Gidel said.

Bank of America To Offer Fixed-Rate Prepayment Penalties


San Francisco-Bank of America plans to offer up to one-eighth or one-fourth of
a percentage discount on interest rates for fixed-rate home loans that carry
prepayment penalties, said Claus Lund, senior vice president of mortgage asset
management.

A "handful" of such loans have already been made on an experimental basis,
spurred by the success of Bank of America's adjustable rate prepayment
penalties and prepayment penalties in the commercial mortgage-backed
securities market at large, Mr.  Lund said.

"The MBS market will accept those loan types because they will be protecting
the investor and we believe the market will start paying up for that type of
asset," he said.  "I think a lot of investors in servicing will realize that
this has potential."

The Federal National Mortgage Association and Morgan Stanley & Co.  have shown
interest in the new loan, which will penalize borrowers 2% of up to 80% of
their outstanding loan amount if they prepay within the first three years, Mr.
Lund said.

So far, the collateralized mortgage obligation market is showing more of an
interest in the fixed-rate prepayment penalty loans than the mortgage
pass-through market, he said.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  has been less receptive to the
prepayment penalized loans, Mr.  Lund said.

Previously, banks have been adverse to affixing prepayment penalties to
fixed-rate mortgages because they look unfriendly to borrowers, he said.  But
Mr.  Lund said he believes the discount offered for the penalties will be
favorable to borrowers as well as investors.

"This is not something where we're going out and providing the borrower with
what is an unpleasant asset," he said.  "This is something where the borrower
can take advantage of a better rate if they know they are going to be in their
house for some time."

Bank of America may not be the only large lender considering making such loans
at a time when low rates and refinancings have led to "purchased assets
disappearing quicker than a snowman in July," Mr.  Lund said.  But he believes
the bank is "one of the pioneers in the field."

The move marks an increased re-emphasis on securitization concerns at the
bank.  Securitization and secondary market business have been comparatively
light over the past few years, but added that the bank is a long-time player
in the field, having issued the first private MBS in the mid-'70s.

Thus far in the 1990s, Bank of America has securitized $2 billion to $4
billion of its loans each year, he said.  This year it has done about $2.5
billion in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitizations and about a half billion
in private issues, Mr.  Lund said.

BF Enterprises Reports Income Loss


San Francisco-BF Enterprises Inc.  reported that for the three months ended
Sept.  30, net income was $80,000, or 2 cents per share on revenues of
$1,429,000.

For the same period in 1994, net income was $339,000, or 9 cents per share, on
revenues of $870,000.

The company said that the reduction in income in 1995 was due primarily to a
lower level of lot sales to builders at the company's Meadow Pointe project
near Tampa, FL, and a substantial decline in the rent being received during
1995 from the company's commercial building in Tempe, AZ.

As a result of the amendment of the original lease and the execution of a new
10-year net lease of the Tempe property, annual rental revenue from that
property is expected to decrease to approximately $350,000 in 1995 from
$505,000 in 1994, but will increase to approximately $1,450,000 in 1996.

Real estate revenue for the 1995 third quarter and nine month periods included
$804,000 from the sale of a commercial property in Edina, MN, for which the
company reported a loss of $29,000.

BF Enterprises is a San Francisco-based real estate holding and development
company.

Upon completion of the offering, the company contributed $19 million in
qualifying Tier 1 capital to its subsidiary, Hawthorne Saving, FSB.  The bank
has been under a Prompt Corrective Action Directive by the Office of Thrift

First Union Completes Record-Setting CMBS Conduit Offering


Charlotte, NC-Increased acceptance of mixed-use commercial mortgage-backed
securities helped First Union Capital Markets Corp.  complete a record-setting
$643.7 million offering.

Michael Greco, managing director of First Union National Bank of North
Carolina's commercial real estate finance unit, said the shift in the market
recently allowed his bank to make what he said is the largest conduit-financed
CMBS deal to date.

"The mixed pools are doing better than multifamilies and that wasn't true a
year ago," he said.  Investors "have embraced the diversity of property
types."

First Union claims its deal is more than double the size of the previous
record conduit offering.  The portfolio includes $553.6 million of publicly
offered securities and $90.1 million of subordinated securities privately
placed with a real estate investment trust, Mr.  Greco said.

The securitization is a "simple" collateralized mortgage obligation structure,
secured by a geographically diverse pool of mortgages, in which the greatest
concentration - less than 20% - are located in Texas, he said.

The next two heaviest geographic concentrations are in California (16%) and
Massachusetts (8%).  More than 60% of the pool was made up of multifamily
loans, 23.5% were retail, 8% healthcare, 3% hotel, and the remainder are
office, industrial and mobile home properties.

The publicly traded securities were rated AAA, AA and A by Standard & Poor's
and Duff & Phelps and the privately placed securitizations were rated BBB
minus.  The average loan size was $4 million.

RECOGNIZING DIFFERENCES: CCUL MAY CONTEST UNITY WITH ITS STATE
REGULATOR

The California Credit Union League warned its state regulator it
will fight the merger of credit union regulatory responsibilities into the
state's banking department unless it can guarantee the industry won't be
treated like banks.
        Among CCUL's concerns are retaining specialized examiners,
increased operating fees, sustaining relations with NCUA including
protecting state authority from federal encroachment and assurance that the
new regulator will promote the league's legislative agenda.
        The State of California Department of Corporations, Business and
Transportation Agency promulgated a proposal to transfer regulatory and
supervisory duties for credit unions, presently within the DoC, to the
Department of State Banking.
        John Annaloro, the league's senior vice president of public and
government relations, told California's DoC in a Dec. 9 letter that the
league's concerns "at a minimum, would have to be resolved to our complete
satisfaction before credit unions could consider supporting any
consolidation effort."
        CCUL is fighting a battle that 44 other states tussled with and
lost--but not necessarily to their detriment. "Consolidation isn't
necessarily awful. The key is the supervision has to be credit union
specific," Doug Duerr, president and CEO of the National Association of
State Credit Union Supervisors, told NCUA Watch. He said the change can be
positive because it provides additional resources, i.e. investment product
expertise and greater access to legal counsel.
        The states that still have stand-alone credit union departments are
Alabama, Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Texas and Puerto Rico.
        CCUL said the Department of Corporations is against the changeover,
but the move has the backing of powerful state legislators, including the
chairs of both the Assembly and Senate banking committees.
        While no specific legislation to advance this action in California
exists now, Robert Arnould, director of legislative affairs for CCUL, said
he will meet with California Gov. Pete Wilson's office to uncover his
intentions.
        Arnould said "the proposal is part of a broader package to
streamline and bring efficiency to state government." He said the
governor's office is very anxious to hear CCUL's concerns and it's not
really interested in moving forward unless the credit union industry has
support. "I don't think they want a big fight with the industry. They are
aware of our lobbying abilities."
        CCUL also conducted a survey among state-licensed credit unions
regarding their satisfaction with the DoC and their willingness to consider
consolidation. The study found most state credit unions would rather be
regulated by the DoC than NCUA. It also concluded most larger credit unions
opposed a merger while medium and smaller CUs supported it.
        CCUL said the merger would be detrimental to credit unions if the
new regulatory authority didn't learn the distinctions of nonprofit goals
vs. the competitive goals of for-profit banking.
        Other critical subjects CCUL broached were federal deposit
insurance and generally accepted accounting principles. The league argued
credit unions are different from other financial institutions in these
respects and warrant specialized examiners.
        California credit unions have made a substantial investment in
training and computers for the DoC credit union staff. Through the use of
operating and deposit insurance funds many millions of dollars have been
spent educating California's examiners and other officials. Therefore, the
league said, this investment would be lost if new training devices were
needed.
        CCUL also said CUs should have separate regulatory and supervisory
policies because the league and credit unions have invested substantial
resources in adopting laws and regulations that govern operations.
        The league also wants assurance that consolidation results in
reduced operating and examination fees for credit unions because they pay
for the operation of the DoC. The league also argued state credit unions
pay substantially more in operating and examination fees than their federal
counterparts.
        A consolidated regulator would have to sustain a positive
relationship with NCUA, the league said. Common examination platforms,
shared computer technology and other cooperative arrangements minimize
regulatory burdens for all parties, it argued. But the regulator would also
have to protect state authority from federal encroachment, CCUL said.
        In addition, CCUL's legislative agenda to recodify the credit union
law and seek franchise and sales tax relief would have to be maintained as
well.
        Duerr said the tax issues in California and the potential change in
the regulatory environment make the climate for state-chartered credit
unions in that state inhospitable. He said it's also important to note that
a gray area exists as each state's regulatory framework varies somewhat.
        In July 1995, a proposal was passed and signed into law by Gov.
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin that created a new department consisting of
several divisions, mirroring what is already law in 44 states. According to
the Wisconsin League, as a result of legislative compromise, credit unions
will be one of the divisions attached to this new department for
administrative purposes, while retaining its autonomy as a separate entity
called the Department of Credit Unions.
        The change is positive for Wisconsin credit unions because they
will gain administrative and legal assistance they lacked as a separate
entity.
        Gary Gores, president of the Ohio League, said his league grappled
with a consolidation bill last year. He said a bill was approved at year-
end 1995 that included a compromise with the governor's office. The league
was able to get the Ohio government to agree to have a person on staff that
would head up credit unions.
        Gores said the league wanted to make sure credit unions wouldn't be
unduly influenced by banking and thrift regulators. "In the long run it
won't hurt us. But in the short run it will be an adjustment," he said.

DODGING THE LOAN ASSASSIN
Appeals Court Rules CU Student Loans Nondismissible

Members who owe student loans to federal credit unions can't use
bankruptcy as a way to avoid paying off the debt, a federal appeals court
has ruled.
        The 1st U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in December is significant
because for the first time, a court said that federal credit unions are
"government units" for purposes of having educational loans
nondischargeable.
        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy
proceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofit
organization.
        The ruling stemmed from a case brought by T.I. Federal Credit Union
in Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.
DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case went
before the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definition
of both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for these
loans.
        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.
        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylaws
provided that shareholders get a dividend." Koban won this point in
bankruptcy court.
        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its case
to U.S. district court and it eventually ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.
        The district court defined a CU as a nonprofit because, under U.S.
bankruptcy law Section 523(a)(8), it's a "democratically controlled,
cooperative, nonprofit society organized for the purpose of encouraging
thrift and self-reliance among its members'."
        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the
"government unit" status, so the case was appealed to the 1st Circuit Court
of Appeals. The 1st Circuit said federal credit unions are, in fact,
government units, so it didn't see the need to address whether it was also
a nonprofit.
        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning of
this section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)
offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.
        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments
are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying
as a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,
insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor's
loans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters of
either provision," the 1st Circuit said.
        Koban, reached by NCUA Watch, asked rhetorically whether this
ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank is a
"government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the law
should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period. This
ruling is counter intuitive."
        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn't
address the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress is
the only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, not
the courts.
        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'
educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.
        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.
        According to the brief of the case, T.I. FCU advanced loans as part
of its special educational loan program. This program differs from standard
loan programs in that it allows for lower interest rates, gives borrowers
longer repayment periods and allows loans to be aggregated in maximum
amounts greater than those permitted under personal loan programs. The
program also enables borrowers to simultaneously borrow additional funds
and refinance outstanding balances on previous loans.
        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times for
assistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into a
single promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes
$32,618. His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but his
lawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely.
        Student loan data supplied by the Credit Union National Association
show that for year-end 1994, the latest date available, roughly one-third
of CUs offer just Guaranteed Student Loans (FFEL), one-third offer just
non-guaranteed student loans and a third offer both.
        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage of
credit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.
Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a CU that lends FFELs, and
37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends other types
of student loans. --Ken Reed

LENDERS TO FIGHT RISE IN 1099 PENALTIES

Representatives of the nation's lending industries are joining
together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for what they believe
is a plan to raise the penalties for failing to file, or filing
inaccurately, so-called "information returns," the infamous 1099s.
        These forms are used by lenders to report payments of dividends,
interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely paid, for
example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit, U.S.
government securities or similar instruments.
        The Clinton administration proposal is part of the budget stalemate
that closed the federal government for several weeks, among other
developments.
        The administration submitted a proposal to the Republican
leadership in Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to the Republican calls for
deep cuts in the federal budget that calls for increases in miscellaneous
fees and closing of certain loopholes.
        The proposal, aimed more at stirring indigination from those
affected than a plan with even a small chance of winning congressional
support, included several other provisions that the administration knew
would be opposed by powerful corporate interests. For example, it calls for
requiring federal banking regulators to impose examination fees on state-
chartered banks.
        The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments for
services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC.
        However, according to a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert
Rubin dated Jan. 2, the lenders said that an explanation provided by the
Joint Committee on Taxation Dec. 15 indicated the provision had a much
broader scope.

CU AUDITING FIRM ACQUIRED BY INSURANCE CO.

A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurance
company--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into the
insurance business.
        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British West
Indies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International Standards
Group Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory audits
for more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.
        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into the
insurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in a
recent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit union
services.
        A source within the industry told NCUA Watch that ISG is attempting
to expand into insurance because it's not making any money from supervisory
committee audits.
        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.
        ISG is the parent company of Financial Standards Group, Boca Raton,
Fla., and the only publicly owned auditing firm in the United States.

FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT TO $207,000

Fannie Mae is on the verge matching Freddie Mac's $4,150 conforming
loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its limit to
$207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage industry
sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers to
raise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect
Jan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider the
views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make its
announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said those
details would be made available shortly.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not return
requests for comments.
        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie
raised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the last
month, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the
change in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew
that to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to
Freddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be
surprised."

Direct Access Gives Boost to B Paper


San Jose, CA-Innovative Mortgage Solutions, a conduit based here, said 22% of
its total November production came from its new Direct Access product.

Direct Access is a credit score-based first and second lien product.

The new product has received a better than expected reception.  IMS had
estimated that Direct Access would account for 15% of production.

Steven Skolnik, chief executive of IMS, said despite the increase over the
original projection, the quick success was not a surprise.

"The B-paper industry will increasingly embrace Direct Access because it
simplifies a traditionally cumbersome lending process.

"Our numbers are a direct reflection of the industry's demand for this type of
product," Mr.  Skolnik said.

Direct Access allows lenders to determine the loan pricing at the point of
origination and allows for simplified credit documentation.

Eligible mortgage bankers and financial institutions have delegated
underwriting authority.

IMS is currently updating Direct Access to offer more benefits, such as an
improvement in the debt ratio requirements and removing the need for income
documentation.

"Lenders using Direct Access already have the opportunity to make their
B-paper origination efforts more efficient and profitable.

"With our intended improvements, this product will make it that much simpler
for any lender to enter the high-margin, B-paper arena," Mr.  Skolnik said.

These improvements will be incorporated into Direct Access during the first
quarter of this year.

IMS was established by First Franklin, a mortgage banker here; both are
subsidiaries of DLJ Merchant Banking, LP, New York.

FHA loan limits rise to match Freddie Mac's


Washington-The Federal Housing Administration's loan limits will rise by 1.9%
on Jan.  1 to $155,250 in high cost areas and $78,660 elsewhere.

The changes were prompted by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.'s decision
late last month to boost the ceiling on loans it buys or securitizes by 1.9%
to $207,000, also effective Jan.  1.

The rival Federal National Mortgage Association chose to maintain its limit at
$203,150, however.  And neither company seems ready to change its mind, at
least not for the time being.

Fannie Mae is "not reconsidering," said spokesman David Jeffers.  "We made our
decision, and are very comfortable with it."

So is Freddie Mac, according to chairman Leland Brendsel.

"The decision to raise our limit was an easy decision to make," he said,
"because it is consistent with the purpose for which Congress chartered us;
that is, to increase the availability, affordability and reliability of
mortgage credit."

However, both agencies left the door ajar to the possibility that they could
change their minds sometime in the future, though they said they have not
received any pressure from either Congress or the Administration to do so.

Noting that there has been "lots of discussion in the press" about potential
operational problems and market stability issues resulting from two different
conforming loan limits, Mr.  Jeffers said Fannie Mae "will certainly listen
carefully to our customers as they describe those issues to us in more
detail."

But the vice president for corporate relations said whether or not his company
would reconsider is "way too speculative a question at this stage."

"We still need to hear from our customers," he said.

Mr.  Brendsel would not say unequivocally that he wouldn't change his mind,
either.  But he said there "is no downside" to the higher loan limit, "only an
upside for the nation and consumers."

"Nearly everyone realizes that when the secondary market as represented by
Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae is allowed to serve an additional group of
borrowers, they benefit from lower rates and better mortgages," he added.

The Freddie Mac chairman also called on Fannie Mae to rethink its decision,
remarking that "the market is not well served by having these two companies
operate with different loan limits."

Mortgage Bankers Association president Paul Reid invited Fannie Mae to follow
its rival, too, saying it would be "a lot easier on lenders who seek to be as
assembly-line oriented as possible" if they could place all their loans "in
one large bucket."

Mr.  Reid predicted that Fannie Mae will "give up some market share" if it
keeps the lower loan limit, as lenders who previously did business only with
the larger, older company "will have to start" doing business with Freddie
Mac.

Meanwhile, Federal Housing Commissioner Nicolas Retsinas indicated last week
that he had no choice but to raise the FHA limits, saying that the floor and
ceiling on government-insured mortgages are "by law ...  tied to the limits
established under the Freddie Mac Charter Act."

The new FHA floor, which is the basic nationwide limit and covers some 2,100
counties, will be as follows:

* $78,660 for loans on single-family homes * $100,600 for those on two-unit
dwellings * $121,600 for three-unit buildings * $151,150 for four-unit
structures.

In high cost areas, the FHA ceiling, which is set at 95% of an area's median
house price and is applicable in 122 counties, will be:

* $155,250 for mortgages on single-family homes * $198,550 for those on
two-unit buildings * $240,000 on three-unit dwellings * $298,350 on four-unit
structures.

NY mortgage brokers refund $400,000


New York-New York State regulators have forced two mortgage brokers to make
$400,000 in refunds to 234 customers as a result of an alleged illegal
referral fee arrangement between the two brokers and home improvement
contractors.

Equity Stars Inc., Elmsford, NY, will make $250,000 in refunds (of which
$100,000 has already been returned), while PGM Enterprise Inc., Merrick, NY,
refunded $150,000.

According to state superintendent of banks, Neil D.  Levin, a home improvement
contractor would aggressively solicit homeowners for work and promise to
obtain financing for them.

The contractor then contacted one of the mortgage brokers in question that the
homeowner needed a loan.  In return, the contractor received a referral fee.

There were as many as 10 contractors involved in the scheme, but most of the
problems came from two firms, a Banking Department spokesperson said.

The investigation into this matter is on-going.

Allegedly the mortgage broker contacted the customer but did not identify
themselves as a mortgage broker and did not make known the broker fee or
supply the proper disclosures.

Consumer complaints to the Banking Department charged the brokers involved
paid the contractor out of the loan proceeds before the work had been
completed to the homeowner's satisfaction.

There were four complaints made to the Banking Department about PGM, with one
involving this matter.  Equity Stars had four complaints, all stemming from
this incident.

Besides the state law violations, the referral fee payments are a violation of
Federal law, specifically the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, Mr.
Levin pointed out.

Neither company has surrendered its mortgage broker registration.

Both firms were given two-year probationary periods and are required to post a
surety bond or have a pledged asset account of $25,000 for the duration.

Furthermore, both must perform community service.

HUD Reexamines Broker Fee Disclosures


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development has started a
negotiated rulemaking process to get various interests in the housing industry
and consumer groups to agree on what mortgage broker fees should be disclosed
under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act.

Currently, mortgage brokers have to disclose points and fees they receive from
consumers and yield spread premiums or backend fees they receive from lenders.

Brokers claim the disclosure of backend fees on the HUD1 settlement form
places them at a competitive disadvantage with other mortgage lenders who
aren't required to disclose commissions or other fees paid by their employers.

To avoid this disclosure, many mortgage brokers have secured warehouse lines
of credit to fund loans themselves, according to Robert Lotstein, a partner in
the Washington, D.C., law firm of Buckman & Lotstein.

"This makes the mortgage broker a lender," he added, even though the broker
may sell the loan to the same lender who would have table funded it.  But a
table funded transaction triggers the RESPA disclosure.

"HUD sees two issues," according to Sarah Rosen, who oversees RESPA issues for
HUD and who also is the Federal government's representative at the negotiated
rulemaking table.

"First, does RESPA require disclosure of indirect fees and does it help
consumers to shop and compare products," she said.  And second, where does the
secondary market start, particularly when lenders have effectively sold a loan
before closing.  Secondary market transactions are exempt from RESPA.

"Brokers are looking for an even playing field," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "It
would help the industry, if this negotiated rulemaking works, for HUD to tell
us what is a secondary market transaction.  To learn what needs to be
disclosed and what does not need to be disclosed."

Mr.  Lotstein attended the first negotiated rulemaking meetings on Dec.  13
and 14.  Additional two-day meetings are scheduled for January, March and
April.

The 18 representatives are also charged with reaching a consensus on the issue
of lenders paying volume discounts to brokers.

HUD has not addressed this issue before and it has not decided whether volume
discounts are an incentive or a referral fee.  RESPA was enacted 21 years ago
to prohibit payment of referral fees to parties who do not contribute anything
of value to the mortgage transaction.

"This is a big issue," Mr.  Lotstein said.  "Lenders are saying why can't we
compensate brokers if we get a volume of business from them and take advantage
of economies of scale....  Why can't we pass on some of the savings in the
form of a discount."

But consumer representatives say this is just another way to get around the
RESPA prohibition on kickbacks and referral fees.

The Federal Reserve Board also sent a staffer to attend HUD's negotiated
rulemaking meeting because several bills now pending in Congress may transfer
RESPA rulemaking authority to the Fed.

In addition, the Fed has been wrestling with mortgage broker fees under its
responsibility to issue rules on high cost mortgages under the Truth in
Lending Act.

The Fed recently reversed its interpretation and now proposes to exclude
backend fees paid to mortgage brokers in the calculation of the high cost
mortgage test.

Later this winter, the Federal Reserve Board is expected to issue a final rule
that requires consumer fees paid to a broker to be included in the finance
charge.  This change was mandated by the Rodash bill passed by Congress in
September.

"A new statutory provision categorizes all broker fees paid by the consumer to
the broker (or to the creditor for delivery to the broker) as finance charges,
and will go into effect when the Board issues a final rule in 1996," the Fed
said recently.

The statement was made in connection with a study on finance charges the Fed
is conducting for Congress as a result of the Rodash bill.

The Fed is seeking public comments on finance charges and how accurately they
reflect the cost of mortgage credit.  The comment period ends Feb.  9.

Fannie Goes for Stock Split and Buyback Plan


Washington-In a surprise move, the Federal National Mortgage Association has
announced a four-for-one stock split and a stock buyback plan that sent the
company's stock up.

"It is a nice bundle of goodies to put under the Christmas tree for investors
at the end of the year," said Thomas O'Donnell, senior analyst at Smith Barney
Inc.

"And unlike most goodies, it is not going to be in the trash heap in January.
It is going to be something that is going to carry through 1996 and 1997," Mr.
O'Donnell said.

The surprise move accomplishes several objectives for the agency.

First, Fannie Mae will diversify its capital base by issuing $1 billion in
preferred stock and use the proceeds to repurchase common stock, somewhere in
the range of 7.5-to-8 million shares.

Second, Fannie Mae will contribute three million shares ($375 million) to the
Fannie Mae Foundation to fund its charitable and affordable housing activities
through the end of this decade.

FNMA has been contributing $40 million a year to the foundation but this
contribution will allow the foundation to increase its spending on affordable
housing to $50-$70 million a year.

Fannie Mae will take a one-time $350 million charge in the fourth quarter, but
analysts believe it will help the agency meet its Federally mandated
affordable housing goals while reducing its affordable housing expenses going
forward.

Third, FNMA's board of directors authorized the purchase of up to 6% of the
shares outstanding for additional capital restructuring.  Analysts believe
these buybacks will take place in 1997.

"With these initiatives, we will maintain our capital base comfortably above
the statutory requirements, enhance shareholder value, and further expand our
commitment to affordable housing," FNMA chairman and chief executive James
Johnson said.

Unlike its competitor, FNMA does not have any preferred stock on its books.
Noncumulative preferred stock currently comprises 14.7% of the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp.'s total capital base of $5.54 billion.

"The issuance of preferred stock is capital neutral, but it gives Fannie Mae a
more diversified funding base," Mr.  O'Donnell said.  "You want to have more
than one funding source," he added.

FNMA's Federal regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight,
also gave its stamp of approval.

"Fannie Mae's capital restructuring plan will not affect the company's
compliance with capital requirements so long as any common stock that is
withdrawn is replaced by preferred stock that meets regulatory requirements
for core capital," OFHEO director Aida Alvarez said.

Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stocks are at 52-week highs and Freddie Mac
currently has a $200 million stock repurchase plan in effect.

A Freddie Mac spokesman refused to comment on the possibility of a stock
split.

Fannie Mae shareholders of record on Jan.  8 will participate in the
four-for-one split and the additional shares will be mailed Jan.  12.

Fannie Mae chief financial officer Timothy Howard commented that the split
"should make its common stock more affordable and attractive to individual
investors."

Meanwhile, Mr.  O'Donnell of Smith Barney increased his estimate of 1996
per-share earnings from $9.85 to $10.  And he raised his 12-month target price
on Fannie Mae stock from $120 to $150 on a pre-split bases.

"With the mortgage market as strong as it is right now, the stock should
perform well," Mr.  O'Donnell said.

Fannie, Freddie Stocks:  Outlook is Attractive


New York-In recent weeks, the stock prices of both the Federal National
Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  have been trading
near or above their previous 52-week highs and, according to one analyst,
should continue to trade at a high level into 1996.

Thomas O'Donnell, an analyst for Smith Barney, said, "the outlook for both
stocks is attractive and they should continue to trade highly.  The question
is whether Fannie Mae is a $125 stock that is going higher, or a $90-$100
stock masquerading as a $125 stock.  I think it's a $125 stock going higher."

Mr.  O'Donnell attributed the increased stock values of both companies to
numerous factors.

"Both stocks have done very well all year and the recent upswing could be
because a lot of people want(ed) the stocks in their portfolios by the end of
the year.  Another reason is that high-tech stocks have been in trouble while
the financials are doing very well.  Fannie and Freddie both represent
conservative financials - a good place to be.

Mr.  O'Donnell also said, "the fundamentals in the mortgage market are very
good, especially fixed-rate mortgages which can be sold in the secondary
market.  And then the monthly numbers each company puts out have been very
positive, and this attracts investors."

Another possibility for why the two stocks are trading at their 52-week highs,
according to Douglas Robinson, a spokesperson for Freddie Mac, is that the
stocks often trade in tandem with the bond market, which has been doing
reasonably well in recent weeks.

But even if the bond market falters, according to Mr.  O'Donnell, the outlook
for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock is quite good.

Fairbank has new nonconforming loan


Waterbury, CT-Fairbank Mortgage here has created a new non-conforming jumbo
mortgage loan program for its bank and mortgage broker correspondents.

These loans can be used for purchases or refinancings and for owner or
non-owner occupied properties.

Craig Cooper, executive vice president, said, "traditionally jumbo loans were
only for those with perfect credit who could verify their income.

"This new product enables banks and mortgage brokers to offer jumbo loans to
an expanded group of qualified customers including borrowers who have some
credit or income issues which could prevent them from obtaining conventional
financing."

Fairbank Mortgage does business in Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island, and operates in New York under the name Colony Mortgage.

Now DLJ is Dumping Its Mortgage Unit


Washington-A few weeks after it gave up on warehousing, Donaldson Lufkin &
Jenrette is looking to sell a major chunk of its mortgage affiliate, First
Franklin Financial Corp., San Jose, CA.

Sources told NMN late last week that First Franklin is shopping around its
mortgage servicing portfolio which may be as large as $7 billion.

First Franklin president and chief executive William Dallas, who sold the
company to DLJ in 1994, could not be reached for comment.

Last week servicing brokers said the portfolio could be a hard sell right now.

"A lot of what they have is California-based and it's likely they will not get
a good price for it with concerns about refinancings plaguing the market," a
senior mortgage official said.

One West Coast servicing broker said DLJ's merchant banking unit - which
controls First Franklin - hopes to get as much as $100 million for the unit,
"but likely won't.

"They were shopping it around for $100 million last year (1995)," the broker
said, requesting anonymity.  "If they can get $90 million, I think they'd take
it."

The broker said that DLJ likely will take a loss on the company.  "DLJ bought
the company at the top of the market," he said.  "Ultimately, this isn't going
to look good."

One source said, "this deal is going to hurt them (DLJ)," he said.  "I think
the merchant banking unit has a lot to explain to its investors."

First Franklin is the result of a merger between itself and Franklin Mortgage
Corp., Irvine, CA.  In 1994 Franklin also bought the Jacksonville, FL,
servicing operation of Ryland Mortgage Co., Columbia, MD.

In early December it was revealed that DLJ was exiting the warehouse/gestation
repo business, a line of products it had a strong presence in.

DLJ gets out of repos


New York-Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, a major player in gestation repos and
warehouse lending, is getting out of the business.

Late last week a handful of warehouse lenders said they had received telephone
calls from worried mortgage bankers who were told by DLJ that it no longer
would extend credit facilities.

DLJ senior vice president James Walsh, and Rod Ennico, who runs the gestation
business for the securities firm, could not be reached for comment.

Meanwhile, several large warehouse lenders were busy celebrating the news.

"I don't want to sound too happy but this means one less competitor for us and
more business," said one bank executive who is active in lending money to
mortgage bankers.

What exactly went wrong at DLJ, if anything, remains unclear.

One New York competitor said DLJ was an aggressive pricer that wasn't always
particularly careful with its underwriting.  "They may have taken a few hits
on their lines which caused this to happen," the warehouse executive said,
requesting anonymity.

One DLJ customer who is not happy with the news is Monument Mortgage Corp.,
Walnut Creek, CA.

"We hear they're getting out," said Monument executive vice president Jim
Umphryes.  "They have told us they will not be increasing our lines.  We have
a long-term commitment with them that we believe will be honored."

However, Mr.  Umphryes said he has been told "getting an increase or a new
line is out of the question."

Monument used DLJ's gestation repo products but also had warehouse lines with
the company.

Many large warehousers - mostly banks and large thrifts - compete directly
with Wall Street firms to fund the mortgage pipeline of home lenders.

During the past three years, warehousers have lost business to gestation repo
firms but have been fighting back with new products and pricing.

Besides DLJ, Wall Street firms that dominate the gestation repo business
include Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Nomura Securities, and PaineWebber.

Colonial mortgage has a new joint venture


San Diego-Southwest Colonial Mortgage here has formed a joint venture with
Western Pacific Housing, El Segundo, CA, to provide funding for the latter's
new home sales.

The controlled business arrangement will operate under the name Pacific
Colonial.

This is the fifth such arrangement Southwest Colonial has entered into.

The others are Koll Colonial Mortgage, Orange County, CA; Pioneer West
Mortgage, Las Vegas; North Star Mortgage, Sacramento, CA; and Liberty
Mortgage, San Diego.

Steven R.  Buehler, president and chief executive of Southwest Colonial, said,
"through the strategic alliance created, we will be able to provide one-stop
shopping to Western Pacific Housing's homebuyers and added control of the
mortgage process to the builder."

The CBA is structured in such a way to allow the builder to receive financial
benefits from the mortgage process, and is set up as a separate entity that
originates, process and closes loans for individual homebuyers.

Craig Manchester, Western Pacific's vice president, said, "the joint venture
makes good business sense because it offers a win-win situation for both
companies.

"Southwest Colonial will receive added revenues, and Western Pacific Housing
will play a much greater role in the home buying process, which translates
into an increased level of customer service for our homebuyers."

Wholesaler changes guidlines


Woodbury, NY-Delta Funding Corp., a non-conforming wholesale lender here, has
created a program with more liberal guidelines.

Loans with a minimum annual income of $25,000 can get a 55% debt-to-income
ratio for a 50 basis point add-on.

Where the total annual income is less than $25,000, a 50% debt-to-income ratio
is available with a 50 BP add-on.

Until now, such loans were subject to a 45% debt-to-income ratio.

However, there are a number of loan types not eligible for the liberalized
guidelines, including Section 32 mortgages (loans subject to the high cost
mortgage act) and those that require an 80% loan-to-value ratio on non-owner
occupied properties.

Separately, Delta has completed the public offering of $150 million of
asset-backed certificates.

The certificates are backed by home equity loans.

The underwriters of this securitization were Lehman Brothers and Natwest
Capital Markets.

Both Moody's and Standard and Poor's gave all five classes of this
securitization a "AAA" rating, based on a 100% insurance guarantee from MBIA
Insurance Corp.

This offering consists of $50.7 million of Class A-1 certificates; $37.1
million of Class A-2; $15.9 million of Class A-3; $11.3 million of Class A-4;
and $35 million of Class A-5 certificates.

Editorial:  A Pivotal Year


1996 will be a crucial year in many respects.

By year-end we will have decided who will lead the nation (and by extension
the civilized world) into the next century.

We should have in place a long-term plan to deal with the cancer of repeated
huge budget deficits that have sapped the economic energy of the country.  If
the proponents of a disciplined fiscal policy are correct (and we think they
are) this should mean a long period of lower interest rates and general
prosperity.

But there will be dislocations.  If a crackdown on entitlements is to succeed,
there must be action to slow the rapid increase in Social Security payments,
as well as other Federal payouts.

With a huge segment of the population (the Baby Boomers) headed into its 50s,
the demands on Social Security as we hit the second decade of the new
millennium will be beyond anything that could have been imagined in the early
years of the pension program.

If our society is to stay solvent and our working-age population is to have
the same standard of living (or higher) that we enjoy, we have to assure the
preponderance of the society's wealth is not poured into retirement plans,
while making certain that out senior citizens are given the "golden years"
they will have earned.

But these "global" issues are on the periphery of this paper's interests.  We
focus, in order to keep your interest, on third-party mortgage lending.

And, in our view, 1996 will be the defining year for the industry.

With an increasing number of mortgage bankers getting out of wholesale at
least temporarily, the supply/demand balance could change the next time
originations move up strongly.  The broker, who has been king in the last few
business upturns, may find that he needs his wholesale lender's good graces
more than ever before.

Mortgage investors have begun to differentiate between loans originated at
retail and those generated by brokers.

The largest of those investors, the Federal National Mortgage Association, has
warned that the quality of third-party lending must improve.

In issuing that strong caution, Fannie Mae chairman James Johnson did not
threaten two-tier pricing.  Nor did he forecast a time in which the secondary
market giant might close the window on broker-originated mortgages.

But both of those solutions are distinct possibilities.  And make no mistake,
Fannie Mae and its competitor the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  make the
rules in the mortgage market.

If they decide they no longer can afford the default rate on third-party
product, there will be no outlets for these loans at prices that would allow
brokers to continue functioning.

Should this happen, the broker community could find itself back in the role of
a hard-money lender seeking private sources for financing of its financially
strained clientele.

This obviously would be an extreme result.  But to prevent things from moving
in that direction, brokers must commit themselves to insuring the quality of
the loans they bring to the system.

The industry must weed out not only those originators willing to falsify
applications, but also those that take advantage of market conditions to earn
fees by initiating transactions which roll over borrowers quarterly or even
more often, without any inquiry from the customer.

The industry now has an important function:  to lead the mortgage borrower
through the maze of competing products and competing lenders to the right loan
for each customer.

It would be a major loss to the home-buying public if a few bad apples are
able to ruin the business for everyone.

Lockbox technology now is automated


SouthBend, IN-Data-Link Systems here has automated the final step in
processing mortgage payments.

That step - closing out a mortgage account - is the only one which mortgage
lenders have not traditionally outsourced, explained Sadu Thinakal, vice
president of the Fiserv subsidiary.

Lenders typically outsource mortgage payment processing to lockbox operations,
to which homeowners send their monthly checks directly.

The lockboxes, which usually are owned by big banks, handle all routine
payments.

That excludes the final payment, which is somewhat complicated.

"There are many extra steps involved in processing the final payment," Mr.
Thinakal said.

"Lenders thought the lockbox couldn't handle the final check because of the
extra steps involved:  balancing the account, sending letters to the county
office, the tax collector etc.," he continued.

Consequently, nobody had approached the lockbox operators to see if there was
a way for them to handle non-standard payments.  (Any so-called exception
payment, meaning it does not meet lockbox expectations, also gets routed back
to the lender.)

Data-Link, which is believed to be the nation's second-largest provider of
servicing software, recently did.

It created a system to automate all the functions associated with paying off a
mortgage, so that the lockbox need only be set up for what to expect.

Once the lockbox posts the account, the system handles tasks such as triggered
release of escrow funds and issues a triggered request to the document
custodian to release the file.

Ultimately, the system deletes the loan file from the servicing system and
saves a record on microfiche.

Data-Link's so-called payoff-through-lockbox feature should allow lenders to
maintain just a skeleton staff in payoff, Mr.  Thinakal said.  By contrast, a
large lender, with at least $20 billion in servicing, would probably have
between five and eight full-time staff manually handling payoffs today, he
said.

Besides labor savings, lenders will benefit from increased float and reduced
interest payments on mortgage-backed securities, Mr.  Thinakal said.

By eliminating the typical delay involved when the lockbox facility (to which
homeowners send their mortgage payments directly) has to send the final check
on to the mortgage company, the company should be able to deposit its money a
day or two sooner, he said.

Quicker processing should also ensure that the company meets the deadlines
imposed on mortgage servicers by mortgage-backed securities investors.

Unless the servicer tells the investor on time what mortgages backing an MBS
have paid off, the servicer is obliged to make the standard interest payments,
(as if the mortgages were still current).

"And they never recoup those payments," Mr.  Thinakal said.

The new service is "essentially free," he said.

Data-Link customers pay a $25 "transmission charge" for communicating to the
lockbox operator what to expect when the mortgage is being paid off.

Prior to this advance, Data-Link says, the closest anyone had come in
automating the payoff area was having a voice response unit tell customers how
much they owed to close out their mortgage loan.

Data-Link is also in the process of automating the procedure of establishing
whether a mortgaged property requires flood insurance and, if so, placing it.

The firm works through a third-party vendor of flood certification services.

Now servicers can manually update their systems when flood zone status
changes, but this will be done automatically by "early 1996," Mr.  Thinakal
said.

Recent emphasis on flood insurance follows the coming into effect late this
year of the National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994, plus related
requirements from the secondary market agencies.

Lenders 'not getting results' from CLOs so far


Arlington, VA-Lenders are not getting results from their involvement in
computerized loan origination systems, speakers told a conference here.

Robert Meceda, chairman of the electronic mortgage lending conference run by
AIC, said it is a fallacy that real estate agents steer consumers to lenders
participating on a CLO.

"Thirty-five percent of homebuyers are coming to the transaction with the
lender identified in advance," said Mr.  Meceda, who is managing director of
the Stratmor Mortgage Finance Group Inc.

After his presentation, the head of the Alexandria, VA, investment and
mortgage bank said he was citing research done by the National Association of
Realtors.

Mr.  Meceda added that "230 of the 250 largest Realtors surveyed have a
captive mortgage bank, by way of a controlled business arrangement."

Even apart from CBAs, he said afterward, "real estate agents typically view
themselves as entrepreneurs, regardless of who employs them."

In an attempt to avoid any problems associated with the mortgage rebounding on
them, they often avoid recommending any lender, CBA or otherwise, he said.

Another speaker, Larry Walker, director of the real estate and mortgage
industry group with EDS, echoed Mr.  Meceda.

"CLOs are not producing the business - that has been shown by several
studies," he said.

He listed involvement with CLOs as evidence of the "sheep mentality" which
begets the mortgage industry.

"One of the biggest problems with CLOs is that Realtors aren't interested,"
the representative from the Plano, TX, technology giant added.

Additionally, some say that Realtors' lack of technical knowledge often means
that a CLO is a waste unless lenders employ some sort of facilitator to assist
customers.

Still others say that lenders themselves resist the CLO concept because it
leads toward mortgages being viewed as a commodity, making price the only
difference.

HFS buying Century 21 regions


Parsippany, NJ-HFS Inc.  here has agreed to purchase the six regions of
Century 21 real estate franchise master licensees that it does not already own
for a total of $140 million in HFS common stock.

The regions involved in the sale are:  the Southwest, central California,
south Florida, the Mid-Atlantic states and eastern Pennsylvania.

There are more than 1,000 offices involved that generated more than $440
million of real estate commissions over the last 12 months.

Robert W.  Pittman, managing partner and chief executive of Century 21 Real
Estate Corp., said, "with the acquisition of these non-owned regions, Century
21 will have a direct franchise contract with all of the real estate brokerage
offices in our United States franchise system.

"We are excited about the prospects of further utilization of the only
national brand in residential real estate to the benefit of Century 21
franchisees and HFS shareholders."

HFS management has previously announced it is exploring the possibility of
using a preferred vendor system for mortgage finance suppliers.

Burnet Realty, Minneapolis, has acquired The Prudential Preferred Properties
of Chicago.

The combination will have an estimated $6 billion in sales in 1995, up from
$5.3 billion for 1994, and revenues of just over $200 million.

Burnet plans to provide a complete range of home ownership services to
Prudential Preferred, including title insurance and closing services, and
expanded relocation services.

Great Lakes Mortgage, First Security Title, Burnet Relocation Management and
Burnet Insurance all operate as part of the Burnet Financial Group.

In Hawaii, four real estate companies announced plans to merge to create the
largest company in the state, Coldwell Banker Pacific Properties.

The four firms are:  Dolman Associates, Conley Dew Ltd., Bradley Properties
Ltd.  and Coldwell Banker McCormack Real Estate.

This combination will have a market share of 19% in Hawaii, and will be the
top company in number of sales associates, offices, total listings, sales
volume and gross commission income.

Southern Energy Homes, Addison, AL, has acquired Imperial Homes Corp., a
manufactured housing company based in Hegins, PA, for $2.4 million.

The purchase price was divided between $942,000 cash and the assumption of
$1.4 million of liabilities.

Imperial had revenues of $10.5 million for 1994 and $9.1 million for the first
nine months of 1995.

Home Equity Provides Boost for California Lender


Irvine, CA-Preferred Mortgage is capitalizing on home equity lending to expand
the company's presence nationally.

In October, loan applications at Preferred Mortgage exceeded $100 million,
fueled in large part by a surge in demand for home equity loans.  While
primarily a California lender at the moment, Preferred is expanding into other
western states and plans to open shop on the East Coast in the first quarter
of 1996.

More than 80% of Preferred's 1,976 loan applications in October were for home
equity loans.  In September, the company received 1,400 loan applications.

During calendar 1995, Preferred's income increased ten-fold from the previous
year, said Todd Rodriguez, CEO.  He attributed the company's growth to its new
niche serving home equity borrowers with strong credit ratings but little
equity in their homes.  It is a market that will allow the company to continue
growing, he said.

"Our primary purpose is to lend to people who have A quality credit but little
equity in their homes," Mr.  Rodriguez said.  "We're not necessarily looking
for the collateral but more for the character."

In October, Preferred raised its maximum loan amount for home equity loans
from $50,000 to $100,000.  Preferred introduced home equity loans just over a
year ago.  Preferred offers home equity loans with a loan-to-value ratio of up
to 100%.

Preferred offers both closed-end loans and home equity lines of credit.
Currently, almost all borrowers are choosing closed-end loans, Mr.  Rodriguez
said.

Congressmen ask a rollback on limit


Washington-Two key Congressional leaders have called on the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp.  to rethink its decision to raise its conforming loan limit to
$207,000 effective Jan.  2.

But Freddie Mac has "no plans to change" its mind, according to a spokeswoman.

"We are sticking to our original position," she said.  A higher loan-limit
"makes more low-cost mortgage credit available to more families."

Republicans Rick Lazio, NY, chairman of House subcommittee on housing and
community opportunity, and Richard Baker, LA, who chairs the subcommittee on
capital markets and government sponsored enterprises, don't see it that way.

In a letter to Freddie Mac Chairman Leland Brendsel, Reps.  Lazio and Baker
said the decision to boost the limit flies in the face of Congressional
intent.

And they threatened to ask the "appropriate authorization committees to
explore" the issue "if Freddie Mac in unclear" that Congress wants "the
conforming ceiling (to) follow as closely as possible the long-term pattern in
home prices."

Noting that Freddie Mac "declined" to adjust its conventional mortgage
purchase limit when the index to which it is tied showed lower housing prices
in 1994 and again in 1995, they said "a ceiling which reflects only increases
 ...  cannot be reconciled with this Congressional intent."

If annual price decreases are not taken in the year they occur, Reps.  Lazio
and Baker said, "they should at least be recaptured before any subsequent
increases may raise the limit," Reps.  Lazio and Baker said.

"Since this year's increase does not offset the prior years' decreases, your
ceilings should remain at their earlier levels.  This is the only logical
conclusion, and the only result consistent with the intent of the statute."

That's the position taken by the rival Federal National Mortgage Association,
which was commended by the two congressmen for deciding to maintain its loan
limit at $203,150 for the coming year.

However, Freddie Mac argued that higher loan limits are necessary to bring
lower rates and better terms to homebuyers in high-cost areas.  But Reps.
Lazio and Baker disagreed.

Noting that prices actually have "declined dramatically" in "many high-cost
areas," they said the present Freddie Mac ceiling already encompasses a
significantly larger percentage of the market "in the very areas you claim
need the increases."

And in a letter to Fannie Mae Chairman James Johnson, they said the private
sector has developed a viable market for the 10% of all mortgages that are
above the two agencies' purchase limits.

Reps.  Lazio and Baker also told Mr.  Brendsel that at a time when the
allocation of government assistance "is undergoing intense Congressional
scrutiny," now is not the time to expand Federal subsidies.

The expansion of Federal credit guarantees can only help families with incomes
over $100,000, they said.

And because the Federal Housing Administration's loan base limit and ceiling
are tied to Freddie Mac's limit, they said, it also would "consume resources
that could maximize homeownership opportunities for low-income families."

Fleet will sell mortgages


Boston-Fleet Financial Group's strategy for acquiring NatWest Bank will put
billions of dollars in securities and residential loan assets on the market as
it sells off large portions of NatWest's loan portfolio as well as its own to
fund the move.

Fleet plans to sell off $18 billion of its holdings (mostly mortgages and
securities) and $13 billion of NatWest's to finance the $3.26 billion deal.
About $1 billion is to be used to fund the transaction while the rest goes to
retire debt.

"We were able to realign our balance sheet fairly dramatically in terms of
certain assets being replaced by loan assets," said president and chief
executive Terrence Murray, who said at a recent press conference that he was
pleased that Fleet was "selling no stock to complete this transaction and
financing largely internally."

Fleet's vice chairman Jay Sarles will become chairman of the new combined
Fleet Bank of New York, that includes the NatWest holdings.  NatWest chairman,
president and chief executive John Tugwell will become Fleet Bank of New
York's president and chief executive.

Most of the loan assets being sold will be residential mortgages that the bank
plans to replace with other loan types, said Fleet executive vice president
Eugene McQuade.

"In terms of the balance sheet restructuring, what we're talking about doing
both at Fleet and Natwest is to eliminate mostly low-yielding assets, mostly
investment securities and residential mortgages," he said.

"Essentially, we will make room on the balance sheet for higher-yielding
assets which we'll get from NatWest, which essentially are commercial and
industrial loans and consumer loans."

Officials at Fleet could not immediately be reached for further comment about
the composition and amount of mortgages and securities they would be selling
to finance the acquisition.

But Sept.  30 earnings reports from the companies indicate that billions of
dollars of loans from each bank's portfolios must be involved.

Fleet had $51 billion in net loans and NatWest had just $19 billion.  Loans at
that time made up about 60% of each bank's total assets.  A spokesman said
that Fleet's figures included the loan assets of the recently acquired Shawmut
National Bank.

Securitizations potentially involved $4.757 billion of mortgage-backed
securities Fleet classified as available for sale Sept.  30.  Shawmut had
$3.28 billion on its books at that time, most of which were classified as
held-to-maturity, according to earnings reports.  At both banks the MBS
represented about 40% of their total securities holdings.

Other funds involved in the deal include about $200 million that will be saved
when Fleet lays off about 1,800 employees and closes 30 of NatWest's 300-plus
branches, Mr.  McQuade said.  Most branch closings are expected to be in Long
Island, NY, where the two banks have the most overlap, and most staff cuts
will be corporate finance, technical and back-office jobs.  About half the
positions are expected to be lost through "attrition."

After $2.7 million in cash is raised for the deal, to be paid at closing
slated to occur in the second quarter of 1996, Fleet will have up to eight
years to pay NatWest's London-based parent the remaining $560 million in
payments linked to the acquired bank's earnings.  These will be annual
payments equal to about 50% of NatWest's earnings each year.

Fleet also plans to issue $600 million in preferred stock equity and $400
million in securitized debt, Mr.  McQuade said.  National Westminster Bancorp
has agreed to buy $300 million of the preferred stock issued, he added.  The
British company also agreed to keep $375 million of NatWest's problem loans
and repossessed properties in the deal, according to ratings agency reports.

Ratings agency analysts have primarily given the deal good reviews, but a few
have expressed concerns about how the sale will affect company in the next few
years.

In addition to putting more MBS on the market, the acquisition also could
potentially affect $1.8 billion in securities, according to Moody's Investors
Service, which has revised its rating outlook for these credits upward to
"positive" from "stable."

"While FLT's leverage will increase initially, creditors should benefit from a
better earning asset mix, a lower reliance on purchased funding, enhanced
revenues and expense reductions," Moody's reported.

The rating agency also reported that Fleet will benefit from strengthening its
market in the Northeast, strengthening its presence in New York and New
Jersey.  But Fleet's decision to acquire NatWest so soon after merging with
Shawmut may "present a significant challenge for FLT's management."

Because of this, analysts at Thomson Financial Services believe the
acquisition could potentially have negative implications for the company's
credit in the next one to two years until it can prove its ability to rebuild
capital.

"The increase in risk of the new asset mix will likely put a strain on reserve
coverage," Thomson's BankWatch, Inc.  reported.  "Although the acquisition
reduces FLT's reliance on purchased funds and pro forma, FLT's balance sheet
clearly has a higher risk profile."

Thomson viewed the bank's longer-term and shorter term credit more favorably.

First Mortgage Announces Expansion


Diamond Bar, CA-First Mortgage Corp., predicting that it will achieve new
originations of $100 million per month in 1996, announced plans for expansion
and a new operating structure.

Bruce G.  Norman, chief operating officer, will become the company's new
president, with Clement Ziroli remaining as chairman and CEO.

Under the direction of Mr.  Norman, the company will be restructured as two
operating groups - production headed by Abby Hedengran, and finance headed by
Pac Dong.

Until 1995 Mr.  Hedengran was a senior vice president at North American
Mortgage, Santa Rosa.  Mr.  Dong has been CFO at First Mortgage since 1976.

Mr.  Ziroli said the company's "aggressive growth plan" will capitalize on
affordable housing opportunities in the company's markets.

"We are planning multi-branch expansion, opening 10 new offices in the next
two years, in California, the Pacific Northwest, Arizona, Utah, and New
Mexico," Mr.  Ziroli said.

Mr.  Norman said homes in California are more affordable than at any time in
recent history.  "We believe housing prices are reaching lows in the current
cycle of our markets, with rents at a parity with mortgage payments," he
added.

First Mortgage projects a stable interest rate environment in 1996 that will
enable the company to reach "at least $700 to $800 million in originations,
with earnings per share of about 90 cents to $1 for our fiscal year ending in
March 1997, and at least a billion in annual originations the following fiscal
year," Mr.  Norman said.

First Mortgage is a mortgage banking company that currently operates through a
network of 12 offices in California, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

New Jersey Bank Targets Home Improvement Loans to Low-Mod


Washington-United Jersey Bank, Princeton, is targeting home improvement loans
to low and moderate income residents of Morris County.

The program, which will offer HUD-insured Title One Home Improvement Program
loans and the bank's own "Signature Loans," is a model and may be expanded to
include other areas, the bank said.

The Title One loans are special fixed-rate loans of up to $25,000, with up to
20-year terms.  The loans are currently offered at a 10.4% interest rate, or
9.9% with automatic withdrawal from a United Jersey checking account.

Title One loans are available for eligible home improvements to owner
occupants of a one-to-six-family home.  United Jersey Bank is offering the
loans through its Spectrum Mortgage division.

The "Signature Loan" is a home improvement loan of up to $3,000 available to
homeowners and renters that is currently offered at interest rates of 13.5% or
13% with automatic withdrawal.  The product is designed to include renters and
borrowers who may have little credit history.

"It is basically an unsecured home improvement loan," said Barbara Horn,
public relations manager for United Jersey Bank.

Possible uses of a Signature loan include purchase of appliances, carpeting,
or furniture.  The mortgage company offers terms of up to 60 months.

The pilot program is being offered through a United Jersey Bank branch in
Dover, NJ.  Ms.  Horn said the initiative is targeted to serve low- and
moderate-income borrowers.

"The idea is to use the pilot as kind of a test of our outreach to the low-
and moderate- income community.  We are seeking to refine our outreach
methods," Ms.  Horn said.

United Jersey Bank is the principal subsidiary of a holding company with $15.5
billion in assets.  The bank has 290 branches in New Jersey and eastern
Pennsylvania.

Wholesalers see 1996 in an optimistic light


New York-Despite the name of wholesale lending being dragged through the mud
at the end of last year, mortgage bankers are optimistic about what 1996 holds
for the third-party originations market.

Great Western Bank, Chatsworth, CA, is happy with its wholesale production and
would like to do even more, said Sam Lyons, senior vice president of mortgage
banking.

Right now 25% of its production is from wholesale.

In the latter part of 1995, a number of participants in the industry
complained about the quality of loans originated by mortgage brokers.

Mr.  Lyons declared, "we don't share that opinion here."

Great Western underwrites its loans from the beginning and those loans
originated by mortgage brokers look similar to a retail origination when the
process is finished.

To get the volume of originations desired, a lender has to be involved in all
production channels, he added.

There are a lot of lenders that have money to lend and to be successful, they
need "all arrows in the quiver," and that includes wholesale, Mr.  Lyons said.

Burton Horwitz, director of marketing for Oceanmark Bank, FSB, North Miami
Beach, FL, said the question mark in his mind is whether a loan originated on
a retail basis is better than one originated wholesale.

Oceanmark deals with brokers of a very high quality.  Those that aren't are
weeded out right away, he said.

Mr.  Horwitz reviews the application of every mortgage broker, and the vast
majority have good credit and are of good character.

"I am 100% supportive of mortgage brokers," he declared.

Oceanmark is a wholesaler in both the "B&C" (over 10 years experience) and
conforming marketplaces.

A number of wholesalers have entered the "B&C" area recently.

The big question, Mr.  Horwitz said, is how many of them will be able to
survive.

To do so, these lenders will need to provide a consistent level of service to
their customers and make loans that will perform.

Those companies that don't have the experience "may drop the ball," Mr.
Horwitz said.

Oceanmark is continually expanding its presence in the wholesale market,
recently opening up an office in Reston, VA, to serve Maryland, Delaware, the
District of Columbia and Virginia.

It has also expanded its Atlanta office and now has representatives all over
the eastern seaboard.

Rates will have an effect on the wholesale market in 1996, said Joe Harvey,
executive vice president of Countrywide Funding Corp., Pasadena, CA.

Currently the industry is in a refinance market, and that will help the
mortgage broker.

But, he added, brokers have learned their lesson from the last refi boom and
have spent the last year and a half developing relationships with Realtors and
builders.

Mortgage brokers will not forsake these relationships for refinancings, Mr.
Harvey said.

If rates stay where they are or move up or down slightly, 1996 will be a good
year for the mortgage broker, he said.

Mr.  Lyons predicted there will be consolidation among mortgage brokers with
the stronger ones surviving and the weaker ones falling away.

Laura Kenda, marketing manager for Delta Funding Corp., a "B&C" wholesaler
based in Woodbury, NY, predicted that wholesale will continue to be strong in
1996, but legal issues will have an impact on the industry.

The stronger mortgage brokers will survive, but some of the larger ones will
think about becoming lenders with their own warehouse lines, because of
litigation and laws that favor lenders over brokers, she said.

Wholesalers feel impact of stricter variance rule


New York-Small originators and wholesalers are the segment of the mortgage
industry most likely to be affected by new, stricter guidelines for the amount
of variance allowed by Wall Street in the cash value of loans pooled for
delivery.

The stricter guidelines, set late in 1995 after months of study by a Public
Securities Association task force, decreased the variance recommended to 1%
from 2%.

Wholesalers that deal with a large number of smaller correspondents will face
a difficult task in trying to enforce the stricter guidelines down the food
chain, said a spokesman for the Mortgage Bankers Association.

The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.  also opposed the stricter variance on
the grounds that smaller originators may be hurt by it.

Despite this, PSA officials have said they had to go forward with the change
in guidelines because demands of technology and standardization have made a
stricter variance necessary.

"A number of things have led to (the new guidelines)," said George Miller, the
PSA's vice president and assistant general counsel.

"Primarily there have been a tremendous amount of technological advances in
poolings and settlement advances in recent years, in particular, very
sophisticated TBA and optimization systems."

Mr.  Miller said he believes the technology has become accepted enough to
accommodate the majority of those involved in trading in TBA securitizations
by government-sponsored agencies.

He said that the automation was "at one time the province of dealers and very
large mortgage originators but now is available and used by just about all
participants in the market."

Mr.  Miller added that mortgage bankers are not bound by the bond trader
group's guidelines and counterparties are free to negotiate deals outside the
suggested variance.  But MBA officials said the industry's standard practices
make such exceptions rare.

"Dealers trading MBS from the interdealer trading screens cannot specify a
lower variance," said MBA vice president Warren Lasko, in a letter to the PSA.

"In our discussions, dealers have expressed a reluctance to carve out a
special variance rule for original issue transactions."

RESPA Guidance on Joint Ventures Coming Soon


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development is developing
guidelines to distinguish bona fide joint ventures between real estate brokers
and mortgage bankers from shams.

HUD is concerned that the structure of these joint ventures may not qualify as
controlled business arrangements under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures
Act, and the fees paid to Realtors may be illegal.

"The issue is whether you have a bona fide controlled business arrangement or
whether you have a business arrangement that is designed as a sham intending
to disguise referrals," according to Sarah Rosen, special assistant to HUD
assistant secretary Nicolas Retsinas.

RESPA permits the payment of referral fees to affiliates in a CBA so long as
disclosures are provided to consumers and profits are distributed based on a
return on equity.

In a presentation to a Mortgage Bankers Association compliance conference, Ms.
Rosen characterized a sham CBA as one where a real estate brokerage firm and a
mortgage banking company set up a joint venture to take mortgage applications
from customers in a Realtor's office.

Each party invests $50 in the joint venture, which includes one employee who
is the former loan officer of the mortgage company.  The employee's desk in
the Realtor's office is rented by the mortgage company.  And the venture
contracts all back-office work with the mortgage company except for taking the
initial mortgage application.

"Essentially, this is an entity that is not performing any work, yet
collecting significant fees with an extraordinary return in capital," Ms.
Rosen said.  "That scheme seems to be on its face designed to avoid the
prohibition on referral fees."

The guidelines will not set capital standards or work rules for joint
ventures, but should provide some clarity to the industry, she said.

Phillip Schulman, a partner in the Washington, D.C., law firm of Kirkpatrick &
Lockhart, said the industry is looking for this kind of guidance and he hopes
HUD addresses such issues in joint ventures as the paying of rent and the use
of part-time employees.

But to show that a joint venture has a real business purpose, Mr.  Schulman
advises clients not to sell 100% of the mortgages to the joint venture
mortgage company.  "A real mortgage broker sells to the highest bidder," he
said.

Meanwhile, HUD continues to struggle with the issue of whether employers can
pay fees to employees who refer business to affiliates.

And the agency has convened a working group of private sector experts to
reexamine HUD's approach to computer loan origination systems.

As HUD's point person on RESPA issue, Ms.  Rosen did not indicate that the
agency is even close to finalizing the RESPA proposal it issued in June for
public comment.

However, HUD intends to issue guidance on joint ventures "relatively soon
because we think it is important," she said.

Third of CA homes were sold at loss


La Jolla, CA-Surveys of public records by DataQuick Information Systems show
that 31.6% of all California homes sold during the first 10 months of 1995
were sold for less than their original purchase price.

That percentage of loss sales continues to decline from a 42.7% peak in
September 1993.

Because of low prices, "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the
past few years" said DataQuick CEO Donald L.  Cohn.  As a result, a higher
percentage of homes on the market "were put there because the owner was under
the gun to sell."  Many of these "have-to-sell" situations resulted in sales
at a loss, he said.

The median loss was $21,800 on a house sold for $199,000, originally purchased
for $221,000.  The hardest hit areas were those, like Orange County, which
experienced the fastest appreciation in prices during the late 80s.

In 1994, 51% of Orange County resales were at a loss, down to 45.5% through
November 1995.

Meanwhile a Chapman University study predicts existing Orange County homes
will begin to appreciate 1.4% in value next year, after a 1.3% decline for
1995 and falling prices every year since 1990.

Despite rising prices, says Jim Doti, Chapman's president and chief economist,
higher incomes and lower interest rates will combine to boost Orange County
affordability - possibly beyond the national average next year.

That increase in affordability and employment in the county should create
conditions favorable for housing starts, which presumably explains the
decision of the homebuilder Lennar, based in Miami, to begin setting up shop
in Orange County.

Norwest Mortgage value aids rating


Chicago-A recent report on Norwest Corp.  by Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.
here cites the banking company's "flexibility to recognize the significant
off-balance-sheet values housed" in its mortgage banking subsidiary as a
reason for comfort in its capitalization levels.

This was cited as one of the justifications for DCR assigning an "AA" rating
to a $200 million medium term note issue from Norwest Corp.

Des Moines, IA-based Norwest Mortgage was the top originator in the country
during the third quarter, with volume of $10.7 billion for the three-month
period, and has the fourth-largest servicing portfolio in the industry, at
$100.1 billion as of Sept.  30.

The mortgage operation is one of several "well-diversified" sources of revenue
for Norwest Corp.

"The efficiencies of scale have become apparent in Norwest Mortgage's reported
profitability over the past year.

"Positively, application volume and the level of unclosed loans are at high
levels, suggesting that performance should remain strong through the
seasonally slow winter months," DCR said.

NJMIC expands in states of Florida, Ohio and New Jersey


Roseland, NJ-New Jersey Mortgage and Investment Corp.  here has appointed
James V.  Hall to the newly created position of national director of branch
operations.

Among his responsibilities will be to ensure consistent service for the
company's wholesale clients in new market areas.

Mr.  Hall is directly responsible for the development and supervision of
NJMIC's new satellite branch offices and will recruit management personnel for
the offices.

Joel Furst, senior vice president of NJMIC, said, "Jim Hall has proven to be a
fantastic operations and sales administrator throughout his career.

"His attention to detail and valuable experience will insure that our
full-service branch offices are able to provide clients with an incomparable
level of personal service."

Most recently, Mr.  Hall was underwriting supervisor for ContiMortgage,
Horsham, PA.

NJMIC has been expanding lately, opening two new offices in Florida, and one
each in Ohio and southern New Jersey.

The company has opened a Florida regional operations office in Boca Raton to
service wholesale and retail customers in the Palm Beach-Broward county areas.
In addition, it opened a wholesale and retail production office in the Tampa
Bay area.

Dale Koch has been named Florida regional director of services and will work
out of the Boca Raton office.

Most recently he was vice president/national retail division of NationsCredit,
Charlotte, NC.

The Tampa office will be managed by Janice McFadden.  She previously held
similar positions with ContiMortgage and Independence One Mortgage, Farmington
Hills, MI.

This office will also deal with mortgage brokers in the Orlando area.

"With the growth and development of Florida's west coast and central regions,
as well as a need throughout the state for our unique mortgage loan products
and services - this is the best time for NJMIC to emerge as a viable
alternative source of funding in the outstanding Florida market.

"All processing and closing activities will take place at our offices in the
Sunshine State, so our wholesale and retail clients will be able to enjoy the
best possible attention to their specific needs," said Mr.  Furst.

In Canton, OH, NJMIC opened an office to serve wholesale and retail clients in
Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Kentucky.  The office is managed by Marty Lang,
director of business development, Ohio/Midwest region.

Most recently, Ms.  Lang was manager of NationCredit's office in Canton.

The new office will process and close loans from the region.  Those not closed
in Canton will be done in closing offices in the region.

Salvatore A.  Pappalardo, South Jersey regional director, is in charge of the
new Shrewsbury, NJ, office, where he will concentrate on the wholesale side,
seeking to develop new sources of business from mortgage brokers who serve
customers with credit problems.

Previously, he worked for PNC Bank, Pittsburgh, where he was able to establish
a retail mortgage banking relationship with a number of South Jersey Realtors.

June Fourth Corp.  starts wholesale


Boca Raton, FL-June Fourth Corp., which develops mortgage products and other
proprietary investment products for small community banks, has created a
wholesale division with the goal of providing first and second mortgage
financing for buyers in single-family home developments.

The genesis of the program, a company spokesperson said, is the trend of
corporations to contain costs by moving to the suburbs and rural areas.

"The resultant employment has created unprecedented opportunities for
single-family home developers.

"Unfortunately, many prospective purchasers do not qualify for conventional
mortgage financing," the spokesperson said.

"Our program will enable a developer to offer a variety of first and second
mortgages custom tailored to just about any borrower.

"What we hope to accomplish is a partnership between our local bank
correspondent and the developer," explained the spokesperson.

In areas where June Fourth does not have a community bank correspondent, it
will arrange for qualified developers to be able to originate and close these
loans on their premises.

The spokesperson added "the whole idea is to make homeownership a reality for
as many families as possible, regardless of the pitfalls placed in the way by
an economy in transition."

Countrywide boosted '95 wholesale volume


New York- Nearly three-quarters of Pasadena, CA-based Countrywide Funding
Corp.'s November 1995 volume was produced by third party channels, according
to data released by the company.

For the month, the firm had volume of under $3.1 billion, with the
correspondent channel accounting for $1.8 billion and wholesale recording an
additional $639 million.  Retail contributed the remaining $653 million.

This is compared with November1994 production volume of $2.2 billion, of which
$1.2 billion was correspondent, $635 million was wholesale and $420 million
retail.

Increased business at Countrywide led to an increase in employees.  The
correspondent lending system went from 214 employees in November 1994 to 277
12 months later, while for the same period the number of employees in the
wholesale system increased from 393 to 517.

Countrywide's pipeline of loans in progress stood at $4.49 billion at the end
of November 1995, versus $4.41 billion for the same day the year before.

North American Mortgage Co., Santa Rosa, CA, saw a 73% increase in loan
fundings between November 1994 and 1995, from $459 million up to $794 million.

John J.  Farrell, Jr., chairman and chief executive, declared "as interest
rates approach the historic low levels set in 1993, the potential for
substantial growth in refinance activities increases.

"Historically, the company's telemarketing division and network of wholesale
brokers have been successful in capturing increased market share during
periods of high refinance activity."

The number of new applications made at North American increased from $830
billion in November 1994 to $1.24 billion one year later.

Another wholesaler from Santa Rosa, Allied Bank, FSB, saw its origination
volume increase more than threefold during the one year period, from just
$35.6 million in November 1994 to $124.4 million this past November.

For the first two months of the fourth quarter, total volume was up 161% from
the year before, $94.9 million versus $247.8 million.

Patrick W.  Kilkenny, president and chief executive, said "we are pleased with
the growth of our loan originations at Allied Bank which is being spurred by
the long bond rally.

"We expect the volume of loan originations to remain strong as we continue our
effort to maximize our wholesale lending activities in Northern California."

The number of loans originated by Bay View Capital Corp., a thrift holding
company based in San Mateo, CA, fell off sharply, from $61.3 million to just
$16 million between November1994 and 1995.

Bay View's fully indexed origination rate for new loans may tell part of the
story.  The rate for loans indexed to the monthly COFI increased from 6.41% on
Nov.  30, 1994 to 7.74% one year later.

However, the rate for loans indexed to the one-year Treasury decreased during
the period from 9.05% to 8.07%, while the rate on 30-year fixed loans went
from 9.13% to 7.75%.

Standard Federal Bank, Troy, MI, had volume of $797.9 million in November, up
from $278.8 million one year earlier.

Portfolio loans made up only 12% of production volume during the month, versus
61% for November1994.

The percentage of adjustable-rate mortgage loans fell from 51% in November
1994 to 35% in the most recent November; during the same period the total
volume of fixed rate loans (both 15- and 30- year) went from 30% to 37%.

As of Nov.  30, 1995, Standard Federal had a pipeline of $1.19 billion, of
which 88% was fixed rate and 12% ARMs.  On the same day in 1994, the pipeline
was $633.9 million, and split 70% FRM to 30% ARM.

Celtic flavor to US mortgage deal


New York-In a deal with a Celtic touch, Citizens Financial Group, Providence,
RI, which is owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland, will acquire First NH Bank,
Manchester, NH, which is owned by Bank of Ireland.

Under the terms of the agreement, Bank of Ireland will receive a 23.5%
interest in the combination, while Royal Bank of Scotland will retain a 76.5%
interest.

Besides the interest in the new company (which is valued at $435 million),
Bank of Ireland also will receive $245 million in cash and notes.

This combination will give a nice increase to Citizens mortgage servicing
portfolio, said Jack Karaszewski, president of Citizens Mortgage Corp.,
Atlanta.

Citizens currently services $8.7 billion, while First NH has a $3 billion
portfolio.  Plans are for the portfolios to be serviced at Citizen's platform
in Columbus, GA.

First NH has average originations of between $50 million and $60 million per
month, of which 60% is wholesale and 40% retail.

The combination will have the second-largest market share in New Hampshire,
behind Norwest Mortgage, Mr.  Karaszewski said.

There is some but not much overlap of the wholesale channel of the two
companies.

Citizens has some outstanding portfolio products, especially on the adjustable
rate mortgage side, he added.

Consolidating its hold on the San Francisco market, First Nationwide Bank has
agreed to pay $70.6 million in cash for Home Federal Savings and Loan
Association.

Home Federal has deposits of $625 million and assets of $735 million.

Carl Webb, president and chief operating officer, said, "this merger
represents another very important step in our strategic expansion in
California.

"We feel the state will continue to gain economic strength as the population
grows."

Meanwhile, First Nationwide has completed its purchase of all the California
assets of CSF Holdings Inc., Miami.

This consists of four branches in the Santa Rosa area.

Because of the sale, CSF recorded a pre-tax gain of $3.2 million.

As it grows in California, First Nationwide is getting out of other states.
It has agreed to sell 21 Detroit area branches to Charter One Financial,
Cleveland, parent of First Federal of Michigan.

The branches have $765 million in deposits, for which Charter One will pay a
premium of $55 million in cash or 7.18%.

Independence Savings Bank, Brooklyn, NY, is buying the two First Nationwide
branches on Staten Island, which have deposits of $285 million.

Pending is a deal where Independence buys three Brooklyn branches from First
Nationwide.

Westcorp, the Irvine, CA-based holding company for Western Financial Savings
Bank, FSB, has purchased 80.1% of the Hammond Co., a Newport Beach, CA,
mortgage banker.

Thomas T.  Hammond, president of Hammond, controls the rest of the company.

Hammond had volume of $375 million for fiscal year 1995 (almost all of it
retail) and a $500 million servicing portfolio.

Western Financial had volume of $268 million (mostly wholesale) for the first
three quarters of 1995, and has a $4.5 billion servicing portfolio, of which
$3.2 billion is for other investors.

Plans are for Western Financial to acquire the Hammond servicing and combine
it with its own, a spokesperson said.

But the two companies will remain separate for origination purposes.

American Industrial Loan Association, a non-conforming wholesale mortgage
banker, based in Virginia Beach, VA, has agreed to purchase at least 87% of
the stock of First Security Federal Savings Bank Inc., Annandale, VA.

If 100% of the outstanding stock is acquired, the maximum premium is $150,000.

First Security's primary focus is the origination of conforming loans in the
Maryland-District of Columbia-northern Virginia region.

Allen D.  Wykle, chairman and chief executive of American Industrial, said,
"First Security is a good fit for American Industrial.

"It will provide us with access to the conforming mortgage business in a
geographic market for which we have many years of profitable lending
experience."

Standard Federal Bank, Troy, MI, has agreed to purchase Bell Bancorp Inc.,
Chicago, for $354.1 million in cash.

Bell's subsidiary Bell Federal Savings and Loan Association has deposits of
$1.6 billion and assets of $1.9 billion.

After the deal is closed, Bell will operate under its current name.

Thomas R.  Ricketts, chairman, president and chief executive of Standard
Federal, said, "our goal is to capitalize on our retail mortgage loan and
fully automated branch delivery systems to increase Bell's market share in the
Chicago area."

Robert G.  Rowen, president and chief executive of Bell, said that low and
moderate income borrowers will benefit from this merger because of Standard
Federal's many special credit-related programs.

"It has also received an 'outstanding' Community Reinvestment Act rating from
the Office of Thrift Supervision, and it has won many local and national
awards for its community lending activities," Mr.  Rowen said.

Marine Midland Bank, New York, has agreed to buy East River Savings Bank from
River Bank America, New Rochelle, NY, for $93 million.

East River has 11 branches with $1.2 billion in deposits; Marine Midland will
also acquire $1.1 billion in assets.

NY broker wants to educate borrowers


New York- Fidelity National Mortgage, a mortgage brokerage operation that
specializes in making affordable loans, has as its goal educating borrowers as
well as mortgage brokers.

John Boxman and his partner Kenneth P.  Warner, an attorney, started Fidelity
National three years ago "with the intention to house everyone," said Mr.
Boxman.

He said one of the greatest obstacles to homeownership in addition to not
having a downpayment is not knowing the homebuying process.

Mr.  Boxman said "35% of people who do not purchase a home do so not because
of lack of a downpayment but because they don't know the how to start the
process."

To address these obstacles to homeownership, an in keeping with its aim to
house everyone and as the company discovered, to meet the unmet needs of low
and moderate income and minority borrowers, Fidelity National has instituted a
couple of themes that underly its origination process.

For this year, 1996, Fidelity National will have as it theme 'Knowing How to
Get Started'.  As part of that theme $20 from each loan originated will go to
Habitat for Humanity.

Its first theme was House New York, where in 1995 $10 from each loan was
donated to Habitat for Humanity.  The House New York program allowed for three
percent downpayment on a single family house and five percent downpayment on a
two family house.  Mr.  Boxman said a check for $1,000 was donated to the
organization, created by former President Jimmy Carter, which builds housing
through donations such as this and sweat equity for low and moderate income
individuals across the nation.

Mr.  Boxman said "structuring the loan is key."  He said brokers need to be
educated on how to structure loans, particularly affordable loans.  "Here in
New York people do not have savings.They seem not to have the downpayment, but
most borrowers have jobs and incomes but somewhere they had a credit glitch
that was never fixed.," he said.

"Sure you need to spend a little more time with them and sometimes you need to
convince them they can buy the house," he said, but "we need to get them into
conventional mortgage programs where they can make the payments" and are not
charged excessive interest just to get a loan.

One example of structuring a deal would be to use the Federal National
Mortgage Association's Community Homebuyer program or any 97% program which
allows for a seller's concession of three percent which in effect allows you
to raise the purchase price three percent, have the sellers concession.  This
allows 100% financing for the borrower who must only pay closing costs.

Educating borrowers takes the form of weekly seminars which are attended by
approximately five to seven people and hosted by Mr.  Boxman's partner Mr.
Warner.

Mr.  Boxman said Fidelity National uses materials from private mortgage
insurance companies particularly United Guaranty Residential Insurance Corp.,
and the Federal National Mortgage Corp.'s homebuyer education materials "which
are very simple to digest."  Mr.  Boxman added that Fiedlity national in its
use expands on the materials.

Additionally, Fidelity National's 10 loan officers meet with clients of
clients of realtors on an individual basis to education them on the homebuying
process.

Mr.  Boxman said the mortgage brokerage makes between 50 to 60 loans per month
and approximately 800 loans per year.  Approximately 75% to 80% of loans
originated are mortgage loans made to low and moderate income and/or minority
borrowers.  The other 20% or so are conventional loans.

Fidelity National is completely computerized and everything is explained to
the borrower from application, verification, credit report and appraisal.

The company began using laptops from its inception.  Mr.  Boxman said
technology is the future of the business.  This year, perhaps later this
month, the mortgage brokerage operation will have a page on the world wide
web, expanding its reach onto the internet.

The mortgage broker has a number of relationships with mortgage bankers
including Prudential, Loan America and Countrywide to whom it sells its loans.
On average its sell 20 to 25 loans to each.

The mortgage brokerage operation, which makes loans in the five boroughs but
focuses on Staten Island and Brooklyn primarily, found when it entered the
community that low income and minority borrowers were a neglected clientele.

One way it reaches out to such clientele is by working with Neighborhood
Housing Services, a community organization which refers potential borrowers.
"NHS may have clients interested in purchasing a house.  We interview them and
set them on a course or plan to get them into homeownership.  if they follow
that plan in maybe eight months they can purchase a house," said Mr.  Boxman.

CA home sales up 4th month


La Jolla, CA- Home sales in southern California increased for the fourth month
in a row in November when looked at on a year-to-year basis, according to a
report from DataQuick Information Systems here.

However, on an overall basis, for the first 11 months of 1995, home sales in
the region were down over 9% when compared with the same period in 1994.

Between January and November 1995 170,703 houses were sold in the six county
area, versus 188,137 the year before.

In November itself, there were 15,983 houses sold, up 2.1% from November
1994's 15,655 houses sold.

This is down 2.1% from the 16,320 houses sold in October 1995, but DataQuick
said a decline between October and November is normal, and in fact, this was
the best November for home sales so far in the 1990s.

"The sales surge is coming in the entry-level part of the market.

"Because of low prices and low interest rates, a lot of people who couldn't
afford to buy a home before can afford to now.

"We're watching the numbers carefully, the increase in buying activity should
spread into other home categories in 1996," said Donald L.  Cohn, chief
executive of DataQuick.

Entry-level sales account for the bulk of the transactions taking place today,
unlike five years ago, when sales were distributed across all categories, from
entry-level to prestige homes.

This can be seen in the median sales price, which for November was $161,000,
down from $164,000 in November 1994.

For the first 11 months of 1995, the median home price was $160,000, down 4.8%
from the $168,000 median home price for the same period in 1994.

The six southern California counties studied are:  Los Angeles, Orange, San
Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura.

A second DataQuick study found that statewide in California, fewer homes are
being sold at a loss to the previous owner.

Between January and October 1995, 31.6% of sellers said they received less for
their property than the amount the purchased it for, a decline from 34.7% for
the same time frame in 1994.

The amount of sales made a loss began to climb in California starting in early
1991, and peaked at 42.7% in September 1993.

In October 1995, it was 31.2%.

Mr.  Cohn said "a lot of homeowners have put off selling during the past few
years because of declining prices.

"So a higher percentage of the homes that were put on the market, were put
there because the owner was under the gun to sell for one reason or another.

"Many of these 'have-to-sell' situations resulted in a loss.

"We may find it shocking that three in ten sellers lose money, but we need to
remember that it still means most people are making money."

Hardest hit were the areas where prices appreciated the greatest during the
boom period in the 1980s.

For example, 45.5% of home sales in Orange County in the first 10 months of
1995 were done at a loss; this is still an improvement over the 50.9% that
were done at a loss in 1994.

Ventura County, which had 52.8% of home sales in 1994 at a loss to seller, saw
that percentage drop to 40.9%.

Another area were sellers were impacted was San Diego, where 41.4% of homes
sold in the first 10 months of last year were for a loss, down from 42.2% in
1994.

On the other hand, Madera County had the best results; just under 10% of homes
were sold at a loss between January and October of 1995, up from 9.5% for the
same months in 1994.

Washington state is on the cutting edge for mortgages


Seattle-About 80 wholesale lenders are currently doing business in Washington
state, says John Porter, president elect of the Washington Mortgage Brokers
Association and an owner of Mortgage Master Service Corp.  in Kent.

Mr.  Porter, who is both a mortgage broker and banker and a correspondent with
more than one wholesale lender, says the state is "one of the most popular
places in the country with wholesalers right now, because of the stable
economy - which is more diversified and less dependent on Boeing - and home
prices, which are still appreciating at a rate of 3% to 6%."

Fleet is coming back into the Northwest market, he says, as is Home Savings of
America (now in the process of locating a regional branch office in Bellevue
and expected to begin production in the first quarter 1996).

He expects Chase "will be coming in big," once it finalizes the merger deal
with Chemical Bank.  These wholesalers will be looking for players -
correspondents with experience who can close in their own name, he said.

Mr.  Porter, who funds in his own name, said most wholesalers expect a
correspondent to put up $500,000 cash to be a player.

But he also sees the industry shifting to accommodate the small, independent
players who are handling 60% to 70% of the nation's mortgage originations.

"Small, independent mortgage brokers can move fast and make it at 1.5 points,"
he said, while the big lenders, who need a 1.75 loan fee to break even, will
increasingly move toward providing back-up services for the independents.

Evergreen Money Source, Bellevue, is reaping the benefits of that strategy.

Gary Winslow, president and marketing director, correspondent lending division
for Evergreen, says his company "has increased business by 100% since he came
aboard in July, primarily by providing good service to correspondent brokers."

"Our goal is to turn around and fund a correspondent's submission within 24
hours and we rarely do it in less than 48 hours," he said.

Prior to this year, the company mainly handled retail nonconforming loans, but
its growing correspondent lending division is in an expansion mode.

"We're looking for quality mortgage brokers with experience, who have been in
business a long time.  We want to deal with the most professional mortgage
broker we can find.  We're not so heavy on net worth and financial strength as
we are on professionalism and experience.  We like them to be members of the
state mortgage brokers or bankers associations," he said.

A past president of the Washington Association of Mortgage Bankers, Mr.
Winslow says the most active mortgage lending areas in Washington and Oregon
are Puget Sound and the Vancouver-Portland market.

"The Puget Sound area has rebounded nicely from last year.  It's not the
refinancing boom of '92-'93, but it's very active and it could be the start of
a flood," he said.

Rick Merlino, who heads the nonconforming wholesale division of Evergreen
Money Source, said the company primarily handles A and B paper in Washington
and Oregon and just started in Idaho's Coeur d'Alene and Boise markets.

The company does "a fair amount of stated income product," for nonresident
aliens who have no documentation, often Russian or Saudi citizens, he said.

"We've built our business in the niches," some 40% of it based on credit
issues like a lack of documentation, higher LTVs, or no paper trail of a down
payment, he said.

The company also funds manufactured housing loans.  While it's not yet big, it
is growing, Mr.  Merlino says.

The company's average loan size is around $135,000 and Puget Sound is its
strongest market.

Evergreen's nonconforming loan division is accepting new mortgage brokers and
bankers.

What the company looks for in a mortgage broker or banker, says Mr.  Merlino,
is "a quality shop with professional people concerned with getting good
service at a good price, with no prepayment penalties.

"We strive hard to be professional and to give the professional broker the
service they need.  We understand relationships.  We know they are hard fought
and hard won.

"We want the broker to know we'll protect their relationships, that they can
depend on us to do what we say we'll do," Mr.  Merlino said.

Kendall Frazier, wholesale account executive with Metropolitan Federal Savings
and Loan, said the company's "Make Sense" portfolio loan program is popular
with brokers.

The program is designed for conforming loans that deviate from the normal
guidelines of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae but are not bad credit risks.  She is
also seeing a lot more refinancings because of the current low interest rates.
Strong mortgage origination centers in the state, she said, are King, Pierce
and Snohomish Counties.

Joe Ebner, vice president of mortgage production at Washington Mutual, says,
"production has been marvelous for Washington Mutual, which has been the
number one mortgage lender in Washington for 28 years and just took over as
first in Oregon."

Mr.  Ebner said the company holds a 10% market share of the
Portland-Tri-County area, over 13% of the market share in King County, 14% of
Spokane County, and 13% of Pierce County.  The company's average loan size is
$115,000 in Washington, Oregon, Idaho and Utah.

Its most popular loan is the 30-year at 15-year fixed, he says, and "the
purchase market is extremely strong in both Washington and Oregon."

The company funds both conforming and nonconforming loans.  On the
nonconforming side, the issues are usually less than perfect credit or an
unusual property.  The average loan size ranges from $200,000 to $300,000 and
is limited to $400,000.

The company has been a leader in manufactured home loans since 1969, he said,
and is now extending 25- and 30-year loans with land valued in hundreds of
thousands of dollars.

Washington Mutual is doing a number of speculative construction loans for
homebuilders and investors in the City of Seattle, he said.  "The market is
strong, not overly heated up but very stable, very strong," with loans of
$500,000 moving well, he said.

Continental Savings Bank has never been in the wholesale business except as a
master servicer of loans across the state for the Washington State Housing
Finance Commission's (WSHFC) bond program.  But according to Rick Bennion,
vice president in charge of Residential Mortgages for Continental Savings
Bank, the company now has "an embryonic wholesale division."

The start-up wholesale division is the result of Continental's leadership in
helping to develop, promote and originate the FHA 203k in the state.

When Mellon took over U.S.  Bancorp, it agreed to originate the 203k loan
product but it did not want to handle the contractor part of the loan deal.
Yet, the 203k was one of the loan products offered in a special city housing
program partnered by the City of Seattle, WSHFC and U.S.  Bank, designed to
increase city residency of police and fire personnel.

The program offered lower mortgage rates, lower down payment requirements and
lower loan and escrow fees.  It was immediately popular and quickly expanded
to include all city employees.

Continental, which was already a strong pipeline for the 203k, had it's
contractor inspection system in place, and knew all the players involved with
the city program, agreed to buy the product.

"We have never been in the wholesale business," Mr.  Bennion said.  "But when
the Mellon opportunity came along, we saw this as a great opportunity to put
our toe in the water, to invest in the infrastructure and to grow it.  We
might consider doing it with other institutions."

As the master servicer for the WSHFC's bond loan program, Continental works
with some 250 mortgage bankers and thrifts across the state.  It's own 203k
program has nearly 200 homes under construction and over 200 more loans in
process in Snohomish, Kitsap, King, Pierce and Spokane Counties and Vancouver,
Washington as well as Portland.

The benefits of making 100% loan-to-value mortgages


by Marianne Arbulu Vice President, National Lending Center Inc.

National Lending Center, Deerfield Beach, FL, is a mortgage wholesaler doing
business in Florida, Georgia, Illinois and North and South Carolina.  It
operates, according to its own promotional literature, "within the confines of
even the most forbidding credit history."  Ms.  Arbulu has written an article
about when 100% financing is appropriate, which is presented as our Viewpoint.

A while back, I read an article in a national publication about the risks of
100% financing.  While the article pointed out some very valid issues, I was
concerned that it didn't address any of the benefits, nor did it point out
ways to mitigate the risks.

With the advent of high LTV loans in the marketplace, we all need to
understand which borrower benefits from this product and how to reduce or
eliminate risk.

Full 100% financing offers several benefits to borrowers that brokers can
market to full advantage.  The program provides an opportunity for new
homeownership to clients who haven't had the ability to accumulate a down
payment.

On a refinance or second mortgage, clients can improve their cash flow by
consolidating debts, or minimize the interest they are paying on consumer debt
versus a second mortgage.  They may even gain tax advantages in this scenario
or find themselves able to use equity which was previously unavailable to
them.

Risk-wise, this product is truly the last stop for the consumer.  In most
scenarios, tapping out equity renders most customers non-lendable for years to
come.  So it is crucial to understand the type of customer for whom this loan
works to full advantage.  Primarily, borrowers who fit the 100% profile have
AA credit and have never had a problem paying their bills.

Let's take the case of the couple who is looking for either a full refinance
or a stand-alone second mortgage, utilizing 100% of the equity.  The ideal
borrowers, in this case, are people who, while they have revolving and
consumer debt in addition to their mortgage, don't need that revolving debt to
survive on a month-to-month basis.

They haven't used the consumer debt to supplement their income; therefore,
they have available credit and make payments in a timely manner.  So why would
this couple tap out their equity?

Primarily, the loan would give them the opportunity to further improve their
cash flow and reduce their overall monthly expenses.  It would bring down
their interest expense and may give them some tax benefits through interest
expense deductions by using the equity in their home as security.

This customer, who prior to debt consolidation had a 45% debt ratio, now has a
35% debt ratio post-consolidation.  Even with all the equity tapped out, if
they come across unexpected monthly expenses, this couple can handle it.

Now let's look at the borrower for whom this loan is not appropriate.  We have
a husband and wife, salaried individuals who simply don't make enough money to
meet their monthly needs.  They have children, school expenses, car repairs,
and have historically used credit to supplement their income.

They are heavily indebted with both revolving and unsecured debt.  They pay
their bills on time and their credit looks spotless, but they have probably
used one set of credit cards to pay existing credit card bills.  Today they
are sitting in a difficult cash flow position with 50% or more debt ratio.

If we consolidate these customers, tap out all the equity in their property,
squeak them into an acceptable debt ratio, they could be headed for trouble.
Now, if they need car repairs, tuition, anything we don't routinely think of
as household operating expenses, they must incur more consumer debt.

They have taken themselves totally out of any lendable position.  They are now
back to using debt to supplement their income, and with the loss of their
equity, they have no remedy.  For obvious reasons, the 100% product does not
benefit these clients; in fact, it disables

The 100% purchase, when marketed to the appropriate customer, is a golden
opportunity for brokers.  Again, the ideal borrowers are a young couple, both
working, paying a rent similar to what a new housing payment would be, using
credit moderately with debt ratios that are reasonable without having to
consolidate.  Their only difficulty has been in saving toward a down payment.

For this kind of client, with their careers ahead of them and expected
increases in income, the 100% loan is a prime opportunity.  It gives them the
ability to buy property today, at today's prices, get available tax benefits,
and effect no major change in household operating expenses.

The key to a successful 100% purchase loan is the term.  Most 100% loans are
really a combination 80% first mortgage and 20% second.  The 80% first is a
standard 30-year amortization with a 180-month balloon.

The second mortgage, however, is structured to be fully amortizing over the
shortest term possible, ideally, somewhere between five and seven years.
Assuming a 0-3% appreciation, the property alone will not improve the equity
position.  The only way to improve the equity position is to pay down the loan
in the quickest period of time.

A short-term second is almost like forced savings.  The borrowers apply a
tremendous amount of principal every month back to the property so that at the
end of a loan with a five-year term, they could be back to a 20% equity
position.  It's as if they saved the down payment after they got the house.

If these customers comfortably meet a 40% debt ratio, have moderate income
growth and experience moderate appreciation, they will be in good shape within
a three-to-five-year period and in a position to refinance into a conforming
loan, further reducing their monthly expenses.

To summarize, the 100% loan is not for everyone.  It's not for the person
who's strapped.  It's not for the person who doesn't expect moderate income
increases over the next three to five years, and it's not for people who
haven't been able to manage their debt.  However, the broker who targets the
right customer stands to do a considerable amount of business with this
product.

HUD Sells Title One Loans


Washington-The Department of Housing and Urban Development recently sold 2,707
defaulted Title One loans to Sagres Co.  Inc.  in a Nov.  7 auction.  Sagres
is located in La Jolla, CA.

In what has been described as an effort to sell "the worst of the worst," HUD
offered a package of defaulted, unsecured Title One loans made for home
improvement and manufactured housing purposes.  In most cases the loans
defaulted more than five years ago and have already been through extensive
collection efforts.

As a result, HUD got what was expected from the sale:  very little.

The winning bid was 0.66% of the total outstanding debt.  HUD sold about $25
million in outstanding debt.  Since HUD was ready to write the loans off, the
low price they fetched was not much of a disappointment.

"The lesson is that you don't sell the worst of the worst alone," a person
familiar with the sale said.

But HUD still has about 40,000 Title One loans with a total outstanding debt
of over $300 million, many of which make more promising candidates for sale.
HUD is currently evaluating that portfolio, which is managed by debt
management centers in Albany, Chicago and Seattle, to try to determine if it
makes sense to sell the loans to the private sector.

Mellon buying big wholesaler


Farmington Hills, MI-Mellon Bank Corp., Pittsburgh, will be purchasing Source
One Mortgage Services Corp.  here from Fund American Enterprises Holdings
Inc., Norwich, VT, industry sources confirm.

The sales price is set at a premium of $65 million over the company's adjusted
book value at the closing date.  The adjusted book value was $285 million at
the end of the third quarter 1995, according to a Fund American spokesperson.

Lehman Brothers served as Fund American's adviser in this transaction.

Fund American would not disclose who the purchaser was other than to say it
has signed a letter of intent with a "significant financial institution."

The buyer is a "first rate organization" that is a "good match" for Source
One, the spokesperson said.

Mellon said it had no comment.

A definitive agreement will be signed before the end of this month.

Source One, which currently services $33 billion, is a low cost servicer, with
excess capacity available, which makes it attractive for an organization
growing its servicing, added the spokesperson.

During the refinancing boom of the early 1990s, Source One was subject to
severe run-off problems with purchased mortgage servicing rights.  To make up
earnings, the firm later sold portions of its servicing portfolio.

Fund American placed Source One on the auction block in August 1994, but
failed to get its price and pulled the company.  Lehman Brothers had also
served as adviser in that attempt.

Source One's servicing portfolio dropped from $40 billion at the end of the
third quarter of 1994 to $28.6 billion at the end of the third quarter last
year, a 28.5% decline, according to data from a National Mortgage News survey.

But the company has been growing the portfolio again, the Fund American
spokesperson said.

The same survey has Mellon Bank as the nation's 11th-largest servicer, with a
portfolio of $45.67 billion.

On a pro-forma basis (and including the pending Chase Manhattan/Chemical
merger), the Source One/Mellon combination would constitute the industry's
seventh-largest servicer, at more than $78 billion.

What was not a factor in Fund American's decision to sell was fears about
run-off in a declining interest rate environment, coupled with a new rule that
equalizes the accounting treatment between originated and purchased mortgage
servicing rights.

"Portfolio run-off is a difficulty for the entire industry.

"But that is not a major consideration here.

"In the mortgage business, especially with FAS 122, you have to accept that
(servicing) is volatile," the spokesperson said.

Source One had originations of $3 billion for the first nine months of 1995,
of which 60% was retail and 40% wholesale.

Mellon has been an active buyer of mortgage servicing as of late, with its
most significant deal coming in September, when it purchased Metmor Mortgage,
Overland Park, KS, from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York, for
$165 million cash.

In that deal it acquired a $13 billion residential and commercial servicing
portfolio.

Back in 1994, it acquired U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage Co., Portland, OR, a $4.3
billion servicer.

Mellon also was a bidder in a bankruptcy court-ordered rebidding for Lomas
Mortgage USA, Dallas, but was not the winner.

Separately, Mellon announced it has named Ronald E.  Stroble national retail
production manager for Mellon Mortgage Co.

He joined Mellon as part of the U.S.  Bancorp Mortgage deal (where he was
production manager), and will remain based in Portland.

Mr.  Stroble is responsible for Mellon's 107 retail production offices
nationwide.

California brokers expecting a banner year


Mortgage lenders doing business in California expect good news for a change.
California Association of Mortgage Brokers president Virginia Ferguson told
Origination News that 1996 is likely to be one of the biggest years for
purchase loans California has ever seen.

Analysts are saying the state with the world's sixth largest economy is
finally putting quakes and base closures behind it to resume good health.  The
Southern California real estate market is bouncing off its bottom, and the
state again outpaces the nation in job growth.  UCLA economists say California
will generate about 820,000 new jobs through 1998.

James Chapman, president of First Security Loan Corp., one of the largest
mortgage brokerages in the nation, told ON, "California is going into the year
with a tax surplus, more businesses moving in than out, and interest rates
seeking historic lows.  We're looking forward to a great year."

Stephen Levy, director of the Center for the Continuing Study of California,
said the California recovery is being led by foreign trade, hi-tech industries
and the entertainment business, with gains in income and spending outpacing
inflation.

The only real weak spot Mr.  Levy sees has been construction activity, and
some major builders like Lennar and Catellus are positioning themselves for a
building recovery in the very counties, like Orange, that have most been in
the doldrums.  Mr.  Levy expects Orange County employment figures released in
January and February to show dramatic improvement.

Has Orange County -- notorious for its county bankruptcy following a $1.2
billion loss in the derivatives market and its plummeting real estate prices
-- bottomed out?  Clement Ziroli, Chairman and CEO of First Mortgage Co., says
so.  "We think that because we have a very substantial book of loans there,"
Mr.  Ziroli told ON.  "We've definitely seen a stabilizing of homes in
foreclosure."

TRW REDI analyst Nima Nattagh is not so sure:  "What we see is the declining
trend continuing."  But Mr.  Nattagh, who sees no connection between Orange
County's bankruptcy and its falling home prices, does note that "for the first
time since 1990 we have seen foreclosures decline there."

Ian Wong of Mortgage Information Corp.  in San Francisco cited statistics
showing Southern California delinquency rates declining, though remaining
worse than those for the nation as a whole.

A Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Co.  report says mortgage insurance losses
"attributable to California reached 39% of all mortgage insurance losses in
1994," but have since stabilized.  "DCR believes that housing prices are at or
near lows in Southern California."

Mr.  Ziroli said the good news is that contracting prices have boosted home
affordability in many parts of California, with interest rates down far enough
to make mortgage payments compete favorably with rents.

Mr.  Ziroli agrees with Stan Ross, managing partner of real estate consultants
E&Y Kenneth Leventhal, that California's primary home buyer in 1996 will be a
first timer -- probably a member of an ethnic minority and/or a recent
immigrant.

Were it not for foreign immigration, California's population would be
declining, largely because of out-migration to other Western states.

Given that profile of a typical California borrower, Ms.  Ferguson said the
GSEs' pushing FICO credit scoring "is the most serious issues facing our
industry today.  FICO scoring is not going to put a great deal of borrowers
into homes.  The likelihood that they are going to meet the Congressional
mandate is not very great."

Ms.  Ferguson, a partner in Heritage Valley Mortgage, says her company is very
active in working with low-to-moderate lending and first-time buyers,
utilizing "numerous county MCC programs in tandem with both conventional and
FHA/VA loans" to get those borrowers into homes.  She agrees that modification
of Fannie and Freddie underwriting guidelines for "vanilla" product will have
to be made in order to meet Congressional lending mandates.

Ms.  Ferguson said improvements in the real estate move-up market for
high-priced areas are being slowed by lagging state allocations for MCC bond
programs, a situation that CAMB will target for lobbying.

Though California real estate prices have fallen, they still remain higher
than in most parts of the country.  California Association of Realtors
president Rick Snyder says thousands of moderate-income Californians will
benefit from the recent HUD and FHA raises in loan limits for high cost
states.

"Refis will be substantial but not the engine that drives the train," Mr.
Chapman said, joining Ms.  Ferguson and North American Mortgage president
Terry Hodel in predicting a healthy mix of purchase loans and refis for
California in 1996.

Mr.  Chapman disagrees with Mr.  Ross' prediction that technology and the
Internet will make a big impact on real estate lending in1996.  "Those things
are here to stay," said Mr.  Chapman, "but it's not as pervasive as some
people think.  A lot of loan officers are still resistant to computers.
Nothing of real substance has happened on the Internet that affects the
mortgage industry because there hasn't been a need for it.  It may be as long
as another two to three years before that happens."

He said mortgage lending is too technical and intricate to be mastered by the
software available on the Internet.

Controlled business arrangements, on the other hand, have arrived to stay, Mr.
Chapman said.  First Security has loan representatives in the offices of Frank
Howard Allen & Co., a leading Northern California Realtor.

"CBAs are part of the mixture that will make us successful," he said.  "We're
probably going to do a capture rate of 25 to 35%."

B and C loans pose 'unique challenges'


Houston-EquiVantage president John Smith said he felt pressed but confident
about the ways his B&C business manages risk during the busy month of
December.

In fact, the unique challenges of B&C lending are exactly what Mr.  Smith said
he likes about the work.

"I find (nonconforming lending) attractive because its not as cookie-cutter as
conventional lending," he said.

Mr.  Smith is president of both EquiVantage and servicer Transworld Mortgage
Corp., a legally separate business that EquiVantage was originally a division
of.  Transworld recently completed its second securitization, totaling $75
million and consisting of three classes of fixed-rate HEL certificates backed
"predominately by first-liens due to current interest rate environment."

Its first, similarly structured $65 million securitization was completed
earlier in 1995, he said.

The issues have traded "at a slight discount, 99 30/32 - effectively at par
when priced off the yield table," and were bought by "various institutional
investors," Mr.  Smith said.

EquiVantage has a $15 million net worth and combined the two companies have
assets totaling $65 million that Mr.  Smith is charged with overseeing.

Standard & Poor's has recently reported that it is concerned with the credit
quality of HEL and B&C paper, and many players in the market are dropping out
after failing to rise to the challenges of the business.  But with insurance
from Financial Guaranty Insurance Co.  and underwriting from CS First Boston,
EquiVantage's recent issue has received AAA ratings from both S&P and Moody's
Investors Service.

Mr.  Smith added that he is confident that his experience, combined with
strong staffing, marketing and capitalization that keeps the market from
becoming too crowded, will sustain the company as a player.

"We will be in the business long-term," he predicted.  "It's highly capital
intense, so there are substantial barriers to competitors entering the
marketplace.  You need $25 million to $50 million just to get involved."

Mr.  Smith's background in the nonconforming business includes five years
working with "programs for acquiring and securitizing" at United Financial
Companies and previous work as a savings and loan officer.

"We worked with B&C loans then, only we didn't call them that," he said.  "We
called them loans with delinquencies."

The secret to making such credits profitable comes from "evaluating your
borrowers' willingness and ability to pay over time, value of property, and
pricing - charging a higher interest rate, although our rates go as low as
8.5%," he said.

WA gets assisted living units


Seattle-Proceeds from an $8.3 million tax-exempt bond will finance the
construction of five assisted living facilities in Washington state to be
purchased by LTC Properties Inc., a real estate investment trust company that
provides financing to the health care industry.

The projects are being developed by Assisted Living Concepts, a for-profit
company that serves low- and moderate-income elderly in Washington, Oregon,
Texas and New Jersey.  The company will lease the completed facilities from
LTC Properties and manage and operate each of the projects.

The Washington State Housing Finance Commission (WSHFC) publicly sold the
bonds backed with a letter of credit by U.S.  Bank of Washington.  The bonds
were issued through the Commission's Housing for the Elderly Program, which
provides tax-exempt financing to develop the full range of living options for
the elderly.

The projects are in Grandview, Walla Walla, Kennewick, Vancouver and Camas.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $11.18 million, with $8.8 million
coming from the bond proceeds.

"Washington state has one of the fastest growing populations of senior
citizens in the nation," said Busse Nutley, WSHFC chair.  "Because our state
expects to more than double the number of elderly residents between now and
the year 2020, facilities such as this are vital."

Each of the five projects now under construction has 36 assisted living units,
with the exception of Lexington House in Vancouver, which will offer 44
assisted living units.  Occupancy for the projects is expected from December
1995 through March 1996.

"The tax-exempt financing allows Assisted Living Concepts to lower the cost of
living for the elderly," said Steve Gordon, chief administrative officer, ALC.
"Assisted living is more economical and less invasive than a nursing home and
it enables seniors to maintain their independence and privacy in a homelike
setting."

Fifteen percent (28) of the total new units will be dedicated to residents at
or below 50% of the median income of the county in which the project is
located.  Five percent (nine) of the total units will be dedicated to
residents at or below 35% of the median income.

An assisted living community bridges the gap for seniors between active
retirement communities and nursing homes.  An assisted living facility
provides elderly senior citizens with more independence than a traditional
nursing facility, while still providing necessary nursing care and support
services.

A $5.815 million tax-exempt bond issue for a 120-unit apartment building for
the elderly was also issued by the WSHFC.  Proceeds of the bonds will be used
to construct Pacific Crest Apartments in Everett.  The project is also
eligible to receive some $3.7 million in Federal low-income housing tax
credits allocated to the Commission.

"Good health starts with good living facilities," said Thomas Gray, executive
director of Bethany of the Northwest, one of the developers of the project.

"With adequate housing, elderly people can sustain themselves for a longer
period of time," he said.

The tax-exempt financing and low-income housing tax credits, he added, enables
Bethany to offer both housing and personal services to lower-income elderly
residents who want to live independently as long as possible.

The bonds were sold publicly, backed with a loan guarantee from Bethany.
Seafirst Bank provided a 30-year letter of credit.  The City of Everett and
Snohomish County helped Bethany fulfill its part of the financing agreement.

The bonds were issued through the WSHFC's housing for the elderly program.
Total cost of the project is estimated at $8.8 million, with nearly $6 million
coming from the bond proceeds.  The balance will be financed primarily through
low-income housing tax-credits.

The project includes 108 one-bedroom and 12 two-bedroom independent living
apartments for seniors.  The seven-story apartment building will offer
residents panoramic views of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges and is
conveniently located within walking distance of a senior center, public
library, post office and other services.

All units will be affordable to elderly (aged 55 or older) residents at or
below 60% of the Snohomish County median income.

Joint venture starting up for Edina, AmerUs


Edina, MN-An investor group which includes the management of Edina Realty here
has purchased the company as well as Equity Title Services and First Edina
Mortgage from First Bank Systems Inc., Minneapolis.

First Edina Mortgage immediately entered into a joint venture with AmerUs
Mortgage, Des Moines, IA.

Bradley D.  Childs, president of First Edina, and executive vice president of
the new holding company Edina Financial Services, said the mortgage company
brings relationships with Realtors, its sales team and staff to the joint
venture.

He explained that the mortgage operation is a restructuring of a going
concern, rather than a start-up operation.

These joint ventures are happening more and more frequently between Realtors
and mortgage lenders, added Fred Moore, president of The AmerUs Group, AmerUs
Mortgage's parent company.

In structuring this venture, the parties were careful to make sure it is in
compliance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, both men said.

AmerUs has similar ventures with Iowa Realty and Carol Jones Realty, both of
which it owns, and is a partner with Mel Foster Realty.

These ventures give AmerUs a substantial amount of volume, but Mr.  Moore did
not specify what percentage.

AmerUs will provide the joint venture with table funding capability, working
capital and technology.

First Edina will rent space at market rates at Edina Realty offices.

Mr.  Childs said the company will be a "focused Realtor service organization."

Technology was one of the keys to this joint venture.

AmerUs was the first mortgage originator to use the Federal Home Loan Mortgage
Corp.'s Loan Prospector system and the first to have it interface with the
Gallagher front-end origination management system.

Ron Peltier, chief executive and president of Edina Realty, said, "we talked
to a number of mortgage joint venture partners and AmerUs was the obvious
winner due to their commitment to state-of-the-art loan processing and
commitment to quick response to homebuyers."

Edina Financial Services is actively looking for other services and products
to provide to homeowners.

AmerUs decides what will happen with the servicing rights created by the joint
venture, Mr.  Childs said, and it will retain some but sell most in bulk, Mr.
Moore added.  It has approximately $1 billion in servicing.

Edina Realty was sold to Metropolitan Financial Corp., Fargo, ND, in 1988.
MFC subsequently was acquired by FBS.

The acquisition group is made up of Mr.  Peltier; Mr.  Childs, the president
of Institutional Capital Services Inc.  here; David E.  Wilbur Jr., the former
owner of PolyTech, Bloomington, MN; Phillip L.  Hendershott, chairman of
Altair Ventures Inc.  here; and Arne Rovick, senior vice president of Edina
Realty.

TAX LEGISLATION:  The Budget Bill Battle Puts Tax Planning On Hold


The tax provisions being considered run the gamut and will substantially
impact every one of your clients, if enacted.

The one thing I've learned from dealing with tax legislation for over 20 years
is that you never know the path it will take.  This year's budget bill proves
the point once again.  As we went to press, the budget bill (HR 2491) had been
vetoed by President Clinton.  There are talks going on between Congress and
the White House aimed at reaching a compromise budget bill acceptable by all
sides.

Without a crystal ball, it is impossible to predict what will happen-if
anything.  However, to alert you to the possibilities, here is a summary of
the major proposed tax changes that were contained in the vetoed budget bill.

Family tax relief.  The budget bill contains a nonrefundable tax credit of
$500 that would be allowed to a taxpayer for each qualifying child under 18.
The credit (subject to a phaseout) would be effective Oct.  1, 1995.  There
would also be a nonrefundable tax credit of up to $5,000 in qualified adoption
expenses.  An above-the-line deduction would also be provided for interest on
qualified education loans and expenses for the custodial care of certain
elderly family members.

To combat the marriage penalty for couples filing joint returns, the ratio of
the standard deduction for joint returns relative to single returns would be
increased annually from 1.68 in 1996 to 2.00 in 2005.

Retirement provisions.  The budget bill also provides that an individual would
no longer be considered an active participant in an employer-sponsored
retirement plan merely because his or her spouse is an active participant.
The $2,000 IRA contribution limit would be indexed for inflation (for taxable
years beginning after 1996) and the phaseout income limits would be increased.

Also, the budget bill would create an "American Dream IRA" with no income
phaseouts for contributions.  Withdrawals would not be includable in gross
income if the withdrawal is made after at least five years and the withdrawal
is for a special purpose (i.e., first-time homebuyer (up to $10,000); higher
education; catastrophic medical expenses and distributions to unemployed
individuals), or made after the individual reaches age 59 1/2 or becomes
disabled.

A new simplified retirement plan would be available for small businesses-the
savings incentive match plan for employees (SIMPLE) retirement plan.  SIMPLE
plans would mean an end to new simplified employee pension plans after Dec.
31, 1995.  There are also provisions aimed at tax simplification of the
pension rules.

Capital gains.  Practitioners will recognize the individual's capital gains
change-a return to a capital gains deduction.  Under the budget bill,
individuals would be allowed a deduction of 50% of net capital gain.  The
maximum 28% rate would no longer apply.  For a taxpayer with a marginal rate
of 39.6, the effective rate would be 19.8%.  Special rules would apply for
collectibles.  The budget bill provides that two dollars of long-term loss
would offset only one dollar of ordinary income.  The changes would generally
apply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994; however, the capital loss
rules would apply to losses arising in taxable years beginning after Dec.  31,
1995.

Indexing of capital gains is coming under the budget bill as it would allow
taxpayers, other than a C corporation, to index the basis of certain assets
for determining gain on the disposition of any property for the holding period
which begins after Dec.  31, 2000.  There is a provision that would allow
other assets to be treated as being required on Jan.  1, 2001 (with gain
recognized).  Another provision helping individuals is a modification and
liberalization of the existing 50% exclusion for the sale of certain small
business stock (would be subject to maximum rate rather than an exclusion).

A particularly helpful provision would allow individuals to deduct the loss on
the sale or exchange of a principal residence after Dec.  31, 1994.  Also,
gain could be rolled over more than once within a two-year period and a safe
harbor is added in the case of rollovers in the case of divorce or separation
for purposes of Section 1034.  The budget bill would also liberalize the
Section 121 exclusion rules.

Corporations.  The budget bill would add an alternative rate of 28% on the net
capital gain of a corporation if that rate is less than the corporation's
regular tax rate.  It also would add a special alternative rate of 21% on the
gain from the sale or exchange of qualified small business stock.  Both
changes would generally apply to taxable years ending after Dec.  31, 1994.

Alternative minimum tax.  The depreciation adjustment for purposes of
computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations would
be repealed effective for property placed in service after Dec.  31, 1995.
Also, corporations will be able to use the AMT credit to offset a portion of
the corporation's minimum tax in excess of its regular tax in limited
circumstances.

Cost recovery.  The maximum amount that may be expensed would increase from
$17,500 to 19,000 for taxable years beginning in 1996 and $1,000 annually
through 2002 (to $25,000 for taxable years beginning in 2002 and thereafter).
The budget bill would clarify that a lessor can adjust the basis of certain
improvements upon termination of the lease.

Partnerships.  A simplified flow-through method for computing the taxes of
partners of electing large partnerships would be available.  The budget bill
also provides that the taxable year of a partnership would close for a partner
whose entire interest in a partnership terminates, whether by death,
liquidation or otherwise.

S corporations.  Generally effective for taxable years beginning after Dec.
31, 1995, a number of changes would be made that directly benefit those
choosing S corporations as way of doing business.  Among the many changes
would be an increase in the maximum number of shareholders to 75.

Health-related provisions.  The budget bill would make significant changes to
the tax treatment of long-term care expenses and insurance.  Also, to help
alleviate the high costs of medical expenses, the budget bill also would
introduce a tax-advantaged Medical Savings Account.  And the deduction for
health insurance expenses for the self-employed would increase gradually to
50% for taxable years beginning in 2002.

Estate and gift taxes.  The budget bill would increase the estate and gift tax
unified credit by an exemption equivalent amount of $25,000 annually from 1996
through 2001 to a maximum equivalent of $750,000.  It also would index for
inflation after the year 2000, the unified credit, annual gift tax exclusion,
the $750,000 reduction limit on special use valuation property, the $1 million
generation-skipping transfer tax exemption and the $1 million ceiling on the
value of a closely held business eligible for the special 4% interest rate
under Section 6166.  There also would be a new estate tax exclusion for
qualified family owned business interests for estates of decedents dying after
Dec.  31, 1995.  There are a number of other estate and gift taxes changes.

Extension of expiring provisions.  As with most major tax legislation, there
are a number of tax provisions that are given added or limited life or are
even reinstated.  They include:  (1) a work opportunity tax credit (similar to
the prior law targeted job credit), (2) an income exclusion for
employer-provided education assistance, (3) a research and experimentation
credit, (4) the special rule for contributions of qualified appreciated stock
to private foundations, and (5) the sunsetting of the low-income housing
credit.

Tax-exempt organizations.  The budget bill would add for intermediate
sanctions that the IRS may invoke against certain tax-exempt organizations.

Miscellaneous provisions.  There are a number of miscellaneous provisions
aimed at tax reform.  Some of the provisions would:

* Generally repeal the Section 936 credit for taxable years beginning after
Dec.  31, 1995.

* Clarify the exclusion for damages received on account of personal injury or
sickness.

* Provide that there will be no rollover (Section 1034) or exclusion of gain
(Section 121) for depreciation deductions attributable to principal
residences.

* Generally deny Section 1034 rollover treatment to non-U.S.  citizens for
non-U.S.  principal residences.

* Substantially modify the rules for foreign trust tax compliance and
treatment as well as the income estate and gift tax treatment of individuals
that lose U.S.  citizenship.

The budget bill, effective for contracts completed in taxable years ending
after the date of enactment, also would modify the look-back method for
long-term contracts.  It also would extend the luxury excise tax on
automobiles through Dec 31, 2002, correct the inflation adjustment and
decrease the rate of tax by 1% per year beginning after 1996.  The budget bill
also would increase the tax return preparer penalties, add a new set of
taxpayer bill of rights provisions and reform the earned income credit.

Jury Still Out

The only certainties are death and taxes.  But will there be a new tax law?
If there is one, what will it contain?  The answers to both questions must
wait for the smoke to clear from the budget battle that still rages on in the
nation's capital as we go to press.

Practitioner's Update


Can Your Work Papers Come Back and Haunt You?

Work papers, traditionally the dry stuff of an accountant's audit work, have
become a target for clients out to grab any evidence they can to back a
malpractice claim against their accountant.

Accounting firms, therefore, are closely reviewing work papers and often
making changes to more clearly show they followed the proper procedures in the
audit.  In most cases, work papers are altered routinely and without incident.
Accounting firms usually follow their own internal policies for recording,
signing and dating any changes.  There are no official guidelines on
maintaining work papers.

"There are no auditing standards that prescribe a methodology and maintenance
of work papers, only the fact that they need to exist," said Edmund (Randy)
Noonan, chairman of the AICPA's Auditing Standards Board and a partner with
KPMG Peat Marwick.

Slipping from firm policy

But when firms slip away from their own policies, they can find themselves in
a bind trying to explain why papers were altered in a way that might appear to
mitigate a charge of malpractice.  That's what happened to Coopers & Lybrand
in a recent case brought by Mitsubishi Motors Corp.  of Japan, which is
accusing C&L of altering the work papers for the 1989 audit of Value
Rent-A-Car Inc., which Mitsubishi acquired in 1990.

As reported in the lead story of the Nov.  2 Wall Street Journal, Mitsubishi
said it learned after the acquisition that Value had a $10 million negative
net worth, which was $4 million further into red ink than indicated in the
1989 financial statement audited by C&L.  It contended that C&L erased words
and figures and inserted new information in its work papers in an attempt to
protect itself from charges of negligence.  Mitsubishi said the changes, which
were not dated or signed, included a note saying that C&L had received
assurances from Value that certain liabilities didn't exist, such as
distributed customer coupons Mitsubishi now claims are worth $4 million.

Mitsubishi, which obtained C&L's final work papers as part of the discovery
process in its lawsuit against the accounting firm, had the unusual
opportunity to compare them with the original work papers, which had been
photocopied by the accounting firm it hired to replace C&L shortly after it
had acquired Value.  But C&L insists that the changes to the audit work papers
were "totally immaterial" to a bad investment decision by Mitsubishi, which
C&L claims ignored the numbers in the financial statements that showed a 1989
loss of $14 million as well as a negative worth of $6 million.  "Changes to
the work papers were made to reflect decisions made later in the audit
process, which was reflected in the financial statements," said Patrick J.
McDonnell, vice chairman of C&L's business assurances practice.

Still, the fact that C&L's auditors made the changes without following firm
policy fuels the skepticism over its intentions.  Indeed, McDonnell admitted
that any deviation from work paper policy was rare.  "Our policy is to leave a
trail," he said.  "Erasing is not something we normally would do, and it's
rare when work papers are not dated or signed."

Precautions

To help prevent future incidents, C&L is rolling out a new Notes-based
paperless audit system.  Called "CLASS," for C&L Automated Support System, it
enables auditors to prepare all work papers in a Windows-based computer
notebook.  The system, which is expected to be in use for all C&L clients by
the end of next year, is designed to make it easier for auditors to follow the
firm's policy for preparing and changing work papers.  The dating of changes,
for example, will be done automatically.

Such precautions, whether automatic or otherwise, will likely become more
common in all firms.  The controls firms use in preparing or altering work
papers should be made with the assumption that the work papers might later be
examined for proof of malpractice.-Paul Demery


Illinois Restricts Punitive Damages Award

Plaintiffs seeking financial recourse from accountants under Illinois law will
have a tougher time proving their case.  Under a new state law that restricts
punitive damages awarded against accountants, plaintiffs are saddled with a
stiff requirement to prove that their accountant acted far outside of standard
ethical procedures.

Tougher standards

"Perhaps the most important part of the new law is the standard set to justify
an award of punitive damages," Tom Wetzler, director of Government Relations
for the Illinois CPA Society, said in a recent Society newsletter.  "The
statute requires a plaintiff to prove the CPA acted with evil motive or
reckless and outrageous indifference to a highly unreasonable risk of harm,
and with a conscious indifference to the rights and safety of others."

Wetzler added that by requiring plaintiffs to prove the justification for
punitive damages with clear and convincing evidence, the law, which became
effective last year, demands a greater degree of proof than the ordinary
preponderance of evidence required in most civil lawsuits.

Other elements of the new law limit punitive damages to three times the value
of economic economic damages and allow punitive damages to be awarded only in
cases where compensatory damages are awarded.

Proportionate liability

Illinois also passed and made effective last year a law that abolished the
principle of joint and several liability and replaced it with proportionate
liability, under which accountants cannot be held liable for wrongful acts
committed by other partners of their firm.  -P.D.


Expect More State Tax Audits

Businesses may have a growing need to call on their accountants:  to minimize
the onslaught of efforts to collect state taxes.

Rather than impose politically unpopular tax increases to balance their
budgets, state revenue departments are increasing their numbers of auditors,
according to a survey of states by the Atlanta-based State Taxation Institute.
The survey found that individual state auditors assess on average more than $1
million each year.

Targeting out-of-state businesses

"Companies doing business in multiple states are particularly vulnerable
because auditors specializing in out-of-state companies post higher
assessments than their counterparts based in the home office," the Institute
said.  It noted that businesses based out-of-state are likely audit targets
because they have less political clout, are less familiar with rules on how to
comply with state tax laws and because many businesses don't realize they
should file returns under a state's nexus law.

The Institute also noted that some states have unusually large staffs of
auditors, such as mostly rural Alabama, whose 342-auditor department is the
nation's sixth largest.  Other states are extremely aggressive in out-of-state
operations.  The Institute said Florida, for example, keeps more auditors in
Atlanta (43) than the total number of auditors employed by Rhode Island (40).

CPA Exam to Become Non-Disclosed Because of Computerization

As of May of this year, question booklets and answers to the Uniform CPA Exam
will no longer be available after the exam is given.  The change, breaking a
tradition followed since the exam's inception in 1917, is one of the first
major steps toward a planned computerization of the exam by 2000.

The computer-based exam will enable CPA candidates to take the exam at any
time at hundreds of testing sites and provide for faster processing of test
results.  According to the AICPA and the National Association of State Boards
of Accountancy, which co-administer the exam, computerization will also make
it possible to create more complex questions, though essays will likely be
left out.

To prepare a large enough bank of questions to be used in computer-based
tests, which could be differentiated for each candidate, exams given as of May
will include questions that will not be included in the test taker's score but
stored for later use.  This will also enable the AICPA to judge the difficulty
of the questions before using them in exams.  The future use of these test
questions necessitates the non-disclosure of the exam materials.

In addition, non-disclosure will enable the AICPA to re-use questions
statistically proved to be a good measure of candidates' knowledge and skills.
And it is expected to increase grading fairness by providing for statistical
comparisons between different exams.

The AICPA said it will continue, however, to issue to candidates exam
preparation materials, including the unofficial answers to questions that will
no longer be used in exams.  -P.D.


CCH Acquired by Dutch Publisher

With three years of costly rebuilding finally behind it, legal and tax
publisher CCH Inc.  was expecting to begin showing some hefty profits in the
third and fourth quarters of this year.  "We'll see some dramatic earnings
growth in the last quarter," said spokeswoman Mary Dale Walters.

The projection of dramatic earnings growth is pale by comparison to Riverwood,
Ill.-based CCH's announcement that it had agreed to be taken over by Dutch
publishing giant Wolters Kluwer NV for $1.9 billion - more than three times
CCH's expected 1990 revenue of $600 million.  Wolters' offer of $55.50 per
share caused CCH's Class A shares of stock to nearly double in value to
$54.62.

The two companies said the acquisition would not cause any major changes in
CCH's operating philosophy or management structure, which will continue to be
headed by CEO Oakleigh Thorne.  The Thorne family, which owns 57% of CCH, has
indicated it will tender its shares to Amsterdam-based Wolters, a major
business-to-business publisher of legal, tax, medical and scientific
information with operations throughout the U.S.  and Europe.

Positioned for growth

CCH said it will be in an even better position to continue investing in new
technologies, building on its successful efforts in recent years to develop
CD-ROM-based research materials and its ProSystem fx tax software.  Indeed,
CCH said its technology was a big factor in making it attractive to Wolters,
which is just beginning to develop electronic publishing products in Europe.
Wolters also expects CCH to boost its efforts to expand its U.S.  operations.

One area the two companies expect to further explore is how they will deliver
products, particularly electronic ones.  CCH has already taken its initial
steps along this course by working with AT&T and MSN, the new on-line network
of the Microsoft Corp.  Traditionally, CCH has distributed its products using
its own Access technology platform.  Now, it is interested in seeing how it
can meet customer needs by catering to their preferred distribution channels.

"Wolters Kluwer shares [our] philosophy," said Thorne, adding that CCH's new
parent is "committed to expanding technology leadership and dedicated to
delivering products via the most desired proprietary and non-proprietary
media."  CCH's product line includes The Standard Federal Tax Reporter, The
U.S.  Master Tax Guide, CCH Federal Tax Guide, and various guides on human
resources and health care.-P.D.


Course Work Waiver for ACAT Tax Credentials

The Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT) is waiving the
required course work until July 31, 1996, for receiving the credentials of
Accredited Tax Advisor and Accredited Tax Preparer.

The waiver is being offered to CPAs, licensed accountants, enrolled agents,
holders of Master of Taxation or Master of Laws in Taxation degrees, attorneys
with specialist credentials in taxation, and Accredited Tax Advisors who wish
to also become an Accredited Tax Preparer.

Applicants seeking to become an Accredited Tax Advisor must have five years of
experience in tax planning and consulting; Accredited Tax Preparer credentials
require one year of experience in tax preparation and compliance.  All
applicants must have taken 48 hours of continuing professional education in
the past two years.  For a Waiver Interest Form, call (703) 549-2228.  -P.D.


California Passes LLP Law

California has joined the ranks of states with laws allowing accountants to
establish their firms as limited liability partnerships.

The California law, which created a new form of legal entity for the state
called a registered limited liability partnership, passed both houses of the
state legislature with few negative votes, largely due to strong support from
the state's accounting and legal professions.  The law also covers attorneys.
It became effective immediately when signed by Governor Pete Wilson in
October.

Like other states' LLP laws, California's offers LLP partners limited
liability protection while continuing the tax advantages granted to
partnerships.  It limits the professional liability of individual partners to
their own actions, protecting them from any tort or malpractice liability of
other partners.

Gale Case, president of the California Society of CPAs, said he expects many
small as well as large accounting firms to form as LLPs, since small firms
usually can't afford as much insurance.  He added that small firms that do
form as LLPs will probably begin to re-enter practice areas such as auditing
that they had considered too risky due to exposure to liability.

The law stipulates that partners of an accounting firm LLP must be either a
CPA, a public accountant or an accountancy corporation.  It precludes enrolled
agents because they are not licensed by the state.

Minimum insurance requirement.  To form as an LLP, an accounting practice must
satisfy one of three insurance requirements:  malpractice insurance coverage
not less than $100,000 per licensed person, whether or not the person is a
partner; at least $100,000 in trust or escrow cash, bank certificates of
deposit, U.S.  Treasury obligations, bank letters of credit or insurance
bonds; or a net worth of at least $10 million confirmed annually in a filing
with the California Secretary of State.  -P.D.


New Privity Law In New Jersey

Among the many bills on tort reform making their way through the halls of
legislative bodies, those up against the toughest obstacles usually include
measures on privity, which set the bounds in which accountants or other
targets can be sued by third parties.  Third parties, such as investor groups,
are often the biggest source of claims against accountants resulting from the
actions of the accountants' clients.

But privity laws have been making some headway.  Although bills in such states
as Texas, which has passed other tort reform measures, were derailed by the
aggressive lobbying of trial attorneys, efforts in New Jersey have been
successful in establishing strict privity standards.

In New Jersey, the privity statute enacted and made effective in 1995 states
that accountants can be liable for negligence to only two classes of potential
plaintiffs:  clients and non-clients who meet certain criteria.  The criteria
for non-clients requires the following situations:

* They must have been "specifically identified to the accountant in connection
with a specified transaction," and the accountant must have agreed that the
accountant's report would be provided to the non-client;

* The accountant must have known that the non-client "intended to rely upon
the professional accounting service in connection with that specified
transaction";

* The accountant must have "directly expressed" to the non-client, by words or
conduct, an understanding of the non-client's intended reliance.  -P.D.


Insurance For The Accountant

The Singer Insurance Group began in 1958 and more than 90% of its business
comes from CPAs who refer their clients to them.  They set up a Complete
Accountants Program whereby they give seminars to accounting firms on what
they should know about insurance for their clients.  They also do CPE seminars
where they discuss the respective roles and responsibilities of CPAs and
insurance agents.  According to David Singer, vice president of the firm, CPAs
are in a rather awkward position today.  Although they have professional
liability coverage which covers errors and omissions and although as
accountants they should be involved in the insurance process, he feels that
they should not, however, be involved as insurance experts.  Singer believes
the accountant's primary role is to be a catalyst and to bring up ideas to
think about and then they should shift the E&O exposure to the insurance
agent.

By the same token, Singer warned that accountants have to consider their own
involvement with business interruption insurance.  He pointed out that if an
accounting firm has a fire, there is a reasonably good chance that they
wouldn't need such coverage because their business isn't really being
interrupted.  Instead, they would incur additional expenses to get back into
business right away.  That's known as extra expense insurance.

Depreciation:  Courts Turn Thumbs Down On Irs's "Collectible" Stance


It's hard to believe.  Fourteen years after Congress adopted the ACRS and then
MACRS statutory cost recovery systems, the IRS is still fighting taxpayers in
court over what can and cannot be depreciated.  In three recent cases, the IRS
has been told, enough is enough.

The victorious included two professional musicians who used valuable, antique
instruments in their work.  These cases, decided under pre-'87 law, received
much attention in the media, presumably because of the inherent human interest
factor.  But an even more recent Tax Court case, involving "exotic" cars, has
apparently expanded the result of the musician cases by making it applicable
under current law.  These cases, taken together, clarify the basic law of
depreciation and seem to show that it is still evolving.  These cases may also
justify practitioners reconsidering their understanding of this area to be
sure they are not overlooking potential deductions-either for themselves or
for clients.

Musicians Redux

Brian Liddle, a professional musician, purchased a 17th century Ruggeri bass
violin (or viol) in 1984 for $28,000.  He insured it for its then-appraised
value of $38,000.  He used it to practice at home, at rehearsals and for
performances.  The bass suffered physical deterioration from this use and
eventually lost its value for performance purposes.

On his 1987 tax return, Liddle claimed a deduction for $3,170 under Section
168's accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) then in effect.  The IRS
disallowed the deduction initially claiming that the viol would appreciate in
value.  Later abandoning that theory (see cases such as Noyce1), the IRS
argued before the Third Circuit that Liddle could claim the ACRS deduction
only if he could first establish that the viol had a determinable useful
life.2 The IRS said this could not be done in light of the fact that the viol
was over 300 years old and still appreciating in value.

It also argued that the viol, as a work of art, did not have a determinable
useful life.  Generally, works of art that hang on a wall or works that are
considered to be museum pieces are not depreciable because the Service has
ruled that such items do not have a determinable useful life.3

The Court reviewed the basics of depreciation both before and after 1981.
Before 1981, Section 167 governed the allowance of depreciation and required
that the property have a determinable useful life.  See Regs.  1.167(a)-1(a)
and (b).  This life was related to the asset's usefulness to the taxpayer's
trade or business and could reflect economic as well as possibly physical
considerations.  In 1981, the Economic Recovery Tax Act (ERTA) replaced this
approach with ACRS as part of a plan to stimulate the economy.  ACRS allowed a
deduction for "recovery property" under Section 168.  Recovery property was
tangible property "of a character subject to the allowance for
depreciation"-used in a trade or business or held for the production of
income.  Recovery property was assigned five categories for determining the
actual amount of the deduction.

The IRS argued that ACRS, then in effect, did not eliminate the pre-'81
requirement that tangible personal property used in a trade or business must
also have a determinable useful life to qualify as property of a character
subject to the allowance for depreciation.

The Third Circuit disagreed with the Service and held that only the following
two pre-'81 requirements had to be met:  (1) the asset must be subject to wear
and tear or obsolescence and (2) the asset is used in a trade or business or
held for the production of income.

The Court allowed Liddle the depreciation deduction because the viol was used
in his trade and did suffer wear and tear in that use.  The Court also
rejected IRS's attempt to classify the viol as a nondepreciable work of art
because in Liddle's hands, the "bass viol was a tool of his trade."

Richard Simon and his wife, professional violinists, purchased two 19th
century Tourte bows which they used in their work.  The bows suffered wear and
tear as a result of such use.  Although purchased in 1985, the tax year in
controversy was 1989 when the Simons claimed ACRS deductions of almost
$11,000.  The same issues were raised here as in Liddle and the Second Circuit
also disagreed with the IRS, holding that IRS's argument (i.e., having to
first show a determinable useful life) contradicted Congress's intent when it
enacted ERTA.4

The Court distinguished Browning5, a case involving a musician who sought to
depreciate three antique violins, in which the Ninth Circuit upheld a denial
of depreciation.  In Browning, the Ninth Circuit held that the musician failed
to establish a useful life for the violins but Browning was a pre-ERTA case
and there was no evidence indicating that he used the instruments in his
professional work.

Both Liddle and Simon were decided under the ACRS system that applied to
property placed in service between Jan.  1, 1981 and Jan.  1, 1987.  After
1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 replaced ACRS with a modified ACRS system
called MACRS which eliminated the concept of recovery property.

Exotic Cars

Bruce Selig purchased in 1987 and 1988 "exotic" automobiles to exhibit at car
shows for a fee.  Exotic cars are state-of-the-art, high technology vehicles
with unique design features or equipment.

The cars were not set up for use on the street; they were not driven and were
used exclusively for shows or promotional photography.  Between 1987 and 1990,
Selig claimed various deductions for depreciation on the cars.  The IRS
challenged whether cars maintained in pristine condition and shown for a fee
could be depreciated.  The Tax Court held for Selig because the cars were
subject to obsolescence (due to the unique high-tech features), and the fact
that he failed to show the useful lives of the cars was irrelevant.6

The Court reviewed the history of depreciation in the tax law and the Liddle
and Simon cases which had been decided under prior law.  The Court concluded
that in enacting the current version of Section 168, applicable to property
placed in service after 1986, Congress did not intend to reimpose the pre-ERTA
requirement that a taxpayer must show a determinable useful life of the
property.  The Court said it is following Liddle and Simon in interpreting
Section 168 as restated.

Richard J.  Sapinski, partner in Sills Cummis Zuckerman Radin Tischman Epstein
& Gross in Newark, NJ, was Bruce Selig's attorney.  He agreed that Selig seems
to be carrying forward the result of the musician cases (Liddle and Simon)
under the post-'86 law.  In fact, Sapinski was surprised that the Selig
decision was a Tax Court Memo decision rather than a reported decision.  I
expected that the results of Liddle and Simon would apply under MACRS, said
David L.  Segal, sole practitioner in Philadelphia and the attorney who
represented Brian Liddle, the bass violinist.

The Selig Court listened to testimony indicating that new and improved
features for the cars would come along within a few years and held that the
cars had a limited useful life as show cars because of obsolescence.  It noted
that a precise useful life did not have to be determined to establish that the
cars were depreciable.  It also said that the cars were not museum pieces of
indeterminable useful life.  In doing so, it distinguished Harrah's Club7, in
which the Court of Claims did not allow a depreciation deduction for the cost
of restoring antique automobiles to a casino that maintained a car museum to
attract business.

The Selig Tax Court clearly stated that the fact that the show cars might
become museum pieces did not matter since it was satisfied that the exotic
cars were show pieces and not museum pieces.  Sapinski explained that it was
irrelevant whether the exotic cars might become museum pieces or appreciate in
value.  "Our argument was that is irrelevant; that it's the asset's usefulness
in the taxpayer's trade or business [that is relevant]," said Sapinski.

Sapinski also doesn't believe IRS will appeal Selig because it is appealable
to the Third Circuit which already decided Liddle.  But he added that he
thinks the IRS will still argue the basic issue.  "I would think this is a
case-specific thing and I think they'll keep that option open.  If I were on
their side, I would be looking for a lawyer with Louis 14th furniture to make
an egregious case," said Sapinski.  Dr.  William Raby, CPA and editor of The
Raby Report, said, "I'm sure it's going to be appealed."  He thinks Selig
might be vulnerable as to applying Liddle and Simon to post-'86 law.

Implications and Irksome Questions

Selig should focus a new light on certain valuable assets that may be
nondepreciable collectibles or works of art in some circumstances but
depreciable business assets in other circumstances.  Some commentators believe
that assets such as these may now be depreciable if they are used in a
business in a manner that results in physical wear or tear or economic
obsolescence.  Passive use in a business such as hanging on a wall may not be
enough.  But what about assets such as antique furniture or carpeting that are
part of an office?

In 1996, can practitioners say they understand depreciation?  These cases
raise fundamental questions:  Is useful life necessary to depreciate an asset?
If an asset is depreciable, is it always clear how to calculate the amount of
the deduction?  "I think a lot of people were surprised that after 14 years,
there was still a fundamental concept that hadn't been resolved," said Ada
Rousso, senior manager at Price Waterhouse in Washington, DC.

Segal said, "Let me tell you what's at stake here, the depreciation deduction
has nothing to do with accounting...It is the primary tool for encouraging or
slowing down capital formation.  The IRS thought there's lots more law to it
than in fact it turned out to be."

Sapinski said the decision might mean depreciation has been overlooked for
certain assets such as classic furniture used in a trade or business.  He
pointed out that "Judge Halpern who decided this [Selig] case was a dissenting
judge in the Liddle and Simon cases.  He felt this would open the door to
depreciation of Louis 14th furniture in a lawyer's office or other property
that would otherwise not be depreciable because they are collector's items."

Raby said, "I guess you'd have to ask yourself what it is people have that
they are not now depreciating [which could be items being overlooked for
depreciation]."

Sapinski added that practitioners should evaluate whether the assets they have
are properly classified and perhaps take a second look at what they may have
considered nondepreciable in light of these cases.  Segal said, "if people are
genuinely using their products in business in a way that subjects them to
obsolescence, or wear and tear, then they should get a deduction because
Congress wanted them to employ that equipment."

Investment implications.  Segal, who is also president of the Philadelphia
Youth Orchestra, suggested that the musician cases might provide an
opportunity to refinance America's symphonies by placing musical instruments
into leasing partnerships.  Segal explained that orchestras have millions of
dollars' worth of great instruments which could be turned into cash for needy
orchestras through a sales-leaseback.  An investor can buy the instruments for
full value and then lease them back to the orchestra for say a 1% per year
rental stream.  The investor can get seven years' of depreciation out it.  The
orchestra takes the purchase money and can invest part of it in an annuity and
use the rest for operating expenses.  The orchestra has no use for the
depreciation so it can pass it to investors; Liddle says as long as a
professional musician is using it, the instrument is depreciable.

How Much to Deduct?

Under the current MACRS rules, among other provisions, depreciable assets
other than buildings can fall into one of six categories, i.e., three, five,
seven, 10, 15 or 20-year class life.  The rate of depreciation depends on the
method, recovery period and whether the half-year or mid-quarter convention
applies.  Tables are available to simplify the actual computation.  Congress
intended to "deemphasize" the application of useful life and salvage value
when it reformed depreciation in 1981.

While the decisions discussed in this article did not directly deal with
computing a specific useful life, the Selig case raises a potential
difficulty.  In Selig, the Tax Court held that the cars were depreciable
because they were subject to obsolescence.  Sapinski said, "We didn't have to
prove an exact period for useful life.  The accountant used the rates for
cars, five years."  In Selig, the Court said, citing Columbia Malting Co.8 and
Reg.  1.167(a)-9, that a taxpayer could recover the cost of business property
over a period shorter than the ordinary useful life of the property if the
taxpayer could show that the assets would become obsolete in the business
prior to the end of such ordinary useful life.  Selig had testified that
within three or four years, the cars' state-of-the-art technology could
change.  An associate of Selig testified that the cars had a life of one or
two years before something better came along.  Yet Selig's accountant used
five years, the normal MACRS category for a car.

Sapinski said, "It is my feeling that it would not be right [to write off the
cars over a shorter period] because I think the whole premise is that you
don't have to get into these determinations because Congress has already
chosen your slot."

Raby said the issue is whether these assets (collectibles) are eligible for
depreciation under Section 168.  "That's a yes or no question.  Once you've
decided the answer is yes, then the question is into what category do they
fall which then determines the useful life," said Raby.  He said MACRS
eliminates arguments about useful life.

One commentator, however, went so far as to say that in citing the Columbia
Malting decision, Selig suggests that a taxpayer in a situation that is
similar to Selig should be prepared to show the period over which property
similar to the property in question has become obsolete.  This approach,
however, seems inconsistent with the flow of logic indicated above.

Ultimate Lesson

"The main thing that you need to learn from [these cases] is that it pays to
challenge what are more or less 'received truths,'" said Raby.  He noted that
people had accepted that collectibles, whether they were antique cars, violins
or french desks, were not depreciable.  "I wonder how often, how many times in
our daily work things come to us and we know you can't do something, and so we
never try doing it.  So, maybe practitioners have to stand back occasionally
and say 'why can't we do it?'," added Raby.

BUSINESS CONSULTING:  Protecting Business Clients With The Right Insurance


Woody Allen, in his classic film, "Take The Money And Run," put his lead
character in a prison's solitary confinement cell, which consisted of his
descent into a hole in the earth and then being locked in under a metal
grating.  Allen didn't think that was enough.  He had an insurance agent
accompany the prisoner.

Granted that didn't seem to play well with the insurance crowd but it strikes
a rather interesting chord today primarily because many accountants are taking
a proactive role as business consultants to their clients.  As a result,
accountants are paying increased attention to the insurance carried by their
business clients.

Why is this so?  Why is the accountant doing so much of the work and not the
insurance broker or company?  And what's actually happening?

Getting Involved

Businesses today want their accountants to get involved because to them most
insurance brokers and companies appear to be glorified salesmen, only trying
to sell them more and more insurance.

Alvin Goldberg, a furrier in New York City, pointed out that "most brokers
don't tell you that you're overinsured.  If anything, they tell you that you
may be underinsured."

So, what is going on today is that business clients are seeking out their
accountants to ride herd on exactly what insurance they need and what they
don't need.

Add to this the fact that many businesses have little appreciation for the
casualty and liability risks to which their companies are exposed.

Peter Berlant, partner in Anchin, Block & Anchin, an accounting firm based in
New York City, said that accountants today are more intimately involved with
the client's business than the broker, the insurance company or any other
adviser.  Why?  "Because we as accountants can very often identify risks that
other advisers can't.  For example, I have a client who is extremely dependent
on a particular supplier.  We have advised them to obtain contingent business
interruption insurance covering that supplier.  If the supplier has a problem
such as something going wrong in the warehouse and can't deliver, then our
client is protected against claims from his own customers."

Berlant also believes that typically the insurance broker may not ask the
questions to get a real understanding of what the business is all about.
That's where he feels the accountant can come into this.  "We don't replace
the broker but we are a resource for our clients in understanding the
business."

Berlant illustrated this by recounting the case of a client, a wholesale
glassware importer who questioned the extent of her liability coverage.  "We
felt that she had to have product liability insurance.  It's not an expensive
policy but all she needed was for one glass to go from the factory to the
customer with a chipped rim and all of a sudden even though she may not be
liable, she's going to get sued."

Berlant said that the accountant can also reduce costs by a simple review of
the policy and the client's business operation.  For example, he noted that in
the workers' compensation area, the client many times overspends for insurance
because of the classification of workers.  "It is vitally important that the
worker is classified properly because that classification impacts considerably
on the ratings and charges."

He pointed out that the accountant also has to know how the policy is written.
"The policy is subject to audit.  The auditors that the insurance companies
send in may not fully understand how the client's bookkeeping or business
works.  For example, in most policies, the risks in workers' comp depends on
the number of hours the particular employee worked at a certain function.  It
is not supposed to be based upon wages; yet the premiums many times are based
on wages.  Most policies also exclude bonuses and overtime payments from the
wage base in determining premiums.  Often, insurance auditors overlook these
things and take the gross payroll figure instead.  Those numbers, when
translated into premiums, can be rather significant."

Nature of the Review

Victor S.  Rich, senior partner in New York-based Edward Isaacs & Company,
CPAs and financial consultants, said that the job is to make sure the areas
are covered and that the insurance is adequate.  "How often we do it depends
on how large the client is and how large an internal staff the client has.
And, of course, what they are paying us to do or not to do."

Rich explained that too often accountants jump into reviews before they know
what they are being asked to do.  "Are we doing an audit, a compilation, or
what?"  he said.  "What's the nature of our engagement?"

He added, "If our engagement is simply a compilation, we should not be looking
at insurance because we may be liable for not picking up something.  We look
at it when the client specifically asks the question."  He cautioned that by
doing the reverse, an accountant is extending the engagement beyond what was
anticipated when the engagement letter was signed.  "Are we compiling figures?
Are we involved in a certification?  The levels of responsibility increase
depending on the nature of the engagement."

How often then should these reviews be conducted?

"Every time we go to a client," said Berlant.  "No matter how often or on what
basis, insurance is part of our program.  Sometimes we will simply look to see
that they are maintaining coverage but typically once a year we go through the
coverages with the chief financial officer or the other principals of the
company, looking not only for amounts of coverage but for the types of
coverage."

Theodore S.  Levy, partner and vice president in the accounting firm of
Kamenitz Uhlfelder in Baltimore noted that his firm reviews the insurance
needs of their clients when they do their year-end financial statements.
"It's part of our procedure to look at their insurance coverage.  We
scrutinize all the policies and we see if the coverage they have makes sense.
This includes their limits of liability and how much inventory they are
insuring.  Sometimes, the clients say, same as last year.  We don't accept
that because the client many times doesn't even look at their own inventory
levels."

Kamenitz Uhlfelder orchestrates an administrative retreat which is a
comprehensive, full-day planning session with the client's key personnel and
advisers.  Levy said, "we bring in their insurance people and we request that
they give us a complete analysis of all the client's coverage."

David Marcus, partner in the accounting firm of Paneth, Huber & Zimmerman in
New York City, said that his firm works closely with their clients' insurance
brokers and insurance companies.  "In effect, we act as the overseer in that
regard so that we are able to evaluate properly each proposal and compare one
against another."

Marcus noted that his firm volunteers insurance reviews at least on a two-year
basis, depending on the client.  He said that the reason for the two-year
spread is because of the proliferation today of multi-year (usually three)
insurance policies.

Marcus said that normally, unless something out of the ordinary happens such
as a major purchase, a change in the business, the addition of new principals
or something dramatic like an increase in premiums, they don't necessarily go
into a big review every year.

Erwin Petschauer, principal in the brokerage firm of John Petschauer, Inc.  in
Ridgewood, N.Y., corroborated what Marcus detailed with respect to multi-year
plans.  He said that in the area of property casualty insurance, many large
companies are writing three-year plans rather than on an annual basis.  "To
insurance companies, it serves as a method of retention while to the business
customer, its fixes the premiums at a set amount for a period of time without
any increase."  He cited General Accident Insurance Company as one company
that is using three-year plans.

However, insurance brokers tend to favor an annual review.  Gerald L.  Tobias,
principal in the Westchester, N.Y.-based Richwood Brokerage Company,
emphasized that his firm reviews insurance religiously.  "We look at changes
in exposures or limits and we review annually based on the expiration of a
client's insurance.  Most clients who are paying a lot in the way of premiums
may even want insurance reviews more frequently."

What to Look For

Having business insurance doesn't necessarily mean that the business is
protected but having the right insurance is what it's all about.

"Basically, we try to stay ahead of the times," said Levy.  "For example, one
policy that is becoming more and more popular these days because of the law
suits now proliferating is employment-related practices liability insurance."

He stressed that people don't realize how easy they can get sued for
harassment or wrongful dismissal, even if they haven't done anything.  "This
kind of insurance protects them in a number of ways:  it pays for legal fees
and gives them the necessary liability coverage."

Another area that companies overlook is employee benefit omissions.  "For
example," Levy said, "if you forget to cover somebody in your group plan,
you're liable if it's a benefit."  He added that "we can see the cost of
insurance generally coming down a lot recently so we encourage our clients to
protect themselves to take advantage of this."

Levy specifically noted that it is surprising how many businesses have
inadequate coverage.  For example, he pointed out an instance where employees
drive their own cars for a business purpose.  "If there is an accident," he
said, "they may not be covered because the car is being used for business and
is insured instead for personal use.  The policy to protect this is called
"Business Use of Owned Vehicle" and it is relatively an inexpensive
endorsement."

Levy said that the partners in his firm constantly talk with their brokers and
insurance companies so that we are always on the alert for new products and we
pass them on to our clients."

Rich added that the real value an accountant brings to the table is to
understand exactly what the insurance covers and whether it is adequate.
"Suppose you have a client with inventory covered at a public warehouse and
the client changes warehouses but doesn't amend the insurance to cover the new
location?  Then it's clear what will happen and it happens more frequently
than we would like."

Rich pointed out that business interruption is important today.  "You must
make sure that the loss coverage is sufficient.  You may have a growing
company and your original insurance is for half a million dollars in
inventory.  Now look at the company three years down the road where the
inventory is running at $3 million.  But, you only have a half million in
coverage.  You've got to expand the insurance with the expansion of the
business."

He said that what he looks for is a risk reward analysis where you have to
determine what you are willing to pay for what you are willing to accept.  "In
effect, it comes down to what's the deductible and what's the coverage?"

Tobias said that he works with accountants on ways to lower premiums by
raising deductibles.  "A client generally appreciates it when an accountant
says that they can save them money by raising the deductible.  If the loss can
be $4 million, is there a big difference in having a $1,000 or $5,000
deductible?  Clients like this and are appreciative of accountants looking at
this to save them money."

Picking the Right Coverage

According to David J.  Singer, vice president of the Singer Insurance Group in
Teaneck, N.J., there are some basic policies that accountants should review.

1.  Regular General Liability.  Accountants should be looking for businesses
having umbrella policies that cover a wide range of areas.  For example, many
insurance companies will advocate a general insurance but will fail to
recognize risk management.  "Insuring your computer is one thing," said
Singer, "but making backups and taking them offsite is even better.  It should
be coupled with a disaster plan.  Insurance then is just a part of risk
management."  2.  Fire & Theft Insurance.  Most clients have this but do they
have any disaster recovery plans?  Singer believes that accountants must
advise clients about this aspect.  "We know you have insurance but will it
really make you whole?  You still have to recover from the fire.  It's not
just a question of money here."  3.  Business Interruption.  This type of
policy will provide reimbursement for a major loss of income caused by an
insured catastrophe.  Singer notes that this is standard coverage.  "Almost
everybody writes it."  Two of the leaders offering this policy are the Wausau
Insurance Companies and the St.  Paul Fire & Marine Insurance Company.  4.
Employment Practices Liability.  This is a relatively new area to explore and
it covers areas such as sexual harassment, discrimination, wrongful
termination and the like.  Many accountants working hand-in-hand with
employment practices attorneys will advocate the preparation of an employee
handbook or manual.  5.  The coverage here is not yet mainstream.  Only a
limited number of companies such as Chubb, American International and Pen Ex,
to name a few, are writing this policy.  Some insurance companies will only
look at it if the business has a minimum number of employees.  6.  Employee
Benefit Liability.  This is coverage that protects the employer from the
liability in the administration of the Employee Benefit Plan.  It is becoming
more and more popular today with the increase in such plans.  This policy
would include improperly counseling plan participants, improperly interpreting
coverages, handling records carelessly and failing to enroll or terminate plan
participants.  7.  Employee Dishonesty Coverage.  This is highly important
today, insisted Singer.  "As we know, when someone steals, the client sues the
accountant because the client thinks that the accountant should have been
Sherlock Holmes.  We advise accountants to encourage all their clients to have
this type of coverage."

Singer also recommended that accountants be aware of specialty-type coverages.
For example, if the client is in a particular business, such as the travel,
entertainment, advertising or computer industries, insurance coverage should
be provided for professional liability or errors and omissions.

There is also the multi-peril policy that is a combination policy including
property, liability, bonding, valuable papers, business interruption and other
coverages.  The advantage here is that there are often discounts available for
such a combination package policy.

In addition, products liability is important and is usually made part of the
general liability policy.

The so-called umbrella policy is another layer of liability coverage on top of
basic liability policies such as automobile and general liability.  This
policy offers broader coverage and picks up exposures such as excess coverage
under specific personal policies (e.g., personal liability and automobile)
that might not be covered in the basic policy.

Key-person life insurance coverage should also be considered.  Robert Rudolf,
managing partner of Richwood Brokerage, estimated that only about a quarter of
today's businesses have key-person insurance .  "Key-policy coverage pays cash
directly to the company as the policy beneficiary when the key person either
dies or becomes disabled.  For example, you can insure someone for $50,000 or
$50 million.  The idea is to peg it to that person's worth to the company,"
concluded Rudolf.

There are a wide range of other policies to consider such as deferred
compensation indemnification that applies to officers and directors of
companies, disability insurance and of course, group health insurance which is
becoming more and more involved.

Part of any accountant's job is reviewing the insurance schedule.

Traditionally, accountants review an insurance schedule, said Marcus.  "For
example, with plants and equipment, we want to be certain that the coverage is
adequate and to be sure it's the right type such as replacement cost versus
original cost.  We also check the inventory on hand to afford the client a
full review of what they require to cover their inventory properly."

However, when reviewing such a schedule, Singer mentioned some concrete
cautions.  "Take the business interruption policy.  There is generally a
worksheet involved and that worksheet is very often filled out by accountants.
It should not be!  What the client is doing is making a projection of what
their profits will be and if they have a fire and they are underinsured, they
will sue the accountant if the accountant filled out that worksheet.  The
accountant can help the client but the client is the one making the
projections.  In fact, the engagement letter the accountant has with the
client must have a disclaimer that those numbers are the client's and not the
accountant's."

Picking the Right Broker

When it comes to finding a broker, Singer believes that the accountant should
be looking at the following areas:

1.  Departmentalization within the insurance group because personal insurance,
commercial, life and group health should be handled by different people.  2.
Affiliation with at least a half dozen major insurance companies.  3.  A
specific claims department because claims people are a special breed and they
know how to deal with insurance companies.  4.  Ability to put together a risk
management program.  The broker shouldn't be just an order taker.

Verifying Adequate Insurance

In today's economic climate, many businesses look to the accountant to protect
their interests.  There are few conditions that can reverse the fortunes of a
successful company as quickly as the lack of adequate insurance coverage.

According to Robert L.  Gray, executive director of the New York State Society
of CPAs, one of the most important services accountants can provide to protect
themselves and their clients is to verify that adequate insurance is being
carried that will cover the most common and in some cases even remote
casualties.  Gray said that "This requires that the accountant have a
functional knowledge of the types of insurance available and the ability to
determine if the client is adequately covered."

Gray added that "the accountant need not be an insurance specialist but must
be able to work with and feel confident in the ability of a client's insurance
agent."

INSIDE THE IRS


Providing Direct Deposit of Refunds to 1040 Paper Filers Instead of your
clients waiting for their refunds to come via the postal worker, they can now
see them directly deposited in their checking or savings accounts.

The IRS has released Form 8888, Direct Deposit of Refund, which can be
completed and attached to Form 1040, 1040A, 1040EZ, 1040NR or 1040NR-EZ.  The
Service will then send the refund directly to the client's financial
institution provided, of course, it is one that will accept direct deposits.

The Service said that the form cannot be used if the taxpayer is filing
electronically.  In that instance, there must be a specific request for direct
deposit by using Form 8453, 8453-OL or 8453-NR.

It also does not apply to Form 1040PC (since direct deposit election can be
made with that form) or if the taxpayer is filing a tax return for a prior
year; Form 8888 can only be used for the current year returns.  In addition,
it doesn't apply to a deceased taxpayer or where a joint return is being filed
as a surviving spouse.

The IRS said that it has not yet made any provision for notifying the taxpayer
when the direct deposit has actually been made.  For now, it will be up to the
taxpayers to check with their own financial institutions to determine if the
money has been received.  Finally, the Service said that it will only make
direct deposits to accounts in U.S.  financial institutions located in the
United States.


Surprisingly, IRS Unhappy With $13 Million Allocation

The IRS gets $13 million under an appropriation bill signed by the President
and is not terribly thrilled with it.  The problem is that the money is
earmarked for a program that would use legal firms and private collection
agencies to collect unpaid taxes.

In a letter sent to Sen.  David Pryor (D., Ark), Margaret Milner Richardson,
the IRS Commissioner, said that she had "concern" regarding the language in
the appropriations bill that would mandate the Service to spend $13 million
"to initiate a program to utilize private counsel law firms and debt
collection activities."

She added that she had "grave reservations" about using private contractors to
contact taxpayers on their delinquent tax debts without Congress having a
thorough understanding of the costs, benefits and risks of embarking on such a
course.

Questions abound

In her letter, Ms.  Richardson set forth a number of areas to be considered
such as the impact private debt collectors would have on the public's
perception of the fairness of tax administration and the security of the
financial information provided to the IRS.

She also expressed concern about how taxpayers' rights would be protected and
their privacy guaranteed as well as whether privatizing collection of tax debt
was really a good business decision for the federal government.  She cited the
fact that presently the IRS telephone collection efforts yield about $26 for
every dollar expended compared with more complex and difficult cases that
yield only $10 for every dollar spent.  Accordingly, she doubts whether
private collectors will be able to obtain the same successful return as the
IRS.

The matter is still up in the air because Sen.  Pryor (a key opponent of the
bill) isn't entirely clear on whether the IRS will be required to spend the
money.  Right now the Service is studying how best to proceed.


Updated Electronic Filing Procedures for 1996

The IRS has issued Rev.  Proc.  95-49 setting forth the various requirements
for electronic filing for the 1996 tax season for those who participate in the
program with respect to Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ.  It updates and
supersedes Rev.  Proc.  94-63.  The effective date was Nov.  22, 1995.

Under the new changes, the Service noted that Form 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ
cannot be electronically filed after Oct.  15, 1996, even if the taxpayer has
been granted an extension to file a return beyond that date.  It also pointed
out that an amended tax return cannot be electronically filed nor can returns
with foreign addresses or those for a decedent.

Furthermore, the new Rev.  Proc.  details the procedures that applicants must
follow to be accepted into the electronic filing program including their
responsibilities, the penalties that could be applied, advertising standards
and administrative reviews, to name a few.

With respect to such applicants, the procedure makes it easier for a certified
public accountant to be accepted into the program by dispensing with the
submission of a fingerprint card along with the application and requiring
instead evidence of the individual's professional status.


The Latest IRS Audit Techniques Guides

The IRS keeps pumping them out.  The Market Segment Specialization Program
(MSSP) audit techniques guides help IRS examiners focus on the significant
issues in a particular industry or class of taxpayers.  According to the
Service, they are designed to make audits more efficient and to ensure the
uniform application of tax laws.  Here is what's in the three latest guides:

Beauty and barber shops.  The IRS noted that the salon industry is cash
intensive, that the majority of the work force had a high school education and
were graduates of a cosmetology school.  The Service often found that the
books and records provided were rather limited and that the examiner would
have to conduct a very good initial review by utilizing various questions in
order to determine income.  The guide contains more than 50 potential
questions.

The IRS said that additional considerations were in reconciling the reported
tax return income to the taxpayer's financial status, evaluating the intensive
cash situation to determine the extent of the income probe and designing a
test to determine income from a reported or known reliable variable directly
related to that income.

The Service emphasized that an important examination step, of course, was to
compare the type of services and the number of appointments to the amount of
income reported.  It provided specific audit techniques to the industry that
can be used including how to calculate unreported tips.

Auto body and repair industry.  The almost 100-page guide explained that most
auto body shops were small to medium sized businesses operated as sole
proprietorships, small partnerships or closely held corporations and they
ranged in size from the corner shop to large franchises with many locations.
It pointed out that body shops were particularly interesting because they
combined a service-type business with retailing aspects.

The IRS noted that although they provide labor and skill, they must also
purchase and resell the needed parts.  Accordingly, this, they maintained,
often created conflicts in determining whether shops were required to maintain
inventories.

The guide stated that the industry was extremely competitive as a result of
the influence that insurance companies exerted and inasmuch as insurance paid
for many claims, they looked for the most cost-efficient businesses.  Thus, a
shop that was willing to use less expensive parts as opposed to factory
originals would be preferred.

The Service called attention to the fact that because inventory adjustments
had been consistently made in the auto body-repair industry, the examiner
would find it necessary to become acquainted with procedures for making a
change in the accounting method.  For example, for a taxpayer on the accrual
basis, the change will be limited to the inventory itself.  For a cash basis
taxpayer, the change will include the sales and purchases.

Also, the Service pointed out that with the advent of Rev.  Proc.  92-20, the
examiner needed to consider the possibility of allowing the taxpayer to spread
the adjustment over several years.

The guide contains 26 sample questions that may be used in the initial
interview, pointing out what would indicate an underreporting of income as
well as specific audit tips and special employment tax issues that might
easily arise.

Reforestation industry.  The comprehensive report was the work of a team from
Examination Collection and the State of Oregon Revenue Department.  Their
basic goals were to determine if compliance was a problem in this industry, if
the contractors were filing all required federal and state returns, if the
returns were substantially correct and then to make recommendations to the
proper governmental agencies in order to strengthen voluntary compliance
within the industry.

The IRS said a major concern was that many transactions between contractors
was done with cash, thereby creating little or no audit trail.  Those payments
also reduced the likelihood that a Form 1099 was filed or that the contractors
even deposited the cash into their business accounts.  The Service noted that
a possible indicator of unreported income could be illustrated by the
contractor who produced receipts for business expenses paid in cash but not
previously deducted on the return.

A detailed guideline for interviewing contractors along with suggested
questions is included.


Time for Action Regs Proposed

In proposed rulemaking IA-36-91, the IRS has issued a document that contains
proposed regs relating to the time for performance of acts by taxpayers and by
the Commissioner, a district director, or the director of a regional service
center, where the last day for performance falls on a Saturday, Sunday or
legal holiday.  In particular, the proposed regs would remove the list of
legal holidays and other outdated material.

The list of holidays would be replaced by citations to the law (legal holidays
in the District of Columbia is found in D.C.  Code Ann.  28-2701) from which
the holidays would be discerned.  In this way, said the IRS, future changes in
the law regarding holidays would not require amendments to the regs.


Practicing Before the IRS Doesn't Get Any Easier

The Office of Director of Practices has outlined four specific scenarios that
illustrate the types of conduct that would warrant disciplinary action on
those who practice before the IRS.

Coming under Circular 230, the Service said that these represent composites of
matters coming to the director's office and do not constitute precedent in any
one matter.  They are as follows:

* Practitioner A makes estimated tax payments exceeding his personal tax
liability but doesn't file corresponding income tax returns.  He gives the
excuse that he had no time because of a busy schedule.  He could get suspended
or disbarred.

* Practitioner B represents a client whose return has been selected for audit.
The practitioner calls the revenue agent who will be conducting the audit but
he is unavailable.  They go back and forth, each missing the other's call.
Finally, Practitioner B telephones claiming it's a medical emergency,
whereupon the alarmed agent takes the call.  The practitioner's action
constitutes what is called "disreputable conduct."

* Practitioner C cancels conferences with an appeals officer on five different
occasions leaving messages on his answering machine that he had scheduling
problems.  Conduct constitutes "unreasonable delay" and could warrant
suspension or disbarrment.

* Practitioner D pleads guilty to making false statements in obtaining
federally insured mortgage and winds up with a felony conviction.  The
director can impose a suspension on the practitioner based on dishonesty.


IRS Briefs

* Mediation to resolve Tax Court cases.  In a memorandum to field
administrative officers, the IRS has outlined a procedure for the use of
mediation to resolve certain docketed Tax Court cases.  Any agreement reached
through mediation would then be submitted to the court as a stipulation of
settled issues.

* Appointments to international posts.  The IRS has appointed John Lyons to
assistant commissioner, Thomas Smith to deputy assistant commissioner and
Michael Danilack III to associate chief counsel, all in the international
area.

* Federal-State reference guide.  The IRS has issued a special guide book for
state and local government employers that contains information on Social
Security and Medicare coverage and employer-tax-withholding requirements as
they pertain to government employees.  A free copy may be obtained by calling
the IRS at (800) 829-3676.  Ask for Publication 0963.

PROFIT STATEMENT:  The Writing Accountant


What do you do for an encore when you've spent six years at a Big Six
accounting firm and 21 years teaching graduate and undergraduate courses in
accounting, taxation and real estate at three major universities?  How about
opening a small consulting firm where your client base comes from what you
write?  Write?

The accountant with the proclivity for reducing thoughts to the printed page
is Jack P.  Friedman, a transplanted New Yorker now living in Dallas, who over
the years has written and published 21 books and more than 200 articles.
Along the way, he has also accumulated an extraordinary string of degrees and
designations including CPA, Ph.D., MBA, BBA, MAI, SREA, ASA and CRE, to name a
few.  In effect, what Friedman has done is build first a foundation based on
his unique experience and interest and then construct an accounting practice
from there.

He is primarily a consultant in matters concerning real estate but also in
some areas that have a more general business orientation.  Friedman noted that
much of his current work is in litigation support, for several reasons.
"First, attorneys prefer a published author as an expert witness.  Publication
of a book or professional article lends credibility.  Second, litigation
support offers a fairly high hourly compensation rate.  Also, the mix of
assignments that I receive in litigation support present challenges and
prevent boredom."

Writings=Client List

Friedman's books are extensive ranging from consumer guides to graduate school
textbooks and professional references.  They include The Dictionary of Tax
Terms (Barron's),The Encyclopedia of Investments (Warren, Gorham & Lamont),
Income Property Appraisal and Analysis (Prentice-Hall) and Keys to Investing
in Real Estate (Barron's).

His client list includes Champion International Corporation, the City of
Dallas, Simon Property Group, Exxon and the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation.

Where does he get his clients?  They generally come to him because of what he
has written.  For example, a law firm in Kentucky involved in the condemnation
of a public utility found themselves faced with three appraisals from the
condemnee relating to the market value of the property.  The firm sent for
educational materials of professional appraisal associations, found Friedman's
name and credits and called him to review the appraisals.  He did and said he
found them deficient.  "Based on my testimony at the hearings," he pointed
out, "the trial judge precluded any of the appraisal testimony from the other
side.  I have since assisted the firm in other matters."

Friedman also related the story of a prominent real estate broker in Dallas
who was interested in selling her own firm.  "It was a substantial business,"
he said, "with a unique market niche."  The broker visited his accountant to
gain an understanding of the ramifications of the sale and to enlist the
accountant as an ally in marketing the business.  The accountant researched
the business literature on the sale of a real estate brokerage firm, came
across Friedman's name as having prepared articles and monographs on the
subject and then brought him in to counsel the owner.

"All discussions," noted Friedman, "had to be absolutely confidential because
leaks of a possible sale could cause injury to the firm's value."  The firm
was sold in less than two months at a price and on terms suggested by
Friedman.

Project orientation.  Friedman believes that his course of practice is
something that can be done without the ongoing burden of a bigger professional
staff.  In fact, he keeps a lid on having a lot of people running around his
office.  He works primarily with one full-time administrative assistant and
three part-time people, all of whom have extensive experience in real estate
accounting, appraisal analysis and investment analysis.

The firm's personnel philosophy is to have relationships with others as staff
for potential assignments, but not to take on the obligations or overhead of
full-time staff.  "Therfore," he pointed out, "people with various specialties
may be brought in to work on a complex project, on an as-needed basis."  He
said that this modus operandi provides greater freedom and flexibility.

Getting Into Print

Friedman noted that his first five articles grew out of the work he was doing
as a CPA, which was in helping a real estate developer package FHA 236 housing
projects for sale to investors as a tax shelter.  Most of his subsequent
articles have been in response to a current business problem or have grown out
of research needed to shed light on a particular issue.

What does it take to get things written and published?  Friedman offered these
tips:

* Write what you are most interested in.  * Start with an article 10 to 40
double-spaced typewritten pages.  Don't begin by tackling a full-length book
project.  * Prepare an outline.  That will provide a path to follow and more
importantly will allow you to work on it over a period of time-in free moments
between what should be more pressing activities.  * Send it in even if the
editor declines interest in the topic.  The editor may like it when he or she
sees it.

Friedman also offered a tip on manuscript preparation.

He points out that almost all the publishers will edit the manuscript, some
more than others.  "Still, although editors can make a silk purse out of a
sow's ear, they're more likely to decline an obviously substandard piece (such
as one that is replete with typos), so seek out a typist who can prepare a
presentable manuscript."  In fact, Friedman goes a step further and insists
that you proofread your manuscript carefully before submission because "even
the best typist may have misunderstood you."

He said that even if you can't find a publisher, "a well-thought out,
beautifully typed and printed manuscript can be used in your own firm's
promotional material."

Friedman emphasized the fact that "manuscripts don't write themselves.  It
takes real work."  Also, you must be realistic.  "Don't expect immediate
results.  The payoff after publishing may take months or years."  To him, it's
paid off not only in accounting fees but in book royalties, as well.

He believes that there are many benefits to publishing.  "It brings prestige
to your employer or client and highlights you as an expert on a subject,
making your name valuable both inside and outside your firm."

Friedman's writings corroborate this and prove the point that putting the pen
to the paper can pay off handsomely.

TAX ALERT:  ESTATE AND GIFT TAXES


Minority Discount Is Part of Special Use Valuation Reduction

Hoover died owning a 26% interest in a limited partnership that operated a
cattle ranch.  In determining its estate tax liability, the estate first
determined the fair market value of her interest and then subtracted a 30%
discount of $819,000 to reflect lack of marketability and control.  The estate
then determined the special use valuation of that interest.

The estate's pro-rata share of the special use valuation was more than
$750,000 less than the discounted fair market value.  As a result, the estate
then reported the discounted fair market value less an additional $750,000 for
the interest in the partnership under the special use valuation election.

The IRS argued, and the Tax Court agreed, that the fair market value of the
interest for this purpose should not have been reduced by the 30% discount
since the estate was also taking the $750,000 special use valuation reduction.

Law:  Under Section 2032A, an election can be made for estate tax purposes to
value property according to its qualified use rather than at its highest or
best use.  But the maximum reduction in valuation is $750,000.  By Section
2032A(g), the election applies to interests held in a partnership.  In Estate
of Maddox, the Tax Court did not permit a subtraction for a minority interest
discount against the special use valuation itself.

Held:  For the estate.  The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit held that
the true fair market value for Section 2032A purposes is not modified in any
way and so it was proper to subtract the discount.  Neither the statute nor
the legislative history suggest that Section 2032A is designed to modify the
definition of fair market value.  An accurate determination of fair market
value must involve the use of the minority interest discount.The special use
valuation reduction of $750,000 can then be applied.  Estate of Hoover, 76
AFTR 2d 95-7305, (CA-10, 1995).


PROCEDURE

Transferee Bound by Transferor's Closing Agreement

Harvey Pert is married to Kathleen Pert who was previously married to Timothy
Riffe.  For four tax years, Kathleen, as representative of Riffe's estate and
in her own behalf signed closing agreements to settle tax liabilities asserted
against her and Riffe and penalties asserted against Riffe.  She also agreed
to a stipulated decision of the Tax Court to settle liability for another tax
year.

The IRS asserted transferee liability against Harvey Pert as both transferee
of Kathleen and successor transferee of Riffe.  Harvey claimed that he could
litigate the underlying tax deficiencies despite the signed closing
agreements.

Law:  Section 7121 authorizes written closing agreements which cannot be
reopened unless there is a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation
of material fact.  It also says that a closing agreement may not be annulled,
modified, set aside or disregarded in any suit, action or proceeding.

Held:  For the IRS.  Pert could not relitigate any of the liabilities that
Kathleen settled in the closing agreements or the stipulated decision.  A
closing agreement binds a transferee of the party to the closing agreement in
a manner analagous to the way res judicata binds a transferee to a prior
judicial decision in which the transferor was the party.  Also, there is no
basis for distinguishing between a transferee and a successor transferee for
this purpose.

Res judicata, under which parties and their privies to a prior action that
concluded with a final decision on the merits, are bound as to all issues that
were or might have been decided in the prior action, also applies to persons
in privity with the taxpayer (e.g., as a transferee and transferor).

Thus, res judicata bars a transferee from relitigating the income tax
liabilities of a transferor once a final decision has been entered by the Tax
Court in the transferor's case if the decision was stipulated.

The Tax Court refused in this case to reconsider the principle that a Tax
Court decision entered pursuant to the stipulation of the parties is
considered to be judgment on the merits for purposes of res judicata.  Pert,
105 TC No.  24.

TAX BRIEFS


Substitute tax forms procedure.  Rev.  Proc.  95-46 provides general
requirements and conditions for the development, printing and approval of
substitute Form 1040A and related forms and schedules to be input through the
Document Processing System.

Foreign tax credit.  Final regulations (TD 8627) deal with certain limitations
on the use of deconsolidation to avoid foreign tax credit limitations under
Section 904(i).  They will affect the sourcing and foreign tax credit separate
limitation character of income for purposes of the calculation of the foreign
tax credit by certain domestic related corporations.  The regs are generally
effective for taxable years of affiliates beginning after Dec.  31, 1993.

Nurses were independent contractors.  Corporation that operated nursing
registry established reasonable basis under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of
1978 for treating its nurses as independent contractors.  The facts satisfied
many of the common-law factors indicating that the corporation did not control
how the nurses performed their work.  It could get refund of employment taxes.
Hospital Resource Personnel Inc., 76 AFTR 2d 95-7148, 95-2 USTC  50, 594,
(CA-11, 1995).

Dollar-value LIFO didn't reflect income.  Dollar-value LIFO accounting did not
clearly reflect corporation's income when it treated bargain purchase
inventory the same as physically similar inventory acquired and manufactured
at normal costs under dollar-value LIFO.  Kohler Co.  and subsidiaries, 76
AFTR 2d 95-7194, 95-2 USTC  50, 600 (Ct.Fed.Cl., 1995).

Law firm taxed on client reimbursements.  Under tax benefit rule, law firm had
to include in income reimbursements in current year for service costs advanced
for clients and previously deducted in prior closed years.  This was so even
though firm agreed to treat service cost advances as nondeductible loans
starting in current year.  Hughes & Luce L.L.P., 95-2 USTC  50, 614, (CA-5,
1995).

Taxable insurance policy exchange.  Ltr.  Rul.  9542037 discusses various
spouse-to-spouse exchanges of life insurance policies that will trigger
recognizable gain under Section 1035.  The exchanges involve going from
coverage of individual lives to second-to-die policies.

Form 872-A not terminated by bankruptcy.  Form 872-A consent to extend the
time for assessment is a waiver of the limitations period and not an executory
contract.  Thus, it does not terminate automatically 60 days after a taxpayer
files a bankruptcy petition.  Bilski, (CA-5, 1995).

Bankruptcy and IRA distributions.  A debtor physician, age 62, who filed a
Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding does not have to withdraw funds from an IRA
prior to the tax-law mandated required beginning date to provide payments to
the trustee and creditors.  Chapter 13 protection is not contingent on being
funded from retirement assets.  In re Solomon, M.D.  (Solomon v.  Cosby), 76
AFTR 2d 95-7124, (CA-4, 1995).

Auction proceeds levy invalid.  IRS levy on the auction proceeds of taxpayer's
property was invalid.  Levy was served on the auction company before the sale
took place and the specific items to be sold were not identified until one or
two days prior to the auction.  Auction company's liability to taxpayer was
not fixed and determinable at the time of the levy.  Tull, 76 AFTR 2d 95-7312,
95-2 USTC  50, 602 (CA-9, 1995).

Timely notice of transferee liability.  Tax Court analyzes effect of
consensual extension of limitations for assessment of gift tax along with
issuance of notice of deficiency to donor on timeliness of notice of
transferee liability.  Value of taxable gift in hands of transferee was not
reduced by gift tax lien.  Ripley, 105 TC No.  23.

Interest paid by utility was exempt from 30% tax withholding under treaty
since sub was in business activity and not just utility's agent.  Northern
Indiana Public Service Co., 105 TC No.  22.

S corp income not self-employment earnings for Keogh deduction.  S corporation
shareholders can't treat pass-through income as net earnings from
self-employment for Keogh plan deduction purposes, even though they performed
services for the corporation.  Under Sections 401 and 404, both partners and
sole proprietors may deduct contributions to qualified retirement plans but
not S corp shareholders.  Durando, 76 AFTR 2d  95-5644, (CA-9, 1995).

Publicly traded partnerships.  Final regulations (TD 8629) have been issued
dealing with the classification of certain publicly traded partnerships as

The Art of Sharing Data

A feature in software programs much ballyhooed by vendors these days is
integration, the ability to share data among different software applications.
One way to accomplish this is through software suites that provide several
programs, sometimes from different vendors, on a CD-ROM.  Another way is to
use tax and accounting programs available from the same vendor, so that the
different programs all speak the same language.  A third way is to use a
third-party bridge product that provides data conversion between different
software programs.

For example, the Audisys Corp.  of Portland, Ore., said its TAXi tax import
bridge is capable of transferring data from virtually any accounting
application into several popular tax return software programs, including CCH
ProSystem fx, Lacerte, Pencil Pushers, CLR Fast/Tax and TenKey's Tax Shop
Entities.  It said TAXi is set up to automatically convert data from several
accounting and write-up packages, including ACCPAC Plus, ATB, Creative
Solutions ws-2, TAASC Easy ACCT and UniLink Write Up Plus.  And because it's
capable of reading DOS and ASCII formats, TAXi can convert data, though
probably at a slower pace, from other packages as well.  TAXi has other
advantages, too.  It can prepare reports in either a book or tax basis, it
maintains and updates tax code dictionaries in accounting software and it
enables users to switch from an accrual to a cash basis accounting method.

To be sure, Audisys has its work cut out for it.  "Data conversion has its own
set of problems ...  there's always something missing," said James Metzler, a
frequent lecturer in computer technology and a partner of the Buffalo,
N.Y.-based accounting firm Gaines Emhoff Metzler & Kriner.

Indeed, CCH and TAASC, two of the vendors whose tax software can receive data
via TAXi, say they are not directly cooperating with Audisys and recommend
their own bridges to users.

TAXi's ability to maneuver quickly also raises some questions.  Pencil Pushers
CEO Harvey Stein, who said he supports Audisys's efforts, said, however, that
the time and effort it takes to code each account being converted with TAXi
seems to negate the advantage of using it.

But others say TAXi is the only vehicle available that enables users to
integrate virtually any tax, accounting and writeup packages of their choice -
even from among competitors.  "It allows the user to make the choice of whom
they want to bridge with," said Greg King, vice president of marketing for
Lacerte Software, adding that TAXi "breaks down some walls set up by competing
vendors."

Even though Lacerte has its own bridges with certain accounting and writeup
vendors, King said it supports TAXi as a way to give users complete freedom in
designing their own connections.  He added that TAXi's critics overlook the
fact that, after its initial set-up of codes, it requires only typical
maintenance to update data.

TAXi's price is an initial $279 with a $129 renewal cost.-Paul Demery

ESTATE AND GIFT TAXATION:  DISPUTES OVER MINORITY DISCOUNTS CONTINUE


Value, like beauty, is in the eyes of the beholder.  Unfortunately, in the
case of transfers of closely held businesses, the owner of these businesses
and the IRS don't always see eye-to-eye.  Over the years, the IRS has been
enmeshed in many battles over the valuation of minority interests in closely
held businesses.  In 1993, the IRS appeared to have given up when it issued
Rev.  Rul.  93-12, which allowed minority discounts for a parent's gifts of a
20% interest in a closely held business to each of five children.  However, a
close examination of later Technical Advice Memorandums (TAMs) indicates that
the IRS is still fighting over minority discounts.  A review of the seeds of
this controversy makes it easier to understand the current battle lines.

It's Worth Much Less

Because of the lack of market transactions, the valuation of a closely held
business interest must involve a review of the corporation's intrinsic worth;
which includes its earning capacity, the book value of its stock, its dividend
paying capacity and goodwill.  The IRS provided an analysis of these factors
in Rev.  Rul.  59-60.  One factor mentioned is the size of the block of stock
transferred and the block's inherent degree of control.  Although the Service
administratively recognizes this concept, it has repeatedly challenged the
taking of minority discounts in valuing closely held businesses for both
estate and gift tax purposes.

A minority discount is based on the fact that the minority shareholder cannot
unilaterally control the corporate decision making process including the
payment of dividends, the election of directors and officers and the
liquidation of the corporation.  The range of the minority discount that is
claimed usually varies from about 20% to as much as 50%

Generally, ownership of less than 50% of the voting stock of a closely held
corporation will constitute a minority interest.  However, if the governing
state law requires greater than 50% of the voting stock in order to affect
corporate action, then the transferred block, if less than that greater
percentage, will be a minority interest for discount purposes.  For minority
discount purposes, it is only voting control which is relevant and not the
value of the transferred shares.

Breaking It Up

Owners of majority interests in closely held businesses often look to take
advantage of the minority discount by giving stock to a number of
beneficiaries so that each receives a minority interest.  In the case of
lifetime transfers, courts have generally allowed each block to be valued
separately.1 However, they also hold that if the transfer occurs at death,
aggregation is required.2 The fact that a block of closely held stock which is
included in the gross estate is divided among several beneficiaries is
irrelevant for valuation purposes.  The imposition of the estate tax, unlike
the gift tax, is based on what the decedent owned at death and not what was
given to each beneficiary.

On the flip side, courts have held that a transfer, either by gift or at
death, remains a transfer of a minority interest subject to a possible
discount even if the transferee already has control of the corporation or will
achieve corporate control as a result of the transfer.3

IRS Pulls Back

Until recently, it was the IRS's position that a minority discount would not
be allowed with respect to the transfer of stock among family members when
that family controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer.

In Rev.  Rul.  81-253, the Service concluded that where the family owned a
controlling interest, the stock would be valued as if all of it were held by
one person.  The result was that each share transferred would be considered
part of the controlling block.

Example:  Alpha Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding.  John
and Betty Smith each own 40 shares while Bob and Wendy, their two children,
own 10 shares apiece.  John and Betty transfer to Bob and Wendy one share each
of their stock, which clearly is a minority interest.  However, since the
family controlled the corporation at the time of the transfer, the IRS would
deny the minority discount.

Generally, the courts have rejected the IRS's application of family
attribution as being inconsistent with valuation principles clearly stated in
the regulations.4 According to these regs, the transferor should be viewed as
a hypothetical willing seller who is independent of the other shareholders.5

Rev.  Rul.  93-12 revoked Rev.  Rul.  81-253 using the example of a parent who
transferred all of the shares in a wholly owned corporation by making gifts of
20% of the shares to each of his five children.  The IRS ruled that the shares
should be valued in the hands of the donees without regard to the shares held
by other family members.

The IRS has recently issued two TAMs further defining its position with
respect to this type of minority discount.  In TAM 9432001, the decedent owned
48.59% of the stock with the remaining 51.41% of the stock owned by his son.
Decedent's will provided that all of his stock would pass to his son.  The IRS
concluded that the minority discount would not be lost merely because the son
owned the remaining shares in the corporation.

In TAM 9449001, the Service addressed the issue whether simultaneous gifts to
family members would be valued separately.  The donor, who owned 100% of the
stock in a closely held corporation, gave simultaneous gifts of the stock to
each of his 11 children.  The IRS ruled that each gift would be valued
separately.

Unfortunately, Rev.  Rul.  93-12 and the two TAMS might only be a short-term
concession.  It appears that the IRS still has an arsenal of weapons that it
is using against a claim of a minority discount.

Substance-Over- Form Salvo

The IRS will aggregate minority stock as components of a single control block
when it perceives a tax avoidance motive for the transaction.  In Estate of
Murphy,6 an individual, pursuant to a general power of appointment, controlled
a 51.41% block of stock in a closely held corporation.  Eighteen days prior to
her death, she transferred .88% of the stock to each of her two children,
leaving her with a 49.65% interest.  The estate claimed a minority discount
for (1) the two .88% stock gifts and (2) the 49.65% block of stock owned at
death.

The Tax Court ruled that the minority discount did not apply to either.  It
concluded that the attempt to reduce the ownership interest below 50% by
gifting 1.76% of stock prior to death constituted tax avoidance.  According to
the Court, the transfer "lacked substance and economic effect."  The court
aggregated both the gift and testamentary transfer for valuation purposes.

But it is clear that the IRS and the Court failed to recognize that a
substantial change did occur.  Implicit in the court's reasoning is that the
decedent retained control over the corporation until her death.  But, this
ignores the legal significance of the decedent's stock transfer which
effectively stripped her of control over the corporation.

The court's conclusion would be acceptable if there was some sort of an
agreement that the children were required to vote the gifted stock in
accordance with their mother's wishes.  However, no such agreement existed, so
the decedent's 49.65% stock interest should have been considered a minority
interest.7

Recently issued TAM 9504004 further shows the IRS's propensity to apply
substance over form.  In this TAM, the decedent, 19 days before he died from
terminal cancer, sold one-half of his 60% interest in the family corporation
to child A, who at the time owned 20% of the corporation prior to the sale.
This increased child A's interest to 50%.  The decedent's two other children
collectively owned 20%.  Simultaneously with the sale, the corporation
redeemed the decedent's remaining 30% interest.  The redemption increased
child A's stock ownership interest to 71.4%.  The estate stipulated that the
principal purpose of the simultaneous stock sale and redemption was to
transfer decedent's controlling interest in the corporation to child A.

For valuation purposes, the decedent's estate treated the sale and redemption
as involving two separate transfers.  However, the IRS concluded that for
valuation purposes the sale of decedent's 30% stock sale to Child A and the
simultaneous redemption of decedent's remaining 30% interest must be viewed as
a single integrated transfer of a controlling corporate interest to child A.

Swing Vote Attack

A portion or all of the minority discount may be lost if the transferred stock
is determined by the IRS to have a swing vote characteristic.  Minority stock
is considered as having such a characteristic if it may enable another
minority holder to achieve majority control.

Example:  Two shareholders own 49% of the stock and a third shareholder owns
2%.  The stock owned by the 2% shareholder is perceived as possessing a swing
vote potential; it arguably may be able to command a premium in excess of its
pro-rata value.

The adverse effect of the transferred stock with swing vote attributes is
illustrated in the following example based on TAM 9436005.

Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common shares of Beta
corporation.  On Dec.  18, 1994, John gifted 30 shares to each of his three
children.  He also transferred five shares to his wife.  In valuing the
transfer, John discounted the value of the transferred shares by a minority
discount of 25%.  According to the IRS, John would not be entitled to a
minority discount for any of the three 30% blocks since each had a swing vote
characteristic.  Any of the three children could join with another and control
the corporation.

This is inconsistent with case law which recognizes that where a donor makes
simultaneous gifts of stock to different donees, each gift is valued
separately in determining the fair market value for gift tax purposes.8 The
IRS disputed donor's argument that if it had not been a simultaneous transfer,
the result would have been different.

Although the Service agreed that at the time of the transfer of the first
block it would not reflect a swing vote attribute, it contended the value of
the second 30% block transferred would reflect a swing vote characteristic.
According to the IRS, the transfer of the second 30% block would also result
in an increase in the value of the first block transferred since the first
block would belatedly acquire possible voting control in the form of swing
vote.  The IRS reasoned that this increase in the value of the first block
would constitute an indirect gift to the first block recipient at the time of
the second transfer.  The IRS concluded that even if the transfers were made
at different times, the total value of the gifts would ultimately be the same
as if they were made simultaneously.

The IRS's decision that the second transfer constituted an indirect gift seems
to stretch unduly the concept of an indirect gift.  Only the value of the
property which passes at the time of the gift should be subject to the gift
tax.  The second transfer carried out the donor's intent to transfer 30 shares
of stock to a particular donee.  It was not the donor's intent to transfer
value to another shareholder.  Furthermore, the IRS's position is built upon
the principle that any increase in the value of one family member's stock
constitutes a gift to that shareholder.  In essence, what the IRS
characterizes as an indirect gift is a phantom gift.  Consider the following:

Example:  Family Inc.  has 100 shares of voting common stock outstanding which
is owned by three sisters:  Linda (46 shares), Sally (30 shares) and Betty (24
shares).  Linda is bored with corporate life and decides to gift her shares to
her two sisters.  It is her intent to treat her sisters equally, so she gives
23 shares to each.  After the gift, Sally is in control of the corporation
with 53 shares while Betty owns 47 shares.

Under established case law, Linda would be entitled to a minority discount
with respect to both transfers.  The value of Linda's gift to Sally is limited
to the value of the shares actually transferred.  There is no basis for
finding an additional indirect gift to Sally.

Assume the same set of facts, except that Linda decides to have her shares
redeemed from the corporation in a transaction which does not have as its
intended purpose the objective of transferring control of the corporation to
Sally.  There is no question that the redemption would result in increasing
the value of Sally's shares.  However, it would be an unintended stretch of
the gift tax rules to suggest that Linda has made a gift to Sally as a result
of the redemption.  That would only be the result if one extends the IRS's
perception of an indirect gift.  It should be noted that the courts have
rejected similar attempts by the Service in the past to create phantom income
in the form of a constructive dividend to the remaining shareholders.9

In support of its swing vote position the IRS primarily relies upon Estate of
Winkler.10 In that case the IRS contested the amount of the minority discount
for a decedent's 10% ownership of a corporation with two different
families-the Winklers and the Simmons-each owning 45% of the stock.  The IRS
denied the minority discount for estate tax purposes claiming that the owner
of the 10% block could effect control over the corporation by joining with
either family.  According to the Tax Court in this case, a willing buyer would
pay a premium for this 10% stock interest.

The court's rationale here is inconsistent with the regulations' concept of a
hypothetical willing buyer and willing seller.  It invites an unintended
subjective and very speculative inquiry into the feelings, attitudes and
anticipated behaviors of the recipients of the stock, other shareholders and
potential purchasers.

The IRS's position would then result in the minority discount being either
eliminated or reduced whenever the minority block of stock being transferred
would provide control if coupled with any other minority blocks.  Except in
Estate of Winkler, the courts have generally not embraced this position.  In
fact, the Ninth Circuit in Propstra11 rejected such an approach and allowed a
minority discount for an estate.  It reasoned that inquiries into the
anticipated behavior of the surviving co-owners was logically inconsistent
with the regulations and would require subjective assessments that might prove
to be groundless.  In Estate of Bright12, the Fifth Circuit did not consider
the swing vote characteristics of a 27.5% stock interest.  At the time of the
transfer, the decedent's wife owned 27.5% of the corporate stock and an
unrelated party owned 30%.

Query?  Is swing vote potential limited to those situations where only one
minority block shareholder could achieve control?  In TAM 9436005, the
minority block which could achieve control by aligning with the transferred
shares was owned by one person.  However, in TAM 9449001, the IRS implied that
minority stock could possess swing characteristics even if the benefitting
minority block was owned by more than one shareholder.

Section 2704 Threat

Prior to the passage of Section 2704 in 1990, family business interests were
often structured so that voting and liquidation rights would lapse upon a
transfer resulting in a reduced estate or gift tax.  Use of lapsing rights
would then result in a closely held business being valued at its going-concern
value, which very often is less than its liquidation value.

In Estate of Harrison,13 a decedent was both a general and limited partner in
a family partnership in which his sons were also limited partners.  Pursuant
to state law, the decedent, as general partner, possessed the power lapsing at
death to liquidate the partnership and to receive the liquidation value
attributable to both his general and limited partnership interest.  The
limited partners did not possess such power.  The estate valued his limited
partnership interest at its going-concern value of $33 million instead of at
its higher liquidation value of $59 million that the IRS contended.  The value
of the general partnership interest was not in dispute.  The Tax Court
concluded that the value of the limited partnership interest was $33 million
since the liquidation right lapsed at death.

Congressional concern regarding perceived valuation abuses as a result of
using lapses to artificially reduce transfer tax value resulted in the passage
of Section 2704.  It overrules the result in Harrison by eliminating the
disappearance of value caused by a lapse in either the voting or liquidation
rights (defined in Reg.  25.2704-1(b)) of the transferred interest.  It treats
the lapse of either a voting or liquidation right as a taxable transfer if the
holder of the right and members of the family (as defined in Section
2704(a)(1)) control the partnership or corporation, both before and after the
lapse.  The drop in value triggered by the lapse is recaptured as an
additional transfer.  The value of the transfer is equal to the excess of (1)
the total interest value (including voting and liquidation rights) held before
the lapse, over (2) the value (without the lapsed right) immediately after the
lapse.

Example:  John owns 70% of the outstanding common stock of Alpha corporation
while his daughter Betty owns the remaining 30% interest.  John's voting stock
is automatically converted to nonvoting stock at his death.  The pre-lapse
value of the 70% interest, which possesses voting rights, is valued at $1
million.  The post-lapse value of John's 70% interest, without voting rights,
is reduced to $400,000.  The amount of the Section 2704 transfer is valued at
$600,000, the difference between the value of the stock as voting and
nonvoting stock.

Section 2704(b) addressed similar perceived valuation abuses regarding
intra-family transfers of corporation or partnership interests where the right
to liquidate is restricted.  It provides that applicable restrictions14 on the
ability of a corporation or partnership to liquidate are disregarded when
valuing an interest in such entity.  Section 2704(b) applies if there is a
transfer of a business interest to, or for the benefit of, the transferor's
family and members of the transferor's family control the entity immediately
before the transfer.

Example:  Sally owns all of the preferred stock in Profit Corporation.  The
stock carries a right to liquidate which cannot be exercised until 1999.
Sally's two children, Bob and Betty, own all of the common stock, which is the
only voting stock.  In 1994, Sally gifts the preferred stock to Bob and Betty.
Under Section 2704(b), the value of the gifted stock is determined without
regard to any restriction because it is not a restriction which by its terms
will never lapse.  Because the restriction lapses subsequent to the transfer,
it is disregarded.  Therefore, the Profit preferred stock is valued as though
the restriction on liquidation did not exist.

It has been suggested that strict application of Section 2704 may preclude the
application of the minority discount.15 Consider the following:

Example:  John owns all of the 100 outstanding common stock of Beta
corporation, which is the only outstanding class of stock.  On March 1, 1995,
John gives 30 shares to his son, Bob, and 30 shares to his daughter, Betty.
The voting rights attributed by the corporation's bylaws to such stock lapse
upon the transfer.  The value of the corporation on the date of the gift was
$1 million and the per-share value prior to the gift was $10,000.  The
post-lapse value of each share of gifted stock is $7,500.  Assume that the
recommended minority discount would be 25%.  Since the right to vote the
transferred shares lapses upon the stock transfer, there is a potential
Section 2704(a) transfer equal to $2,500 per share.  Thus, the per-share value
subject to gift taxation would be $10,000 per share.  Such a result would
eliminate the minority discount.  But for Section 2704(a), the per-share value
subject to gift taxation would be reduced to $7,500 as a result of the
minority discount.  However, Section 2704(a) creates a transfer equal to the
value of the lapsed voting rights.

Congress considered including in Section 2704 a provision that the minority
discount would not be allowed.  Despite the challenge, the committee reports
provide that Section 2704 currently is not intended to affect minority
discounts or other discounts.  Reg.  25.2704-1(d) appears to be consistent
with this point.  According to the reg, when valuing a gifted interest with a
lapse, the starting point for determining the amount of the 2704 transfer is
not the value of all interests owned by the holder immediately before the
transfer.  Instead, it is the value of all such interests determined
immediately after the lapse as if the lapsed right was nonlapsing.

Example:  At his death, D owned all of the preferred stock of Alpha
corporation and his child, Betty, owned all of the common stock.  The
preferred stock possessed 60% of the total voting power with the common stock
possessing the remaining 40%.  Pursuant to the corporate bylaws, the voting
rights of the preferred stock terminated on D's death.  The value of D's
interest immediately prior to his death was $100,000.  The value of that
interest immediately after death would have been $90,000 if the voting rights
had been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects the end of D's
involvement in Alpha.

The regulations recognize the $10,000 discount attributable to the loss of a
key person.  Therefore, under Section 2704(a), the beginning value of the
transferred stock is the post-transfer value after application of the key-man
discount.  The same analysis should also apply with respect to the minority
discount.  If so, then the starting point for determining the amount of the
Section 2704 transfer should be the post-transfer value after application of
the minority discount.

Example:  John owns 80 shares of the total of Money Corporation's 100
outstanding shares of common stock.  He gifts 40 shares to each of his two
children.  Per the corporate bylaws, the voting rights of John's common stock
terminated upon the stock transfer.  The per-share value of the transferred
stock prior to the gift was $1,000 per share.  The value of that interest
immediately after the gift would have been $750 per share if the voting rights
had been nonlapsing.  The decrease in value reflects a 25% minority discount.
Assume that as a result of the lapse the per-share value of the transferred
stock drops to $600 per share.  If we assume that the beginning value for
Section 2704(a) purposes is $750 which incorporates a 25% minority discount,
the value of the 2704(a) transfer is $150 per share ($750 minority discount
value less $600) and not $400.

Final Legislative Offensive

We understand that the IRS is pursuing a legislative attempt to eliminate the
minority discount.  This would not be the first direct legislative threat to
the minority discount.  In 1987, the House version of Section 2036(c) provided
that absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the deemed value of
stock in a corporation is its pro-rata share of all the stock in the class.
The Senate version of Section 2036(c) did not contain a similar provision.
The House provision on minority discounts was dropped from the final Section
2036(c) bill.

Historically, the minority discount has played a significant role in many
estate plans.  Although the IRS has reversed its position with respect to
family attribution in Rev.  Rul.  93-12, it has established significant
positions elsewhere to regain any perceived lost ground.  As the battles
continues, the concern is that the IRS might ultimately win the war.  n

LLOYDS BANK MAY SELL OFF MAJOR SHAREHOLDING IN SMH

LLOYDS BANK has refused to comment on reports that it will sell its
majority shareholding in Schroder Munchmeyer Hengst (SMH), the leading
German private bank.

Eberhard Weiershauser, one of the managing partners at SMH, also denies
the reports. He believes the current surge of speculation about a sale
was triggered by the leak of a confidential study from Merrill Lynch,
which last month made an unsolicited presentation to Lloyds Bank
advising on the possible divestment of SMH. "We have to contend with
these rumours every three months," Weiershauser said.

Although it is not the first time Lloyds has apparently considered the
sale of its 75 percent of SMH, on this occasion various circumstances
suggest that the time is right.

According to the Merrill Lynch presentation report, there are a number
of international banks which could be considering the sale of their
German private banking subsidiaries in the short and medium term.

Germany's new regulations on capital adequacy and capital backing for
derivatives business, and in particular the new rules on minimum
volumes for trading business, all place the viability of smaller German
banks in question, Merrill Lynch said.

The additional work and expenditure necessary to tackle these
challenges would induce many banks to seek a strong parent bank to
finance the necessary investments in edp and personnel, or else to
withdraw from certain businesses.

Another dilemma is that some of the exclusive and confidential services
which are the hallmark of German private banks can no longer be
provided under the new legislation. German banks are now obliged, for
instance, to pass on suspicions of insider trading.

But the crucial argument of Merrill Lynch's presentation was that SMH
is better placed than most to tackle these difficulties. SMH is
particularly attractive to potential purchasers, according to Merrill,
because of its above-average financial performance, excellent market
reputation and highly professional management team.

The bank has operated its own international capital markets business
for some years and has the expertise to comply with the new capital and
trading regulations without any real difficulty, Merrill added.

Nevertheless, Lloyds will be aware that several other big banks have
suffered losses and embarrassment from their German private banking
subsidiaries. Barclays' Merck, Finck, lost substantial sums over
several years and humiliated its shareholders by publishing profit
figures for 1993 before having to admit that the bank had made a loss
after all.

Recently it has been rumoured that Grunelius Privatbankiers, the tiny
private bank owned by Deutsche Bank, will also be sold off or even
disbanded. In 1994, Grunelius' assets shrank by nearly 14 percent to
DM206 million ($143 million). Commissions income fell while
administrative expenses rose, culminating in a net loss of DM1.8
million. Managing Director Gerd Schmitz- Morkramer left several months
ago and has not yet been replaced.

But if Lloyds is indeed considering a sale of SMH, which it acquired in
1984, the reasons would probably lie with its own strategy.

It is telling that Lloyds, which has never been a major international
investment house, has always operated SMH at arm's length as a
non-consolidated subsidiary. But Lloyds has recently amended its
strategy and foreign capital markets subsidiaries no longer seem to fit
in at all.

Lloyds is now aiming to focus on the mass market at home and hopes to
become the strongest and most profitable institution in UK retail
banking. The recent merger with the TSB retail bank followed takeovers
of the Cheltenham & Gloucester building society and the insurer Abbey
Life. Rather than retaining SMH which is engaged primarily in upscale
German private banking and capital markets business - Lloyds could sell
and use the proceeds of sale to pursue its new strategic aims.

In the light of Lloyds' new strategy, it is clear that the profitable
shareholding in SMH which could be divested to another large financial
institution without stiffening competition in Lloyds' core UK market.

Traditionally, Lloyds has included in its core business any subsidiary
which generates return on equity of at least 15 percent. SMH achieved
net return on equity of more than 27 percent in 1993, but slipped back
to 3.3 percent the following year as a result of depleted commissions
income. Weiershauser indicated that commissions income had made a
"respectable" showing in 1995, but declined to give details.

However, the sale - if it does happen - may not occur for months.
Lloyds' profits are so good - indeed, the bank is considering a share
buy-back - that it need not accede to the first bidder. If it does
sell, Lloyds can almost certainly afford to wait until an advantageous
price is offered.

NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTIONS

PRIVATE BANKING is one of the most troublesome terms in the financial
services lexicon. Consider the number of definitions.

Ask a mainland European to define the term and, in all probability, a
private bank will be described as a banking institution not owned by
the government. Probe a little harder, especially in Switzerland, and
the respondent may qualify his answer by pointing out that a private
bank tends not to be incorporated, is structured on the partnership
model, and is totally reliant on the partners' resources for bank
capital.

Go to the UK or the US and a more familiar definition will be given.
Private banking is concerned with the provision of banking services for
high net worth individuals. However, as innumerable articles in PBI
have pointed out over the years, this definition is not without its
drawbacks.

The first problem is that no one has yet come up with a definitive
description of "high net worth". To judge from the plethora of "private
banks" coming into existence, the high net worth threshold is falling
by the day. It will surely not be long before the whole of the retail
banking sector will be subsumed by the private banking market.

A second problem is that most of the services provided by "private
banks" are not concerned with banking, i.e. the collection of deposits,
the making of loans and the provision of payment services. Asset
management, tax planning and the establishment and administration of
trusts, inter alia, are the essence of private banking, or more
accurately, of wealth management.

Although the possession of a banking licence can be advantageous in a
number of respects - it facilitates offshore and international "private
banking" as well as providing an aura of greater security - it is not
critical to the business of wealth management.

In fact "private banks" are probably responsible for only a small
proportion of the total stock of wealth owned by "high net worth"
individuals, although it is likely that they dominate the international
and offshore markets.

This poses a considerable dilemma for the editor of PBI. It may be
possible to identify a discrete target market in terms of wealth
management institutions that possess a banking licence. The problem is
that they constitute a small sector of the market within which private
banks compete.

Clearly a way around this impasse is to redefine "private banking".
Henceforth, as far as PBI is concerned, private banking will be defined
as "the provision of financial services and wealth management
facilities for affluent customers".

ONE CONSEQUENCE of this definition is that the scope and content of PBI
will be extended. From time to time previous editors have dabbled with
other institutions active in the wealth management sector such as legal
and accountancy firms, broker dealers and the plethora of institutions
contained within the "independent financial adviser" umbrella. Although
we do not intend to cut back our coverage of institutions active in the
international private banking sector - indeed we intend to expand both
the depth and breadth of our coverage - the "non-bank" private banks or
wealth management institutions will assume a higher profile.

This is at it should be. Last year a study produced by PSI of Tampa
Florida showed conclusively that US banks were losing market share in
the private banking sector to broker-dealers. The losses were not
confined to "middle-income affluent", a market segment which might be
considered particularly vulnerable. Perhaps, more worryingly, they
included the "elite private banking" segment, or clients who had on
average $1.2 million of investible assets and who contributed over
$10,000 in annual revenue.

The dynamism exhibited by non-bank sectors of the wealth management
sector makes it a natural for coverage in PBI. In the US, for example,
the investment companies and broker dealers are having a profound
effect on the evolution of the financial services sector. They have
often been a hothouse of new product developments, many of which can be
usefully taken up by "conventional" private banks.

BOOM IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

BY COINCIDENCE, according to statistics published by the Association of
Solicitor Investment Management (ASIM), it appears that the investment
management activities of UK legal firms are currently booming. Not only
did funds managed by its members double during 1995 but there has been
a substantial increase in the number of firms active in the sector.

It is no surprise to find that the firm with the biggest involvement is
an Edinburgh-based firm, Murray Beith & Murray, which has #180 million
($280 million) under management. Many of the firms currently active in
the Scottish fund management sector can trace their origins to the
legal and accountancy professions. This is especially the case with
Baille Gifford, Scotland's largest specialist fund manager. For the
record it still maintains a partnership structure.

There are two sets of factors responsible for the increased involvement
of solicitors in the wealth management sector. Like retail banks, they
have seen margins on their traditional business areas tumble as a
consequence of new entrants and increased competition. On the other
hand, they already had some of the core capabilities required for
successful involvement in the sector. They appear to be more than
willing to buy in what they lack.

BROKERS POST HIGHER EARNINGS THAN BANKS

IN THE last four years, brokerage houses serving individual investors
have posted consistently higher profits than investment banks,
according to research by the Security Industry Association (SIA) in New
York. The trend marks a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when investment
banks dominated Wall Street earnings by posting profits that were more
than twice those reported by "full-line" brokerage firms catering to
individual investors.

In 1994, which saw a global correction in the bond market, Wall
Street's investment banks were thrown for a loss, while the full-line
brokerages remained firmly in the black. And in 1995, a stockmarket
rally pushed the brokers' earnings some 60 percent over those of
investment banks (see chart).

"The securities industry has been turned upside down," said SIA
research chief Jeffrey Schaefer. In the 1990s, he explained, profits
grew due to three factors: the success of capital raising activities;
the booming business of money management both for institutions and
individuals; and the phenomenal growth of mutual funds. While the first
factor has helped investment banks, full-line brokerage houses have
taken advantage of all three factors, with retail investment services
giving them a strong edge.

"The biggest difference [from the 1980s] has been the role of mutual
funds, which I call the financial intermediary of the 1990s," Schaefer
explained."Long-term mutual funds, which only became attractive to
individuals in fixed-income markets in 1985, have allowed individuals
to participate in the equity and bond markets of the 1990s and still be
able to diversify."

The performance of full-line brokers in 1995 is particularly impressive
given the strong performance of investment banks, due to last year's
merger and acquisition boom and the surging revenues from the issuing
of securities. Investment banks have also benefited from 1995's bond
rally, which has greatly enhanced the value of their large bond
portfolios. Investment banks' fees from underwriting new stocks and
bonds have recently begun contributing from their bottom lines again.

In 1995, full-line brokerage firms have benefited far more from the
year's record stockmarket trading volume and price appreciation.
Excluding new stock issues, market activity has increased the value of
stocks by $2.1 trillion, or 33 percent, to a total of $8.4 trillion.
Last year was one of only three in the past 21 years when stock prices
increased more than 30 percent.

Brokers have also been better positioned to exploit the explosion of
stock mutual funds, which are far more profitable for retail brokerages
than bond funds. In 1995, an astonishing 87 percent of net cash flow
into long-term mutual funds went into equity instruments, according to
the SIA.

FORMER CHASE OFFICIAL NAMED TO HEAD AMEX BANK

IN EARLY January, American Express Bank appointed John Ward, a senior
executive at Chase Manhattan, as its new chairman and chief executive.

Ward served most recently as executive vice president at Chase and
chief executive of Chase Bankcard Services. His resignation from Chase
came two months before the scheduled closing of the bank's merger with
Chemical Banking, which will create the largest US commercial bank. In
the competition to fill the position of the new Chase's chief cards
executive, Ward was edged out by his opposite number at Chemical,
Charles Walsh.

A 27-year veteran at Chase Manhattan, Ward served in the 1970s as the
bank's credit and marketing officer for Japan and then Chase's chief of
trade and export finance in Europe and the Middle East.

In 1987, he was named credit policy officer of Chase's Individual Bank
based in New York, and became president of Chase Personal Financial
Services in 1991.

At Amex Bank, Ward will replace Steven Goldstein, who informed Amex
officials of his desire to resign when discussions concerning a
possible sale of Amex Bank were concluded in October.

American Express had tried to sell its international private bank, an
Edge Act institution chartered only for offshore operations, for $1
billion, or 1.25 times book value. The bank has performed poorly in
recent years, reporting a return on assets of 0.58 percent on assets of
$13.39 billion in 1994.

CREDIT SUISSE TARGETS TREPIDANT GERMANS

CREDIT SUISSE has extended its CS Direct Invest fund broking operations
to Germany, attempting to capture German private investors who are
worried about the implications of the European single currency and who
mistrust client confidentiality at German banks while at the same time
avoiding charges of aiding and abetting tax evasion.

Romeo Lacher, project manager at Credit Suisse in Zurich, said CS
Direct Invest is not competing on price, but will attempt to beat the
competition with superior customer advice, a 24-hour telephone service
and a twice-yearly personalised newsletter. He hopes to attract between
30,000 and 40,000 customers within four to five years.

This is the first time that German retail investors have been offered
Swiss investment products by direct marketing routes. The marketing
campaign has begun with large full-colour advertisements in the German
business press, and, from next month, will branch out into direct mail
aimed at high-income private investors - particularly those deemed to
have an interest in Switzerland as vacationers or owners of holiday
homes.

In most markets, an advertising campaign of this kind would be
unremarkable. But in Germany, Credit Suisse's advertisements are
reminiscent of the mood three years ago, when the German banks made
frenzied appeals to investors to avoid tax by transferring their
savings to accounts in Luxembourg. Some banks, particularly Dresdner
Bank, are still being "punished" for this, with regular police raids
and confiscation of confidential client records in branches suspected
of assisting tax evaders.

Lacher is resigned to criticism from competitor banks and the German
authorities. But he points out that the Credit Suisse advertisements
avoid the innuendo employed by some German banks during the Luxembourg
campaigns. Indeed, Lacher is playing so safe at present that the
current campaign does not even stress the advantages of the Swiss franc
as a reserve currency. However, the next set of ads may do, he said.

Moreover potential tax evaders will not be given any new opportunities
by CS Direct Invest. In fact, since the transfers will not be made in
person (often the case with Luxembourg accounts in 1993) investors have
less chance to evade tax.

Investments in the funds from German clients are transferred first to
Credit Suisse's Frankfurt offices, and then en masse to Switzerland.
Foreign money transfers of more than DM2,000 ($1,400) must be
registered with the local branch of the Bundesbank, and the names of
each investor must be supplied on request. "These transfers leave
footprints in Germany," Lacher said.

Customers have an incentive to use this automated route because Credit
Suisse waives the usual bank fees for foreign payment transfers.

Nevertheless, Lacher concedes that "the border region is a problem".
Germans living near Zurich, Basel or Schaffhausen prefer to drive into
Switzerland with cash in a briefcase and deposit it in a Swiss custody
account. By that means, they can escape the attention of the
Bundesbank, and, possibly, the German tax authorities too.

CS Direct Invest was launched in Switzerland last May and has attracted
25,000 enquiries. The bank declines to say how many have so far become
CS customers.

GRIEG MIDDLETON SUES DEFECTORS

GRIEG MIDDLETON, which claims to be the UK's largest private client
stockbroker, has issued writs claiming breach of contract by nine
ex-directors of Allied Provincial, another private client brokerage
company it acquired in 1995.

Following completion of the deal, 47 Allied Provincial staff located in
the company's Birmingham and Glasgow offices attempted to defect to
rival broker Brewin Dolphin (see PBI 88).

Grieg Middleton allowed 38 of the former Allied Provincial staff to
leave, but insisted that the nine most senior adhered strictly to the
terms of their contracts, which required the executives to serve a
six-month or 12-month notice period. Last month, however, the nine told
Grieg Middleton that they intended to start work at Brewin Dolphin.

ALBERT SHARP TAKEOVER FORMS POWERFUL NEW UK STOCKBROKER

ALBERT E SHARP, an independent stockbroker based in Birmingham, has
purchased the private client stockbroking business of Brown Shipley
from Guinness Peat Group for #7.4 million. This will create one of the
UK's largest independent firm of stockbrokers.

"The ambitions of both companies in the private client service market
are identical," said Trevor Cooke, Brown Shipley Stockbroking's chief
executive.

"Comprehensive investment services of the highest quality delivered
efficiently and with the greatest level of security are what private
clients need. Together Brown Shipley and Albert E Sharp will be able to
meet the challenges presented to our clients by an international
marketplace driven increasingly by high technology. The personal
service traditions inherent in both companies, which combine investment
skills and systems capabilities, will create a major new force in the
UK stockbroking industry."

Brown Shipley Stockbroking has 14 offices spread thoughout the UK. It
currently manages around #2 billion ($3 billion) of funds, mainly for
private investors, mostly on an advisory basis. It also has an
institutional presence in Scotland.

In 1994 the brokerage made pre-tax profits of #532,000. Profits are
expected to be down in 1995 as a result of falling stockmarket volumes.

Albert E Sharp has offices in Birmingham, Bristol, London and
Manchester. It manages #2 billion for private investors, pension funds
and charities, half of which is managed on a discretionary basis. It
also has around #115 million in its own family of proprietory unit
trusts (mutual funds).

Guinness Peat Group, which encapsulates a number of subsidiaries
involved in banking and asset management, describes itself as"a
strategic investment business". It is better known as the investment
vehicle of Sir Ron Brierley, a New Zealand entrepreneur.

Brown Shipley Stockbrokers has turned out to be a very good investment.
The company was acquired by Guinness Peat in 1993 for #5.6 million. It
then sold off Brown Shipley's unit trust and asset management
businesses for #2.7 million. The sale to Albert E Sharp of the
remaining businesses will result in near doubling of its investment.

QUILTER GOODISON TO MERGE WITH FOSTER & BRAITHWAITE

THE COMBINED effects of competition and new technology have resulted in
yet another merger in the UK private stockbroking sector. Quilter
Goodison, the private client stockbroker owned by Commercial Union
(CU), a leading UK composite insurer, is to merge with Foster &
Braithwaite, a stockbroking subsidiary of Credit Commercial de France
(CCF).

The combined company will be called Quilter & Co. CU will own around 75
percent of Quilter's shares, and CCF the remainder. John Vincent, who
is currently Foster & Braithwaite's managing director, will head the
new business.

The merger reflects recent changes within the UK stockbroking and
investment management sector. With the arrival of the Crest settlement
system later this year, the UK stockbroking sector is likely to
experience further segmentation.

The execution of stockmarket trades is likely to become a commodity
business usurped by discount brokers and banks.

RBC PROVES POPULAR CHOICE WITH EXECUTIVES

EXECUTIVE PLUS, a private banking product offered by Royal Bank of
Canada, has proved to be a popular choice for globetrotting business
executives. Offering an instant access deposit account with tiered
interest rates, the product offered by RBC's Jersey-based Global
Private Banking Unit (GPB) has attracted new deposits in excess of #10
million ($6.5 million) since it was relaunched in August of last year.

Executive Plus, which commenced four years ago, embodies a number of
enhancements. "A number of improvements were made," says Chris Blampied
of RBC (Jersey). "American Express and Visa Gold Cards are now
available to account holders. We also expanded our range of currencies
to include the Canadian dollar, American dollar and sterling." Designed
for the global and wealthy executive, a wide range of banking services
is available to clients maintaining a minimum balance of #10,000 in
funds. The improved product was relaunched in August of this year.

"Executive Plus is targeted at high valued clients with income and
assets above the retail thresholds," explained GPBs Chris Blampied.
"The client base is very international, ranging from the Middle East
and the US, as well as from the UK. We attract many existing clients.
Since the re-launch we have experienced an awful lot of growth from
within the network. We have seen a number of French clients going into
the product. However, we cannot discern a definite trend.

"We have in excess of $21 million in Executive Plus, with an average
balance of #70,000 per customer. Due to our success we have recently
opened an office in the Isle of Man and are planning another in
Guernsey."

Royal Bank of Canada, is one of North America's largest banks, with
C$405 billion ($300 billion) in assets under administration. Royal Bank
of Canada Global Private Banking, a Jersey-based operation, offers
private banking and investment services to customers in more than 130
countries. GPB currently has C$29 billion in assets under
administration.

Looking ahead into 1996, Blampied is buoyant."Between Jersey and the
Isle of Man, the two offices providing Executive Plus, our objective is
to obtain #50 million in deposits by the end of the year."

MONTANA EVALUATES SECRET BANKING FACILITY

A SANTA BARBARA entrepreneur has proposed the establishment of a
Swiss-style secret banking unit in the state of Montana. The proposal,
which has attracted the anxious attentions of federal banking and tax
authorities, is now being actively studied by Montana regulators.

While the proposal appears far-fetched at first sight, Montana
authorities said it could lead to the establishment of an innovative
offshore deposit facility in the mountain state.

In late 1995, Robert Svoboda, a former banker and Montana resident now
living in Santa Barbara, asked Montana regulators to commission a
feasibility study to investigate the possibility of establishing a
Swiss-style secret banking facility in the state. Such a bank would be
state-chartered, and would not benefit from federal deposit insurance
and the federal regulation that goes along with it.

The unit would provide highly confidential deposit services to
foreigners through the use of numbered accounts. Svoboda's most
aggressive scenario would allow non-resident aliens to deposit funds in
a Montana bank, which could then put the funds in trusts that could
deposit the money in non-taxable investments or transfer them to other
banks and countries. Depending on clients' investment and deposit
needs, the bank could provide varying "levels of privacy."

"This isn't for money-laundering or helping people to keep from paying
taxes," Svoboda told American Banker in December. "It's a safe haven
for money, and it's private."

According to state authorities, Svoboda described his initial
motivation as "philanthropic" - secret banking facilities could provide
his former home state with significant revenue in state-levied fees on
assets and possibly escheatment revenues, where funds in secret
accounts might revert to the state treasury if they are not claimed by
heirs of deceased depositors.

Such an institution might also benefit from Montana's relatively
unregulated financial environment and the Montana state constitution's
unusual privacy provisions.

Responding to Svoboda's proposal, Montana's legislature formed an
interim committee late last year to study the idea. The committee has
met four times and will meet next in late January, when it will hear
presentations from federal authorities, including representatives of
the Internal Revenue Service, the Department of the Treasury and the
Federal Reserve Bank.

"No precedent exists for this anywhere in the country," said Chris
Olson, Montana's deputy banking commissioner, who freely admits that
state banking authorities currently lack the legal and regulatory
background to evaluate such a novel plan. Outside the state, banking
experts have greeted the Svoboda proposal with incredulity or derisive
laughter.

"The people who haven't laughed are the Feds," said Steven Maly, a
legislative aide who is co-ordinating the state legislature's interim
research effort. "Knowing that we do a lot of fishing up here, the Feds
have warned us that we would be bottom-fishing attracting the worst
criminal element - with this sort of activity."

Maly said he was surprised by the level of concern expressed by federal
authorities. "Without saying as much, they seemed to be telling us,
`This could happen, and we're not going to help you do it.'"

Disregarding the wrath of the Feds, Maly believes a Montana secret
banking facility is simply not practical, given existing US law and
regulation. For example, he sees no way to circumvent the federal
requirement that all deposits in excess of $10,000 must be reported to
the US Treasury Department.

But Maly is evaluating the possibility of minimizing federal
supervision of a state-chartered depository for offshore funds which
have no tax liability and which waive the requirements for federal
deposit insurance.

A state-chartered foreign funds depository might provide offshore
clients a higher degree of privacy than other US banks, and it might
provide some non-taxable investment services as well. In particular, a
significant level of federal oversight could be avoided where funds are
deposited but not transferred out of the depository.

"We're thinking about something that is much simpler and more primitive
than a secret banking facility," Maly explained."We're not planning to
compete with existing offshore facilities. Instead, we're looking at
creating a new and different way of attracting legitimate flight
capital. One angle we're looking at is tying deposits to precious
metals, especially platinum, which is produced in Montana."

The cost advantages of in-state production and storage of precious
metals, coupled with new financial technology and reduced regulation,
could create a commercial opportunity to establish a new kind of
offshore depository in Montana, Maly said.

He believes that such a facility might be attractive to rich families
in Taiwan, for example, who are looking for secure and relatively
secret international deposit facilities, and who already hold a
significant amount of their wealth in precious metals.

BARRIERS TO INTERSTATE BANKING REMOVED

IN LATE December, the US Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
issued an interpretive letter designed to lower the barriers to
interstate trust banking. The OCC's letter comes more than a year after
Congress passed the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching
Efficiency Act, which ushered in a new era for national banking in the
US.

The OCC's action aims to "level the playing field" for US banks wishing
to extend their trust business to states where they have no trust
charters. According to the OCC, trust banks can now ignore state laws
requiring them to have operations based in those states. Moreover,
national banks need not apply for special permits if state-chartered
banks are exempt from them.

Banks have long complained that state regulatory requirements, which
generally stipulate that trust departments must have in-state
headquarters to obtain special exemptions, have contributed to
inefficiency by preventing consolidations. However, the OCC's ruling is
likely to face resistance from state regulators uncomfortable with
further intrusions from federal banking authorities.

The OCC's letter came in response to an inquiry from Midwest
super-regional Banc One, which is eager to centralise its 11-state
trust business under a single national banking charter.

US TRUST UNITS FACE NEW FEDERAL REGULATION

FEDERAL REGULATORS have completed a new rule which will require trust
departments of large US institutions to disclose new profitability
information for 1997.

According to the new regulation, trust departments must report salaries
and employee benefits, as well as other direct expenses such as the
cost of equipment. Trust departments must also report instances where
surcharges or the cost of settling customer disputes have caused an
account to lose more than $100,000.

Up until now, trust departments have reported only the size of
discretionary and non-discretionary assets by account type. The new
rule applies to 2,819 trust departments that manage more than $100
million in assets. These units control 99 percent of the over $11
trillion held in trust at US financial institutions.

The new regulation was drafted by the Federal Financial Institutions
Examinations Council, an inter-agency group of federal regulators that
supervises federally insured depository institutions.

The rule will permit examiners to produce uniform measurements of the
performance and risk management policies of trust departments, and to
get a fuller picture of their solvency and profitability.

Regulators have called for new scrutiny of the US trust industry, as
the gathering and managing of trust assets has gained momentum in
recent years. In the five years ending in 1993, US trust assets grew 61
percent to $10.6 trillion.

The American Bankers Association in Washington has protested against
the new regulation as a violation of confidentiality. Bankers are
concerned that the information may be used to gauge the profitability
of competitors, and that such information may become public as the
result of litigation, as happened recently in a suit filed against the
derivatives activity of Bankers Trust.

Regulators at the Federal Reserve Bank have responded that the
profitability information it collects on trust departments will remain
confidential, although the central bank will release composite
profitability data which will be of use to the industry.

Bankers have responded that little benefit will come from such data, as
profitability benchmarking services are already offered by private
consultants. The Financial Services Association of Niles, Michigan, for
example, currently sells a service called Trust Compare, which allows
trust departments to benchmark their profitability against that of
other institutions using the service.

SPAIN:  SPANISH BANK ENDS ALLIANCE

THE JOINT private banking venture launched last year by Banco Popular
and Bankers Trust (see PBI 76) has proved short-lived. Banco Popular
recently ended the collaboration agreement on the grounds that there
was too much competition between the two institutions.

"After six months in operation we came to the conclusion that for a
bank such as ours, well positioned in the domestic market and with a
substantial branch network there were few advantages to be gained from
such an agreement. We realised that basically all we were doing was
presenting our clients to Bankers Trust. As a result, we decided to end
the agreement," Fernando de Soto of Banco Popular told PBI.

Last year Banco Popular chose to develop its private banking services
in close collaboration with Bankers Trust, as a means of giving an
international dimension to its existing service and product offer. Each
bank opened its own specialised private banking branch in Madrid.

Bankers Trust was to be responsible for managing client assets but each
bank had separate relationship managers and was responsible for
marketing its services. For Bankers Trust, whose presence in Spain has
been mainly geared towards foreign customers, the agreement with Banco
Popular was seen as a means of drawing closer to the domestic market.

Banco Popular is adamant that competition was the only motive for
ending the relationship, but with its reputation for tight risk control
and prudent investment practices, Banco Popular can hardly have been
pleased by Bankers Trust's loss of prestige.

The US bank's reputation has taken a severe battering over the last 18
months as a consequence of its derivative-related activities and the
lawsuits brought against it by disgruntled clients such as Proctor &
Gamble.

In the meantime, Banco Popular will continue to deal with its high net
worth clients through the branch network."This system worked very well
in the past and there is no reason why it shouldn't continue to do so,"
said de Soto.

RBOS JERSEY TARGETS EXPATRIATES

EXPATRIATES ARE the main beneficiaries of the worlds first offshore
telephone banking service. Launched by Jersey-based Royal Bank of
Scotland International, the new service, is accessible on a 24-hour
basis, offering clients full banking facilities with comprehensive
security measures and the highest degree of confidentiality.

The banks Premium Account will be available to customers who deposit a
minimum of #2,000. It can be opened in a variety of currencies.
Customers can transfer money between different RBSI accounts, set up or
make changes to standing orders or direct debits, pay bills and deal in
currencies and shares. "It makes sense for customers living overseas,
in whatever time zone, to be able to make personal contact with their
bank whenever it is convenient for them", says Peter Sherriffs director
of the Offshore Banking Division.

So far, the new service has attracted considerable interest, especially
from expatriates in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, the bank reports. Further
interest has come from as far afield as Australia, Singapore and Hong
Kong, from expatriates and overseas nationals, as well as residents
with second homes outside the UK. Among European clients, Scandinavians
showed a particular interest in the new service.

FINDING THE MOST FAVOURABLE TAX REGIME

A study published by the Adam Smith Institute, a UK-based think-tank
shows a surprisingly wide disparity in tax burdens between members of
the OECD. Ian Orton reports

JAPAN, AUSTRALIA and the US are the best countries for tax-averse
individuals to be domiciled. According to Tax Freedom Day 1996, a
report which attempts to compute the number of days an individual has
to "work" for the government, these three countries demand far less
from their citizens than other OECD members, especially constituents of
the European Union.

In 1994 a Japanese worker had, on average to work only 119 days - or
until April 29 to pay off his or her tax bill (see chart). Australian
workers had to work a day longer. It took US workers another six days
to work off their annual tax load.

Onerous as these requirements were, however, they were much lower than
those faced by Europeans, especially members of the European Union. Tax
Freedom Day would have arrived in the European Union on June 14, or
after 165 days, compared with June 7 or 158 days for the OECD.

Some European countries fared relatively well. In Portugal a worker
would "only" have had to work for 132 days or until May 11 to meet his
or her tax obligations. In the UK the equivalent date was May 17 or 138
days.

Conversely, however, Scandinavian workers would have had to work well
into the second half of the year to clear their tax obligations.
Norwegians and Finns would have had to work for 185 days, Danes 200 and
Swedes 208 - or until July 27 - to achieve tax freedom.

As always, with any international comparison, there are considerable
methodological problems and, as a consequence, the tax freedom days
calculated for each country are not necessarily a"true" reflection of
the time needed to work-off the annual tax obligation.

To some extent they reflect the methodology used by Gabriel Stein, the
report's author. As such, the figures give only a rough approximation
of where Tax Freedom Day might occur in each country.

For each country shown in the chart, total tax revenue as a percentage
of GDP at market prices has been compared to the equivalent UK figures.
The difference between the two figures has then been translated into
days of the year, and this has then been added to - or subtracted from
- the British Tax Freedom Day.

In 1996, the average UK employee will have to work 142 days, that is
until Tuesday May 21 to pay off his or her tax bill, the same number of
days as last year. The 2p reduction in the standard rate of income tax
announced in the November budget has been offset by increases in other
areas, such as excise duties on tobacco and petrol.

Nonetheless, the situation is still an improvement on the 1970s and
early-1980s when the tax burden was much higher. The 1980s and early-
1990s saw a continuous fall in the tax burden with Tax Freedom Day
moving earlier and earlier from June 6 in 1982 to May 17 in 1993. It
then shot back five days in 1995 and shows little sign of reverting to
the 1980s trend.

The situation would be even worse if government borrowing was taken
into account, however. Stein argues that this should be added to the
total burden of taxation, since it eventually has to be paid for by
future taxpayers. This would mean that the UK taxpayer would not be
free of both burdens until Monday June 3. Nonetheless, as a result of a
fall in government borrowing, this would be an improvement on the
situation in 1993 when the relevant day was June 13.

For much of the European Union, where many countries have much heavier
debt burdens than the UK, the situation would have been even worse.

As tax burdens rise, as governments attempt to conform with the
Maastricht criteria before 1999, this should mean that there should be
substantial opportunities for private bankers, especially those which
place emphasis on tax-planning.

LOOKING AHEAD TO A PROMISING FUTURE

Following a turbulent period of restructuring in the 1970s, Trinkaus &
Burkhardt's management is confident, that their integration into the
HSBC Group will ensure a rosy future. Ulrich Sutter talked to Dr
Sieghardt Rometsch

THE PAST year produced outstanding results for Trinkaus & Burkhardt,
one of Germany's oldest private banks. Net profits increased by 24.9
percent to DM92.9 million ($64 million), an all-time high.

Interest income leaped to DM177.7 million, an increase of 23,7 percent
on the previous year, while commission income was marginally down by
3.4 percent at DM160.6 million. Since flotation in 1985, Trinkaus has
seen its total asset base jump by more than 260 percent.

Operating from their Dusseldorf headquarters overlooking the
prestigious Konigsallee, Trinkaus has experienced its fair share of ups
and downs especially during the 1970s and early 1980s, admits Dr
Sieghardt Rometsch, a partner responsible for corporate banking.

"The bank was caught up in the aftermath of the Herstatt banking
collapse. Despite performing well, we were forced to look for outside
help to rebuild our capital base, and this resulted in Citibank
acquiring a controlling stake. This produced a change of strategy and
we abandoned retail banking," said Rometsch.

"The Citibank connection was relatively short-lived, and in 1980 the
bank was acquired by Midland Bank. Our fortunes changed rapidly,
largely as a result of Midland Bank's decision to give us a large
degree of autonomy. It surely was paramount to the success we have
achieved so far", he said with pride. "Reducing Midland's shareholding
from 90 percent to 70 percent subsequently helped strengthen our
position with our customers as an independent private bank."

A former general manager with Chase Manhattan Bank, Rometsch argues
that most foreign banks have failed to be profitable in the German
market, as a consequence of adopting relatively short-term strategies.

"The exception, of course, is Citibank which has successfully
established itself in the retail banking sector. The vast majority of
banks, however, do not understand that private banking is predicated on
relationships and has to grow organically. It will sometimes take years
for a relationship to create the trust necessary to sustain profitable
business. Once we have crossed this line, they accept us as partners.
Only then will the typical private banking client entrust larger sums
to us."

Rometsch is also critical of many foreign banks management systems.
"These often reduce the individual's creativity and his overall
performance. Matrix management is still very common especially with US
banks. From my own experience, I have found this style a handicap to
the successful private banker."

Since Trinkaus & Burkhardt abandoned retail banking to concentrate on
asset management, securities and corporate banking, its performance has
improved significantly. The bank now has some DM35 billion of assets
under management of which DM18 billion comes from private banking
clients.

Contrary to the industry trend, which has resulted in a reduction of
minimum thresholds, private banking clients must have at least DM1
billion in free assets of which they must place DM250,000 with
Trinkaus.

"As soon as profit margins were being squeezed, we decided to set
rigorous benchmarks, to avoid getting involved in price competition. We
analysed our markets and came to the conclusion that we had a franchise
in the regional Mittelstand market, especially in companies with a
minimum turnover of between DM100 million-DM200 million. I think you
need a certain minimum size to be able to stay in the business and to
deliver good performance."

"A typical account manager at Trinkaus will look after between 40-60
clients. Training has been made a priority since the mid-1980s. Our
staff spend an annual average of 60-90 hours on in-house training.

"As a small private bank we are fully aware that we must be available
for our clients from 9 am to 5 pm. So our approach is somewhat
different from other institutions. We just don't think it is
justifiable to send them on seminars in training centres. After all,
our clients should expect excellent performance and this means that we
should be working all the time".

International expansion has so far been on a modest scale. Besides five
domestic offices, representative offices were set up in Luxembourg and
Zurich in the late-1970s. Overall, business expansion has largely
concentrated on the affluent region of North Rhine Westphalia.

"The Mittelstand is our main business focus", explains Rometsch.
"Although they have always been very export-oriented, they simply have
not achieved much penetration in Far Eastern markets, although we hope
this may change.

"The Hong Kong of German industry is eastern Europe. They are more
comfortable with the distance and culture and a majority speak the
German language. Today our natural market also includes Luxembourg and
parts of the Netherlands, where we are experiencing good results. When
HSBC decided to close their Luxembourg banking activities it was only
natural for Trinkaus to look after their clients. Through this
connection we maintain an Asian client base".

The integration process within the HSBC Group has been smooth. "Our
link with HSBC is a strong selling argument", he claims. "We have
introduced a substantial number of clients to HSBC. Nevertheless, we
have to be aware, that operating as a private bank within a group
network requires enormous sensitivity on our part. It is almost like a
walk on a razor blade - as independent private bank operating within
the network of one of the world's largest banks."

European expansion plans, however, are far off the agenda at Trinkaus.
"We have no plans to become a global player in the private banking
market. We are a truly German private bank with strong roots in the
Mittelstand. This is our strength on which we have built our expertise
over centuries".

Rometsch concluded: "If clients within the HSBC Group need advice on DM
products, they certainly find them at Trinkaus & Burkhardt."

BACK TO THE FUTURE?

Midland Bank, a UK subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation (HSBC), established a domestic private bank in 1993 which
eschewed much of the conventional wisdom associated with the sector.
Ian Orton spoke to Peter Renn, its first managing director, about the
philosophy behind the initiative and the progress achieved to date

OF ALL the new domestic private banks established by the large UK
financial institutions during the 1990s Midland Private Banking has
undoubtedly attracted the most interest, not least because of its
decision to use staff drawn from the commercial bank.

Purists could argue that Midland's initiative is yet another instance
of the private banking moniker being devalued. For Peter Renn, however,
the establishment of Midland's private bank, is a natural consequence
of the changes affecting the UK banking sector generally.

"The UK retail banking sector has experienced rapid change over the
last ten years. This is particularly the case as far as service
provision has been concerned. New technology is making it easier to
service retail customers through remote media. There are far fewer
branches. However, there is still a demand for personal service,
especially from the more affluent segment of the customer base. Hence
the decision to establish the domestic private bank."

According to Renn, in some respects the establishment of domestic
private banks by the large UK banks is a throwback to an earlier era.
The UK banks only became mass market institutions during the 1960s.
Before then their customer base had an element of exclusivity. In this
environment it was possible to provide a relatively high level of
personal service, albeit in a much more narrowly defined market.

Thirty years on, the new private banks are attempting to re-establish
an aura of exclusivity and personal service - and generate high quality
fee and commission income as a consequence.

"It is also a natural consequence to an increasingly competitive
environment. Product differentiation and market segmentation are
logical responses to increased competition," said Renn.

The HSBC UK strategy

The domestic private bank was an outcome of a global review of its
interests in this sector conducted by HSBC following its acquisition of
Midland in 1992.

At that time, Midland had two operations which catered for the
financial services requirements of the affluent. Samuel Montagu catered
for very high net worth individuals. Midland Personal Asset Management
catered for the needs of private clients with more modest means.

The review resulted in the pooling together of the group's
international private banking operations under the umbrella of HSBC.
Each of the component banks would retain or operate with its own name
in order to capitalise on existing reputations and ensure that staff
and relationships were country-focused rather than legal
entity-focused.

This meant that in the UK Samuel Montagu and the British Bank of the
Middle East would continue to cater for the financial elite from a
joint office in Hill Street, London. It was also decided to establish a
domestic private bank based on Midland Personal Asset Management.

"It was a natural outcome. The Personal Asset Management business had a
number of private banking elements such as a brokerage, fund management
and trusts. What it didn't have were the human resources or the brand
recognition to communicate a quality service image. The establishment
of a private bank provided an opportunity for these attributes to be
provided," said Renn.

The importance of personal service

The provision of a high level of service was perceived from the outset
as the key to enabling Midland to differentiate itself from other
institutions.

"There is no shortage of definitions of private banking or, for that
matter, private banks. I think the term private banking should really
be used to describe the market rather than the nature of the products
or services provided. Private banks can trace their origin to a number
of sources - legal and accounting firms, fund managers, stockbrokers,
even commercial banks.

"Although each institution will attempt to follow a different strategy
there is often one basic similarity between them - they will tend to
emphasise one particular product. This will often reflect their
origins. Private banks which evolved out of legal or accounting
partnerships will emphasise their trust and tax planning capabilities,
asset management specialists their fund management skills and so on. In
other words, the nature of the service will be product-orientated.

"At Midland we had to decide whether to go down a similar route and, if
so, what type of products we should offer. After conducting a lot of
research we decided to go down a different route by making the
provision of high quality service the keystone of our strategy".

Customer preferences

Midland's research suggested that prospective clients were looking for
advice and an ongoing relationship from a private bank. "There is a
definite gap in the market as far as the provision of advice is
concerned. Although people are becoming more affluent there is no
shortage of financial worries. There is less certainty of unbroken
unemployment. People are living longer. Meanwhile, the government is
reducing health and welfare provision. No matter how affluent they may
be now, people are being forced to address long-term financial planning
issues and they need advice."

The research also showed that potential clients were not particularly
interested in being sold a plethora of banking or investment products.
Nonetheless, they were appreciative of a broad range of product
offerings drawn from a variety of suppliers.

They were also looking for specific - or rather seamless solutions to
their financial problems. It was clear from the outset that "packaged"
solutions would not generate much enthusiasm.

The emphasis placed on advice and the preference for a "bespoke"
private banking service was critical in a number of respects. Despite
the fact that an organisation the size of HSBC is in a position to
provide from its own resources all of the products and services
traditionally associated with private banking, it was felt that the
private bank should function as an independent intermediary. It would
therefore have the freedom to buy in - on the client's behalf - any
relevant product or service.

Second, given the nature of the "product" offered, considerable
emphasis was placed on the ability of relationship managers to provide
service of a quality that would satisfy prospective clients.
Relationship managers in this environment have to encapsulate a number
of skills and functions and must develop an almost encyclopedic
knowledge of the banking and financial services sector. They also have
to be readily accessible.

Staffing the private bank

Midland decided to staff the bank with people drawn from the commercial
bank supplemented, where necessary, by outside recruits. These were
often drawn from the IFA sector. Although this decision has been
greeted with some surprise by outside commentators - not to mention
competitors - Renn is unrepentant about the efficacy of the approach.

"The first point to make is that in the current UK regulatory
environment it is virtually impossible for unqualified personnel to be
let loose in the private banking market. All of our people were
rigorously trained and are in receipt of one of the qualifications
recognised by the Personal Investment Authority.

"We also used very stringent selection criteria to identify potential
relationship managers. We understood quite clearly that wealthy
customers will only deal with experienced people with the authority to
take decisions and act on them."

The commercial bank was in a position to meet this requirement. "A bit
of grey hair does you no harm in this particular environment. At
Midland, we had quite a large pool of very experienced bankers to draw
on. Many of the bank's more senior personnel could look back on 20 or
25 years of banking experience. We were very keen to encourage these
people to come and work for us."

It was also decided from the outset to provide the bank with a local
focus. "We thought it was of critical importance to ensure that our
people were locally based - not located in a remote City office. You
can't develop significant relationships if the customer has to travel
to London every time he, or she, wants to see a private banker."

There are over 30 Midland Private Banking branches located throughout
England and Wales. They share a common location with the commercial
bank branches.

Tied versus IFA status

Midland's strategy meant that the new private bank's "natural"
competitors would be the IFA sector. "These are the institutions which
most closely match what Midland are trying to do.

"The decision to go down the IFA route or to concentrate on selling
Midland or HSBC products was a tough one to make. We rejected the tied
option. We knew that customers might feel compromised by being offered
only Midland or HSBC-branded products. Their options are limited.

"We also decided to stay clear of packaged products and services.
First, a package will not necessarily address the specific customer
requirements. Second, customers may feel that they are having to pay
for something they do not really need. A `bespoke' approach is much
more efficacious. It is cost effective - customers only pay for what
they need - and it is much more flexible. It doesn't cost much more to
select and manage a customised portfolio of stocks and shares than unit
trusts, for example."

Pricing was something that Midland Private Banking was conscious of
from the outset. "Although the customer base was comfortably off, we
were conscious of the fact that, in many instances their money had been
hard earned. They did not expect to be ripped off."

Positional advantages

Renn maintains that the bank had two important positional advantages
over the IFA sector, however. The first was that it had a
well-recognised brand name. The second was that it could rely on the
commercial bank for potential customers.

"On the whole, IFAs do a very good job in the financial planning and
wealth management market. Nonetheless clients are sometimes put off by
a relative lack of security. There have been a number of
well-publicised cases involving IFAs where probity - and the security
of the client's assets - has been severely compromised.

"Clients do run a notional risk assessment of institutions. One of the
perceived strengths of the Midland Bank name is that we are a large,
safe and well-run institution. Size is important in this market as, I
think, the aftermath of the Barings crash showed."

The bulk of the private bank's customers have been generated by
internal referrals. The customer threshold is income or free assets of
#100,000, although this is more a guideline figure rather than a strict
eligibility criterion. "Midland Private Banking targets the
`comfortably off' portion of the market rather than the very affluent".

Renn admits that a customer recruitment strategy which relied very
heavily on referrals from the commercial bank could have been
problematic. This is especially the case in the new sales culture which
is permeating retail banks. A customer lost to the private bank may
mean the loss of potential sales revenue for the retail bank.

"There is always scope for a potential conflict of interest unless you
make sure you have the right organisational structure in place. We were
helped by the fact that local private bank branches were structured as
part of the General Manager's department. As such, a referral amounted
to an internal transfer within a single arena, not a transfer from one
department to another. We were also fortunate in that when the bank was
being set up, the Midland branch network was in the process of
upheaval. Very senior bankers were being put back into the branches and
this probably eased the transition."

In practice, the strategy has worked well with the commercial bank
generating a substantial proportion of Midland Private Banking's
customer base. "In most cases, we have had an almost seamless transfer
of an old relationship". During the first half of 1995, for example,
the retail branch network generated 3,500 customers.

The future

Renn maintains that the future for the UK private banking sector is
very good. The market is opening up and many of the old cliches are no
longer relevant. There is a lot of "new money" about. Senior company
executives, entrepreneurs, media people, athletes - even lottery
winners are domestic private banks' natural constituency. Midland
Private Bankers is well placed to take advantage.

UNITED STATES:  AT&T CUTS APR TO DRUM UP BUSINESS

AT&T UNIVERSAL Card has cut the APR from 18.15 percent to 13.9 percent
for a selected swathe of its customer base in an effort to transform
convenience users into borrowers - at least during the holiday season
and in time to affect the 1996 bottom line.

"We have a significant number of transactors who have the potential to
become revolvers," said Robbie Kolakowski, vice-president of portfolio
marketing for AT&T Universal, based in Jacksonville, Florida. "We want
to become the card of choice in our cardholders' wallets."

The move comes at an especially important time for AT&T, both
corporately and in the card unit itself. AT&T Universal suffered a
charge-off rate of 6 percent, adding up to a $39 million loss, during
the third quarter of 1996. It was largely in anticipation of this
disappointing result that unit president David Hunt resigned late last
summer (see Cards International 163).

More recently, and on the heels of Universal Card's disappointing third
quarter, AT&T chairman Robert Allen named John Walter president, chief
operating officer and chief executive of the telecommunications giant.
The appointment prompted renewed industry speculation that AT&T will
seek to spin off or simply sell the Universal Card portfolio.

"It is certainly not going to surprise anyone if it does go on the
block," said an industry observer. As for the rate cut itself, few
think other issuers will respond.

"It has that sort of scent to it; a desperation move," said Bruce
Brittain, president of Brittain Associates, an Atlanta-based market
research firm. "It has just not been terribly successful in getting
revolvers."

According to Brittain, the industry average for revolving a balance
from one month to another is 60 percent, while on the AT&T card it is
39 percent. "And it was 39 percent in the third quarter of last year,
so it hasn't seen any improvement," he added.

"It is true that we have a large share of transactors," Kolakowski
said, "but we can rely on our AT&T relationship to make that a
profitable relationship." Speaking of the rate cut, she said, "We do
expect it to have a positive effect in 1996."

Kolakowski expected more aggressive marketing from AT&T Universal in
the near term, and described the card unit's strategy as twofold.

"We are aggressively pursuing strategies to control our losses, and all
our marketing programmes are going to concentrate on getting a greater
share of cardholders' wallets." Controlling losses, she said, would be
mainly a matter of tightening credit standards: "We have sliced
acquisitions in 1996."

While AT&T Universal is the world's third largest card issuer in number
of cards in circulation, behind Dean Witter, Discover and Citicorp with
24 cards and 18 million accounts respectively, it is seventh in
receivables.

UNITED KINGDOM:  RETAILER MOVES INTO BANKING

UK SUPERMARKET group Sainsbury has announced it plans to set up a bank.
Sainsbury's Bank will be 55 percent owned by the UK's second-largest
retailer and 45 percent owned by the Bank of Scotland.

The move into financial services by the retailer will be led by the
issuance of credit cards in early 1997. "The first phase will see the
launch of both classic and gold Visa cards, as well as attractive
additional account and card-based services providing broad customer
appeal," Sainsbury said in a statement.

The new 24-hour banking operation will be telephone-based and will
operate out of the Bank of Scotland's call centre in Edinburgh,
alongside the Scottish bank's own Banking Direct service, rather than
as part of it.

"We have the necessary infrastructure in place, but the products
offered will differ. They will be genuine Sainsbury products," said Ian
Fiddes, the bank's director of marketing services.

Sainsbury said it would be the first supermarket retailer to enter the
consumer banking market. The only other UK retailer to possess such a
licence is Marks & Spencer, which launched its charge card back in
1987.

The move has wrong-footed its main rival, Tesco, which, until
Sainsbury's announcement on October 25, had led moves by UK supermarket
groups into the financial services market.

Tesco launched its own budget account in June, offering 5.12 percent
interest on deposits, ten times some bank and building society deposit
rates. This, however, is operated by NatWest, which possesses the
banking licence. One leading UK banking analyst said the Sainsbury's
move was "one big step on from that".

Tesco, which has recently taken over from Sainsbury as the UK's biggest
supermarket group, refused to say whether it would respond by setting
up its own bank. "We do not comment on the activities of our rivals," a
spokeswoman said.

But other retailers have not discounted such a move. Kevin Hawkins,
Safeway's head of communications, said: "We have not ruled out the
provision of financial services should it fit with our customer
proposition."

For some time now, UK banks have had problems with their public image
and are becoming increasingly concerned with the activities of the more
"consumer-friendly" retailers. Bankers and analysts alike are promoting
collaborative joint ventures, like the Sainsbury venture, as the way
forward.

Tony Surridge, head of co-branding at NatWest UK, who was behind the
bank's joint venture with Tesco, said if the UK banks did not set up
alliances with retailers, US credit card operators would. "We would
rather be inside the goldfish bowl than looking in from outside," he
said.

Recently, British Gas, a major UK utility, and HFC Bank, a subsidiary
of the US Household Financial Corporation, teamed up to form Goldbrand
Development to manage its new Goldfish credit card. The Goldfish credit
card offers a loyalty point scheme whereby customers can save up to #75
on their gas bills.

British Gas and HFC said the Goldbrand joint venture company was aiming
to"rewrite the rules in financial services".

THAILAND:  BANK AND INSURER LAUNCH AFFINITY CARD

THAILAND'S LARGEST bank, Bangkok Bank, has launched an affinity card
with associate company Bangkok Life Assurance, just six months after
establishing a similar deal with Bangkok Insurance.

The three companies have a web of cross-shareholdings in a group
controlled by the country's influential Sophonpanich family.

The latest credit card, the BLA-BBL card, is being launched to mark
Bangkok Life Assurance's 45th anniversary and is being offered with
Bt200,000 ($8,000) of insurance cover which pays off any outstanding
credit card balance on the card of up to that amount if the holder dies
or is permanently disabled.

The promotion also offers a 10 percent discount on life assurance
policies and unspecified discounts on comprehensive motor insurance
policies with Bangkok Insurance, which also has a stake in its life
assurance affiliate.

Bangkok Bank has around 400,000 cards in issue, and is aiming to add
another 10,000 from the latest card in the next six months. The card is
being offered to all Bangkok Life Assurance clients with individual or
group life policies.

The affinity card is being offered as a blue or gold proprietary card,
and with classic and gold Visa card and standard and gold MasterCard
options.

The joining fee has been waived for applications before the end of the
year, as has half of the annual fee for the first year.

Otherwise, joining fees are Bt300 and Bt400 for local blue and gold
cards respectively and Bt600 for the international options. Full annual
fees are Bt600 for the blue cards, Bt900 for the local gold cards,
Bt1,000 for the classic/standard card and Bt1,500 for the international
gold card.

In April, Bangkok Bank launched a similar card with Bangkok Insurance
offering two alternatives - Bt500,000 cover or Bt300,000 insurance
against death or illness at a monthly premium of Bt235 to Bt2,510 and
Bt140 to Bt1,506 respectively. The cover is limited to cancer
diagnosis, a disease which is one of the biggest killers of Thais.

The scheme was targeted at all Bangkok Bank cardholders aged between 21
and 59 years, although applicants were required to fill in a health
form.

MALAYSIA:  BANK SIGNS SCHEME WITH ENGINEERS

MALAYSIA'S 30,000 engineers will be eligible to join Southern Bank's
Direct Access credit card and banking scheme following the signing of
an affinity programme in October.

The bank signed an agreement with the Institution of Engineers (IEM)
which will give its members special privileges on the bank programme.

The scheme offers IEM-Direct Access Visa and MasterCard affinity cards
bearing the IEM logo, the three-in-one current, savings and money
market accounts and the Direct Access/Maestro ATM and debit card.

IEM members will have their joining and annual fees waived for life and
will be subject to interest on outstanding balances of 1.49 percent a
month, the lowest rate in the country, according to Southern Bank.

The bank has signed similar affinity deals with the Medical Association
of Malaysia, the Malaysian Dentistry Association and Compaq computers.
The Direct Access programme is run as a standalone part of the bank and
is expected to see positive earnings in the next few months, having
been launched a year ago, said the division's head K Muganthan.

He is now working on another affinity programme with an unnamed mutual
fund company, aimed at encouraging high-net-worth clients to open
Direct Access accounts.

When Direct Access was launched a year ago, Muganthan said he was
aiming for 30,000 to 40,000 new customers a year. That target still
remains, he said.

The bank spent around M$10 million ($4 million) on computer software
and hardware last year to launch Direct Access, which features 24-hour
direct banking.

CARD REWARD DEALS REMAIN POPULAR

THE CONTINUING popularity of co-branding and reward deals is based on
solid business considerations. A little more than half of US consumers
who own a co-branded airline card say that owning the card influences
their choice of carrier, according to a new study by Brittain
Associates, an Atlanta-based research firm.

"Airline frequent-flier programmes have a lot of appeal to a fairly
narrow segment, but it's a viciously loyal segment," principal Bruce
Brittain told Cards International.

According to the study, about 6 percent of all US households claim to
own a credit card that provides air travel rewards linked to card
usage. Of these programmes, ten are co-branded card issues bearing
either the MasterCard or Visa marque, along with a bank's. Four of the
programmes generate points that can be redeemed for travel on any
airline.

"The majority of owners tell us that they use the card both for airfare
and other purchases," Brittain said. "And compared to other co-branded
cards we study, airline card owners use these cards much more
frequently."

It was such loyalty that American Express and Advanta hope to break
with their Rewards Accelerator Card that enables users to earn points
on their Amex membership rewards programme through a bank card (see
pages 1 and 6).

Among the surprises in the study, Brittain said, was the rapid growth
of the Delta SkyMiles Optima portfolio. "It's really vaulted up there,"
he said, and now rivals United's programme. Amex was careful to forbid
balance transfer from any Optima card to the new Rewards Accelerator.

Brittain added, however, that"the American Airlines AAdvantage
portfolio with Citibank is still the 800lbs gorilla among these
programmes, with twice as much business as its nearest competitors."

SUIT FILED AGAINST VISA

WAL-MART STORES, the world's largest retailer, and The Limited have
filed suit against Visa USA, charging that Visa's "honour all cards"
policy regarding debit and cheque cards is illegal.

Visa immediately responded in a statement saying it would fight the
suit.

The court action alleges that Visa's rule that each of its merchant
members accept all Visa cards, whether they be credit, online debit or
cheque card instruments is in violation of US anti-trust laws.

The suit hinges on the differing costs to retailers of processing
Visa's online debit cards versus banks' ATM cards with debit functions
attached and routed over local POS networks. According to the suit, the
merchants' profitability may erode when customers are allowed to
present online Visa debit cards.

Visa, according to its statement, "will vigorously defend this action
and believe that we will prevail".

The grounds on which it will defend itself hinge on two points,
according to Stephen Theoharis, senior vice-president and director of
litigation with the card association.

First, he said, Visa successfully defended itself against a similar
suit brought in 1983 by upscale retailer Nordstrom's. Second, it
regards the "honour all cards rule" as fostering rather than stifling
competition worldwide.

"If I can go into one of 13 million establishments worldwide and
present any Visa card for payment, we believe that encourages
competition," he said.

Regarding Visa's use of Nordstrom's precedent, the only difference
between 1983 and 1996, Theoharis said, is the enormously-enhanced
number of debit cards, offline and online, in circulation.

"Clearly, the debit card has been embraced by consumers," Theoharis
said. "But the number of cards has nothing to do with the issue
legally." There are about 35 million offline, or "cheque" cards
currently in circulation in the US.

Theoharis added: "They seem to be arguing that the debit transaction be
processed over regional POS networks. But what they don't seem to
understand is that one half of the bank ATM cards that are also debit
cards are Visa cheque cards.  "I think there is a misperception on Wal-
Mart's part. We have no rules for routing transactions. The merchants
are free to route that transaction as they see fit."

Curiously, MasterCard International, which has a similar rule, was not
mentioned in the suit. Industry speculation centres on Wal-Mart's
reluctance to sue MasterCard, its partner in a recent agreement to
offer the retailer's first-ever co-branded credit card in association
with Chase Manhattan and FDR.

BRANDING MEANS BONDING

In an increasingly-competitive cards market, a co-branding programme
can provide issuers with a keen edge

OVER THE past year co-branded and affinity products have outperformed
all other card products in the market place. As competition becomes
more fierce and brand loyalty decreases, co-branding is taking on a new
significance, Virlea Mays, president of the Mays Marketing Group told
delegates at Lafferty's International Retail Financial Services
Conference for Southern Africa in October.

"If we want the customer to want, use and keep our products, the way we
structure strategies and go to the market with our card products is
critical," she said.

"The credit card business is intensely competitive. It is expensive to
market, especially in the US, and by combining the marketing resources
and marketing expertise of two major organisations, you get more
muscle."

Co-branding offers significant benefits and enhancements to both
parties. Marketing expertise is shared by the issuer and co-brander, as
is the revenue.

The co-brander is typically profit-driven and usually has a recognised
brand or logo, merchant outlets and sales volume, often through a
proprietary card. Solicitation is done primarily by or through the co-
brander.

But the co-branding process is fraught with difficulties. Finding the
right partner and working out the relationship may seem
straightforward, but it is often not the case.

"The associations are important but the co-brand partner and the issuer
are the most critical component. And as they develop the partnership,
the most important thing is to define the contractual relationship and
the product and the value proposition of that product," said Mays.

The partners must start with an equitable contract and establish mutual
objectives. The two sides should design the product, value proposition
and packaging, and define credit approval criteria and credit limits.

A marketing plan should be developed and quality service standards
defined. While the ongoing relationship should be formalised, decision-
making and conflict/resolution processes and a termination agreement
should also be defined. But for the issuer, negotiating revenue and
expense sharing details is crucial.

"The ability to forecast how the revenue is shared can make the
difference for the issuer in terms of complete and total profit and
loss," explained Mays. "A lot of contracts were written so that the
issuer ends up with all of the responsibility and takes the full brunt
of the loss if the product fails or the programme simply doesn't work."

The time spent developing the partnership and working on the contract
is a key factor and one that is often overlooked, according to Mays.

"This is where the time needs to be taken and in most cases is not.
Everybody is rushing to get to the market and the correct length of
time is often not taken in the development of the contract," she said.

The length of the contract also has to be worked out and Mays advised
delegates to settle for a contract of between seven and ten years.
"Nobody is down in the three-year range, except maybe some affinity
programmes. There may be some five-year contracts out there, but there
is just too much riding on this, so contracts should be in the
neighbourhood of seven to ten years," she said.

When working out the rebate and reward structure, the co-branding
partners should be careful to make the product easy for the customer to
understand.

"Some rebate and reward structures work very well, some are way too
complicated for a consumer to really get caught up in to use the card,"
said Mays.

She cited a survey conducted by Visa in the US where consumers
indicated they wanted something that is simple and easy to use.

"We are all customers and we don't want a ten-page book to figure out
how to get our reward," she said. "We want reasonably easy
gratification and no tricks, no restrictions, no caps and no fine
points.

"The process is attempting to create a connection with the customer and
create some sort of emotional connection, even if that emotion is
greed."

When the product is designed, the next piece of the equation is to
define the marketing plan. This involves developing strategies for:

* Acquisition - acquire new accounts and appeal to customers to want
the card.

* Activation - generate a balance and induce activity so the cardholder
will use the account.

* Retention - become the "card of choice", so profitable customers keep
accounts.

"Many of the programmes designed in the US and in other parts of the
world, such as AT&T, do a great job in acquiring but they do not do the
best job possible at activation. The activation today in AT&T is still
only about 49 percent and the industry average is 65 percent," said
Mays.

100-YEAR ISSUE FROM MALAYSIA

Tenaga Nasional Berhad's proposed 100-year issue via the 144A market
has been rated A1 by Moody's Investors Service.
      Tenaga, which plans to issue $150 million of the notes, is the
dominant producer of electricity in Peninsule Malaysia with approximately
80% of the total market. It is 78% owned by the Malaysian government.

NEW YORK CITY PLANS TO SECURITIZE TAX LIENS

The nascent movement among municipalities to securitize delinquent
property taxes took a major step forward last week when New York City
stepped into the fray, requesting proposals from investment banks on how
best to securitize $200 million to $250 million of tax liens. It would be
the biggest such securitization ever.
     The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrears
totaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; and
it is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the senior
notes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.
     Although the document states that an objective is to complete the
transaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "pretty
tight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completion
of any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment of
pending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is the
city's advisor.
     A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pending
legislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city as
the lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes when
someone falls behind on their property taxes. The proposed issue will be
backed by the better-quality of these tax liens, mostly commercial real
estate with a high likelihood of repayment.
     One of the basic principles behind these transactions is that the
pooled tax liens will eventually generate cash in one of three ways: the
property owner will pay the back taxes, the bank will foreclose and pay the
back taxes, or the municipality will itself foreclose and sell the
property.
     According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizations
will accomplish four things: to increase the cashflow from delinquent tax
liens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;
increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need for
the city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.
     "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficient
method to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure process
the City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restore
fairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improve
collection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieve
upward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term sale
program will be the initial securitization," the request for proposal
states.
     The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike a
traditional private placement, the issue will be fully underwritten by the
investment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-
efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital will
be funneled into the city's operations fund.
     The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was last
Friday, and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about two
weeks.
     Which underwriters the city will choose is anyone's guess, but one
question in the document does ask bankers to describe their experience
implementing new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list of
those with specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.
     Most recent was Smith Barney, which priced a $19 million issue for the
City of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. The issue has a two-year average,
seven-year final life, priced at 220 basis points off the curve, and had
$25 million of collateral. Fitch Investors Service rated it BBB and The
Principal Finance Group scooped up the entire offering.
     New Haven sold its liens into a trust, which then issued the taxable
notes. There will be no recourse to New Haven and in this way is similar to
a deal in the fall of 1994 from Jersey City, N.J., which was agented by CS
First Boston.
     Other tax lien deals are due to follow soon. Breen Capital Group is
about to launch a $50 million securitization backed by a diverse pool of
tax liens, culled from its own portfolio. The deal, which will be placed by
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, is currently structured with a four-year final,
two-year average life. The deal will likely be overcollateralized.
     Price talk has not been heard yet, but because the portfolio is "hand-
picked" and will not carry the concentration risk of a single-city deal,
BZW will aim for a tighter spread than New Haven, a source said. Both Fitch
and Standard & Poor's are expected to rate the transaction.
     Meanwhile, Philadelphia is expected to make its securitization plans
public soon. The city is rumored to be planning a $150 million issue.

ELKEM FROM LAND OF REINDEER

Barclays de Zoete Wedd was roadshowing a $60 million issue last week
for Elkem A/S, a Norwegian metals company with sales last year of
approximately $1.4 billion.
     The company, considered a mid-BBB, is reportedly looking for 10- of
12-year money in the form of senior unsecured notes. Price talk was 130
over Treasurys. Bids were expected this week.
     One investor expressed concern about the company's cyclicality, noting
that Elkem is coming off its best earnings in six or seven years. "I think
it's on the fence between an NAIC-2 and 3," the investor said.
     Last fall ABN-AMRO brought a $20 million deal from Elkem's U.S.
subsidiary. Those senior notes, considered an NAIC-2, had a 10-year final,
seven-year average life and priced at 125 off the curve.
     Elkem is one of Norway's largest companies and a worldwide leader in
the production of silicon metals and aluminum, to name a few.

IFC-LINKED DEALS MAKE ROUNDS

Chase Securities is in the market with a $200 million issue from
Edelsur, an Argentine gas utility. The deal would be just the third under a
new program by the International Finance Corp., an arm of the World Bank.
     The deal comes on the heels of another IFC-linked deal. Just before
Christmas, J.P. Morgan and ING Securities placed a $100 million issue with
institutional investors for Grupo Industrial Bimbo, S.A. (Gibsa), which
owns a popular Mexican bread sold under the brand name Bimbo (PPR Nov. 13,
p. 1).
     Under the program, the IFC extends a loan to the company and keeps a
small portion for its own account. It then sells the remainder to a
Delaware trust in form of participation interests subsequently issued to
investors.
     As a division of the World Bank, the IFC can ensure certain payment
guarantees that generally yield an investment grade rating.
     Details about the Edelsur deal were sketchy at press time, but sources
said it was apparently divided into floating- and fixed-rated tranches that
would be filled out according to demand. Price talk was reportedly Libor
plus 200 for the floater and the equivalent spread for the fixed.
     On the Gibsa transaction, more details were available. The 10-year
bullet priced at 305 off the curve and was popularly referred to by
investors as the Bimbo deal. The structure did evolve somewhat since it
first hit the market mid-November. At that time it had a 12-year final,
seven-year average life and the notes were being talked at 275 to 285 off
the curve.
     Gibsa, with sales last year of $1.25 billion, was founded in 1945 and
makes such products as breads, cakes, potato chips, and tortilla chips,
among others. Besides a 90% market share in much of Mexico, the company has
plants in Argentina, Chile, Guatemala and El Salvador. It has also started
to make some acquisitions in the U.S. tortilla market.
     A source pointed out that the company's distribution network is so
extensive and well respected that Gibsa currently has a distribution
agreement with Mars, and until recently also had one with Wrigley's.
     The new program is part of the IFC's attempt to tap the U.S.
institutional market -- such as insurance companies and pension funds.

ABN-AMRO PAVES WAY FOR ROGERS

ABN-AMRO recently found circles for a $25 million issue from Rogers
Group, one of the largest aggregate companies in the nation. The materials
it produces are used in road construction.
     The issue from the Nashville-based company was four times
oversubscribed and purchased by three investors. The issuer decided not to
expand the offering, which was divided into two tranches, 10-year and 20-
year bullets.
     Although no pricing was available, initial price talk was 110 to 120
over the 12-year Treasury.

AIRBUS CIRCLES MARKET

Salomon Brothers was in the market last week with a $52 million issue
from Airbus Industrie, sources said.
     The secured loan certificates were reportedly broken into two
tranches, a 17-year final, 11-year average life with price talk at 70 to 75
off the curve; and a 21-year final, 20-year average life with price talk at
105 over Treasurys.
     One buy-side source said those spreads offered some decent value.
French-based Airbus Industrie, an equipment manufacturer, is considered a
double A minus credit.
     Last January Salomon led a  $108 million leveraged lease transaction
for Airbus broken into two tranches. Final pricing was not available. But
the 10-year average life strip started at 85 basis points over the curve;
while price talk on the 20-year average life tranche started at 115 basis
points over Treasurys.
     The raised capital from the 1995 deal financed the purchase of four
A320 aircraft. Although the planes went to United Airlines, the deal was
based on Airbus' credit.

BANKS EXPLOIT WIDENING SPREADS

After being unable to come to terms with investors on a $75 million
proposed issue via BA Securities, Empresa Nacional deMineria opted for bank
financing late last year. But is Enami's fate indicative of what will
happen to similar issues in 1996?
     When Enami, Chile's second largest copper producer, hit the market in
late October, price talk was a tight 95 off the curve for the seven-year
paper. But the BBB+ paper quickly widened to 120.
     "The market was demanding much wider spreads than was initially
anticipated," a source said.
     Unfortunately for Enami, its entry into the market coincided with a
general widening of emerging market spreads, particularly those "quasi"
emerging markets whose sovereign rating is investment grade, such as Chile,
Malaysia and the Czech Republic, sources said.
     For instance, a recent public Chilean deal from Celulosa Arauco y
Constitucion SA also had to swallow a wider spread than initially
anticipated. An eight-year tranche that started at 80 over Treasurys got
done at 105 and has since traded even wider.
     "It's not a dramatic shift, and it's not just Chile, and it'll still
be a good year," a source said. "But you'd expect it to be a runaway year
for issuance given that long-term interest rates are at a 20-year low. But
with banks so aggressive, I don't think you'll see the amount of issues in
the private market you might expect. The few basis points (the banks will
give over institutional investors) do matter."

COBHAM LOOKS FOR U.S. INVESTORS

Schroder Wertheim was circulating a $50 million issue last week for
Cobham plc., a U.K.-based aerospace company.
     The 12-year final, 10-year average life notes were being talked at 80
off the curve, though a source said New York Life had offered to take a $15
million portion at a spread of 85.
     Cobham, considered an A- credit, is a private company with 1994 sales,
the last year a figure was available, of $278 million.

SCHMIT EXITS MUTUAL OF OMAHA

Thomas Schmit has resigned from Mutual of Omaha. He had been at the
insurance company for 26 years, all of that time in the realm of private
placements. For the past six years he was head of the department.
     Schmit, 52, is currently pursuing options both in and outside the
Omaha area.
     Mutual of Omaha has not yet appointed a replacement, and is reportedly
considering whether to hire a junior or senior person. In 1994, the insurer
did $650 million of private placement volume.

Joe Rowan resigned as head of private placements at Deutsche Bank as
of the end of last year, sources said.
     A spokesperson for the bank declined to say whether Rowan would be
replaced or to comment on the future of the private placement department.
     However, sources said Rowan may have been a casualty of Deutsche
Bank's decision to bring several Merrill Lynch people into its fixed-income
department.

PUERTO RICAN BANK ISSUES 144A

After eying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Rico
became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt in
December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100 million offering
of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis points over
Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The notes,
which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language, enabling
a public-style execution of the offering without registration at the
Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted from
Standard & Poor's rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie
Astor, chief financial officer.
     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates in
December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank to
issue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's first
independent bond offering.
     Jefferies & Co. captured the lead underwriting position on the deal
because of its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney Inc. acted as
co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15 insurance
companies.
     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by the bank's
phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had an average
return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the bank's
initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated in value
by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion asset
bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last year.
     The deal for FirstBank follows a first-time subordinated offering by
another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the month. BanPonce
Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in 10-year
subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125
million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparable
Treasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston. --John Hintze

ALVEY TO FINANCE ACQUISITION

Alvey Systems, Inc. plans to issue a $100 million 144A of six-year,
senior subordinated notes to help fund an acquisition and a buyout of an
equity partner. Moody's Investors Service has rated the notes B3.
     Alvey designs, engineers and produces materials flow equipment and
software.
     The rating reflects Alvey's high leverage as a result of a quasi-
management buyout/acquisition in conjunction with this note issue, which
follows numerous debt-financed acquisitions in the past seven years; its
limited track record as a fully integrated company; and the subordination
of the notes to a $30 million secured bank facility and any future senior
debt.
     These risks are moderated, however, by the company's broad and
innovative product offerings; its stable cash flows from a diversified
customer base; and the growing demand for the kind of complex, custom-
designed material handing systems that Alvey assembles.

A.P.S. ISSUE GETS JUNK RATING

A.P.S.' proposed $100 million issue of 10-year senior, subordinated
notes has been rated B2 by Moody's Investors Service.
     The company is an automotive replacement parts manufacturer and
distributor. Most of the raised capital will be used to acquire Parts, Inc.
for $80 million and to repay A.P.S. bank debt.
     The rating reflects A.P.S.'s high financial leverage, short
profitability history, intensely competitive business environment,
vulnerability to weather conditions, short operating history with its mini-
warehouses and high supplier concentration. It also considers uncertainties
relating to the purchase of Parts, Inc. and future acquisitions as well as
the subordination of the notes.
     Mitigating factors include improving profitability prospects, positive
demand fundamentals, good industry position, limited risk of obsolete
inventory, adequacy of capital for attracting additional sales locations,
and substantial benefits provided by Parts, Inc.

MARKET RADAR


     Traditionals'
     ABN-AMRO priced a $70 million issue recently from Uniboard Canada. The
NAIC-2, senior notes have an eight-year final, six-year average life and
priced at 145 over Treasurys. The company makes fiberboard and particle
board.
     BOT Financial was in the market with a $40 million issue from United
Healthcare Corp. The notes have a 12-year final, 10-year average life.
     Daiwa Securities has reportedly received a mandate for an issue from
Compania Vale do Rio Doce, more popularly known as CVRD, a Brazilian mining
company.
     ING Securities and UBS Securi-ties have reportedly received a Mexican
mandate for a $75 million deal securitized by steel.
     Robertson Stephens reportedly placed $10 million of subordinated notes
for Individual Inc.
     Chilgener, which recently issued a $110 million private placement, has
just had a proposed, 10-year public deal of $150 million senior notes rated
Baa1 by Moody's Investors Service.

     144As'
     Goldman Sachs is reportedly bringing an investment grade issue from
Enterprise Rent-A-Car. No other details were available at press time.
     Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley were on the road last week with a $75
million, high-yield issue from B.E. Aerospace, which makes commercial
aircraft interiors. The 10-year senior subordinated notes are noncallable
for five years.
     Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro/144A via
Salomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive. The
three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 basis points over
U.S. Treasurys. The deal was popular with European retail investors, but
some U.S. investors were not impressed. "You can get Nafinsa paper with the
same spread for shorter maturities," one said.
     Smith Barney and Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette are bringing a $150
million 144A for KCS Energy, a New Jersey-based exploration and production
company. The seven-year issue, noncallable for four years, has been rated
B1.

MOODY'S RATES BRAZILIAN ISSUE

Moody's Investors Service has assigned a B1 rating to the notes of
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras SA (Telebras). Approximately $720 million of
debt is affected.
     The rating is supported by Telebras' established position as the
monopoly provider of Brazil's telecommunications services. Although the
Brazilian government has begun to liberalize the telecommunications market,
it will likely do so very gradually and will take steps to make Telebras
more competitive.

U.S. INVESTORS INHALE ELM

Timing was everything for Mexican cigarette company, Empresas La
Moderna, which increased its long awaited Euro/ 144A to $125 million last
week.
     ELM's three-year issue, joint led by ING Securities and J.P. Morgan,
was oversubscribed by a two to one margin and enlarged from $100 million.
ELM was to launch the deal last November but backed out due to a difficult
market environment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,
carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia and
Europe.
     "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds," says
Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It was relatively
attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and is well priced
and valued."
     Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELM issue
last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was swayed back by the
changing sentiment toward Mexico.-- Dan Levine

NBD, 1ST CHICAGO EXPECT EASY COMPLIANCE MERGER

The fact that National Bank of Detroit and First Chicago both had
line management compliance systems before they merged Dec. 1 will ease the
future merging of their compliance departments, NBD's general counsel told
RCW.
        The compliance program at the new holding company, First
Chicago/NBD Corp., will probably be run in a similar way, Dan Lis said.
Only the holding companies have currently merged; the only banks that will
merge are in Illinois--NBD Illinois and First National Bank of Chicago--
which will merge at mid-year. At that time NBD will fold into First
National.
        So far, the plan of how to structure the new compliance program
hasn't yet gone to senior management or been implemented, but according to
bank executives this is not a problem.
        "There was no danger in not having a compliance program completely
set up in time for the merger, because our functions and the way the two
banks approached compliance were very similar," said Lis. "We will not have
any gaps in coverage because of this."
        How to merge CRA functions, which are separate from compliance,
also wasn't considered until after the merger. According to M. Chris Snow,
NBD's CRA officer, before Dec. 1 the CRA department was just making sure it
got through the approval process, which included a couple of protests.
"When we sat down to combine our offices, we realized that our public
affairs divisions both held CRA (departments), but were different in other
ways," said Snow. "So far we've only had two meetings to integrate the
departments."
        Lis said that like the pre-merged institutions, First Chicago/NBD
Corp. will probably have corporate compliance officers in each line of
manufacturing business, who will have corporate-wide responsibility. There
will probably also be distribution compliance officers in charge of each
state, since each state operation serves as a distribution arm of products
and services, speculated Lis. Those officers will report to the bank
president of that state.
        Those officers, together with certain executive officers, including
those of the law and auditing departments, will comprise a corporate
compliance committee. The auditing and law departments will serve as
support for the line management.
        Lis said the manufacturing arms of the bank take up such retail
banking functions as mortgage, consumer banking, deposit services and
marketing. Distribution involves the sale of the bank's products.
        "The most significant difference between the new compliance
department and the old ones is that before, at NBD, there was a single
corporate compliance officer. Now we will use the corporate compliance
committee structure, similar to the one First Chicago had," said Lis.
        "There will also be some decrease in personnel due to redundancy as
a result of the transition, not as a result of the new structure. For
example, before we downsize there may be two lawyers who study the same
reg, two compliance officers who monitor it, etc."
        There won't be many problems combining the bank's CRA departments
either, said Snow.
        "Even though First Chicago was a larger bank, its market was small
compared to ours, and its CRA was focused more in their public affairs
group, out of their downtown Chicago office, since they didn't have many
branches," she said. "By contrast, NBD's CRA efforts were spread over five
states, each with a state coordinator. Each state was also broken up into
regions, with a part-time regional person.
        "I think we will move the centralized CRA to Chicago, like the
centralized lending analysis, since our corporate headquarters will be
there, and keep the information flowing back and forth from the regions,"
Snow continued. "We still need to keep the regional efforts because the
needs of each state are different--CRA has to be much closer to the
customer and geography. Before, we had to rely on a local person to tell us
why a trend was the way it was, but the new reg lends itself more to
centralized data.
        "Right now we're not worried about who will be in what job, but
that whatever data analyzer we purchase will be flexible enough to accept
data from any operating system, be it consumer or commercial loan
information. We'll have small business reporting from five different banks.
        "Our CRA department is responsible for choosing the data base
analyzer, and senior management and our technology task force is in charge
of hiring a geocoder and purchasing loan collection systems, since
marketing will also use the information. We'll have some say in the latter,
but not a lot of input."
        "Then we'll make (CRA) lending decisions based on what the numbers
tell us. We would be doing the switch to data collection regardless, but
the merger will make the switch go faster, since we'll already be in a
change mode."
        "We might be hiring a couple of new people to do lending analysis
for the new CRA reg, the number will depend how much we can automate," said
Snow. "Our plan is not to grow our CRA department, since our CRA philosophy
is to keep the authority with the local state bank president or regional
director. We hesitate to hire too many CRA people because it is too easy to
offload the responsibility to them."

LARGE BANKS FACE RISK-BASED EXAMS

By the end of the first quarter, large national banks can expect to
be examined against nine risk factors identified by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency.
        The agency's new Supervision by Risk program, released Jan. 4 by
way of its "Large Bank Supervision Handbook," is for national banks with
total assets of at least $1 billion and for banks that are part of multi-
bank holding companies with at least one bank with assets of $1 billion or
more.
        Banks smaller than $1 billion in assets will be treated as
community banks and their new risk-focused exam guidelines are expected by
June.
        Intending to help banks manage risk to capital and earnings,
examiners will focus on credit, interest rate, liquidity, price, foreign
exchange, transaction, compliance, strategic planning and reputation.
Examiners will then put together a customer-tailored profile for each bank.
        While the OCC has been examining banks based on a variety of risks
for several years, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said, the new
handbook marks the national standardization of this process.
        "By delineating and defining each risk, bankers and examiners will,
for the first time, be able to use the same terminology when discussing
risk-related issues, and examiners will be more consistent in their
approach to similar institutions," said Ludwig.
        Supervision by Risk, announced by Ludwig last September, will be
part of banks' annual on-site safety and soundness exams and might also
occur throughout the year in various target examinations.
        If a risk is identified as an unwarranted problem, banks will be
expected to take steps to correct the problem, and examiners will monitor
their progress.
        The OCC has also provided a Risk Assessment System within the
handbook--a checklist within the nine risk categories, for banks' self-
assessment regarding the quantity of risk, the quality of risk management,
the level of supervisory concern, and the direction of risk.
        Within each risk category, examiners will identify whether risk is
increasing, stable, or decreasing in each bank. The new handbook also
emphasizes two-way communication about bank risk between bankers and
examiners.
        According to the handbook, each bank's individualized risk
management program should include identification, measurement, control, and
monitoring of risks.
        The OCC defines the nine risk categories as follows:
         Credit: The risk from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of
any contract or fail to perform as agreed. Credit risk also arises in
conjunction with selecting investment portfolio products, derivatives
trading partners, or foreign exchange counterparties; through country or
sovereign exposure; and through guarantor performance.
         Interest Rate Risk: The risk from movements in interest rates.
Should consider risk from both an accounting perspective (the effect on the
bank's accrual earnings) and the economic perspective (the effect on the
market value of the bank's portfolio equity). In some banks, interest rate
risk is captured under a broader category of market risk.
         Liquidity Risk: The risk from a bank's inability to meet its
obligations when they come due, without incurring unacceptable losses.
Includes the inability to manage unplanned decreases or changes in funding
sources; and the failure to address changes in market conditions that
affect the ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in
value.
         Price Risk: The risk from changes in the value of portfolios of
financial instruments. This risk arises from market-making, dealing, and
position-taking activities in interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, and
commodities markets.
         Foreign Exchange Risk: The risk from movement of foreign exchange
rates, found in cross-border investing and operating activities. Market-
making and position-taking in foreign currencies should be captured under
price risk.
         Transaction Risk: The risk from problems with service or product
delivery--a function of internal controls, information systems, employee
integrity, and operating processes.
         Compliance Risk: The risk from violations or non-conformance with
laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards. Also
arises in situations where the laws or rules governing bank activities may
be ambiguous or untested. Compliance risk exposes the bank to fines, civil
money penalties, payment of damages, and the voiding of contracts.
         Strategic Risk: The risk from adverse business decisions or
improper implementation of those decisions. This risk focuses on more than
an analysis of the written strategic plan; it focuses on how plans,
systems, and implementation affect the bank's franchise value.
         Reputation Risk: The risk from negative public opinion, affecting
the bank's ability to establish new relationships or services, or continue
servicing existing relationships. This risk can expose the bank to
litigation, financial loss, or damage to its reputation. Banks that
actively associate their name with products and services, such as with
fiduciary services, are more likely to have higher reputation risk
exposure.
        Copies of the Large Bank Handbook can be obtained by sending $6 per
booklet to the OCC, P.O. Box 70004, Chicago, Ill. 70673-0004. o
Mortgage Reg OKs Endorsements
        HUD-approved lenders participating in the Home Equity Conversion
Mortgage program can now process these loans without approval from the
department. HUD published its final rule Dec. 21 authorizing its approved
lenders to process HECM, or "reverse mortgage," loans under its direct
endorsement program.
        Lenders have been authorized to do so since Nov. 17, but the final
rule, which appears in the Federal Register, makes the change official; it
also completes one of many streamlining procedures HUD has initiated over
the last several months.
        The HECM interim rule was issued Aug. 16. Under the rule, any HECM
that lenders haven't issued a conditional commitment for is eligible for
direct endorsement. However, lenders with fewer than 50 HECMs insured
before Sept. 15, 1995, must submit five HECM test cases to the local HUD
office for pre-closing review prior to endorsement for insurance. If HUD
deems the underwriting of those test cases satisfactory, it will give the
lender unconditional authority to participate in the HECM-DE program. o
Fannie Joins Plan For American Indians
        Lenders will be able to begin offering mortgages to certain
American Indian tribes without the anxieties traditionally associated with
lending on tribal trust lands.
        Starting in January, Fannie will begin taking part in the Rural
Housing Service's Rural Housing Native American pilot, but will limit its
initial participation to 10 tribes.
        Fannie, which agreed to participate last summer and has committed
$20 million to the pilot, said these tribes were selected because they have
a good working relationship with the Rural Housing Service and the Bureau
of Indian Affairs, although it noted that 15 additional tribes may be added
later in the pilot.

FLORIDA TO REQUIRE CONTINUING ED. FOR SECURITIES

Mark up Florida as the first state to follow national continuing
education requirements. The Southeastern hotbed for bank securities
activities has become the first state in the nation to require continuing
education for securities dealers.
        A new administrative rule will go into effect for approximately
130,000 securities sales, trading, and investment banking personnel
registered in Florida who have direct client contact, and their immediate
supervisors.
        The rule requires Florida dealers and associated persons to comply
with the same requirements as members of all the national exchanges, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board and the commodities regulatory agencies.
        The rule also exempts registered representatives with 10 years
experience and a flawless disciplinary history from the regulatory
requirements. Reps with the flawless disciplinary records make up about 17%
of Florida's securities sales industry, according to the state securities
regulator. However, all companies will be required to have a written plan

to develop and administer training programs tailored to specific training
needs regarding product lines and sales practices. The program went into
effect at the start of the new year.

BRIEFS


Fed OKs Chase Merger
Before Ending CRA Check
        The Federal Reserve on Jan. 5 approved the merger of Chemical
Banking Corp. with The Chase Manhattan Corp., a $10.4 billion deal that
will create the country's largest bank.
        Despite numerous complaints by community groups under the Community
Reinvestment Act, including two days of hearings in New York City in
November, the Fed didn't include any conditions in its order, other than
requiring the bank to fulfill an $18 billion CRA commitment it announced
last fall.
        The Fed said that both banks meet the credit needs of their
communities, citing Chemical's lead bank's two consecutive "Outstanding"
CRA grades and the Chase lead bank's recent "Satisfactory" ratings.
        Activists were especially angry that the Fed didn't wait for the
OCC to complete its CRA review of Chase before acting on the application.
Instead, it relied on a 1993 exam.
        The merger still has to be approved by the New York State Banking
Department. o
OCC To Relax Rules
On Community Work
        The OCC has proposed streamlining its CRA regulations in order to
spur more community investment by banks. Instead of the four-part test now
required of banks to prove that a community investment is in the public
interest, the OCC would only require banks to self-certify that investments
will benefit LMI families or small businesses.
        The proposal is in the Dec. 28 Fed Register; comments are due by
the beginning of March.
        "The proposed changes encourage national banks and community groups
to work together by allowing them the flexibility to determine how best to
structure their own partnerships in support of community development," said
Comptroller Eugene A. Ludwig.
        According to the OCC, national banks and their community partners
have invested a combined total of $2.16 billion in CDCs and community
development projects since December 1993, when the Community Development
regulation was adopted.
        The proposed revisions preserve the community development focus,
but would:
         Allow national banks greater flexibility to determine if
investments promote the public welfare by modifying the current public
welfare test;
         Retain the requirement that the investment primarily benefit LMI
persons, families, or small businesses, but make it clear that this benefit
can be provided in a variety of different ways;
         Simplify the self-certification and prior approval processes by
eliminating a current five-day OCC review period for investment proposals
that the OCC has previously approved for another bank;
         Eliminate the reg's list of eligible investment structures to
allow bank management flexibility to determine appropriate structures for
its investments.
        Also, the OCC adopted a final rule Dec. 27 allowing banks to
reinvest proceeds from these investments in any way they choose instead of
being required to reinvest in the community. o
Regulators Clarify
CRA Transition
        Federal banking regulators have clarified that once an institution
chooses or is forced to comply with the performance tests and standards of
the new CRA, it must comply with all of the requirements of the new rule.
(See Fed Register Dec. 20 and RCW Jan. 8 issue, p.2)
        The regulators gave this example: Small institutions will be
evaluated under the small bank performance standard beginning on Jan. 1,
1996. But for examiners to properly evaluate a bank, the institution must
also comply with other provisions of the new reg, including delineating an
assessment area, maintaining a public file and providing proper public
notice--requirements that don't under the transition rules, become
applicable until Jan. 1 or Jul 1, 1997.
        In another example, if a large bank elects to be evaluated under
the lending, investment and service tests before being required to do so in
July 1997, the bank would be required to comply on Jan. 1, 1996, with the
rule's other provisions.
        The regulators also intend to provide banks with guidance on CRA
strategic plans--the types of information to include and when and where to
file the plans--and how to qualify for wholesale bank status. OTS, for
example, plans to issue a CEO letter in the near future. o
Management Interlocks
Changes Proposed
        The financial institution regulatory agencies published a proposed
rule in the Federal Register Dec. 29 that revises their regulations on
management interlocks. Comments are due Feb. 27.
        In order to remove unnecessary obstacles faced by small banks
seeking to attract qualified management, the agencies propose to eliminate
the provision in the current rule that prohibits management interlocks
between an institution under $20 million in assets and a bank with assets
of $20 million or more that are both located in the same MSA. This change
is intended to provide small banks with a larger pool of qualified
candidates for management positions.
        The agencies aren't proposing any changes in the way the management
interlocks regulation is applied to banks in the same community, a smaller
geographic area than an MSA.

FANNIE SET TO BOOST LOAN LIMIT

Fannie Mae is on the verge of matching Freddie Mac's $4,150
conforming loan limit increase and will announce the decision to raise its
limit to $207,000 sometime within the next two weeks, according to mortgage
industry sources close to the agency.
        Fannie has received numerous requests from its seller/servicers to
raise its conforming limit to match Freddie's increase, which took effect
Jan. 1. The agency, which had maintained that it would fully consider the
views of its customers before rendering a decision, may make its
announcement as soon as Jan. 15.
        "We've received a lot of feedback, particularly over the last two
weeks," said David Jeffers, legislative director for Fannie Mae. "A lot of
(lenders) have expressed their concerns about their businesses and the
potential affect on the market." Jeffers added Fannie wasn't ready to fully
discuss the feedback the agency had received from lenders, but said those
details would be made available shortly.
        One mortgage industry lobbyist said some prominent mortgage
companies that have traditionally directed most of their business to Fannie
Mae are already completing larger commitments with Freddie Mac to take
advantage of Freddie's higher loan limit. Freddie Mac did not return
requests for comments.
        Jeffers said Fannie has not seen its commitments dip since Freddie
raised its limits. But in talks with its seller/servicers over the last
month, he said Fannie has heard many lenders expressing concern over the
change in the marketplace that will--and likely is--occurring. "We knew
that to be a real possibility," Jeffers said of lenders defecting to
Freddie, "though it's too early to see it happening--I wouldn't be
surprised."

1996: YEAR OF THE US INVASION?

AT THE start of the new year it is perhaps appropriate to consider what
1996 will bring to the world of retail banking.

The year 1995 will probably be remembered for the extraordinary wave of
mergers and acquisitions in the US and, to a lesser extent, in the UK.

In the US, wholesale consolidation of branch networks is under way,
accelerated by the revolution in retail delivery systems. Increasing
liberalisation of interstate branching laws also means that truly
national banks are emerging in that country - something beginning to be
reflected in the marketing campaigns of major banks.

State barriers have not proved an obstacle to the major credit card
banks in the US, which have seen their sophisticated marketing
techniques rewarded by extraordinary returns in their home market.
Latterly, these banks have become increasingly visible abroad,
particularly in Europe, where the credit card market remains full of
potential compared with the saturated US scene.

While, in the short-term, some major conventional US banks may be
preoccupied with effecting mergers in their home market, the
indications are that once the domestic scene has settled down they and
other organisations will surely turn to foreign markets. Already names
such as Citibank, Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch International
Bank have accumulated substantial foreign business.

US investment banks have for decades followed their corporate clients
abroad; 1996 may be the year when the revolution in delivery systems
will enable their retail brothers to begin to emulate them in selected
markets and sectors.

NYCE MOVES INTO HOME BANKING

NYCE WILL become the first US regional ATM network to announce a full-
service platform for electronic home banking and bill payment. NYCE's
announcement in late December follows a year of new home banking
launches by some 30 large banks, most of which are using personal
finance manager home banking packages from Microsoft and Intuit as a
home banking interface. In addition, Chicago-based regional ATM network
Cash Station has recently announced an outsourcing alliance with
processor EDS for the provision of home banking services.

NYCE, which is based in Hackensack, New Jersey, plans to build its own
home banking processing platform within the NYCE processing system,
which will support home banking and bill payment transactions conducted
over touch-tone phones. Calling its approach "home banking `lite'",
NYCE will offer a low-cost plain-vanilla home banking service for
customers who do not need advanced graphical and consultative functions
that PC personal finance manager (PFM) software packages now provide.

But NYCE's system will also accommodate more sophisticated PFM- driven
home banking programs now offered by many large US banks. NYCE also
plans to pursue state-of-the-art home banking features, like electronic
presentment, which would allow utilities to deliver bills
electronically, as well as alliances with other financial services
providers like insurance firms.

NYCE's technical platform will be based on Tandem fault-tolerant
processing hardware, similar to the system NYCE now uses to run its
core ATM and POS networks, which processed some 350 million
transactions in 1995. Vicorp, a Connecticut-based technology provider,
has already installed "device-independent" software that will manage
interactions, via telephone, screenphones, ATMs and PCs.

The payments infrastructure and experience of regional networks like
NYCE may allow them to offer more cost-efficient services to smaller
institutions, with start-up costs as low as $10,000. Intuit has
recently announced its intention to team up with regional networks to
provide smaller institutions with affordable home banking services. For
its part, NYCE has begun negotiations intended to bring on other
regional networks as equity partners into its new home banking venture.

BANK INSURANCE REFORM STYMIED

AN IMPASSE over new bank insurance legislation has all but killed
prospects for repeal in 1996 of the Glass Steagall Act, the legislation
which imposed "fire walls" between the US commercial banking and
securities industries in 1933. Although an agreement is still possible,
repeated attempts to bridge the conflicting interests of the commercial
banking and insurance agents' lobbies failed in 1995, as they did in
1991, leaving further deregulation of US bank insurance in the
uncertain hands of courts and regulators. The result may be that, while
the Supreme Court and the Office of the Controller of the Currency
(OCC) may achieve some piecemeal deregulation of US bank insurance in
the next few years, US banks will still have to cope with a complex and
difficult regulatory climate.

In December, House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach floated a new
amendment that would strip the "retirement CD" of federal deposit
insurance, which insurers are demanding, if they would agree to abide
by the upcoming decision by the Supreme Court on the right of Barnett
Banks to sell insurance nationally. If Barnett won, all banks would be
able to follow its example, but if Barnett lost, Congress would impose
a five-year moratorium on the expansion of US bank insurance powers.
Both the American Bankers Association and the Independent Insurance
Agents of America opposed Leach's latest compromise.

The Supreme Court's decision on Barnett - which is expected this spring
- could lead to significant deregulation in its own right. The court is
widely expected to uphold Barnett's right to sell insurance nationally
from small towns of under 5,000, owing to a peculiar "small-town
exemption" found in the US Banking Act of 1865. But US bank insurance
would still be regulated at the state level, where local insurance
lobbies are extremely influential. A favourable Supreme Court decision
could also spur the OCC to extend national bank insurance powers beyond
annuities the OCC sanctioned in 1991, to life and other insurance
products.

BANNER YEAR FOR US MERGERS

NINETEEN NINETY five closed out with two significant US bank mergers,
Fleet Financial's acquisition of Natwest Bancorp and Bank of Boston's
purchase of BayBanks (see below). The deals highlighted the rapid
consolidation of the US banking industry. Five years ago, five major
institutions vied for market share in New England, but today just two
banks dominate the region. Fleet and Bank of Boston now control a third
of all deposits in New England, and account for 37 percent of deposits
in Massachusetts and 55 percent in the Boston metropolitan area.

The two deals brought the total value of 1995 US banking mergers and
acquisitions to $73.2 billion, more than the totals for the three
previous years combined, according to SNL Securities in
Charlottesville, Virginia. As a result of 1995 merger activity, the
combined assets of the top 10 US retail banks increased 23 percent to
$1.6 trillion (see chart). The top ten 1995 deals, which involved such
institutions as Chase Manhattan, First Union and First Chicago, were
valued at $47.5 billion, or nearly two- thirds the year's total.

Analysts listed three developments which drove 1995's merger boom:
national banking and branching legislation passed in 1994, flat
industry revenues which spurred large players to pursue technology-
driven consolidation, and a bull stock market which boosted bank shares
and allowed banks to pay for acquisitions with their own stock. All
three factors are still very much in force, and analysts expect bank
mergers to continue, especially as large acquiring institutions like
NationsBank and Bank of America enter the merger arena.

BANK OF BOSTON ACQUIRES BAYBANKS

IN A stock deal valued at $2 billion, Bank of Boston agreed to acquire
cross-town rival BayBanks, creating the 15th-largest US commercial bank
with $57.7 billion in assets, and the second- largest New England
institution, after Providence-based Fleet Financial, with $90.0 billion
in assets.

The acquisition will combine BayBanks' consumer business with Bank of
Boston's extensive commercial operations, giving it a 27 percent retail
share in Massachusetts and strengthening its regional position against
Fleet. The deal will also balance the international businesses of Bank
of Boston, a quarter of whose revenue now comes from volatile Latin
America, with an expanded US regional retail franchise.

In an unusual move, all Bank of Boston retail branches will now use the
name of BayBanks, which Bank of Boston chief executive Charles Gifford
called "the top consumer bank in the country", while the holding
company, with its commercial and foreign subsidiaries, will use the
Bank of Boston name. BayBanks' chairman, William Crozier, will become
Bank of Boston's chairman and will continue to direct retail operations
until his retirement in 1998, while Gifford will become chief executive
of the new institution.

Bank of Boston said that the acquisition, which is priced at 2.2 times
BayBanks' book value, will save $190 million in expenses, or 11 percent
of the two banks' combined cost base. Bank of Boston, which will take a
one-time restructuring charge of $140 million, expects to see $50
million in additional annual revenue, or 7.7 percent of current
earnings, after 18 months. The merger will eliminate some 2,000 jobs,
or 8 percent of the banks' combined work force, half by attrition and
half by lay-offs.

FLEET BUYS NATWEST USA

IN LATE December, Fleet Financial of Providence, Rhode Island, agreed
to acquire NatWest Bancorp, the US commercial banking operation of
National Westminster PLC, in a deal valued at $3.3 billion.

The deal will expand Fleet's operations beyond its bastion of New
England, by adding 310 branches that will strengthen Fleet's presence
in New York State and give it a foothold in New Jersey. While many
analysts praised the deal's geographic logic and its low price of 1.1
times book value, others questioned Fleet's ability to absorb NatWest
following its acquisition in early 1995 of Shawmut National and its $36
billion in assets (see RBI 321). Fleet will now become the ninth-
largest US commercial bank with $90 billion in assets.

National Westminster had originally put its US unit up for auction in
September, asking $4 billion in cash, a difficult hurdle for US banks,
which almost always finance large acquisitions with stock. Fleet solved
this problem with an unusual deal structure: Fleet will pay $2.7
billion in cash up front, and another $560 million in "earn-out" from
NatWest New York's revenues over the next eight years. Fleet will also
issue $600 million in preferred stock, half of which will go to
National Westminster, and $400 million in debt securities.

The deal marks the end of National Westminster's 25-year attempt to
establish a beachhead in the volatile US banking market. Before the
deal, NatWest Bancorp had become the largest foreign- owned commercial
bank in the US, with $31.1 billion in assets ($13 billion of which will
be sold by Fleet to finance the acquisition). But the bank failed to
create sufficient scale, and blundered into buying several New Jersey
banks before the US real estate market collapse in the early 1990s.
National Westminster ended by spending a total of $3.3 billion buying
its US franchise and then bailing out its loan losses. National
Westminster is expected to use the cash from the sale to acquire a US
asset management firm.

BRANCHES STILL PROVIDE MOST REVENUE

NEW RESEARCH by First Manhattan Consulting Group suggests that most US
retail banking profits come from customers who do all their business at
branches and that retail customers who rely exclusively or primarily on
remote delivery still represent a small, if strategically significant,
segment.

Culling data from five major US retail institutions, First Manhattan
found that 40 percent of retail customers rely exclusively on branches,
48 percent use branches and self-service systems, 8 percent use
branches for deposits only, 2 percent use mostly self-service, and the
remaining 2 percent conduct all business through remote delivery
systems.

But the 40 percent who only use branches contribute 60 percent of
retail earnings, while the 10 percent who use self-service except for
deposits contribute 20 percent of profits. The "mixed channel users"
are the least profitable group, representing 50 percent of all retail
accounts but only 20 percent of retail profits.

"We had better be careful in any attempts to radically downsize the
branch system," First Manhattan president James McCormick told an
audience of retail bankers at the recent Retail Delivery Systems
conference in Atlanta. The branch system continues to offer commercial
banks a strategic stronghold in their struggle against non-banks, he
said.

McCormick noted that "mixed-channel" users are the toughest to serve
profitably, and that the best solution is to push these customers
toward remote systems in a way that assures that"self- service
substitutes for branches, not complements them". A number of US
institutions, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America and Keycorp, have
pursued this goal by offering low-cost ATM accounts to customers who
agree to use only remote media for routine transactions. But McCormick
said this approach should be evaluated carefully, lest banks forfeit
valuable transaction revenue.

THE BENCHMARKING IMPERATIVE

Richard McManus explains the rationale behind benchmarking and suggests
that bankers have much to learn from both within and outside their
industry

RETAIL BANKS facing increased competition from both traditional and new
rivals are looking for methods to improve the value proposition that
they present to current and prospective customers. As competition
ratchets up those that do not keep pace are doomed. Discriminating
customers will take flight, opting for providers that devise product
and service combinations which more closely match requirements.

In an increasingly competitive environment it is crucial to have a
clear vision of the future and a sure touch in managing change.
Benchmarking can help in both regards if it is properly undertaken.

It helps an organisation shape its future strategy and build necessary
capabilities on the basis of an understanding of what has worked for
other successful organisations. It involves learning from the
experience of others, rather than solely by doing and making one's own
mistakes.

`Piggy-backing' on the success of others makes particular sense when
agility gives an edge in the marketplace. Customers spoilt for choice
are demanding, and winning their support is the aim of each market
participant. But with the pace of change increasing `time-to-market'
also matters. And to create motivating customer propositions more
quickly there is merit in systematically trawling for best practice
both within and outside the financial services sector.

Benchmarking can support step-change improvements in the customer value
proposition. One of the most significant barriers to innovation is past
success. This gives rise to organisational arrogance which takes the
form "we always do things in such and such a way" or "we know best".

Innovative ideas may be dismissed with an assertion that current
success confirms there is no need to change. Or, equally, inflexible
employees may suggest a new approach `invented elsewhere' simply will
not work.

Benchmarking, at the activity level, can highlight organisational
arrogance. But, at the same time, it can kick-start innovation by
generating concrete examples of best practice. Such examples show
innovation to be the prerequisite of survival rather than unnecessary
or infeasible.

Retail banks committed to learning from others can look for creative
approaches which build customer value advantages vis-a- vis competition
without sacrificing speed. The senior management team, armed with an
acute appreciation of evolving customer needs and changing competitor
capabilities, should seek out proven approaches which can be adapted.
The customer-driven retail bank cannot afford either to stand still or
waste time re-inventing the wheel.

Inevitable popularity

It is not surprising that businesses `catch the benchmarking bug' in
competitive marketplaces. In essence, properly undertaken benchmarking
gives senior management the wherewithal to overcome organisational
inertia. It entails the adaptation of demonstrable success to sustain a
customer proposition which is preferred over and above the alternatives
offered by local competition. It generates information which helps
management improve customer value and create defensible advantage.

Benchmarking output is, therefore, an essential raw material of
successful competitive strategy. And in an increasingly international
marketplace the scope of a benchmarking study must be global.

In Strategic Benchmarking, Gregory Watson has charted the evolution of
benchmarking as a developing science. He argues that there are five
generations.

In the `first generation' it is nothing more than reverse engineering.
This reflects the fact that benchmarking became popular initially in
the fields of civil engineering and computer hardware and software. The
challenge was to better the functionality offered by a competitor
product.

In the `second generation' `competitive benchmarking' involves moving
beyond product-oriented examples to include comparisons of the
processes that lie behind the products. The point is that a successful
competitor needs to know both what the market requires and how to
provide it cost effectively.

In the `third generation' `process benchmarking' represents a natural
progression. Enlightened organisations come to realise that the how is
often more important than the what. Product innovation can give
competitive advantage but this can be easily and rapidly copied. But it
is often far more difficult to identify and replicate the processes
which the innovator has pioneered. These processes are not in the
public domain.

In the `third generation' Watson asserts "quality leaders recognised
that they could learn more easily from companies outside their industry
than from competitive studies".

There are two reasons for this claim. The first is that it is often
difficult to share information within an industry without prompting
concerns over anti-competitive behaviour or stalemate competition. The
second is that information from outside an industry often provides more
insight because it forces management to think from first principles
rather than implement incremental improvements. In summary, those
looking outside their immediate industry can expect a willingness to
share information and a freshness of view.

In the `fourth generation' `strategic benchmarking' represents a
further increase in sophistication. Watson suggests it is"a systematic
process for evaluating alternatives, implementing strategies and
improving performance by understanding and adapting strategies from
external partners who participate in an ongoing business alliance".

In essence, it involves a commitment to learn how the business can be
re-engineered to support better customer value propositions. It entails
root and branch change rather than minor improvement and, as a result,
it is likely to give a competitive edge.

Watson argues that the `fifth generation' will be `global
benchmarking'. This will entail businesses scouring the world for best
practices which can valuably be applied to improve their own customer
value propositions. Leading-edge businesses already adopt this
approach.

In planning a global consumer financial services strategy a few years
ago, GE Capital decided to benchmark (among others) American Express,
Citicorp, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, MasterCard, Barclays Bank and AIG. The
point is that a parochial perspective leaves an institution vulnerable.
It is ill-prepared for competition from powerful traditional and non-
traditional rivals in other geographic areas.

The popularity of benchmarking today probably in part reflects the way
in which this practice has evolved. In Watson's `first generation' it
represents nothing more than straightforward competitor analysis. And
no business in a competitive marketplace can argue against this.

But by the `fifth generation' benchmarking has become something quite
different. It is all about trawling internationally to establish which
best practices will underpin motivating customer propositions. It takes
account of the fact that customers are the arbiters of commercial
success. And it recognises that a parochial orientation will not prompt
necessary innovation.

In spite of the way in which benchmarking has evolved, however, there
can be no doubt that even institutions new to the practice need to come
to terms with the fifth generation. It is futile to plan a gradual
migration from first to fifth generation behaviour. An institution
following this course in a competitive market will not survive long
enough to complete it.

Activities and Processes

Benchmarking is predicated upon the notion that all businesses,
including the retail banking business, can be broken down into a series
of activities and processes. This is significant for two reasons. The
first is that some activities and processes, are more important than
others. The second is that comparative measurement both within and
outside an industry sector is possible at this level.

The critical activities and processes are those that add most customer
value. Superiority in undertaking these will lead to significant
comparative advantage in a competitive marketplace. And an organisation
learning from international best practice at the activity and process
level will be capable of world class performance.

So what are the activities and processes that make up the retail
banking business? One possible diagrammatic representation of the
activities is shown in Figure 2. But the processes that lie behind
these activities are necessarily in a state of flux as customers'
tastes change, new technology becomes available and competitor
innovation makes an impact.

In the product management area, for example, design and packaging used
to be all that was required. When a competitor came out with a new
product that met with success in the marketplace others moved quickly
to copy it. But this is where the problem lies.

It is impossible to build a worthwhile advantage vis-a-vis competition
when emulation is relatively easy. And, to use Watson's terminology, as
first and second generation benchmarking became prevalent, product
management needed to evolve. It is now more a question of targeting
particular customer segments by devising a suitable mix of products.

The optimum mix reflects the long-term mission of a retail bank rather
than the recent market success of a local rival. This is important
because it demonstrates that a product range which suits one
institution may be completely inappropriate for another which has a
different customer focus. And as the European enthusiasm for allfinanz
spreads throughout the world it is wise to question whether it is
necessary to add insurance to traditional retail banking products.

The answer depends on the customer focus and whether the retail bank
committed to allfinanz is in the vanguard or merely copying successful
local rivals.

In essence, some but not all customers will buy a comprehensive range
of financial products from one supplier because they lack the
confidence or inclination to shop around. And allfinanz first-movers
will tend to win these customers leaving late converts with the
unenviable task of trying to change the buying behaviour of other
customer segments.

Against this backdrop, it must be wise to benchmark product management
in allfinanz first-movers and to review critically the market response
to late converts.

So much for product management. The marketing and sales activity is
similarly in a state of flux. In the past, this required little more
than some corporate image work and the dissemination of product
information. But enlightened retail banks are now making sure their
marketeers focus on building meaningful customer brands.

As previous issues of CEO Confidential have argued this involves
positioning products and services in such a way as to ensure they are
preferred by customers. Effective brands improve profitability because
the associated benefits of increased market share or superior price
realisation outweigh the costs of brand creation. It is worth noting
that the most profitable retail banks often achieve this position by
charging high prices. This may reflect an uncompetitive market or the
marketeers earning their keep.

It seems that marketing and sales will be more about sophisticated
customer segmentation and carefully tailored communication in the
future. The segmentation will compartmentalise customers on the basis
of buying behaviour and motivation.

It is possible to address such coherent groups in a persuasive way
because they act and think alike. The marketing and sales initiatives
which result from this approach are a far cry from the general
corporate positioning statements on which too many retail banks
currently rely.

When it comes to benchmarking there is no shortage of organisations
that are committed to sophisticated customer segmentation and the
associated tailored communication. In the finance sector, the credit
card companies embracing affinity group marketing lead the way. But the
airline and automotive industries, among others, can also provide
valuable insights.

Distribution management is probably one of the most critical activities
for retail banks today. This reflects the fact that convenience so
often underpins the financial institution selection decision. And
convenience implies ease of access.

In the past, retail banks with a comprehensive branch network were
preferred because branch-based distribution was the norm. Where
alternatives existed either few customer were aware of them or most
were disinclined to use them. But this is all changing.

Direct delivery channels, particularly those using the conventional
phone, are in the ascendancy. And, as traditional retail banks launch
their telephone banking operations, they legitimise and promote this
change in delivery emphasis. This is all well and good but, in a sense,
retail banks with extensive branch networks are playing into the hands
of non-bank rivals without a bricks and mortar heritage.

This is not to say that turning one's back on direct delivery is a
rational choice. But the key distribution management issue facing
traditional retail banks is how to ensure a smooth transition from the
delivery emphasis of the past to that suitable in the future.

The critical concern for the branch-reliant is how to achieve a high
branch utilisation while focusing attention on new delivery channels.
Natural pressure to justify the overhead of new delivery channels can
lead to existing customers being encouraged to migrate from branch
delivery. As a result, an unchanged branch overhead becomes more
burdensome. New efficient costs are overlaid on inefficient costs. But
the net result is a worsening cost position, particularly when
cannibalisation is the norm and, therefore, capacity utilisation in
each channel is poor.

Against this backdrop it is wise to benchmark those institutions that
prove themselves skilful in both managing capacity utilisation and
matching delivery channel to customer segment.

Wells Fargo is an example in the finance sector of a retail bank that
has become more reliant on ATMs and supermarket branches without being
encumbered with the costs of the traditional branch network. But there
are also lessons from other retail businesses.

Some department stores have embraced the shop-within-a-shop concept
where concessions are given to specialist retailers in order to bolster
sales per outlet. Other retailers have built complementary mail order
businesses without wholesale outlet closure. And there are examples in
the restaurant and leisure business of one operator running competing
concepts with distinct delivery formats.

In the finance sector it is wrong to think about delivery as being
completely separate from the product proposition. Quite the reverse is
the case. There must be a fit between the customer segments, the
product and the delivery channel. But the same is true for other retail
concepts that seek to build a brand image.

The delivery approach is an integral part of the brand. And more and
more retail banks will come to realise that different delivery channels
are best targeted at different customer segments.

In the long term, it is probable that many will seek to make different
product and delivery combinations into distinct brands. They will
follow a trail blazed by businesses in other sectors and as a result
benchmarking will help.

In the customer service area the transition which will be important for
most retail banks is from uniform service to customised service. The
emphasis in recent years has been upon introducing and policing higher
service standards. Many banks have recognised that failing to make the
grade in customer service is an unforgivable failing in the service
business. But the desire to improve service has led to inflexible and
sometimes inappropriate standards. Service means different things to
different people and, worse still, it means different things at
different times.

Bearing in mind this and the cost of service provision the astute
retail bank will strive to match service performance to the customer
and the occasion. Those adopting this approach are treating customer
service as a profit rather than a cost centre.

From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that in the financial
services sector the direct providers will make the running. They are
able to make the notion of the `segment of one' an operational reality.

But outside financial services there will be valuable lessons from the
hotel, airline and restaurant business. Each of these grapple with the
problem of treating different customers in different ways within the
same delivery channel. And each suffer from the difficulty faced by
retail banks where the delivery channel is an integral part of the
overall proposition.

In processing and administration the retail bank emphasis is going to
shift away from securing back-office efficiency towards tasks which
improve customer information and facilitate risk management. It is not
that efficiency is a bad thing. It is a prerequisite, but it is also
insufficient for success.

The challenge facing retail banks is not only to do things efficiently
but to do the right things. And the learning organisation realises that
day-to-day interactions with existing customers can provide a wealth of
information to help in customer retention and customer acquisition
initiatives.

Not to put too fine a point on it, failure to build a `feedback loop'
from arrears management to marketing is pure folly unless the aim is to
keep the arrears department busy!

From a benchmarking point of view it is likely that the credit card
companies will pioneer state-of-art processing and administration in
the finance sector. They already ensure that prospective profitability
drives marketing initiatives and they are sophisticated in risk
management.

But outside the finance sector there will be valuable lessons to be
learned from direct response marketing companies and the mail order
industry. And it is possible that government bureaucracies facing
pressures to cut costs may also give some pointers to retail banks. In
many countries the tax authorities, for example, have simplified
administrative tasks and shifted much of the burden onto their clients.
Those embarking on re-engineering of the back-office should take note.

In customer information the retail bank emphasis is going to be upon
garnering the information which is necessary for customer segmentation
and marketing purposes. This will certainly represent far more than
basic demographic information and details on who holds which products.

Information will include the kind of data which enables a retail bank
to cluster customers into groups which are homogenous both in terms of
products purchased and motivating factors. And it will involve an
assessment of profitability by customer and segment.

The key point is that it is such customer information which will help
senior management determine the long-term strategy for the retail bank.
As a result, customer information helps shape the other activities
which make up the retail bank and redefine the important processes. In
company jargon, the organisation becomes customer-driven.

From a benchmarking point of view retail banks and credit card
companies that have got to the bottom of customer profitability will be
well worth studying. And, as with processing and administration, direct
response marketing companies and the mail order industry will provide
some pointers.

In conclusion

Benchmarking on a global basis provides valuable input to the strategy
formulation process. It is not done once and for all but should rather
be a continuous process. This reflects the fact that rivals will
undoubtedly copy success.

A key task for senior management is to set for the organisation
challenging objectives that stand the test of time. This involves
striving for superiority and not purely in those activities and
processes which have the greatest impact upon customer value. The
emphasis selected will reflect the customer focus, the organisational
heritage and the anticipated competitor approach. The benchmarking
questions to be answered are quite simply:

What do we benchmark?  Who do we benchmark?  How do we act on the basis
of benchmarking insight in our organisation?

HONG KONG: COUNTDOWN TO DESTINY

As the year 1997 approaches Andrew Moody assesses the sentiment among
Hong Kong's retail bankers

LIKE MANY other sectors in Hong Kong, retail banking has thrived on the
colony's seemingly never-ending era of economic growth. Over the past
ten years the economy has sustained annual GDP growth of 6 percent.

The main consequence of this - the colony's 6 million people growing
ever wealthier and more middle class - has proved a rich seam for Hong
Kong's retail banks.

These banks, which make up around 30 of the 180 licensed banks in Hong
Kong, have enjoyed levels of profitability which their western
counterparts could only dream of.

Banking profits have been sustained even against a background of zero
real interest rates (the prime rate of 9 percent remains identical to
last year's annual inflation) and narrow spreads.

But as 1997 looms large, uncertainty over Chinese intentions is having
a damaging and uncertain effect on the market. A report to be published
later this month by the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts that
growth will fall dramatically from 4.5 percent in 1995 to 3.5 percent
this year and just 1.7 percent in 1997.

This could prove damaging for retail banks which, so far, have managed
to avoid large-scale branch closures and panic consolidation which now
so pre-occupies western banks. It may also bring with it bad customers -
 a rarity in Hong Kong where getting into financial difficulties
involves Chinese "loss of face".

Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of Hang Seng Bank, the
second largest locally incorporated bank with 138 branches, recognises
the problem.

"The general impression in Hong Kong is that the industry is confronted
by a less favourable trading environment," he says. "The feeling is
that a period of high growth has passed and that a period of
consolidation will follow. But let's not forget that, although growth
may be slowing in the industry, banks in Hong Kong are still among the
most profitable in the world."

If ever the idea meeteth the man then retail banking and the people of
Hong Kong are one of life's happy coincidences. Unlike in the west,
where single bank relationships are the norm, Hong Kong residents have
on average 2.4 accounts in 1.9 banks. This is a territory in which even
little old ladies play the currency markets with their nest egg and
expect their bank to provide them with foreign exchange deposit
accounts with which they can swap currencies at a whim.

Another headache for the banks is the almost frenetic use of the system
by individual customers. The Hongkong Bank estimates its customers
interact with it on average an astonishing 16 times a month.

The precise size of the retail banking market is difficult to gauge,
but $HK 2.1 trillion ($290 billion) is held as deposits with licensed
banks of which savings deposits comprise $HK 418 billion and current
accounts just $HK 115 billion.

Current accounts play a relatively insignificant role in Hong Kong
retail banking with banks regarding deposit accounts and mortgages as
the core product on which to initiate a relationship with a customer.
The newspapers, both Chinese and English, are full of advertisements
for the latest interest rates on deposit account and mortgage products.

"What you want is someone to come in and take a mortgage from you. You
have then got them for at least nine or ten years," says David K.P. Li,
deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East Asia.

"They would typically be a young couple in their late 20s or early 30s
borrowing between $HK1.5 million and $HK1.8 million to buy a 900 square
foot apartment, the repayments on which would set them back around 60
percent of their income. You can then sell them decoration loans,
credit cars, overdrafts and help them with hire purchase for a car," he
adds.

Ironically, in a city brimming with local entrepreneurial talent, the
main product innovators in Hong Kong retail banking are the foreign
banks.

Inextricably linked to the colony, Hongkong Bank and Standard Chartered
wear thin the definition of foreign, but they dominate the market along
with Citibank and the Hang Seng Bank, the latter part of the Hongkong
Bank since the mid-1960s but separately listed and, perhaps to a lesser
degree, the Bank of East Asia.

They have led the way with smart cards, foreign currency deposit
accounts (targeted at mid-range customers in Hong Kong) and tax loans,
a very popular product in a territory where there is no PAYE.

This is something readily conceded by smaller local banks such as the
Dah Sing Bank, a traditional trade finance bank which only moved into
retail in the last few years.

"Basically, I would agree that the bigger foreign banks have dominated
the market. It has been difficult for the smaller banks because of lack
of resources and the cost of technology, but I sense that things are
beginning to change," says Derek Wong, Dah Sing's head of retail.

A yet to be proven catalyst to greater competition could be the slow
but still partial demise of the Hong Kong interest rate cartel which
began two years ago.

Under the cartel, all deposit interest rates used to be fixed weekly by
the Hong Kong Association of Banks. In October 1994 time deposits fixed
for more than one month were deregulated and in January last year it
was left to individual banks to set their rates for deposits over seven
days.

The larger banks remain unhappy about the break-up. According to recent
analysis, it has led to a 5 percent drop in deposits as a result of
falling interest rates.

Hang Seng's Au is worried it has created another uncertainty in the run-
up to 1997. "Although the industry is not against deregulation there is
a concern it has affected bank profitability and that some banks may
compensate by writing more risky loans," he says.

The smaller players believe it has brought much needed competition to
the market, allowing them to buy market share by setting their own
interest rates.

"The status quo ante made no sense really. Deregulation offers more
opportunity to the medium-sized banks. We can offer lower interest
rates as a way of competing against the bigger players. I believe we
can also react faster than the local banks," says Sergio Rial, the
Brazilian general manager of Dutch bank ABN AMRO in Hong Kong.

Western banks have a lot to learn from the luxurious and airy design of
many of the branches in Hong Kong. In a place where land is more
expensive than anywhere else in the world there is no point in building
a shed. Customers too are treated with great courtesy in the banks,
something not typical in the retail business across the whole of Hong
Kong.

"In the UK if you go into a branch to make a transaction, say deposit a
cheque, all you will get is a stamped stub. It astonishes me how people
will deposit large sums of money and virtually have no proof of doing
so. In Hong Kong, the customer will get a printed out receipt precisely
recording the transaction," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail,
marketing and planning, Hongkong Bank.

The ATM is king in Hong Kong with many more machines per 10,000 of the
population than in the US or the UK. You cannot, in fact, pass an ATM
in Hong Kong without seeing a large gathering of people, many seemingly
not queuing to use it, but perhaps taking time out to worship Mammon,
surely Hong Kong's truest god. Customers not only draw money out at
ATMs but also pay their utility bills with the use of a swipe card.

The love of gadgetry of all kinds would seemingly make Hong Kong ripe
for a direct banking revolution. The fall-off in economic growth would
also seem to necessitate that the banks move faster towards automation
in order to cut costs and retain profit margins. Yet Hong Kong's moves
towards direct delivery are perhaps more primitive than their western
counterparts.

The leading banks have offered telephone banking since 1990 but it is
still very much an in-branch service. The nearest one gets to a UK-
style First Direct operation is a voice response computer at the other
end of the line.

A key reason why the direct banking has not swept the colony is the
problem of getting phone operatives in a land of virtually full
employment.

As Sergio Rial of ABN AMRO explains: "The real barrier to telephone
banking developing in Hong Kong is that professional people don't want
to sit behind a phone all day and in this place they have a right to
choose. Skilled people want to do creative jobs, not pay people's
utility bills and check passwords," he says. "It is one of those things
that has not really caught on and it is presenting real difficulties
for the banks.

"I think what will happen here is that there will be a sudden quantum
leap from ordinary branch banking to PC home-based banking, largely by-
passing the telephone banking stage. This will satisfy the enthusiasm
for gadgetry among Hong Kong people and solve the cost headache for the
banks."

Citibank insists its telephone banking operation has been a success
with its customers. "We have achieved 90 percent satisfaction from our
customers compared to 82 percent from our normal branch banking
business," says Peter Wong, the bank's vice president of global
consumer banking in Hong Kong.

Many of the banks have not as yet embarked on major branch closure
programmes. Hongkong Bank has closed just 20 in the last two years
bringing its total down to 220; the Dah Sing Bank has reduced its
number over the same period from 53 to 43; Citibank has closed mainly
smaller branches, and most of the other banks have only made limited
cutbacks.

There have, however, been moves to segment the market by developing
specific branches for different categories of customers.

The most marked move in this direction has come from the Hongkong Bank,
which now has three different types of branches - select branches for
upmarket customers, standard branches for regular customers and day and
night automated branches.

"Competition for profitable retail customers in the territory has
rarely been keener. We have responded by introducing a strategy that
involves segmenting the way we serve the market," says Hongkong's Eric
Tai. "The select branches will guarantee that we can provide our valued
upmarket customers with the highest quality of service."

The Bank of East Asia services its upmarket customers by delivering
services direct to a customer's office or home. "It is a far more
subtle way of dealing with major clients and, I believe, just as
effective," says Dr Li.

One of the most controversial aspects of banking in Hong Kong is the
stranglehold the larger banks have over the Hong Kong Association of
Banks (HKAB).

It is chaired in rotation by Standard Chartered, Hongkong Bank and now
the Bank of China (which began its first term of office this year).

Many other banks have restricted rights of membership to its committee
and yet the HKAB is all powerful, still setting regulated interest
rates, policing the system and acting as a clearing house.

The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the supposed central bank, does not
even issue notes (still done by the major banks) and is not even a
banker to the Government.

Dr Li, who apart from running the Bank of East Asia is the sole
financial institution representative on the colony's main law making
body, the Legislative Council or Legco, insists the system must change.

"The whole system is very colonial. It is what Singapore was like 45
years ago. The Hong Kong Association of Banks is an old boys' club with
the chairmanship running between three banks," he says. "The Governor
Chris Patten talks about democracy, but we have one of the most
undemocratic institutions on our own doorstep. The whole system
encourages `yes' people. I certainly thought the cartel worked against
the interests of the consumer."

It is a view echoed by Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, which
does not always get its own seat on the HKBA committee: "It is not a
level playing field. The HKBA should incorporate more players so the
flow of information can be better."

Li also insists that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is
still the lender of last resort and, as such, exerts too much control
over the system. He wants the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to assume
that role officially.

"The colony must have an official lender of last resort. At present,
the smaller banks may have a credit line of say $HK30 million from the
Hongkong Bank and if it exceeds that it may get charged 3 percent above
prime which is very steep," he says.

Hong Kong unlike other banking centres has not yet seen a period of
major consolidation between banks.

The main highlights have been the purchase by the Dah Sing Bank of the
Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Bank from the Hong Kong government
and then three years ago its acquisition of the Wingon bank from the
Hang Seng Bank. The Dao Heng, the third largest local bank, bought the
Hang Lung Bank in 1989 and the Overseas Trust Bank in 1993.

Opinion is divided as to whether harsher economic conditions will lead
to a spate of more substantial mergers.

 Dr Li again: "I think consolidation will come. I think there are two
or three banks here that would benefit from merger, although I believe
there is a cultural resistance to it. A lot of the local banks are
family controlled and Chinese people don't like to lose face by seeing
their family's heritage being taken over."

Banks, which have stayed clear of retail for generations, are now
moving into the market.

The Dah Sing Bank, traditionally a trade finance bank, has come up with
some of the most aggressive retail products in the marketplace.

One is a credit card which has a generous cash bonus point scheme that
effectively reduces the monthly rate of interest on borrowings to 1.5
percent, significantly less than the 2 percent to 2.5 percent market
average.

Competitors say the card has flopped and is losing money, something
which Derek Wong head of retail denies. "We have built up a lot of
business over the past 18 months with this card. We had a lot of
initial free advertising because it was such a revolutionary new
product," he says.

ABN AMRO, one of the oldest established international banks in Hong
Kong, has also been a late entrant to retail, although it is perhaps
the first non-British European bank to do so. It has also gone in hard
on price undercutting other banks, particularly in mortgages.

General manager Rial insists the strategy has worked, claiming that
retail banking had grown from nil to 30 percent of profits of the bank
in Hong Kong in three years: "It has proved to be a very good move. We
have a leaner structure than many of the other banks and we do not have
the costs of a large staff branch network. We are also an AA bank, so
we can fund ourselves better than many of our competitors," he says.

But the biggest issue in Hong Kong retail banking as in the colony as a
whole has to be 1997. It creates an uncertainty that perhaps only a
financial centre as strong as Hong Kong could withstand. There is a
feeling in the banking community that those who were going to leave
have left and that capital outflows over the coming 18 months will not
be that significant.

"The current situation is no good for business. The name- calling
between the various political interest groups only makes people
nervous. It will be better when the 1997 deadline passes," says
Randolph Sullivan, managing director, Dao Heng Bank.

And ABN AMRO's Rial believes stories of Hong Kong's death as a
financial centre have been greatly exaggerated."Shanghai will not
replace Hong Kong as a regional financial centre in my lifetime at
least. To be a financial centre, the market has to accept that you are
a financial centre and whole infrastructure and framework has to be
there. Hong Kong will continue to be pivotal in Asia," he adds.

BANKING ON THE LONG HAUL

Eric Tai, senior executive, retail marketing and planning with Hongkong
Bank speaks to Andrew Moody

ERIC TAI is senior executive, retail, marketing and planning for
Hongkong Bank, the leading international bank in Asia outside of Japan.
It has 500 offices in 19 countries in Asia and boasts one of the
largest global proprietary ATM networks in the world with 170,000
machines. The bank's earnings have expanded by a compound rate of 22
percent over the past 25 years. Tai began his career in insurance and
had a spell working for Commercial Union in the UK. Before joining
Hongkong Bank, he worked for Citibank and ANZ.

RBI: Retail banking margins in many countries in the west are now very
narrow and there are pressures to cross-sell higher margin products.
Are there similar pressures in Hong Kong?

Eric Tai: Retail banking is more profitable in Hong Kong than in the
UK, for example, on virtually every ratio you want to talk about. This
is partly to do with serving a smaller geographical area and having
customers with a higher savings ratio, around 30 percent compared to 9
percent in the UK. This means you can do things in a more cost
effective way without the same pressures to cross-sell.

But although we are not driven to sell other products to supplement our
retail banking income we do so because people want to buy these
products from the banks, which they trust. The fact that we also make
money out of this is just a win-win situation. We are moving into
derivative products and we have just launched a universal life product
which we haven't sold before.

RBI: Why is banking in Hong Kong so profitable?

ET: It is not because of margins, which are actually narrower than in
the UK or US. Rather, it is lucrative because of Hong Kong's huge trade
flows, because GDP has grown at 7 percent annually since 1980 and
because Hong Kong is the world's largest forex centre and seventh
largest stockmarket. Per capita income now exceeds that of Europe. And
very, very few bank loans go bad.

RBI: Which product do you have to sell a customer in Hong Kong in order
to build a long-term relationship?

ET: We don't have the situation in the UK or the US where everyone is
chasing the cheque account. The market is very different here and they
are not something we chase, although they are free funds. We have
people with heaps of money who don't have cheque accounts.

The coat hanger product and the one we chase is the deposit account
and, to some extent, AssetVantage and PowerVantage. These lock the
customer in on a much more all-round basis than mere transactional
banking. Our strategy works in that we have a relationship with 60
percent to 70 percent of the bankable population.

RBI: What is your view of the partial break up of the Hong Kong
interest rate cartel?

ET: It has certainly put more pressure on margins and has freed up
competitive forces in the marketplace. It has added extra uncertainty
in the marketplace and reduced the predictability and stability of the
economy in the run-up to 1997.

RBI: A number of your rivals are trying to compete heavily on price.
How are you responding to this?

ET: The deposit interest rates offered by some of our competitors could
sometimes be as much as 20 percent higher than ours. There has been
some market buying and market share purchasing, but we have no
intention of being a price driver.

We do a lot of things sufficiently well to reduce the impact of this
and segmenting the market is also a way of coping with the competition.

RBI: How much emphasis has Hongkong Bank placed on providing direct
banking services to its customers?

ET: We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another.
We can do telephone, we can do fax. We are not doing home banking yet
but we are coming along with it. We are currently working with Hongkong
Telecom jointly to do TV banking. All the different interfaces which
are possible technologically are being looked at to find the most cost
effective and most customer receptive forms of direct banking to
implement.

Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is still
offered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separate
entity such as First Direct.

RBI: Has the move towards direct banking been driven by cost
considerations?

ET: Retail banks, like all businesses, in Hong Kong, face staff
shortages. Unemployment has held steady at under 3 percent for years,
which has led to a steady rise in personnel costs. At Hongkong Bank,
with our big branch network, the staff shortage has been so acute at
lower levels that we now employ several hundred bank tellers from
China.

The positive aspect of this staff shortage is that we have been forced
to introduce a high level of technology in our branches. We have put in
place machines that automatically provide up-to- date balances on
passbooks, as well as automatic deposit machines which count a
customer's cash deposit and credit it instantly to his or her account.

RBI: Hongkong Bank has taken the somewhat unique step of creating three
distinct types of branches for different grades of customer. What is
the logic behind this?

ET: We believe creating three distinct type of branches is the best
method of delivering the right products and services to the right
customers. So we have what we call select branches for our high grade
customers, standard branches, which are just normal branches, and
automated branches, which operate day and night.

To be a customer at a select branch you have to be invited by a branch
manager or be a user of a particular product. The automated branches
currently have two people in them and with more investment in
technology they will be taken out.

A product which would gain you access to a select branch is
AssetVantage, which is a bundled collection of products sold as a half-
way point to private banking. This is similar to first class service on
an airline. You need to have a minimum deposit of $HK200,000 ($25,900)
and for this you are able to have savings accounts in 30 different
currencies and also gold trade.

We have also launched PowerVantage which is more like business class.
It is intended for younger high-earning customers. We have also
launched a special kind of account aimed at small business operators
called BusinessVantage.

Although we segment the market, however, banking is banking is banking
and you can't really offer a significantly different service to one
customer compared to another.

Banking in Hong Kong is often a social activity and since you are
offered coffee and chocolates at the select branches people often bring
their friends to the bank to do their transactions.

RBI: Are you pandering to the notion that banking in Hong Kong is tied
up with status?

ET: I have a very good friend in the UK and he says to me that he
cannot stand the high street banks because they don't look after him.
They don't treat him as someone special and this is something we try to
avoid here.

RBI: What pressures are there on you to close branches and reduce
staffing to rationalise costs?

ET: We have streamlined branches from around 240 two years ago to 220
now. We will continue to look at cutting the number of branches, but
the actual network remains unchanged.

Essentially what we have done is to close some of the smaller branches
and consolidate the bigger branches. Some of the closures have been
made for safety reasons because we had a fire in one of our branches
and needed improved safety facilities.

We are reducing staffing by using more part-timers so we have the
appropriate number of staff in the branches according to how busy we
are. The more flexible use of people has enabled us to cut staff costs
significantly. We want to find more efficient ways of doing things but,
at the same time, we don't want to reduce the service we provide to
customers. In fact, we set a minimum service standard for a particular
product and work to those benchmarks continually checking our customer
satisfaction levels.

RBI: How much pressure comes from the fact that bank customers use
their banks more regularly in Hong Kong than in other parts of the
world?

ET: Yes, essentially it does. It puts a lot of peak load requirement on
our network, particularly when salaries and social security are paid
into customer accounts.

We have customers in our mid-market sector who will interface with the
bank up to 16 times a month, which is more or less every day, if you
ignore the weekend. The number of transactional interfaces is indeed a
problem and we can only deal with it by having efficient systems.

RBI: How big an impact do you think 1997 will have on the retail
banking market in Hong Kong?

ET: As far as we are concerned we are here for the long haul. If we
didn't believe in China we would not be opening branches there. The
change of sovereignty will naturally have some effect. But I think the
potential is still there to carry on doing business the way we think
best. If some of our customers decide to place their money abroad then
we hope our global network will capture some of it.

RBI: How much Chinese money is coming into Hong Kong?

ET: Heaps. We estimate that China has invested $US20 billion in the
territory.

RBI: How much benefit have you derived from the link up with Midland in
the UK?

ET: I believe it has added to our global presence. These things are
often difficult to quantify. Our customers, however, now have access to
ATM machines in the UK, which can often be very useful.

RBI: How much competition do you face from non-banks?

ET: This is certainly on the increase. It is a big issue for us.
Property developers and retailers are providing their own credit cards.
I think if we don't take them seriously they will become big.

RBI: What is your view of the Hong Kong economy?

ET: It has come off since the property boom of 1993/94 which generated
a lot of income. The credit squeeze in China to reduce inflation there
from 30 percent to around 20 percent has had some effect over the past
12 to 18 months. US demand for Hong Kong goods has also subsided. These
seem to be the main factors behind the fall off in growth.

RBI: How much of a presence do you have in other Asian countries?

ET: The bank's greatest success is in Hong Kong itself but we do have a
significant presence in other countries in the region. We are the
largest foreign bank in Singapore, where we play a role in running the
cheque clearing system. We also have a key presence in India, where we
have 21 branches.

We are constrained from expanding in many countries but have been
helped recently by market liberalisation. In the Philippines, we are
taking advantage of this and are expanding our network from two to
eight branches. We have also been allowed to add two new facilities in
Thailand and are growing steadily in Indonesia.

Indochina is becoming increasingly important for us. We have just
opened an office in Burma and are in the process of upgrading our rep
office in Ho Chi Minh City to a branch.

REGULATORY DISCUSSION A MUST FOR ELECTRONIC BANKING

     Confront home banking regulatory issues now or risk losing your
ability to influence lawmakers, said speakers at last week's  Emerging
Law of Cyberbanking conference here.
     Unless bankers are proactive and cooperate with regulators now to
solve issues, such as whether chip-card transactions are cash or check
exchanges, "it will be decided when a member of Congress loses a chip
card or stored value card with $1,000 on it," warned Karen Petrou,
president of ISD/Shaw Inc. consultancy in Washington, D.C.
     Although the industry ignored legislators last year, when asked
for suggestions about regulating electronic banking, a few rulings,
opinions and real life experiences exist to guide you.

SFNB Operates Within Existing Law

     Banks could copy Security First Network Bank (SFNB) of Pineville,
Ky., without a major investment in regulatory applications or
challenges, said Stuart Stein, a partner in the financial institutions
practice group with Hogan & Hartson law firm in Washington, D.C. 
Stein's firm advises SFNB on banking law applicable to its new
business strategies.
     SFNB found that it could be the first to offer Internet banking
without applying for a new charter or filing a separate Federal
Reserve application, he said.
     Initially, Cardinal BancShares, SFNB's parent company, received
approval to consolidate and sell five branches to spin-off SFNB.  But
it did not need Regulation Y approval from the Federal Reserve.  Reg Y
applies to bank and non-bank holding company expansion, Stein
explained.
     After the spinoff, SFNB changed its business from traditional
thrift activities to soliciting deposits and purchasing loans over the
Internet, Stein said.  The bank opened its Internet doors last year
and recently expanded its offerings to include joint checking
accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposits and check
imaging to view cleared checks on-line (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 3.)
     The next step for SFNB may require more regulatory involvement. 
The bank plans to buy Five Paces Software and then license the
technology platform on which SFNB was built, Stein said.  Licensing
this technology to other banks likely will be considered a new
business practice for SFNB, which will require Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation and Office of Thrift Supervision approval, he
added.
     The Five Paces technology, which includes a secure operating
system that resides at the bank, was created for SFNB by WebTech Inc. 
of Atlanta, an affiliate of Atlanta-based SecureWare. 
     SFNB is not alone in its strategy.  Several banks joined last
year to buy Meca Software from H&R Block and plan to license Mec' home
banking program to other banks.

Two Agencies Publish Rules

     Clearly, the SFNB experience shows that banks can deliver any
previously offered service electronically without receiving any
regulatory grief.  But two agencies have published opinions and rules
on electronic banking regulation.
     The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency published a rules'
revision Feb. 9 supporting activities, such as those proposed by SFNB
and Meca.  The revision of part 7 of the OCC regulations states that
banks may market technology they acquired or developed for banking
purposes to third parties, said Julie Williams, chief OCC counsel (see
box, p. 3).
     The FDIC recently released two letters written in October
addressing a bank's questions about Internet banking deposit insurance
and the possible deposit broker role of third-party vendors.  The
opinions can be applied to the industry as a whole.
     One letter addresses customer funds transferred to an account
established at a bank by the sponsoring company to facilitate Internet
transactions.  The FDIC said that federal deposit insurance would flow
through to funds deposited in a third-party agency account with the
insured institution.  Insurance flows through if the company
sufficiently disclosed the capacities in which money was transmitted
to it by customers and that the company maintained adequate records
indicating the identity of customers for which it held funds.
     This approach appears to differ significantly from the approach
used by Mark Twain Bank in its DigiCash trial.  In that system, funds
are deposited directly with the bank into an insured account.  The
money becomes uninsured when withdrawn and placed into the bank's e-
cash mint, or transferred onto the hard drive of a customer's
computer, said Thomas Vartanian, managing partner of the Washington,
D.C. law office of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson.
     The second FDIC letter concludes that a sponsoring company or
third-party vendor in an Internet funds transfer program would not be
a deposit broker.
     That opinion was based on the fact that the company's "primary
purpose" was the provision of electronic payment system, rather than
the placement of funds with a depository institution.  Since no
interest was being paid on the agency account, the FDIC obviously
understood that the safety and soundness concerns articulated by
Section 29 of the FDI Act were not applicable in this case, Vartanian
said.
    Be aware, though, that the main exclusion for this FDIC ruling,
"primary purpose," is considered on a case-by-case basis.  The FDIC
considers the following key characteristics when asked if an agency is
a deposit broker:

*   Fees.  Does the party receive fees from the bank for placing funds
with the institution?

*  Purpose.  Would the relationship have been established but for the
purpose for placing funds in the bank?

*   Other Reasons.  Is there any other substantial purpose for the
activity or business other than the placement of funds in the insured
institution?

Think About Product First

    "Regulatory analysis can vary depending on what you're talking
about," said Scott Anenberg, partner and chair of the financial
institutions group at the Washington, D.C., law firm Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge.  Legal issues differ whether you're just taking
deposits or doing loans over the Internet, he said.
    Decide what the product is, how it will be offered, who will be
offering it and who is the target market before investigating
regulatory options, Anenberg said.
    Also, speakers said, consider the competition, which may not
always be another bank.  In the smart card market, for example,
Florida-based Blockbuster Entertainment Group  [VIA] is working on a
pilot and creating set-top box applications.  (Scott Anenberg, Shaw,
Pittman, 202/663-8000; Karen Petrou, ISD/Shaw, 202/296-5240; Julie
Williams, OCC, 202/874-5770; Thomas Vartanian, Fried, Frank, 202/639-
7016.) 

Specifics of OCC Revision

     The Office of the Comptroller (OCC) of the currency, last week, 
released revisions to Part 7 of its interpretive letters.  The final
rule:

*   Modernizes bank data processing rules to recognize bank
involvement in the area of electronic money.  A national bank may
perform, provide or deliver, through electronic means or facilities,
any activity, function, product or service that it is now authorized
to perform, provide or deliver.
  
*   States that a national bank may market and sell excess capacity in
electronic activities to third-parties for uses not related to
banking.

*   Clarifies that some lending activities must be completed at bank's
main office or branch.  A bank loan recipient must appear in-person at
the bank's main office or at a  branch to collect funds.  Loan
origination, approval and disbursal of loan proceeds by third parties
need not be performed at a main office or branch.

*   Defines interest to include fees for late payments, insufficient
funds, annual banking services and cash advances.  The fees can be
applied across state lines as with credit cards. 

*   Defines rules regarding banks' ability to lease excess space,
share space and share employees with businesses other than other
financial institutions.  

*   Provides national banks with added flexibility to structure their
procedures governing board and shareholder actions by permitting the
reliance on recognized complete bodies of corporate law and state laws
where the bank's main office is located.

*   Updates letter of credit provisions to reflect current industry
practices and to cover a broader category of transactions that are the
functional equivalent of letters of credit.

GROCERY STORES PROVING POPULAR BANKING VENUE

    Branch location will continue to play a central role in the
customer relationship, even as on-line banking and smart card delivery
channels become more popular, banking analysts predict (RDSN, Jan. 19,
p. 3.).  But the size, location and services offered at branches will
change, analysts say.
    In-store branches and mini-branches for grocery chains are two
alternative strategies to brick and mortar branches emerging in the
industry.  Last year, the number of in-store branch locations
increased 25 percent and now stands at more than 3,000, according to
International Banking Technologies (IBT) of Norcross, Ga., an in-store
branch consulting company.  These branches average 400 to 800 square
feet and are staffed with several bank employees.
    Mini-branches are the newest solution emerging as a tool to reach
busy consumers, said IBT's President John Garnett.  Mini-branches
range in size from 35 square feet to 100 square feet and are automated
with self-service loan and teller machines and video conferencing
modules.  The mini-branch is staffed by one or two employees, he said.
     Mini-branches have greater space devoted to automated and self-
service delivery, freeing specialized staff to make one-on-one
contacts in the supermarket aisles, Garnett said.  "We think this will
fill the gap in stores that are too-tight for a full branch," he
added. 
     IBT is finalizing its mini-branch prototype, which has yet to be
tested at a store, Garnett said.

Success Story

     One bank that has contributed significantly to the increasing
number of in-store branches is First State Bank of Austin, Texas. 
     The $415 million-asset institution operates a total of 16 in-
store branches at Wal Mart Supercenters and Kmarts, covering a more
than 1,200 miles between Midland, Texas and Corpus Christi, Texas. 
Five additions are planned this year, said Joseph Long, First State
chairman.
     The bank, which trained employees to roam Wal Mart aisles and
discuss loans with customers, has experienced loan volumes double that
of what was expected.  Deposit volumes also are higher than predicted
at the in-store branches, he said.
    "It's the repeat business in the grocery market, I think, that
makes [in-store branches] work as well as they do," Long said. 
Studies indicate that the average American visits the grocery store
two to three times a week.  Those numbers do not include the
additional reasons why consumers might visit Wal Mart SuperCenters,
which often house opticians and unisex hair salons.  A supercenter
conducts 30,000 to 60,000 transactions daily, Long said.
    First State has been able to increase its market coverage at a
fraction of the cost, Long added.  Stand-alone brick and mortar banks
cost $1 million or more to build compared to the $260,000 price tag
for an in-store mini-branch, he said.
    In-store branches can be created for as little as $175,000. Mini-
branches will fall under that figure because rent and staffing
requirements are even less, Garnett said.
    In-store banking provides many benefits for banks, Garnett said:

*   High-touch delivery channels.  The channel  fosters sales,
allowing automation to handle routine transactions similar to IBT's
mini-branch model.

*   Merger and Acquisition Tool.  In-store branching makes it feasible
for acquiring banks to maintain a presence in key markets when
traditional locations are closed to maximize efficiency.

*   Opportunities to build market share.  Banks can move into new
market areas without as much capital investment as with traditional
branch expansion.  For example, all but one of the Wal Mart branches
opened by First State Bank is in a new market area for the bank, Long
said.  Additionally, the inexpensive branch is a tool for community
banks to ward off competition from larger banks.

*   Increased customer service.  The in-store branch is open longer
and located where consumers must go anyway.  It allows bankers to
maintain face-to-face contact even in the evening hours.  The branches
also can provide services similar to brokerage firms.

Consumer Attitudes Positive

    National Commerce Bank Services Inc. (NCBS) of Memphis, Tenn., an
in-store branching consultancy, recently predicted that the number of
in-store branches will reach 7,500 by the year 2000.  NCBS recently
interviewed about 800 shoppers in 20 states who said in-store banking
is important to them and that the branch should offer more than just
deposit and withdrawal services.  The study revealed that of those
interviewed:

*   93 percent consider in-store bank very important;

*   70 percent shop more frequently at the supermarket because of
branch access;

*   79 percent would use the in-store bank at least once a week and
more than 80 percent would visit the store just for banking
activities; and

*   About 40 percent said the in-store branch should add home equity
loans, personal loans, safe deposit boxes and money market/mutual fund
services.

    Two U.S. consulting companies specialize in advising banks on
creating in-store branches.  Pricing for the services vary according
to the number of in-store branches needed, the mixture of bank-
provided and vendor-provided materials and whether the firm has a
relationship with the grocery store, Garnett said.
    IBT is a business unit of First Data Corporation of Hackensack,
N.J., offering a solution called Sales Platform, which has been
adopted by more than 250 U.S. banks and 950 in-store grocery branches,
Wal Marts and Kmarts.  Customers include The State Bank and Union Bank
in Central Valley, California.  NCBS is the consulting division of
National Commerce Bancorporation, which has placed 62 of its 77
branches inside supermarkets.  NCBS has advised more than 200 banks in
developing 600 in-store branches.  Customers include newly signed on
SunTrust Banks of Atlanta. (Douglas Ferris, NCBS, 800/264-2609; John
Garnett, IBT, 770/381-2023; Joseph Long, First State Bank, 512/495-
1000.)

VISA CASH BENEFITS STILL UNPROVEN

     The Visa Cash division of Visa International is betting that it
can divert some of the nation's $1.8 trillion in annual cash
transactions under $10 into Visa Cash exchanges. Visa believes these
transactions are under the limit for which most people will use a
credit card.
     The banking industry has been awash with big ideas about smart
cards that will hold all of a consumer's vital information, from
medical records to cash transactions.
But Visa Cash stored-value card is designed to be simple and to help
consumers get over technology hurdles, said Mary Buckley, Visa's vice
president of stored value products.  Visa proposes to operate Visa
Cash on its existing VisaNet system and charge a fee for processing
transactions.
      For banks, the card is a vehicle to put its name in consumer
hands, an additional customer service and a fee generator, Buckley
said.
     But the service will require substantial upgrades in
automated teller machines' (ATMs) hardware and software and changes in
merchant point-of-sale equipment, said Basil Bromberg, president of
Smart Cards USA consultancy in Dallas.  "Change-over of equipment out
in the field to support this card is going to be a multimillion dollar
effort."
    Additionally, the VisaNet system limits Visa Cash consumers to
the same merchants where they could use a credit card, Bromberg said. 
He criticized Visa for failing to offer enough information to help
banks to make decisions about implementing the Visa Cash system.
    Indeed, when asked about pricing and profitability potential,
Buckley directed inquiries to each individual bank partner.  But she
acknowledged that, like the credit industry, smart cards may bring
more profits to the issuing banks that earn interest on funds through
float or unused cards funds.  Acquiring banks, on the other hand, can
earn merchant transaction fees.
    Visa Cash is in the pilot stages.  The 1996 Summer Olympics
pilot, for example, will provide many answers to industry questions
about smart card consumer acceptance, profitability and feasibility. 
"There's a lot of work to be done to validate the benefits.  When the
tents are down and the athletes have gone home, we'll still be in
Atlanta,"  Buckley said.
    Visa, at least seems to be ahead of its competition.  MasterCard
is developing a smart card system but has no pilots, Bromberg said. 
American Express initiated a pilot at its headquarters in December. 
The cards, issued to less than 50 employees, contain credit functions
on a chip, but no cash applications, said spokesman Toby Usnik. (Basil
Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502; Toby Usnik, American Express,
212/640-5060.)

Australia, accepted by about 1,000 merchants.  In Atlanta, Visa Cash
partnered with several banks to issue cards in association with the
1996 Summer Olympics.  In the Atlanta pilot, First Union teamed with
at least 12 merchants to accept Visa Cash.  In April, Visa launched a
stored-value card system for employees at its headquarters.  The $20
cards are used in the cafeteria and vending machines.

MASTERCARD, VISA SET STANDARDS. 

    Debit and credit payments over the Internet received a boost
recently when card-association giants MasterCard and Visa scrapped
their competing Internet security protocols and backed a uniform
security standard.  The companies believe the new protocol will make
the Internet safe for commerce, but consumer adaptation may be further
behind.  "I don't think their announcement is going to do very much
for the progress or the pace at which the mass market adopts the
Internet as a viable channel for commercial or retail enterprise,"
says Mark Hardie, an analyst with The Tower Group, in Wellesley, Mass. 
"It's a complicated issue and there's more to it than simply
MasterCard and Visa agreeing that they'll use the same standard."  The
larger issue is whether consumers will flock to the Internet as they
flock to suburban malls, he said.  The standard, called Secure
Electronic Transaction (SET), combines features from MasterCard's
Secure Electronic Payment Protocol and Visa's Secure Transaction
Technology.  The protocol underlying SET is software-based public key
cryptography from Redwood City, Calif.-based RSA Data Security.  It is
the same technology that MasterCard and Visa were using separately,
which software vendors say they're able to support simultaneously. 
The question remains whether software-based public key encryption is
an adequate form of security.  "It's better than nothing," says Bob
Gargus, president of Atalla Corp., the San Jose, Calif.-based division
of Tandem Computer Corp..  Atalla manufacturers hardware-based
encryption devices for automated teller machines and is offering 
peripherals for client-server systems to secure Internet-based
commerce (RDSN, Feb. 2, p. 6).  Standard specifications are to be
available in a few weeks and operational by the fourth quarter.  (Bob
Gargus, Atalla, 408/435-5342; Mark Hardie, The Tower Group, 617/235-
5777; Ed Hogan, MasterCard, 914/249-1421; Richard Lonergan, Visa,

UBANK ON-LINE GETS GOOD REVIEW.

    US Bancorp of Portland, Ore., says that 85 percent of their
customers are satisfied with its UBANK ON-line home banking product
and 95 percent would recommend it to friends.  A survey of about 20
percent of UBANK users also revealed that 88 percent prefer banking
on-line to manual methods and customers especially like the feature
that allows them to download account information directly into their
personal finance software.  U.S. Bancorp has been offering home
banking through Microsoft Money for about two years and recently added
access through Intuit's Quicken.  (Linda Parker, U.S. Bancorp,

CYBERCASH, VERISIGN PARTNER. 

    CyberCash Inc., of Reston Va., a provider of secure Internet
Payment systems, and Redwood City-Calif.-based Verisign Inc., digital
authentication vendor, plan to work together to promote the use of
digital certificates for on-line transactions.  The CyberCash Wallet
now will store Verisigns' digital identifications for secure payment. 
Digital IDs are the equivalent of a digital driver's license to
authenticate a consumers identity to banks and on-line merchants.  The
CyberCash Wallet holds credit card numbers and the digital ID.  In
other CyberCash news, the American Institute for Financial Research

MICROSOFT TRANSACTS WITH VISA

    As RDSN went to press, Microsoft and Visa Interactive revealed
they are working together to offer banks a turnkey remote banking
solution.  Under the agreement, Visa Interactive will act as a
processor for Microsoft's personal finance software, Money.  The more
than 30 banks offering Money have been processing payments through 
Intuit Services Corp. (ISC), also the processor for Intuit's [INTU]
personal finance software, Quicken. 
    The processing arrangement, expected to be approved by Visa
International next month, apparently offers a choice of processors for
banks that provide personal finance software from either Microsoft or
Intuit, said Mark Hardie, technology analyst with the Tower Group in
Wellesley, Mass., who received a pre-announcement briefing from
Microsoft and Visa.
    Being forced to process transactions through ISC, rather than the
bank's usual processor or a new one chosen by the bank, has been a
common complaint among banks offering the Intuit and Microsoft
programs.  The ISC contract is often the second or third processing
arrangement banks must enter into to offer personal finance software.

Microsoft Strategy

    The Visa partnership may help Microsoft improve its relationship
with the banking industry, which fears the software giant will become
a major competitor.
    When Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates spoke to about 6,000 bankers
at the Bank Administration Institute 's Retail Delivery '95 in
December, he promised bankers future processing choices for home
banking.  Microsoft likely will keep its ISC relationship for banks
that want to use that processor, Hardie said.  "I don't think
Microsoft would be as successful going to banks directly and telling
the banks to set up their own payment systems," he added.
    Additionally, the Visa choice may provide a new comfort level for
bankers who fear Microsoft, but are familiar with the Visa, Hardie
said.
    Microsoft's challenge is to keep Money competitive among Internet
banking and payment strategies, Hardie said.  Several competitors,
including ISC, are creating products for Internet banking.
    It's too early to say how the partnership will affect ISC, which
has been the exclusive Money and Quicken processor by default, ISC's
Chairman Bruce Burchfield told RDSN.  ISC will not disclose its
transaction volume numbers until Intuit's quarterly report is
published next month.
    It is unlikely that the larger banks, already processing with
ISC, will change to Visa because they would have to create a new
interface to replace one that already exists, Burchfield said.
    Indeed, the Microsoft/Visa turnkey system will likely be most
attractive to smaller banks that do not have the resources to invest
in development, Hardie said.  (Bruce Burchfield, ISC, 415/944-3569;
Mark Hardie, Tower Group, 617/235-5777; Greg Jones, Visa, 415/432-
2752.)

FINES TOTALING $258,000
LEVIED BY NASD AGAINST
WORTHEN RESPONDENTS

     The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD)
announced Nov. 7 that it has assessed fines totaling $258,000
against Worthen Investments, Inc. of Little Rock and several of
its officers and registered representatives in connection with
the sale on bank premises of mutual funds containing risky,
derivative instruments.  Worthen Investments, Inc. and Related
Cases, Complaint No. C05950057 (NASD Dist. 5, New Orleans).

     Investors who bought the funds have filed suit against
Worthen and its new holding company, Boatmen's Bancshares, Inc.
The investors allege the mutual funds were falsely touted as
safe, government-guaranteed investments.  Many of the mutual fund
sales allegedly took place inside branches of Arkansas' Worthen
banks, which were acquired by Boatmen's earlier this year along
with Worthen Investments.

     NASD is the self-regulatory organization for The NASDAQ
Stock Market and the over-the-counter securities markets.

     NASD said that Worthen and all of the individual
respondents, without admitting or denying the allegations against
them, consented to the NASD disciplinary action taken by the
Association's New Orleans District Business Conduct Committee.

     The respondents, NASD said, consented to findings that they
made, or caused to have been made, misleading statements to their
customers about the characteristics and safety features of the
mutual fund investments at issue.  NASD said that in addition to
conducting many of the mutual fund sales on bank premises,
Worthen "failed and neglected to perform adequate due diligence
in connection with the promotion and sale of certain mutual fund
products."  NASD said that Worthen also failed to keep copies of
all customer correspondence and failed to establish and maintain
an adequate supervisory system.

     Worthen itself was censured and fined $200,000.  In
addition, NASD said, Worthen agreed to a number of additional
sanctions, including a promise to conduct a complete audit of all
internal policies and an agreement to form an investment
committee to meet regularly to review the methods used by Worthen
personnel to market all securities.  The committee is to
especially consider the suitability of sales literature to
promote the sale of the securities, NASD said.  The results of
the independent audit and investment committee reviews are
subject to NASD inspection.

     Among the individuals sanctioned were Patrick D. Miller,
Worthen's former president, and Frank M. McGibbony, Worthen's
executive vice president and former compliance officer.

     NASD said Miller agreed to a $10,000 fine, a five-year
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify in all
capacities.  NASD said Miller consented to findings that he bore
responsibility for misleading and inaccurate statements to public
customers.  Through written solicitations approved by Miller,
NASD said, at least seven registered Worthen representatives sent
misleading sales correspondence to public customers that
misstated the characteristics and safety features of mutual fund
investments.  Miller also failed to supervise employees who use
such correspondence, NASD said.

     NASD said McGibbony agreed to a $5,000 fine, a 30-day
suspension as a principal and a requirement to requalify as a
principal.  According to NASD, McGibbony consented to findings
that he approved certain items of misleading sales correspondence
that misstated the safety features of the mutual funds.  In
addition, NASD said, McGibbony failed to ensure that copies of
customer correspondence were properly maintained in the firm's
files and failed to establish an adequate supervisory system.

     Higher fines were levied against the seven representatives
who were sanctioned.  Jamai W. Weber was fined the highest
amount, $70,300, suspended in all capacities for three months,
and required to requalify in all capacities.  Altogether, the
seven representatives were fined $130,900.

     Five individuals employed by Worthen Bank & Trust Co., which
was the Worthen parent company, also were censured and fined.

     NASD said that Boatmen's cooperated fully with the
investigation "and promptly instituted new policies and
procedures at Worthen to assure compliance and to prevent future
violations."  (Boatmen's changed the name of the Worthen banks
but did not change the name of the investment company after
acquiring the Worthen enterprises.)

CFTC DISMISSES NUMEROUS
'FRIVOLOUS' MOTIONS IN
NFA DISCIPLINARY CASE

     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission in a Dec. 1 order
tossed out 59 motions filed by J&J Development Corp. and affirmed
a National Futures Association (NFA) decision that imposed a fine
of $2,000 against J&J for failure to keep timely financial
statements.  J&J Development Corp. v. National Futures
Association, No. CRAA-95-2 (CFTC).

     Calling J&J's numerous filings "egregious," the CFTC said
they were prohibited under CFR Section 171.10(d).

     The numerous motions began after J&J appealed an NFA
decision that sanctioned the company for not filing financial
statements seven times between June 1990 and August 1992.  The
CFTC said J&J began its blizzard of motions with a monster brief
that was four times longer than permitted under CFTC regulations
and contained 456 exhibits.

     The CFTC noted that the brief was followed by the filing of
59 motions between January 1995 and July 1995.  The motions
generally reiterated points made in the brief, the CFTC said.

     "[R]ule 171.10(d) itself provides that 'frivolous or
repetitive motions dealing with the same subject matter shall not
be permitted,'" the CFTC said.  "We find that most of appellant's
pleadings in fact are the very sort of filings that Rule
171.10(d) is intended to prohibit.  Although we decline to impose
sanctions pursuant to Rule 171.11, we admonish J&J for its
egregious abuse of the process."

     The CFTC noted that J&J's motions fell into three general
categories.  Most of them were made up of arguments already
contained in the brief.  A second category was composed of
procedural arguments, and a third responded to NFA's opposition
brief.

     The NFA also filed procedural motions, which included a
motion to strike J&J's brief and exhibits.  The motions were
dismissed as moot following the CFTC's ruling in favor of the
NFA.

     "[O]ur review of the record and the parties' appellate
submissions establishes that NFA's findings and conclusions are
supported by the weight of the evidence; we therefore adopt
them," the CFTC said.  "We further conclude that NFA committed no
error material to the outcome of this proceeding, and the parties
have not raised any issues that merit extended discussion.
Accordingly, we affirm NFA's decision without opinion."

SIXTH CIRCUIT: INVESTORS'
CLAIMS AGAINST BROKER
ARE TIME-BARRED

     Disgruntled investors in high-risk limited partnerships
cannot arbitrate their claims against a brokerage firm because
the six-year statute of limitations has passed, a divided panel
of the Sixth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Nov. 27.  Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. v. M.C. McCoy et al., No. 94-5779
(6th Cir.).

     In a 2-1 decision, the majority said the limitations period
began to run when the investments were made and when the
investors received prospectuses that clearly outlined the
substantial risks, not when the investments later soured.

     The dissenting judge found a material factual issue for
trial on the investors' argument that the limitations period was
equitably tolled because the brokerage firm fraudulently
concealed the unsuitable nature of the investments.  The
dissenter also said the National Association of Security Dealers
(NASD) Code of Arbitration Procedure does not bar equitable
tolling of the Section 15 limitations period.

     The investors, described as unsophisticated retirees, stated
that their primary goals were preservation of principal and a
steady income stream.  They were allegedly told by Dean Witter
Reynolds that limited partnerships would meet those goals and
were promised 20% returns and safety.  The NASD Code of
Arbitration Procedure with its six-year time period was
incorporated by reference and stipulation into their agreements.

     Dean Witter subsequently filed a declaratory judgment
complaint in the Eastern District of Tennessee, alleging that
claims for improper investments were time-barred.  The investors
were permanently enjoined from litigation and arbitration.

     The Sixth Circuit affirmed in a majority opinion by Judge
Alice M. Batchelder.  The arbitration claims were filed more than
six years after the investments were made and the clock began
ticking, the court said, not when they later allegedly discovered
the unsuitability of the investments.  Adopting the investors'
reasoning would undermine Section 15's intent of setting a
six-year limit on the arbitrability of claims, it said.

     The majority also found the prospectuses to be clearly
worded and not misleading, even to novice investors.

     It found no need to decide whether Section 15 is subject to
equitable tolling, saying the investors failed to offer
sufficient evidence of fraudulent concealment.

     In a dissent, Judge Karen Nelson Moore found a material
factual issue as to whether Dean Witter had engaged in fraudulent
concealment.  She also said the equitable tolling doctrine
applies to claims filed more than six years after an investment
in unsuitable securities.

     The due diligence requirement may be relaxed when a
confidential or fiduciary relationship exists, she said, and the
prospectuses in this case are neither clear nor comprehensive.
She also noted that a Dean Witter agent took the initiative to
meet with the investors, reassured them their goals would be met
and made other statements that were gross exaggerations or
clearly capricious.

     In addition, Section 15 does not bar an equitable tolling
claim in Judge Moore's view because there was no evidence these
investors agreed to waive their right to use the equitable
tolling doctrine.

SEC SUIT REMAINS INTACT
DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT
'SECURITIES' DEFINITION

     Noting that a question may ultimately exist as to whether
the instruments used in multimillion-dollar transactions by the
Foundation for New Era Philanthropy are securities under federal
law, Eastern District of Pennsylvania Judge Anita B. Brody on
Nov. 16 denied former New Era president John G. Bennett's motion
to dismiss on that point and issued a discovery schedule.  SEC v.
Bennett et al., No. 95-3005 (ED PA); see Securities & Insider
Trading LR, Aug. 21, 1995.

     The motion by Bennett for a more definitive statement of SEC
charges that he and New Era sold more than $100 million in
unregistered securities in 1993 alone was denied by Judge Brody
because Bennett "has not made clear the substance of his
objections."

     Bennett argued that the crux of the SEC's complaint is
whether the New Era notes are securities within the meaning of
the federal securities laws.  Under every criteria, Bennett
contends, the notes fail to qualify as securities, i.e., as
notes, investment contracts and other evidence of indebtedness.

     Judge Brody stated she was unable to say at this point
whether the legal test for registered securities has been met.
After discovery has been completed, the judge ruled, Bennett may
again raise the issue and the parties at that time will address
the economic realities of the transaction.

     Regarding the motion for a more definitive statement from
the SEC, the judge stated that the defects to which Bennett
alludes are not obvious and that plaintiff did not have to
respond to allusions to theories of potential liability in the
complaint, only to factual allegations.  Because Bennett did not
comply with Rule 12(e), which requires him to point out the
defects complained of and the details desired, he has not made
clear the substance of his objections, Judge Brody stated.

     Bennett is represented by Gregory Miller, Daniel Joanas and
Gino Benedetti of Miller, Alfano & Raspanti in Philadelphia.

SUP. CT. HEARS FINALITY OF
PACT v. DE REPRESENTATION
ADEQUACY ARGUMENTS

     In arguments before the U.S. Supreme Court Nov. 27,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Ltd. argued that if the Ninth
Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals' invalidation of a Delaware state
court settlement of shareholder claims against it is not
overturned, corporations will have no assurance of the finality
of state court settlements that include federal securities law
charges.  Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. et al. v.
Epstein et al., No. 94-1809 (U.S.).

     Shareholder attorneys countered that Section 27 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which gives federal courts
exclusive jurisdiction to enforce any liability, prevented such a
settlement -- especially where the securities law claims were not
litigated and were based on different wrongs than those at the
heart of the state law breach of duty allegations.

     In 1990, Matsushita acquired MCA Inc. for $6.1 billion.  The
acquisition was accomplished through a tender offer of $71 per
share of MCA common stock.

     Rather than tender his shares, Lew Wasserman, MCA's chairman
and CEO at the time, entered into a separate agreement with
Matsushita, known as the "Capital Contribution and Loan
Agreement," pursuant to which Wasserman exchanged his shares for
preferred stock in a wholly owned Matsushita subsidiary called
MEA Holdings.  Sidney Sheinberg, MCA's COO at the time, tendered
his shares pursuant to Matsushita's $71 per share offer.  Two
days after Sheinberg tendered his shares, he received an
additional $21 million in cash, ostensibly in exchange for
unexercised MCA stock options.

     Subsequently, former MCA shareholders who tendered their
shares for the $71 tender price filed suit in the U.S. District
Court for the Central District of California, alleging that
Matsushita violated SEC Rule 14d-10 by treating Wasserman and
Sheinberg differently from other shareholders in the tender
offer.

     The district court granted Matsushita summary judgment on
class action plaintiff representative Lawrence Epstein's claim
that Matsushita's agreement to pay Wasserman consideration that
was different from the $71 per share tender offer violated
Rule 14d-10.  The trial court subsequently granted Matsushita's
motion for summary judgment on all of plaintiffs' claims.
Appeals were filed.

     During the pendency of the consolidated appeals, the
Delaware Chancery Court entered a judgment approving the
settlement of a state court class action that released all claims
arising out of Matsushita's tender offer for MCA stock --
including the securities law charges.

     The Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's order
denying plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment against
Matsushita on the Wasserman claim.  The panel also vacated the
district's court's order granting Matsushita's motion for summary
judgment on the Sheinberg payment.

     In addition, the appeals court held that the Delaware
judgment does not preclude the Epstein class action.  Finally,
the panel vacated the district court's orders denying the Epstein
plaintiffs' motions for class certification and for leave to
amend their complaint.

     In its petition for writ of certiorari, Matsushita asserted
that the circuit court created an anomalous exception to the Full
Faith and Credit Act that will frustrate the settlement of class
action litigation.  It also argued that implying a private right
of action under Rule 14d-10 violates principles announced by the
Supreme Court and conflicts with decisions of the District of
Columbia, Third and Sixth Circuits.  Furthermore, Matsushita
contended that the circuit court expanded Rule 14d-10 in conflict
with the law in the Fourth Circuit and the tender offer
regulatory scheme created by Congress.

     Walter Minton, one of the plaintiffs, filed a separate brief
in opposition, arguing that this is an appeal from an
interlocutory decision, not a final judgment, and the issues
presented arise because of the unique facts of the case.  Minton
also stated that there is no need for the Supreme Court to decide
whether there is a private right of action under Rule 14d-10.

     In a Feb. 13, 1993 opinion that followed a fairness hearing
on the proposed settlement by objectors, then Vice Chancellor
Maurice Hartnett noted that a "whiff of collusion" was not enough
to bar approval, especially since the pact -- in a revised form -
- had an opt-out provision.

     The justices asked plaintiff attorneys why the California
objectors had not opted out of the settlement instead of
attacking it collaterally.  Plaintiff's attorneys argued that the
Delaware Chancery Court made no inquiry into the adequacy of
representation, thereby inviting a challenge to the settlement.

     Nevertheless, some justices questioned the assertion that
only a federal court could release federal securities claims.

     Counsel for Matsushita are Barry R. Ostranger, Mary Kay
Vyskocil, Paul C. Curnin and Joseph M. McLaughlin of Simpson,
Thatcher & Bartlett in New York City.  Of counsel is Geoffrey
Hazard Jr., Trustee Professor of Law, University of Pennsylvania.

     Epstein is represented by Roger Kirby, Irving Malchman and
Peter Linden of Kaufman, Malchman, Kirby & Squire and Henry Paul
Monaghan and Harold Edgar, both in New York City.

     Representing Minton are Peter R. Dion-Kindem and Laurence M.
Berman of Berman, Blanchard, Mausner, Kindem & Resser in Los
Angeles.

CFTC FINDS DEFENDANT'S
BID TO VACATE DECISION
DID NOT FIT RULE 60(b)

     Although Steven C. Brenner claimed that sanctions leveled
against him by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should be
lifted because he satisfied a judgment, the CFTC ruled Nov. 11
that Brenner's motion to set aside a final decision had been
filed too late for him to obtain relief under FRCP 60(b).  In the
Matter of Steven C. Brenner, No. 90-7 (CFTC).

     "To obtain such relief, generally a party must first
demonstrate that he acted within a reasonable time and show a
meritorious defense," the CFTC said, noting that Brenner's motion
involved a decision rendered four years ago.  The CFTC pointed
out that a Rule 60(b) motion must be made "not more than one year
after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered or taken."

     In 1986, the CFTC ordered Brenner to pay a judgment of
$5,987.20 to a complainant.  There was no record of Brenner's
making the payment by early 1987, and he was automatically
prohibited from trading on any contract market.  The CFTC
Enforcement Division, however, learned in 1990 that Brenner had
violated the trading prohibition in 1987 and 1988.

     The Enforcement Division moved for a summary disposition.
Brenner did not respond to the charges nor did he appear at a
consequent hearing before an administrative law judge.  The ALJ
found Brenner liable on the charges and imposed a 10-year trading
ban and a $10,000 civil monetary penalty.  Brenner did not seek a
modification, and the summary disposition became a final order.
Brenner did not appeal the order to the CFTC, and the case was
closed.

     In June 1992, the CFTC was informed that Brenner was trading
under a fictitious name.  The Enforcement Division sought and was
granted an injunction prohibiting Brenner from trading futures by
the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

     Brenner responded in February by asking the CFTC to set
aside the sanctions on grounds he had paid the $5,987.20 judgment
in 1987.  He argued that his attorney had been incompetent for
not bringing the satisfaction of the judgment to the proper CFTC
authorities.  The complainant alleged that he was not paid until
1994.

               The Enforcement Division argued that Brenner's motion should
be denied because he had failed to demonstrate the "exceptional
circumstances" necessary for the granting of relief under
Rule 60(b).   The CFTC, however, found that Brenner did not reach
Rule 60(b) because he brought his action well after the one-year
limitation period.

     "[W]e initially note that the sanctions Brenner seeks to
have vacated were imposed four and half years prior to the
instant motion.  Nevertheless, Brenner offers no explanation for
the delay in presenting the evidence he now asks us to consider.
Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that his motion has
been filed within a reasonable time."

     The CFTC noted that even if the action had been brought
within the period of limitation, relief under Rule 60(b) cannot
be granted based on the incompetence of a defendant's attorney.
Quoting Nelson v. City College of Chicago, 962 F.2d at 755
(7th Cir.), the CFTC said the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals has "never held that an attorney's gross negligence
justifies relief under Rule 60(b)."

INVESTORS SAY RECEIVER
LACKED AUTHORITY TO SELL
SECURITIES-BACKED ASSETS

     A group of California securities investors argued in a
Nov. 20 brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals that the
Central District of California went beyond its jurisdiction in
approving a receiver's sale of real estate that the investors
claimed they owned through the purchase of securities.  SEC v.
American Capital Investments, Inc.; The ACI Investors Association
et al. v. Shaffer, Nos. 95-55193, 95-55283, 95-5587 and 95-55878
(9th Cir.).

     "The Receiver cannot sell the Investors' interests in the
properties because they are not within the Court's jurisdiction,"
the investors argued.  "Under binding recent Supreme Court
precedent (O'Melveny & Myers v. F.D.I.C...), the Court must look
to State law to define its remedial jurisdiction in Receivership
cases.  Under California law -- as well as all other
jurisdictions -- a Receiver steps into the shoes of the defendant
for whom he is appointed and brings into custodia legis only the
same quality and quantity of title as was owned by the
defendant."

     The case began in August 1993 when the Securities and
Exchange Commission filed a complaint alleging securities fraud
against American Capital Investments, Inc. (ACI), which had been
selling securities interests in real estate investments.  By the
time the SEC obtained a restraining order, 156 investors had
purchased securities backed by commercial real estate.

               The investors -- later organized as the ACI Investors
Association -- claimed they held title to the property directly
through deeds and indirectly through partnerships with ACI.  The
jurisdictional issue presently before the Ninth Circuit had its
genesis in the September 1993 federal court appointment of
Richard G. Shaffer as ACI's receiver.  Shaffer took over ACI's
real estate assets and sold the properties to a Canadian
investment firm.

     According to the investors' opening brief, "The investors
contend that no one can sell what he does not own.  The Receiver
seeks to sell 100 percent fee interests in eight ACI
commercial/office properties -- despite that fact that ACI did
not own 100 percent fee interests.  The investors own major
interests in at least four of the eight properties...."

     The investors claimed the Central District of California did
not have jurisdiction to approve the sale and appealed to the
Ninth Circuit.

     Citing to O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct. 2048 (1994),
which had relied in part on Allen v. Ramsay, 179 Cal.App.2d 843,
4 Cal.Rptr. 575 (1960), the investors argued that federal courts
do not have the power to displace state law in cases involving
the authority of receivers.

     "There is no principle of California law which would permit
a Receiver to sell a better state of title than he acquired when
'he stepped into the shoes' of the Defendant," the investors
argued.  "Applying the law to this case, there is no power to
convey a better title to the ACI properties than ACI itself had
and the district court's sale order is therefore void."

     The appellant investors are represented by Thomas W.
Dressler and Patrick J. Evans of Dressler, Rein & Evans in Los
Angeles.

OFFICER ARGUES THAT NASD
EXCEEDED AUTHORITY IN CASE
INVOLVING NONMEMBER FIRM

     An officer of an Oregon holding company, which owned a
securities dealer but did not sell securities, argued in a
Nov. 24 opening brief to the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
that the National Association of Securities Dealers stretched
beyond its jurisdiction by sanctioning him for a snafu involving
a misdirected securities account deposit.  Alderman v. Securities
and Exchange Commission, No. 95-70609 (9th Cir.).

     "The use of NASD's power to sanction in this context exceeds
the power delegated to it by the Malone Act since it seeks to
impose sanctions over a person not engaged in the investment
banking or securities business for his alleged failure to act in
his corporate capacity with a non-member private corporation,"
according to the brief.

     Daniel Joseph Alderman, an officer and director of Portland-
based Peregrine Holdings Limited, focused his argument on
allegations that the NASD had trammelled on state corporations
law by imposing federal regulatory proceedings over a state-
chartered, non-NASD member private business.

     "The governance of internal corporate affairs [is] reserved
under the Constitution to state law," Alderman argued.
"Corporations such as Peregrine are creatures of state law and
the relationship created thereby are entrusted entirely to state
law....  As a result, state laws govern the internal affairs of
private corporations and federal law shall not intrude into those
internal affairs."

     According to the brief, this case stems from a check for
$3,193.23 that was mistakenly deposited into a Peregrine
corporate account instead of into the account of a Peregrine-
owned securities dealer, American Interstate Financial Corp.
(AIFC).  Peregrine discovered the mistake and issued a check for
the full amount to the AIFC customer.

     The NASD claimed that Alderman deliberately withheld payment
for two whole months.  Alderman said the NASD allegation was
unsupported.

     The deposit snafu eventually resulted in the filing of a
disciplinary action against Alderman by the District Business
Conduct Committee (DBCC) of the NASD.  In addition to being an
officer and director, Alderman was Peregrine's executive vice
president.  He was also a director of AIFC.  The DBCC found
Alderman to be in violation of Article III, Section 1 of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice.

    Article III states:  "A member, in the conduct of his
business, shall observe high standards of commercial honor and
just and equitable principles of trade."

     According to the brief, the DBCC censured Alderman and fined
him $3,000.  Alderman sought review of the decision by the NASD's
National Business Conduct Committee (NBCC), which affirmed the
DBCC.

     The $3,000 case found its way further up the appeals ladder
when Alderman asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to
review the NBCC's finding.  The SEC affirmed.  Alderman appealed
to the Ninth Circuit.

      The brief, citing O'Melveny & Myers v. FDIC, 114 S.Ct.
2048, 2053, 129 L.Ed.2d 76 (1994), argued that state law -- not
the NASD -- governs Alderman's actions as a Peregrine officer.
Specifically, Alderman pointed out that ORS Chapter 60.371
allowed Peregrine to delegate day-to-day operations of the
company.  In this instance, responsibility for Peregrine's bank
accounts fell to a vice president for finance and not to
Alderman, the brief argued.

      "The standards to which directors are held are established
by state law," Alderman argued.  "A director must be diligent and
prudent in managing the corporation's affairs.  It is clearly
recognized that the Board's responsibility is limited to
overseeing the operation."

     Alderman is represented by Allan A. Fulsher of Portland, OR.
The SEC is represented by Randall W. Quinn, Senior Litigation
Counsel for the SEC in Washington, DC.

CFTC FILES COMPLAINT
AGAINST ILLINOIS TRADER
FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has filed a six-
count administrative complaint against Gary K. Bielfeldt,
Carlotta Bielfeldt and Bielfeldt & Co., of Peoria and Chicago,
for alleged violations of the Commodity Futures Act (CFA) that
included exceeding speculative limits and filing false reports,
the CFTC said.

     The Oct. 31 complaint charged in counts one and two that
Gary Bielfeldt, a registered floor broker, allegedly violated the
CFTC's speculative limits for corn futures trading between
Oct. 8, 1993 and Nov. 19, 1993.

     The complaint claimed that Bielfeldt violated speculative
limits rules in two basic ways: by acting pursuant to an express
or implied agreement with his daughters, Linda Bielfeldt and
Karen Gray, and several business and social acquaintances; and,
by controlling the trading in commodity futures trading accounts
of Carlotta Bielfeldt, his wife, who was never registered with
the CFTC in any capacity.

     The CFTC said that counts three through six charged the
defendants with filing false reports.  Gary Bielfeldt,
controlling person of Bielfeldt & Co., was charged with filing
false reports with the CFTC for: (1) identifying his wife as a
reportable trader; (2) filing false 01 Reports that failed to
combine the net positions of the accounts controlled by Gary
Bielfeldt with the positions in the accounts of Carlotta
Bielfeldt; and (3) failing to update his CFTC Form 40 to
accurately reflect his control of the accounts of Carlotta
Bielfeldt.

     Carlotta Bielfeldt was charged with making a false statement
of material fact to the CFTC for allegedly signing a CFTC Form 40
that failed to identify Gary Bielfeldt as controlling her
account.  Bielfeldt & Co. was charged with filing a false CFTC
Form 102 and false 01 Reports with the CFTC.

BANKERS TO PLUCK FRUITS OF INVESTMENT PRODUCT MARKET

      At a record rate, banks are overstepping traditional
boundaries and offering mutual funds and other investment
products to their customers.  The euphoria of finding new sources
of fee income is certainly contagious.
      But to successfully ride this ever-strengthening wave and

of news, analysis and predictions on the burgeoning bank
securities marketplace.  We welcome your comments, so please feel
free to call us at 301/340-2100.
      First of all, the nature of the consumer market is changing,
with a large portion of the population moving from being savers
to investors, "in part driven by low rates, in part driven by the
fact that baby boomers are inflation-conscious and investment-
driven," said Ed Furash, a Washington, D.C., bank consultant.
This group is searching for yield and isn't content with current
savings account and certificate of deposit (CD) earnings.
      Banks, in turn, are stuck with a big distribution system and
the need to increase fee income to offset their shrinking net
interest margins. "At the same time, banks don't have a lot of
loans to make--the demand and quality aren't there," he said.
      Banks have to stop the drain on deposits caused by plunging
interest rates.  "In the battle between banks and non-banks, it's
essential banks enter non-bank products such as annuities and
insurance.  If not, non-bank competitors will steal banks blind,"
Furash said.
      An illustration of the strength fee income can generate is
St. Louis-based Mark Twain Bancshares, which recently reported a
37.94 percent increase in 1992 earnings over 1991.  The bank
attributes its strong performance in part to its revenues from
its fee-based divisions (bond, brokerage, mortgage and trust),
which grew a collective 30.01 percent in 1992 compared to 1991.

   You Can Jump in All at Once or Dip in a Toe at a Time

      Some banks are taking bold steps in their commitment to
investment products. A prime example is NationsBank Corp.'s
partnership created this fall with Dean Witter Financial Services
Group Inc., a unit of Sears, Roebuck and Co.  The two
subsidiaries each own 50 percent of the new firm, called Nations
Securities, a Dean Witter/NationsBank Co., headquartered in
Charlotte, N.C.  The company is an independent securities
brokerage firm and has about 400 investment officers now working
at selected NationsBank banking centers around the country.
      Another tactic is to set up a separate bank subsidiary, then
hire outside investment professionals.  First Chicago Corp.'s
bankers call customers before a CD is about to mature.  Customers
disappointed by the new CD rates available are referred to
nonbanker investment professionals; mutual fund sales have
tripled.
      Other banks are cautious about the investment product wave's
future, or don't have the time or money for new product
development.  But banks can still profit from rent and fee income
generated from investment firms sharing branch space.  Another
strategy is to take advantage of third-party processors that, to
varying degrees, help banks sell investment products.

   Don't Expect a Magic Carpet Ride

      Unfortunately, investment products aren't a guaranteed magic
carpet ride to profitability.  Successfully marketing investment
products requires a lot of planning, including developing a
marketing plan that focuses on customers' needs; after all,
investment product managers shouldn't try to sell a high-growth
stock fund to a 90-year-old woman.
      The mutual fund industry may now have more than $1.67
trillion in assets, but so far bank proprietary funds have relied
mainly on converting existing assets rather than acquiring new
customers, said Kenneth Hoffman, president of the Optima Group
Inc., a Connecticut-based marketing consulting firm that
specializes in helping banks market mutual funds.
      The majority of bank proprietary mutual fund growth is
coming from the cannibalization of existing assets, he noted; to
change that trend, banks must put on their marketing hats.
When asked what pitfalls to avoid, Furash fired off this list:

Improperly explaining the product, including giving full and
complete disclosure of the risks;  Offering funds that are
attractive to the bank, not the customer; Trying to sell a stock
or fund without understanding what the customer wants; Confusing
the customer by selling too many options.  Most people want three
or four different options, plus some advice on allocation; Not
offering the right mix of options; Failure to perform due
diligence, investigating mutual fund vendors.
Many more potential traps probably lie ahead, so go cautiously.

   Market Ripe for the Taking

   Market Ripe for the Taking

      Despite snares, industry analysts are predicting that bank
investment products will be successful.  Baby boomers' propensity
to invest will be coupled with the fact that banks can use their
existing distribution system and their image to cash in on this
growing market.  Banks have a traditionally more trustworthy
reputation than non-banking institutions, said Furash.

   Bank of America Funds Show Strong Growth

      Bank of America is an example of a bank reaping big rewards.
Its Pacific Horizon Mutual Funds grew by 83 percent last year, as
opposed to the entire mutual fund industry's growth of 23
percent.  The nine funds had $12.2 billion in average assets
under management in 1992, compared with $6.6 billion in 1991.
      The growth of new assets in 1992 was principally due to
institutional clients--banks trust departments and Fortune 500
companies--that chose mutual funds over direct instruments, said
Debra McGinty-Poteet, senior vice president and manager of mutual
funds for Bank of America.
      Other reasons are low interest rates that make funds more
attractive to investors and marketing and sales efforts by
Concord Financial Group Inc. (the distributor) and the
relationship managers at Bank of America Funds Management, said
McGinty-Poteet.  Bank of America's and Security Pacific National
Bank's April 1992 merger also resulted in the convergence of
several funds.
      Bank of America NT&SA is the investment adviser to the
Pacific Horizon Funds.  Concord Holding Corp., a proprietary bank
mutual fund administrator, administers the Pacific Horizon funds;
its subsidiary, Concord Financial Group Inc., is the sponsor and
underwriter and distributor.
      Here are some tips from Hoffman on how to make mutual funds
and other investment products tempting enough to keep existing
deposits as well as attract new customers--and their money.

      1.  Give investment products the marketing efforts they deserve.
Banks aren't placing a priority on marketing funds, and "many
banks have attempted to pass marketing responsibility over to
their distributors without effectively communicating their
expectations," said Hoffman.  According to a survey performed by
Optima, 17 percent of senior fund managers reported that no
dollars were committed to mutual fund marketing, while 28 percent
didn't know what percentage of operating expenses went to funds
marketing.
       Optima Group discovered in its survey that banks with a
marketing plan are twice as likely to view their fund product as
"very successful," yet more than one-half of the banks surveyed,
with proprietary funds, had no developed marketing plan.
      The best approach is to cultivate a joint marketing plan
with the distributor, said Hoffman; that is done by about 36
percent of the banks with a marketing plan.  Another 29 percent
did one in-house, while 36 percent left marketing to the
distributor.
      Banks also err by not properly allocating advertising
dollars.  "The strategy that works well for Fidelity and Vanguard
is unlikely to work for your bank for two fundamental reasons:
First, customers of the mutual fund companies are unlikely to
switch; second, the mutual fund companies will always outspend
you," he said, adding that the large mutual fund companies can
spend more than $100 in advertising and marketing for every new
customer they acquire.

      2.  Avoid turf wars.  Retail bankers are used to thinking of
trust departments as handling clients with tax, estate and
investment management concerns.  In turn, trust departments view
brokers as people poised to steal the best customers, and view
retail customers as unprofitable.
      The choice is "to rely exclusively on converted assets and
let your departments squabble over control of the marketing of
the mutual funds or to develop a consistent, well thought-out
marketing plan that commits a significant portion of bank
resources to capitalize on the immense potential of mutual
funds," said Hoffman.

      3.  Capitalize on Competitive Advantages.  One of those
advantages is customer access, including information from
databases, branches and loan applications.
      "Frequent contact with customers provides a tremendous
opportunity to cross-sell existing customers into mutual funds.
This is an advantage which brokerage firms, insurance companies
and other financial competitors do not have.  At a bank,
customers literally 'come to you,'" Hoffman said.

      4.  Focus on customers with the greatest promise.  Carefully
analyze available data, including DDA dollar velocity, CD
balances, credit card balances, credit lines and savings
balances.  Doing so separates the investors from the savers.
      DDA dollar velocity, the amount of money a customer puts
into his checking account each month, can be a prime indicator of
customer income.
      Combined with other research such as car buying habits and
residence location, the resulting market segmentation can be used
for mailings and telemarketing, Hoffman said.  Its effectiveness
in using it to market investment products can then be tested and
refined.
      "This data on purchase behavior is critical," said Hoffman.
"Banks should take pains to update it, nurture it and make it an
operable part of future marketing efforts.

      5.  Divide and conquer, then offer something extra.  Divide
potential customers into three groups:  the traditional mutual
fund retail customer, the affluent and the high-end trust
customer.  Retail customers traditionally don't understand the
difference between stocks and bonds.  But they could become a
lucrative market if those products are explained properly.
      The high-end investors need more services, such as trust
services and portfolio rebalancing.
      Customers that fall in the middle may require a relationship
manager; they often need more service than the traditional retail
customer but don't possess the assets of a trust customer, said
Hoffman.

      6.  Offer brokers incentives.  Instead of worrying that the
brokers will take away the largest customers, bankers need to
focus on strengthening those relationships.  Besides offering
monetary incentives, bankers can give brokers access to customer
data and sales support.  Separate customer statements for the
funds are attractive, as are prospectus wraps with strong sales
messages, dedicated wholesaler telephone support, service support
and cross-sale programs to encourage customers to commit
additional dollars to the fund.

BANKS AGAINST NON-BANKS ON EQUITY INVESTMENTS

      Despite the hard knocks banks have taken in the recent past,
commercial bank trust departments have come out winners over the
past 10 years when it comes to equity investments.
      In fact, over the past decade banks have outperformed mutual
funds, insurance companies and investment advisors in equity
funds under management, according to an annual study conducted by
CDA Investment Technologies Inc., an independent investment
performance measurement service.
      The Rockville, Md.-based company also found that banks
reaped higher equity returns than insurance companies and mutual
funds over the last three- and five-year periods.
      Fixed income returns also fared well, with banks remaining
competitive with those experienced by mutual fund and insurance
companies over the last three-, five- and 10-year periods.

   Bank Trust Departments Produce Returns as Good as Non-Banks

      The survey results are evidence that bank trust departments
are holding their own and producing good investment returns for
their clients.
      "Not only do the absolute returns compare favorably to our
major competitors, but bank-managed portfolios have exhibited
more consistent results under varying market conditions, a
reflection of lower risk profiles," said Henry Gooss, managing
director and chief investment officer of Chemical Bank.
      For the one-, three-, and five-year periods, investment
advisors achieved the highest annualized rate of return in
equities, but banks edged them out over the last 10-year period.
      The chart below summarizes the study's findings for the one-
, three-, five- and 10-year period ended Dec. 31, 1992:

ANNUALIZED RATE OF RETURN ON EQUITIES

                      1-Yr      3-Yr      5-Yr    10-Yr

Banks                  8.7%    11.3%      15.7%   15.6%
Mutual Funds           8.5%    10.0%      14.0%   13.5%
Insurance Cos.         7.5%    10.3%      14.9%   15.4%
Investment Advisors    9.3%    11.9%      16.3%   15.3%
S&P's 500              7.6%

      The survey also found that banks have performed consistently
in the fixed-income area against mutual funds and insurance
companies.  Investment advisors were excluded for lack of data.
      For the one-year period, banks, at 6.8 percent, were
slightly behind mutual funds (6.9 percent) and insurance
companies (7.1 percent).  Over the last three years, banks
achieved a 9.8 percent annualized rate of return, ahead of mutual
funds (9.4 percent) and behind insurance companies (10.2
percent).
      Over the five-year period, banks, which achieved a 10-
percent annualized rate of return, were again behind insurance
companies (10.6 percent), but still ahead of mutual funds (9
percent).  This pattern repeated itself over the 10-year period,
with banks reaping 10.6 percent, mutual funds bringing in 10.2
percent and insurance companies achieving 11.3 percent.
      The Rockville, Md.-based research firm based its equity
research on a survey of 1,489 managers, consisting of 217 bank-
pooled funds, 73 separate/variable insurance accounts, 577 mutual
funds and 622 investment advisors, which manage a total of $1.2
trillion in assets.
      For its fixed-income research, CDA surveyed 741 managers,
broken down into 215 bank-pooled funds, 38 separate and variable
insurance accounts and 488 mutual funds, that manage a total of
$316 billion in assets. (For more information, call Jeff Schutes,
CDA, 301/975-9600.)

CHEMICAL TO GET TAX BREAK, NEW BUSINESS IN DUBLIN

      Chemical Banking Corp.'s Geoserve unit has established
operations in Dublin's International Financial Service Center
(IFSC) by acquiring Irish Life's IFSC licenses.
      The bank foresees the move as an opportunity to generate new
business and expand products and services available to existing
and prospective clients, said Jeremiah O'Leary, senior vice
president of Chemical Bank and general manager of the global
securities services division of its Geoserve unit.
      Chemical also chose the IFSC because it's sponsored by the
Irish government and is fully sanctioned by the European
Community.
      "As a result, this location provides access to the entire EC
market and comes with a comprehensive set of tax treaties in
addition to its own favorable tax environment.  Dublin is rapidly
becoming a major center for offshore fund management," O'Leary
said.
      The IFSC was created to encourage the growth of financial
services activities in Ireland; qualifying financial operations
receive special tax incentives to operate within the center; more
than 200 companies currently operate from the IFSC.
      The two licenses acquired from Irish Life will operate as
separate companies under the names Chemical Fund Administrators
Ltd. and Chemical Custody & Trustee Services Ltd.  They will
become part of the Global Securities Services Division (GSS) of
Chemical Bank's Geoserve unit.
      Chemical Fund Administrators, Ltd. will offer fund managers
and promoters administrative and ancillary services relating to
the issue, redemption and conversion of units in collective
investment schemes in accordance with the directives adopted by
the member states of the European Community.  Chemical Custody
and Trustee Services, Ltd. will act as custodian and/or trustee
on behalf of client fund management companies. Geoserve, Chemical
Bank's global wholesale services arm, provides cash management,
funds transfer, securities processing, corporate trust and trade
services to corporations and financial institutions.  Its annual
revenues exceed $700 million. Global Securities Services provides
domestic and global custody, dealer and broker clearance,
securities lending and master trust services. Chemical has been a
frontrunner in using cutting edge technology to offer global
trust and custody services.  Last year, its ChemTrust system went
live in New York and Europe, fully integrating worldwide
reporting and accounting on one platform.  The system allows
clients to view the status of their global and domestic holdings
in real-time on one integrated report.

MUTUAL FUNDS, INVESTMENT ADVISER ARE BILLS TO WATCH

      Two bills germane to selling mutual funds are in front of
Congress this session: The Financial Services Act of 1993 and the
Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act of
1993.
      The Financial Services Act (H.R. 458), introduced by Rep.
Peter Hoagland (D-Neb.) in January, would expand bankers' ability
to engage in full mutual fund activities by permitting bank
subsidiaries and affiliates to underwrite and distribute mutual
funds. Mutual funds represent a significant market for bankers.
Approximately 120 banks now offer over 675 proprietary mutual
funds; total assets are an estimated $25 billion.  But under
current law, banks must use a middleman instead of having full
control over sponsorship and distribution of their own products.
      Banks are only permitted to serve as investments advisers,
custodians, transfer agents and fund administrators.
      National banks, their subsidiaries and bank holding company
subsidiaries are also allowed to both broker and recommend
securities of investment companies for which they serve as
investment advisors.

   Act Would Give Bankers More Freedom

      The act would give bankers the freedom to sponsor,
distribute and underwrite mutual fund shares--eliminating the
need to involve a third-party provider. Also, management
interlocks between a bank or bank holding company and the mutual
fund subsidiary would be permissible.  The act would also require
one-time disclosures to be made to customers regarding, among
other things, the lack of FDIC insurance for these investment
products.
      This bill has seen no action yet.  It was first introduced
in the closing hours of the last session, mainly for purposes of
discussion.  Keep an eye out.

   The Investment Adviser Regulatory Enhancement and Disclosure Act

      This bill (H.R. 578), introduced by Rep. Rick Boucher (D-
Va.) in January, would amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
an act criticized by industry players for having no teeth.
      The bill proposes to rectify the deficiency by providing
enhanced supervision and regulation of investment advisers by
providing for:

       Higher registration fees (initial and yearly) for
investment advisers to fund more SEC inspections and surveys of
unregistered advisers; More frequent SEC examination of high risk
advisers;  A record-keeping requirement to verify suitability;
SEC authority to designate a self-regulatory organization to
conduct investment adviser examinations; Enhanced disclosure
through brochures containing general information, advance
transactional reports revealing commissions and third-party
payments, and periodic reports of all charges; Client assets;
Disqualification from being an investment adviser for a felony
conviction; Confidentiality with respect to personally
identifiable information unless consent is given.

      Because the bill doesn't propose any change in the
definition of investment adviser, it wouldn't apply to banks or
their trust departments as they are currently exempt from the
definition.  It would, however, have an impact on banks that have
established separate subsidiaries.
      This act was also introduced last session and passed
committees in both the House and Senate, but differences couldn't
be worked out before the recess. Testimony has already begun this
session, and further action is expected.

NEW CALIFORNIA ACTION SEEKS RESCISSION OF PRU PARTNERSHIP RESIDUALS

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   A group of California investors has sued Prudential Securities, claiming
that the firm's continuing residual payments to brokers and former Direct
Investment Group executives has perpetuated its allegedly deceptive limited
partnership sales practices.
   The group, which brought its case in California Superior Court in
Sacramento County, is also demanding rescission of both the residual
payments and its members' limited partnership investments because the firm
failed to disclose financial incentives for brokers to sell the funds.
   Among former high-ranking Prudential Securities executives receiving
residual payments is James Darr, the former head of the firm's Direct
Investment Group, who has frequently been mentioned during investigations
of the firm's partnership problems. According to published reports, Darr
has received more than $2 million in partnership residuals.
   ``We're saying that the fraud was not over and done with at the time of
the sales,'' said Allan Haley, one of three lawyers representing the group.
``Every day Prudential pays residuals is a continuation.''
Prudential has responded to the claim and a hearing on that response is
scheduled for Jan. 30.
   The plaintiffs have petitioned the court to enjoin and restrain
Prudential from ``making or receiving'' further residual payments without
first making full disclosure of each contractual obligation currently in
effect and offering to rescind each contract for the sale of a Prudential
direct investment made in California.
   The suit also is seeking to rescind each limited partnership sale made
after Sept. 1, 1982, and force Prudential ``to account for and to disgorge
the profits made through its unlawful and unfair business acts and
practices in California.'' The investors made their partnership purchases
between 1983 and 1987.
   The foundation of the suit is in a California statute stating any
financial interests a broker has in a security must be disclosed prior to
the transaction. Unless the broker notifies the client of the existence of
the financial interest, a client has a right to cancel the transaction.
   ``Not disclosed in any offering document or sales communication directed
to any plaintiff or other purchaser was the fact that the registered
representative of PSI making such sale had been given by PSI an
indeterminate, open-ended participation in the cash flow, earnings,
refinancing and distribution rights held by the PSI affiliate involved in
that PSI partnership,'' according to the plaintiffs' filing.
   The suit also includes a 1982 memo from former Prudential CEO George
Ball that states: ``Starting September 1st, 50% of Bache's net earnings
from Tax Investment Group programs, from which Bache Properties, Bache
Energy, or Bache Leasing subsequently earns asset residuals interests
and/or cash flow, will be paid to Account Executives who sell $25,000 of
any such offering.''
   Prudential's response said the plaintiffs' claims are made beyond the
statute of limitations, coming eight years after their initial investments,
that the California laws under which the claim is filed is pre-empted by
Federal statutes, and that the state's Business and Professional code is
not applicable to securities transactions based on a similar 1988 ruling in
Hawaii.
   San Francisco law firm Steefel, Levitt & Weiss is representing
Prudential in the case.

MEGA-PRODUCER LANYI LANDS AT OPCO'S MIDTOWN BRANCH

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   Andrew Lanyi, author, radio show host, and $4 million-producer, last
week agreed to bring his team to Oppenheimer & Co.'s Midtown Manhattan
office from Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., branch manager Jordan Berlin
confirmed.
   At Ladenburg, Lanyi operated his team as a self-contained unit, Andrew
Lanyi Research Inc., but he will join Oppenheimer as a senior vp. He will
continue to publish his own research and follow what he terms ``tomorrow's
blue chips,'' undervalued, under-followed stocks.
   Lanyi's 10-person team is comprised of three brokers, one full-time
analyst, and other support staff. Berlin described Lanyi as the ``most
organized, hardest-working broker I've ever known.''
   In addition to his brokerage work, Lanyi, a Holocaust survivor who
arrived in the United States penniless, has a radio show on New York's WEVD
and has written a book, ``Confessions of a Stockbroker.''
   One national headhunter said Lanyi, who was at Lehman Brothers before
Ladenburg, was among the most sought-after brokers on the recruiting
scene.

NYSE MEMBERS FINDING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LEASE SEATS AS PRICES SOAR

By:
Heike Wipperfurth

   While the NYSE is ringing out 1995 on many record notes, floor brokers
and specialists are beginning to feel the heat as prices of membership
leases on the Big Board are reaching a new high, making it more difficult
for some to afford the cost as demand remains strong, sources said.
   While some NYSE participants seem eager to pay higher prices for
membership privileges on the world's largest equities market, others are
unwilling or unable to pay up, and drop out, sources said.
   Attorney James Rothenberg said that he had unfilled demand from a
specialist and a floor broker wanting to purchase a lease on a seat at an
annual cost of $150,000 each, up from recent lease prices of between
$130,000 and $140,000. Prices are typically negotiated between the lessee
and the lessor as a private agreement and the NYSE does not get involved,
an NYSE spokeswoman said.
   Demand for seat leasing is skyrocketing because of the recent rise in
trading volume and the positive direction of the market, Rothenberg said.
   Sources said that about 740, or more than half of the 1,366 seats on the
Big Board, have been leased. The rise in demand for the limited amount of
seats creates major problems for some members, sources said.
   ``It's definitely a problem. It's hard to get a lease,'' a source said.
A lot of specialists, he noted, are trying to lock in costs by paying
premium prices for two-year leases. They are afraid that next year's prices
may be even higher, he said. As a result, some two-dollar brokers are not
able to make it and they drop out, he noted.
   The high prices for seat leases reflect record prices for seat sales,
sources noted. One source predicted that a seat soon could go for as much
as $1.15 million up from the last seat sale at $1,05 million in December.
   At the end of 1995, the Big Board's market capitalization reached $6
trillion. There were 2,675 NYSE-listed companies with 155.2 billion shares
available on the exchange, according to statistics from the Federation of
International Stock Exchanges.

LAWYERS FIGHTING OVER ACCESS TO DOCUMENTS IN NASDAQ ANTITRUST SUIT

By:
Heike Wipperfurth

   Lawyers on both sides of the antitrust suit involving 33 of the biggest
Nasdaq market makers filed court motions in December accusing the other
side of not providing enough documents, sources said.
   The bickering between the opposing sides will be carried into the court
room for a hearing on January 17 before Judge Robert Sweet in the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, an attorney said.
   Defendants' lawyers filed a motion in late December requesting more
documents relating to how `class' was defined by the plaintiff lawyers, he
said. Plaintiffs' lawyers, on the other hand, are fighting for additional
access to documents and tape recordings and are asking for permission to
confer with the Justice Department, he noted.
   Both sides think that they do not have everything they are entitled to,
he said. This is ``the typical bickering over how much paper each side is
going to produce at the beginning of a big case,'' he added.
   In addition, the source said that Judge Sweet has to make a decision on
a motion filed by the Los Angeles Times in December, requesting, among
other things, that the court break its confidentiality order and provide
access to the tapes and other material handed over to the plaintiff lawyers
by the defendants.
   The antitrust suit accusing major Nasdaq market makers of collusion,
price fixing and overpricing was filed after an academic study brought to
public attention of indirect evidence of implicit collusion among market
makers.

PRU'S FORMER SAN FRANCISCO MANAGER MOVES TO NASHVILLE

By:
Daniel Colarusso

   Mike Baker, Prudential Securities' former San Francisco branch manager,
last week moved to Nashville to take over the firm's branch in the city,
sources said.
   Baker was dismissed from his San Francisco manager's post in late 1994
for what appeared to be compliance-related problems (SW, 7 Nov. '94, 4). At
that time, Baker had been expected to take the helm of the consolidated
office made up of Prudential's two metro San Francisco offices. That branch
is the firm's largest nationwide.
   Since leaving the managerial position, Baker has continued working for
Prudential as an internal auditor.
   Ironically, Nashville manager Rick Hertz was recently dismissed for
compliance-related problems in that same office.

DEBATE REMAINS ON RULES TO ENSURE BEST EXECUTION FOR MULTIPLE TRADED
OPTIONS

   A letter submitted recently to the SEC by the Committee On Options
Proposals concerning the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's so-called ``Trade or
Send'' rule for multiple traded options, indicates that a split remains
within the industry on how to ensure the best execution of trades entered.
   The letter, while noting that the COOP ``has [previously] endorsed
[Phlx's] filing in principal,'' also indicated that it ``has received
little or no support from the other exchanges.''
Under Phlx's proposed rule, which was submitted as the exchange's proposal
to ensure that customers receive the best offered price on an option at all
times, when a market maker or specialist at another exchange makes a better
bid than his counterpart at another exchange where the order was first
submitted, the order would automatically be sent to the exchange making a
better market.
   Part of the Phlx rule also requires that public customer orders be
designated as ``Principal Acting as Agent,'' or PA orders, to differentiate
them from trades submitted by institutional customers. However, sources
said, that rule provision has led to some market makers and specialists
refusing to honor posted prices for anything other than small customer
orders.
   Previously, a majority of the industry had instead supported, and still
support, a so-called ``Trade or Fade'' rule, which allows market makers and
specialists to match a better bid, or to contact his counterpart at the
other exchange to negotiate the price. Then, if the market maker or
specialist making the better bid decides not to deal with his counterpart
he can withdraw (fade) the bid.
   While the Trade or Fade rule has been used up until now, the COOP noted
in its letter to the SEC that several exchanges have indicated that ``their
market-makers/specialists match the Best Bid/Offer (BBO) [only] 93% of the
time they receive options orders that are eligible for automated
execution.''
Although the COOP called the results ``a commendable feat,'' it also
indicated that ``the member firm community is very concerned about the
portion of the remaining 7% who do not obtain the BBO.''
   The Trade or Fade rule, the COOP added, is by it nature limited in
addressing the problem, and it added that in any case ``it has been
reported that some trading crowds are not honoring Trade or Fade
procedures.''
Phlx's rule would seem to solve the problem, but the COOP noted in its
letter that the nation's other four options exchange don't support it.
   In the past, the other exchanges have argued that to properly implement
a Trade or Send rule a fully automated linkage system would need to be
developed, something that was originally part of an overall plan for the
multiple trading environment but that was abandoned as too costly before
multiple listing was imposed on the entire market for new listings.
   As a compromise, Phlx's rule was supported in principal with the
provision that the exchange make various adjustments, but sources indicated
that many COOP members now regret the endorsement.
   For its part, the SEC has not been pressuring the exchanges extensively
to accept a standardized rule, probably because the BBO has occurred in the
vast majority of cases. With competition for new listings heating up,
though, the agency could begin to push the industry more strongly.
   Previously the regulator delayed a vote on any rule regarding the issue
until December of last year, allowing a November deadline to pass. The
current government shutdown followed, so the agency has yet to act and it's
unclear when it will be able to do so.
   In the meantime, the COOP has scheduled a meeting for this Saturday for
industry representatives to discuss the issue, along with some other
issues. Among the topics to be discussed will be whether to reconsider the
development of a linkage system to determine if it would be ``economically
feasible.''
   Separately, The Options Industry Council, an educational and
informational group comprised of the nation's options exchanges and The
Options Clearing Corp., last week reported that equity options volume
reached an all-time high in 1995, with 174.4 million contracts changing
hands, surpassing the previous record, set in 1987, by 6%.

NASD SEEKS NEW BROKER/DEALER COMPENSATION LIMITS ON MUTUAL FUND AND
VARIABLE CONTRACT SECURITIES

   The NASD is seeking SEC approval to amend its Rules of Fair Practice to
limit the use of ``cash and non-cash compensation received by
broker/dealers who sell mutual funds and variable contract securities.''
   The NASD said the amendments would ``tighten and broaden existing rules
on the sale of these investment products,'' and added that they were
proposed ``in response to the increased use of non-cash compensation and
certain types of incentive-based cash compensation for the sale of
investment company and variable contract securities.''
   Such practices, the NASD said, ``may heighten the potential for a
member's loss of supervisory control over sales practices and increase the
possibility of the perception of impropriety,'' resulting in a loss of
investor confidence.
   Broadly, the new rule amendments would do the following:
   -- Prohibit, except under certain circumstances, broker/dealers from
receiving any cash or non-cash compensation from anyone other than the NASD
member with which the individual is associated.
   -- Require that NASD members maintain records of compensation received
from an investment company, an adviser to an investment company, a fund
administrator, an underwriter and any affiliated person.
   -- Prohibit receipt by a broker of cash compensation in connection with
the sale of investment company securities, unless the arrangement is
described in the current prospectus.
   -- Retain the prohibition, only with respect to the Investment Company
Rule, against a broker receiving compensation in the form of securities.
   -- Prohibit, with some exceptions, NASD members and associated persons
from accepting, directly or indirectly, any non-cash compensation in
connection with the sale of investment company and variable contract
securities.
   -- Prohibit, again with certain exceptions, an associated person from
accepting cash sales incentives for the sale of investment company or
variable contract securities.
   Separately, the NASD has also submitted new rules to the SEC designed to
eliminate potential confusion by investors purchasing mutual funds and
similar products on the premises of banks, savings and loans, credit unions
and other financial institutions other than broker/dealers.
   The new rule would require NASD member firms, among other things, to
conduct business in a location distinct from the area where retail deposits
are taken whenever possible; provide customers with a written document
outlining differences in insurance coverage and risks for securities and
institution deposits; and prohibit member firms from making payments,
including referral fees, to individuals employed by the financial
institution who are not registered with the member firm.

S.W.I.F.T. LAUNCHES NEW TRADE INITIATION AND CONFIRMATION MESSAGES TO
IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND TIMELINESS

   S.W.I.F.T. announced that it has made available new securities messages
for trade initiation and confirmation on its global network that it said
would ``significantly improve the efficiency and timeliness of confirming
trades as the industry globally moves towards shorter settlement cycles.''
Using the messages will allow S.W.I.F.T. customers to issue settlement
instructions through the same window as trade confirmations, resulting, the
firm said, in ``greater straight-through processing and single-window links
to trade counterparties.''
   The new messages will allow customers to more easily process their
trades automatically end-to-end, the firm said, adding that in the United
Kingdom regulators and tax authorities have approved accepting the
confirmation messages as electronic contract notes, meaning they can be
used to confirm trades without the need for a paper copy.
   The first users of the new messages, the firm said, will include The
Hong Kong Securities Industry Group, which will also ``be piloting the new
messages in conjunction with connection to the New York Depository Trust
Co.
   S.W.I.F.T. added that the new messages can be used in conjunction with
existing securities order and confirmation messages, which are slated to be
removed from the network in November of this year.

DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

The Department of the Treasury said it would continue to work with Congress
to determine whether additional ``transitional relief'' should be granted
on a recent proposal to deny or defer interest deductions of certain
financial instruments that have become popular on the Street. Under current
transitional relief already granted by Treasury most such instruments
registered with the SEC on or before Dec. 7 will not be subject to the
proposals.

FIMAT HIRES S&P FUTURES BROKER GROUP FROM LIT TO EXPAND PRESENCE

By:
Michael Ocrant

   Fimat, the futures sales and clearing division of Societe Generale
Group, hired a group of about 10 broker professionals to execute business
on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, mostly in S&P 500
contracts traded at the exchange, from LIT, a division of First Options of
Chicago.
   The group, headed by Luke Adrian, will also conduct some trading in the
Eurodollar pit at the Merc, sources said.
   Previously the group operated as an independent futures commission
merchant prior to becoming a division of LIT, sources said, adding that it
will remain a division of Fimat.
   Sources said the firm views the new hires as a way to add to its current
business profile and to meet the expected demand from clients for broker
execution services, particularly in the equity index area.
   Sources said the firm also hopes that the addition of the group will
raise Fimat's profile at the exchange and in general.
   Because of the steep rise in equity markets last year, sources said,
there is an expectation at Fimat that there will be significant activity
this year as investors seek to hedge their positions or to speculate on
market moves.
   While Fimat had several employees handling the business on the floor of
the CME, sources said, the expected business in the coming year required
that the firm be ``reasonably well prepared'' to manage any surge by
bringing on board dedicated and experienced brokers capable of meeting all
customer needs.

LIFFE OUTLINES 1996 STRATEGIC PLANS SET FORTH LAST YEAR

   The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange has
outlined a number of strategic developments to help ensure that it retains
the position as the leading futures and options exchange outside of Chicago
and to further its worldwide market penetration throughout the coming
year.
   Cited first by the exchange was the linkage agreement between Liffe and
the Chicago Board of Trade, which was formally signed just last month after
months of prior negotiations.
   Liffe noted that the linkage will provide market users with increased
access to major government debt futures and options products on both sides
of the Atlantic during U.S. and European business hours. Initially, the
linkage will include Liffe's German government bond (bund) contract and the
CBT's U.S. Treasury bond contract, which are scheduled to begin trading in
the second quarter of this year.
   Next, the exchange said, in April of this year it will commence another
linkage with the Tokyo International Financial Futures Exchange that, under
an agreement signed last year, will begin the trading of a fungible
three-month Euroyen futures contract.
   Also slated for this year is a merger between Liffe and the London
Commodity Exchange, which the exchange said will be the first step in
``providing a platform for the development of a liquid European time zone
agricultural and soft commodity complex in London.''
   In an effort to maintain a leading technological edge, Liffe noted that
this month it would launch its APT trading system for options, a move it
said would create the first fully functional screen-based options trading
system in the world.
   Other technological initiatives, the exchange said, include the
development of its so-called LOTS system, designed to provide the
industry's first comprehensive electronic business processing system, and
the development of an unnamed automated system for its equity options
complex.
   Finally, the exchange noted that an agreement has been reached with
London Stock Exchange for Liffe to lease the LSE's former trading floor,
office and storage space, which will allow it to meet its medium-term
needs.
   Like other exchanges around the world last year, Liffe suffered a drop
in volume compared with the prior record year, but still had its second
busiest year ever. The exchange indicated that the various initiatives it
has in store for 1996 will help it continue to grow.

CHICAGO MERC PROPOSES FUTURES AND OPTIONS ON BRAZILIAN AND ARGENTINE
BRADYS

   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange last week filed for regulatory approval
to trade futures on Brady Bond indexes based on Brazilian and Argentine
issues.
   The new products will trade on the Merc's new Growth and Emerging
Markets (GEM) Division, which was launched in November.
   The Merc already trades a Mexican peso contract, which has recorded
strong volume since its April launch. In 1995, the contract averaged 1,186
contracts daily and 15,809 open interest positions.
   Also launched in November was the Merc's futures and options on the
Brazilian real. which also was met with strong interest.
   Open interest on the Brazilian real contracts passed 5,000 positions by
the end of 1995, with average daily volume hitting 559 contracts after only
34 trading days.

JAPAN:  MITI LINKS WITH VISA ON INTERNET

IN AN EFFORT to develop a global platform for electronic commerce,
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), recently
launched the "Smart Commerce Japan" project, which will allow Japanese
consumers to use a Visa card to pay for goods found in the virtual
shopping malls of the Internet. This forms part of the MITI's overall
strategy to promote a wider range of applications for electronic
commerce.

According to Visa, the pilot of the Smart Commerce Japan project will
involve the distribution of 35,000 chip cards which will conform to the
EMV (Europay, MasterCard and Visa) specifications, together with
compact stored-value card readers, to current Visa cardholders who have
experience using the Internet.

A source at Visa Japan told SCB that other Internet projects are also
being conceived by the ministry. Following the test of Smart Commerce
Japan, it is expected the MITI will develop other electronic data
interchange (EDI) type systems for the Internet.

Other systems being envisioned will facilitate the exchange of
trade-related information between individuals and corporations on the
Internet, with later systems allowing similar exchanges between
corporations.

The Smart Commerce Japan project is slated for a pilot debut in the
first quarter of 1997. It is believed to be the world's first system to
combine the EMV-compatible integrated chip card for electronic
commerce. Other payment systems available on the Internet are based on
conventional magnetic stripe technology.

The project will allow Visa cardholders to use their card not only for
credit and debit transactions but also for stored-value transactions on
the Internet. Cardholders might even be able to load up their
reloadable stored-value cards on special terminals in their homes.

Team leader of Smart Commerce Japan, Toshiba Corporation, said the
project will promote electronic shopping and put powerful chip cards
into the hands of thousands of Japanese consumers.

The project is undertaken by a consortium headed by Toshiba and will
also involve international credit card association, Visa International,
Daiei Group, Japan's largest retailer and the Hankyu Toho Group, a
diversified entertainment, retail and transportation group.

A spokesperson for Toshiba said the company's role in the project will
involve the provision of system integration from the EMV compatible
chip card and related devices to back-end servers.

According to Visa, the lack of security for financial transactions over
open networks has hampered the development of electronic commerce. To
overcome this constraint, Toshiba and Visa have revealed that they will
be working to develop hardware applications to facilitate secure
payment over the Internet. It is expected that when the pilot commences
in the first quarter of 1997, a common application standard will
already be in place.

Visa International had earlier partnered software giant, Microsoft, to
develop Secure Transaction Technology (STT), an open standard for
security and payment applications. Visa would not confirm whether
Microsoft are involved in the Japanese project.

A source at MasterCard, the other international card association
currently developing a standard for secured Internet payment
transactions, said: "It is perplexing that for Internet transactions,
which are global in nature, it is necessary to create a Japanese
standard for secured payment. We will certainly be watching this
project with interest."

The source at Visa, however, said there is no intention to create a
Japanese standard for secured transactions. "The objective is not to
create a de facto standard, if another standard comes out and is well
accepted, we will use that. But what we do want to create is
international operability. There will eventually be a commonality of
standards between what Visa and MasterCard are attempting to do."

A spokesman for Toshiba said: "We will adopt a world-standard security
technology, which is compatible with the settlement system for
EMV-based IC cards."

It is understood that Toshiba will co-operate with Netscape
Communications Corporation, a leading Internet-related software
provider, to develop the Internet platform for the project. It will
also develop the system for EMV chip transactions over the Internet, as
well as the Sun Microsystems' Java-based interface software between the
EMV chip card and the transaction system.

Visa said that, during the pilot, experiments will be conducted to find
ways to deliver the convenience of shopping in cyberspace to those who
do not own a home PC, such as the construction of"Virtual Mall Kiosks"
placed in convenient locations. Several credit card issuers, major
retailers and Japan's leading banks will be involved in the pilot.

MONDEX HIRES EXEC FOR AMERICAN EXPANSION

MONDEX International has hired a US-based executive as another effort
by the NatWest-led smart card project to build franchises throughout
North and South America.

Timothy Stewart, who worked for AT&T's corporate strategy and business
development office, will be a US-based liaison to Mondex International.
Stewart formally begins work this month, out of his New Jersey
residence, according to Tim Jones, Mondex International's chief
executive.

Jones introduced Stewart to bankers during the BAI Retail Delivery Show
in Atlanta. According to Jones, Stewart will be a "relationship manager
for all of the Americas", with Canada, the US and other national
subsidiaries reporting through his office.

"We'd like to get Canada and the US operational on an integrated basis
and then expand southward," to Latin America, Stewart told SCB in a
recent interview. Stewart has a business as well as technical
background from his days with AT&T's Bell Laboratories, where he was
involved with research and development.

"If you're dealing with North American corporations, it's important to
have someone on the ground, in the same time zone, available for
meetings at short notice. He'll sweep the whole load of issues. We have
more people wanting to talk to us than we can cope with at the moment,"
Jones said, though he declined to identify the banks involved.

In the US, to date, Mondex has encountered heavy resistance and has not
yet been embraced. Detractors claim that US regulators will never
authorise Mondex because it is harder to audit and control centrally.

Mondex is the only electronic purse scheme that proposes card-to-card
transfers between users without requiring that transactions be routed
through a central clearing mechanism. This will only encourage tax
evasion and money laundering, critics have said.

But Stewart said he was optimistic that regulators at the office for
Comptroller of the Currency and the federal Reserve Board would be
convinced of security and integrity of the Mondex scheme.

In mid-1995, Mondex got its first foothold in the US at Wells Fargo
Bank, which initiated a test among fewer than 100 employees. Jones said
he hopes the $50 billion-asset San Francisco bank will roll out the
system and become a charter member of the Mondex USA franchise.

Elsewhere, according to an industry observer, NationsBank and NBD
Michigan (National Bank of Detroit) are said to be in discussions with
Mondex. Spokesmen from the two banks declined to comment.

There is also speculation that Midland Marine Bank of Buffalo will
participate, since it is owned by the UK Midland Bank, the other
founder of Mondex.

In another significant development last month, National Westminster
Group, which created Mondex in conjunction with Midland Group, sold New
Jersey-based subsidiary NatWest Bancorp.

The bank, which owns retail branches in the New York City area and a
credit card bank based in Delaware, was purchased by Fleet Financial
Group of Boston in a cash deal worth $3.26 billion. Jones said it had
been pretty obvious that NatWest USA would be an important part of
Mondex USA, but that discussions have already begun with Fleet.

PORTUGUESE KEEN ON PURSE

PORTUGAL'S SOCIEDADE Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) says it is
holding talks with a number of countries over the transfer of
technology and know-how of its Porta Moedas electronic purse, which was
launched in Portugal last year.

"The talks taking place are on two levels", explains Dra Carmo Alvim,
SIBS's head of marketing. "On the one hand, we are helping our Spanish
counterparts to actually set up their own electronic purse and, on the
other hand, we are providing, on a more general level, basic know-how
and information to countries as diverse as Israel, Brazil, the UK,
France and Canada".

She added that the Spanish electronic purse project should be up and
running by mid-1996."Both SIBS and the Spanish banking sector are keen
to make the two systems mutually acceptable, which means the Portuguese
will be able to use their electronic purse in Spain, and vice versa.

SIBS says the number of electronic purses in circulation is rising
faster than had been expected. Luis Cid, head of SIBS, recently told
journalists that Portugal issued in the month of October alone what it
took the Danish three years to achieve.

However, he conceded that the numbers are still well below the 10
million cards SIBS expects to be in circulation within the next five
years.

SIBS has already sold around 360,000 cards to the country's banks.
Until October 1995, over 100,000 cards were in circulation, with a
total loaded value of Esc174 million ($1.16 million). In the same
period, there were 7,028 POS terminals in operation, 4,343 of which
were off-line terminals exclusively for the electronic purse. Of this
number, 43 had been integrated into vending machines of various kinds.

The value of the average payment transaction (of which there were over
685,000 in the first nine months of the electronic purse's career) is
Esc370 ($2.5), which substitute for petty cash payments.

SIBS also says that the upgrading of the country's ATMs to accept
electronic purse loading facilities is virtually completed and that the
electronic purse will be usable nationwide within two years.

CARTE BLEUE BANKS GO LIVE WITH PURCHASING

THE FRENCH banks belonging to Groupement Carte Bleue have finally gone
live with the purchasing card service on their range of chip-based
products.

This information and payment system is now on offer to large
corporations that process small-value purchases by the "blue" banks,
that is, Societe Generale, Banque National de Paris and Credit
Lyonnais.

The average transaction value of items processed by these corporations
is estimated by Carte Bleue to be about Fr2,500 ($500). At the moment,
these purchases are carried out from a distance (by telephone, fax,
minitel or ordinary mail) in 90 percent of cases.

Every Carte Bleue member bank will be able to market the purchasing
service, and to personalise it, should it wish to do so, in order to
satisfy the requirements of its client companies.

The purchasing system, as it is defined today, will work from a common
operational core, which will have to evolve in order to become richer
as its market develops both nationally and internationally.

In 1994, the Groupement Carte Bleue conducted two studies of the way
potential customer firms viewed the service. What emerged from them was
that 38 percent of those surveyed expressed an interest in the service.

A study carried out in 1994 by Andersen Consulting evaluated the French
potential for service purchasing to be more than Fr110 billion, but
only took into account the market involving the country's 500 largest
firms in terms of turnover.

Jean-Marc Bornet, the chief executive of Carte Bleue, told CI that he
had great confidence in the future of the purchasing service: "The
question arose as to whether the purchasing service would be
experimented jointly once it had appeared in the Carte Bleue catalogue,
but the Groupement finally decided against this.

"French banks will, in fact, start off with the new product at their
own individual pace. It should be remembered that a large number of
telematic services are already offered to companies by French banks,
and the role of the purchasing service is to enrich the services
already available".

AUSTRALIA GEARS UP FOR SMART REVOLUTION

RECENTLY IDENTIFIED as one of the smart card centres of the world,
Australian consumers are expected to embrace chip technology with
enthusiasm. However, central bank regulators in the country have
expressed reservations about a possible loss of revenue if stored-value
cards (SVC) take off.

According to a report published by Visa International, called Payments
2001, the number of chip-based cards in Australia will swell to 27
million by the year 2001. Meanwhile, the number of consumers holding
cards is expected to rise to 2.8 million by the same year.

One of the greatest breakthroughs that will be facilitated by smart
cards is the ability to load funds on to the card at home. This could
be the catalyst for a massive increase in the use of home banking
services, said the report.

The Australian market also has the benefit of a sophisticated
telecommunications infrastructure. "The hurdles to connectivity are
already coming down. One fundamental is the broad band cable which is
being laid through Australian suburbs and which will not only provide
Australians with Pay TV but also all the utility of two-way data
communication in cyberspace."

In a survey conducted by Visa, Australian consumers were asked to
evaluate three stored-value options - a disposable card, a stand-alone
reloadable card and a multifunction card. The survey found that 72
percent of respondents favoured some form of stored-value function. Of
that figure, 44 percent want the chip embedded on their existing
credit/debit/ATM card. However, a substantial 37 percent preferred a
disposable card, while the remaining 19 percent opted for a reloadable
card.

Interestingly, disposable cards were preferred by those consumers who
thought of buying the cards for family and friends as gifts. "Almost 50
percent of Australian consumers would buy disposable cards for someone
else, and 40 percent would buy stand-alone reloadable cards for
others."

Another finding of the report was that 88 percent of consumers wanted
the capability to reload value onto their SVC at any ATM or eftpos
device and about 46 percent wanted the option of reloading the card at
home through a special device.

Identifying and signing the right merchants was given as an essential
requirement for the success of stored-value cards. Petrol stations were
highlighted as the most important, with 61 percent saying they wanted
to use their card there. Meanwhile, 60 percent identified grocery
stores, 40 percent pointed to payphones, 34 percent buses and trains,
and 29 percent mentioned post offices.

One issue which has not been resolved is the reaction of regulators to
a potentially radical shift in the means of payments. At the moment,
central banks earn money from issuing notes and coins, called
seigniorage.

According to Ray Jones, assistant secretary of the business finance and
superannuation branch of the Australian Federal Reserve: "The fiscal
impact of stored value cards will depend upon the speed and extent of
their market penetration. A sudden loss of a substantial revenue stream
would naturally have some public finance implications, but whether this
is a likely outcome is by no means clear at the moment."

According to Ian Harper in an article in The Australian Financial
Review, "they [stored-value] represent the first real threat to the use
of currency notes and coins in everyday payments. The bank and the
Treasury fear this may at last be about to change. And they have much
to lose."

However, he went on to say "there does not appear to be any significant
downward trend in seigniorage earned by the banks", but he attributed
this to the fact that stored-value cards are in their infancy.

Harper predicts that the Reserve Bank will not allow this revenue
stream disappear if stored-value does take off. "The bank also earns
seigniorage by obliging banks to hold compulsory reserves with it and
paying them low rates of interest or none at all. The trouble is that
banks might not be the main players in stored-value cards.

"The real worry for the Reserve Bank and the Treasury is the prospect
of multiple issuers which have no connection with the banking system at
all and no reason to pay seigniorage to the Reserve Bank," said Harper.

NEW ISSUES - WORLD COLOR LONG TERM BUY

   Currently an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, this company is a leading diversified commercial printer providing
digital prepress, press, multimedia, binding and distribution services to
customers in the magazine (an estimated 33% of 1995 net sales), catalog
(21%), direct mail (9%), commercial (30%), directory (7%), and new media
market sectors. Since the appointment of a new management team in May 1991,
the company has taken streamlining and other special pretax charges
totaling $196 million (including $38 million in the fourth quarter of
1995), invested more than $200 million in equipment and plant expansions to
position itself for growth and productivity improvements, and made nine
acquisitions having an aggregate purchase price of over $400 million.
   The company maintains 14 printing plants, one warehouse, one
prepress/warehouse facility, five prepress facilities, one
distribution/bindery facility, two distribution centers, and one multimedia
facility. The company supplies all of the ink and a substantial amount of
the paper it uses. An extensive network of sales offices located throughout
the U.S. is staffed by approximately 250 sales and marketing
representatives.
   Assuming exercise of the overallotment option, KKR is selling
approximately 12 million of the shares being offered, affiliates of Merrill
Lynch are selling about 2 million shares, and numerous less than one
percent holders are selling their shares. KKR's stake will be reduced to
50.1% (approximately 49% assuming exercise of the overallotment option).
Certain minority shareholders have agreed not to sell any of their
remaining shares for 120 days after the close of the offering, and the
company, KKR, and remaining stockholders have agreed not to do so for 180
days. As of October 1, 1995, debt was 59% of total capital. In 1995,
lenders increased the maximum available under the company's credit
facilities, of which about $89 million remains available.
   Since 1991, the actions of the new management have resulted in a
significant improvement in profitability. Measured by adjusted operating
income margin which excludes steamlining and other special charges,
profitability has increased from 3.4% of revenues in 1991 to 7.1% in the
first nine months of 1995. This has occurred despite that revenue growth
over that time has largely been derived from acquisitions and increases in
paper prices, offset to some extent by higher paper costs.
   Because of the company's substantial leverage, we think free cash flow
is a good method of valuation. Importantly, cash flow has been adequate to
pay down a substantial amount of acquired debt. The company projects
capital expenditures in 1996 will total $75 million and scheduled debt
principal payments total $21 million, leaving free cash flow by our
estimate of about $20.5 million, or $0.60 a share. We also expect free cash
flow will increase an average 40% annually over the next several years as
debt is repaid. Discounting projected free cash flow at the riskfree rate,
the stock price could increase 100% to 125% over a five year period. In the
short term we see the stock climbing to 22 to 24. We recommend purchase of
the shares as a long term holding.

Underwriters: Donaldson, Lufkin; CS First Boston; Morgan Stanley;
PaineWebber; Smith Barney. Offering: 13,780,328 com. shs. (all by selling

NEW ISSUES - OMNIPOINT SHORT TERM BUY

   As a result of this company's work in developing core spread spectrum
technology (software and integrated circuits) and working prototypes based
on this technology for various wireless voice, data and digitized
compressed video transmission projects, the FCC awarded it a Pioneer's
Preference right to a 30 MHZ license to provide Personal Communications
Services (PCS) for the New York Major Trading Area (MTA). The New York MTA,
with 26.8 million people, has the highest population of any MTA in the
nation. The FCC determined the company's license fee at 85% of the average
per population price of the winning bids for the top 23 MTAs, times the New
York MTA's population. The company has been accruing interest on this
obligation at the prime rate and expects interest only payments to begin in
1996. The company is also participating in the Entrepreneurs' Band Auction
for small businesses for additional PCS licenses in each of the 493 Basic
Trading Areas.
   The Omnipoint System has been designated by a key industry standard
setting group as IS-661. IS-661 is one of four technical common air
interfaces (CAI) competing for adoption by PCS license holders, the others
being PCS-1900, a system similar to the digital wireless standard common
across Europe and adopted in many other countries, CDMA, and TDMA, both of
which are being upbanded to the 1900 MHz section of the radio spectrum from
current cellular technologies.
   Each CAI has its proponents among equipment manufacturers and service
providers. The Omnipoint System, as the company proposes to implement
IS-661, is a hybrid system that will interface with PCS-1900 based systems.
It also incorporates certain coding features of CDMA between cell sites,
but uses timing features of TDMA within cells to separate channels. The
company expects that initial capital costs to deploy a commercial IS-661
system, incremental capital costs per subscriber, and ability to rapidly
scale up a system as demand grows, will enable it to offer a variety of
wireless services at lower costs than current cellular and wireline
competitors.
   The company has entered into or committed to agreements with Northern
Telecom for Omnipoint to buy, and for Telecom to sell infrastructure
equipment and finance system buildout, up to $612 million. It has also
entered into a series of agreements with Ericsson for, among other things,
the development of dual mode IS-661/PCS-1900 handsets. The agreements
obligate the company to purchase $250 million of infrastructure equipment
and $100 million of handsets from Ericsson, which will provide up to $375
million of vendor financing. Additional handset development, manufacturing,
marketing and sale agreements have been entered into with JRC International
and Hansol Paper Co., the latter being primarily in Korea and other parts
of Asia.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used for interest payments on the New
York MTA license, for development and marketing of Omnipoint technology and
equipment, and in connection with additional PCS licenses, if any,
purchased by the company. Other than the New York MTA license obligation,
other debt as of September 30, 1995 totaled $26 million.
   The three largest shareholders are Avance Capital, which will own 22% of
the outstanding shares, Madison Dearborn Capital Partners, L.P. 16%, and
Allen & Co. 9.7%. Insiders and their affiliates in the aggregate will
control 64% of the stock. About 1.2 million shares will be eligible for
sale in the public market beginning 90 days after the offering closes, and
26.4 million upon expiration of the underwriter's 180 day lockup period.
   Although IS-661 has obtained separate CAI designation, IS-661 systems
are designed to be compatible with PCS-1900 systems. PacBell and Bell
South, which will construct PCS-1900 systems in certain license areas, have
tentatively agreed to provide each others' subscribers with roaming
capability in the others' license areas. The company expects to have a
pilot system in operation in New York City in the first half of 1996, and
to begin wider deployment by the end of the year.
   Significant revenues will not occur until 1997, even if all goes
according to plan, which it will likely not, judging by the experience of
other wireless service firms. We believe losses will be sustained through
1999. Nevertheless, based on per POP valuations of wireless services firms,
we think the stock price will initially rise from the 13 to 15 range
proposed for the offering, but is likely to be volatile as quarterly
results exceed or fall short of expectations. We recommend purchase of the
shares as a short term holding.

NEW ISSUES - VANSTAR SHORT TERM BUY

   This company provides extensive PC network infrastructure products and
services throughout the network life cycle which it divides into four, more
or less distinct stages: design and consulting, deployment, operation and
support, and enhancement and migration. The company exited the retail arena
in early 1994, which was conducted primarily through the Computerland
franchise business.
   The current business strategy is predicated on the belief that the
market for outsourced PC network services is growing at a compound annual
rate of more than 14%, and that profitability can grow at a faster rate
because the valued added services which comprise a growing percentage of
the company's business have higher margins than the traditional services
which it provided, such as product procurement and repair and maintenance.
   The company's technical workforce currently exceeds 2,200 employees
nationwide, including a rapidly expanding systems engineering force, which
grew from about 200 in March 1994 to over 600 as of October 1995. The
company will seek to expand its business globally by entering strategic
alliances with international partners. Over the past four quarters, about
225 customers purchased products and services totaling at least $1 million.
The domestic sales network as of October 31, 1995 consisted of over 540
field sales and service representatives. A variety of service automation
software products have been implemented to reduce the cost and enhance the
delivery of the services to the customer. Products from over 700 vendors
are provided.
   Proceeds from the sale of eight million shares for the company will be
used to repay debt. The company maintains a $425 million credit facility
with IBM Credit Corp. at prime plus 1.06%. As of July 31, 1995, long term
debt would have been 70% of committed capital on a pro forma basis,
however, this is somewhat misleading since a large portion of the credit
facility is used to finance inventory. Nynex Worldwide Services Group is
the selling stockholder. Nynex obtained the shares when it sold the assets
of its Nynex Business Centers business to the company in fiscal 1991.
Warburg Pincus Capital will own 35% of the stock after the offering.
Although our copy of the prospectus was incomplete in regard to future
sales of stock, we assume that most of the currently outstanding shares are
subject to a 180 day underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume
limitations.
   The pressure to cut costs and eliminate non-core operations is likely to
keep the outsourcing trend intact over the next few years. We project
earnings growth at over 14% annually, but it is likely to be uneven. Given
that 1995 PC sales were so strong, growth in 1996 is apt to be particularly
weak by comparison. We view the shares as fairly valued if offered at 11
1/2, but recommend purchase in anticipation of buy recommendations from the
underwriters, after which we would sell the shares.

NEW ISSUES - IRON MOUNTAIN AVOID

   Approximately four trillion documents are generated each year in the
U.S., and paper remains, at least for now, the primary medium. About 80% of
the documents generated each year are not needed for frequent reference,
and can be considered inactive records, for which it provides storage
services in 66 facilities in 25 markets across the U.S. containing an
aggregate of 4.9 million square feet of space.
   As of September 30, 1995, Iron Mountain stored approximately 21 million
1.2 cubic foot cartons for 14,000 customers. New customers are obtained by
a dedicated sales force. An ongoing fee is collected for storage, and
nonrecurring fees are charged for storage materials and services, such as
document retrieval. The company also provides vital records services for
items such as master audio and video recordings, and provides courier
services via a fleet of approximately 200 vehicles. We believe that growth
in the number of documents generated and outsourcing of document storage
activities has resulted in an increase in the number of cartons stored
which has outpaced the 4% attrition rate experienced by the company due to
destruction or permanent removal. Internal growth has been augmented by
additions of new customers and acquisitions of other document storage
businesses.
   Proceeds from the shares sold on the company's behalf will be used to
redeem a warrant, fund several pending acquisitions and repay debt incurred
for other recently completed acquisitions. Long term debt on a pro forma
basis as of September 30, 1995 was 64% of total capital. About $17 million
was subsequently borrowed to fund recently completed acquisitions. CEO
Richard Reese will own 16% of the stock outstanding after the offering, and
Vincent J. Ryan will control 36%, including 20% held by Schooner Capital
Corp. The sellers are Schooner, Chase Manhattan Investment Holdings, and
Security Pacific Capital Investors, L.P. A small number of shares become
eligible for sale in the public market beginning 90 days after the
offering, but most of the currently outstanding shares are subject to a 180
day (360 day in the case of Ryan and Schooner) underwriter's lockup
agreement.
   Although there will be about $47 million of additional borrowing
capacity available under the company's credit agreement, we believe that
further leverage would necessitate the curtailment of planned capital
expenditures. It already appears that current obligations have been
extended to maintain debt levels at their current level. If additional debt
is assumed for more acquisitions, as is the company's plan, we think that
it will have difficulty meeting interest and scheduled principal repayments
after 1998. Scheduled payments this year of about $2 million, and of $3.3
million and $3.4 million in 1997 and 1998 should not be a problem, but the
$8.3 million payment in 1999 becomes difficult if the balance sheet is
leveraged further.
   How did the company get into its current financial position? We think
it overpaid for the businesses it has acquired, paying about 2.1X revenues,
which is the same ratio of our 1996 revenue projection to the proposed
market capitalization of equity plus debt. We would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - HEARTSTREAM AVOID

   More than 350,000 people in the U.S. suffer sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)
each year. SCA is characterized by rapid and irregular heart beat, or
ventricular fibrillation, in which the heart's normal electrical signals
become disorganized and erratic, causing the heart to cease pumping blood
within a few minutes. Defibrillation involving the application of an
electric shock to the heart, causing it to resume a regular rhythm, is
necessary to prevent death from SCA. It has been documented that timely
defibrillation can boost the survival rate from SCA to over 70%. Often
paramedics or emergency medical technicians (EMTs) equipped and trained in
the use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) do not arrive on site
quickly enough, resulting in average SCA survival rates in the U.S. of 5%.
AEDs use computer technology to interpret the patient's heartbeat to
determine if defibrillation is necessary. This contrasts with hospital
based defibrillation units with which most people are familiar, that
require medical personnel to interpret an electrocardiogram.
   This company has developed and clinically tested an AED which it
believes is easier to use and maintain, requires less training, and costs
less than current AEDs in use. The American Heart Association (AHA) has
endorsed the training and use of AEDs by ``first responders'', i.e. police
and fire personnel in addition the paramedics and EMTs, and The Department
of Transportation has adopted guidelines which include AED training for
EMTs beginning in 1995. The goal is that police and fire personnel, who
typically are on the scene prior to medical personnel, can administer AED
in a timely manner. Also, EMTs, who usually receive substantially less
training than paramedics, are typically not trained in the use of AEDs due
to the expense of training and purchasing AEDs for EMT ambulances.
   The company has conducted two clinical trials which show no difference
in efficacy between its AED, called the ForeRunner, and AEDs currently on
the market. The trials actually measured the efficacy of a method of
delivering the electric shock that uses lower energy relative to the
standard higher energy AEDs currently in use. A 510(k) application to the
FDA was submitted in December 1995 for clearance to market the ForeRunner
on the basis that it is substantially equivalent to AEDs that have been on
the market since before 1976.
   Proceeds from the offering and cash on hand, which together on a pro
forma basis totaled $49 million as of September 30, 1995, will be used to
fund product introduction, to build a sales and marketing organization, for
continuing research and development, and for working capital and general
corporate purposes. Long term obligations are nominal. Four venture fund
groups will own 5% or more of the stock to be outstanding after the
offering, including entities affiliated with Mayfield Fund 23%, Oak
Investment Partners 7%, Weiss, Peck & Greer 6%, and Medical Innovation Fund
II, L.P. 5%. Insiders in the aggregate will own 37%. Future sales of nearly
all of the shares currently outstanding are subject to a 180 day
underwriter's lockup agreement and Rule 144 volume limitations.
   Despite the submission of a 510(k) application to the FDA, we must
classify this offering as speculative. The FDA may require additional
clinical data or may rule that the ForeRunner does not qualify for pre-1976
device equivalency. The ForeRunner has never been tested in the field. The
low energy electrical stimulation which it uses does not meet current AHA
guidelines, and certain states have additional laws regarding which AEDs
may be used. The company and five of its founding employees are subject to
a lawsuit brought by their former employer alleging misappropriation of
trade secrets and tortious interference with business relations. Even if
all these issues are resolved, we believe it will take at least three or
four years for the company to become profitable. We would avoid the
shares.

NEW ISSUES - PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AVOID

   In 1994, worldwide expenditures on research and development by
pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are estimated to have been $30
billion, of which this contract research organization (CRO) believes $1.5
billion was outsourced to CROs. Among the services which the company
provides are Phase I clinical testing, laboratory analysis, Phase II-IV
clinical trial management, clinical data management and biostatistical
analysis, treatment investigational new drug applications, medical writing
and regulatory compliance, and health care economics and outcomes
research.
   In the nine months ended September 30, 1995, the pharmaceutical industry
accounted for 74% of net revenues, biotechnology 16%, the National
Institutes of Health 8%, and other 2%. Therapeutic areas from which
revenues were derived were virology/AIDS/infectious diseases 30%,
gastroenterology/metabolic diseases 27%, critical care 11%,
pulmonary/allergy 11%, central nervous system 10%, and other 12%. At
September 30, 1995, there were 165 active contracts with about 110 clients
in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and the backlog was $50.2 million, versus
$21.6 million a year earlier.
   Contracts are based on specific project proposals developed by the
company's business development personnel in response to potential clients'
requests. We believe the contract cycle can be quite lengthy. Contracts are
usually on a fixed price basis, so the company bears the risk of cost
overruns. Senior management has experience with the regulatory process in
previous positions with Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham. At September 30,
1995, 86 employees had post-graduate degrees.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay debt incurred to make a
final S corporation distribution to current stockholders. Total debt
outstanding will equal 14% of total capitalization. The company will seek
to renegotiate the terms and the amount of its credit facility. Insiders
will own 77% of the shares outstanding after the offering. Most of the
currently outstanding shares become eligible for public sale under Rule 144
after a 180 day lockup period.
   We estimate revenues per employee in 1995 will be about $78,000, which
seems low. It is likely that the company has been adding significant
numbers of business development, research and other personnel, which have
not been reflected yet in revenue growth. This is supported by the
substantial increase in backlog and in the rise in selling, general and
administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 20.4% in 1993 to
33.4% in the nine months ended September 30, 1995. The revenue per employee
may be misleading. Even so, we find it difficult to believe that
compensation levels at the company are adequate to motivate professional
research personnel. A recently adopted stock option plan should aid
employee retention. The company has likely benefited in its hiring from
downsizing of R&D staffs at major pharmaceutical firms that have been
acquired.
   Still, we think that a business in which the overwhelming key to success
is the performance of its employees in conducting research under fixed
price contracts, in which many variables can lead to unpredictable results
and cost overruns, and which is not capital intensive, is better suited to
be a privately held entity. Minority shareholders are apt to find their
interests do not always come first. Moreover, at 30X our $0.50 EPS for 1996
on revenues of $55 million (with 24% more shares outstanding), which
represent 43% and 47% gains over projected EPS of $0.35 (pro forma for
income tax provision) and revenues of $37.5 million, we believe the shares
are amply valued. We would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - NICE SYSTEMS AVOID

   Everyone is aware of the increased use of automated voice systems to
handle everyday business communications. Examples include voice mail and
automated call routing. Increasingly, computer telephony integration
applications are being developed for more important transactions such as
brokerage orders and mail order pharmaceuticals, for example. Voice records
have long been kept for critical communications such as emergency response
centers and air traffic control facilities. Organizations' growing need to
record, process, and store large amounts of voice data has resulted in the
introduction of digitally based voice logging systems that can handle large
volumes of calls at lower costs.
   This Israeli based company's principal product, NiceLog, can record,
store and retrieve up to thousands of analog and digital telephone lines
and radio channels, and enables simultaneous access by multiple users.
NiceLog incorporates enhanced digital networking and voice processing
technologies in the areas of computer telephony integration, digital signal
processing, mass storage and database management. It uses an open
architecture that provides connectivity options to networks such as Novell,
IPX, and TCP/IP using DOS, Windows, Windows NT, and UNIX operating systems
(a Windows 95 version is expected to be introduced in 1996), and
telecommunications interfaces such as T1, E1, ISDN, and analog trunks.
   An add-on module, Call Logging System, enables prompt location and
retrieval of data records according to several key record details, such as
time of call, duration, extension number, and calling number. The company
has sold hundreds of NiceLog units (each capable of handling 96 channels),
to more than 150 users worldwide. A fax logger and a logging system for
customers with requirements in the eight to 24 channel range are under
development. The company also develops and sells communications
intelligence systems, primarily the NiceFix, which enables users to detect,
locate, and monitor transmissions, or ``get a fix'' on the transmitting
object, and provides engineering services for other defense applications.
   The company primarily sells its products to distributors specializing in
the voice logging market. For the nine months ended September 30, 1995, 86%
of total sales were to customers outside of Israel and 52% were to
customers in the U.S. The company has arrangements with IPC Information
Systems and Etrali, two trading room switching equipment suppliers, to
market its products, and with Northern Telecom and Aspect
Telecommunications to market the compatibility features of NiceLog with
their automated call distribution systems. Contracts have been won to
supply up to 800 U.S. air traffic control centers with NiceLog systems over
seven years and for the air traffic logging system at the new Hong Kong
airport. These two contracts have a combined value of $3.4 million to $13
million, for a period of one to seven years.
   Proceeds will be used for working capital and other general corporate
purposes. The ordinary shares trade on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and on
12/27/95 closed at 10 13/16. In October 1995, the company sold its 57%
stake in NiceCom, a developer of advanced data communications switches, to
3Com for $53 million, and subsequently paid dividends of $2.10 per share.
No long term debt is outstanding. Insiders as a group will own 19% of the
shares outstanding after the offering.
   The U.S. air traffic system contract award is a major win because it
gives credibility to the company in the U.S. Still, the company has
generally not been profitable, and despite the contract award, we do not
think the company's products have a clear technological advantage over
competing systems. Most costs are recorded in New Israeli Shekels, while
most sales are made in, and the reporting currency is, dollars. Israeli
inflation in recent years has exceeded the rate of devaluation of the
shekel against the dollar, thereby lowering dollar earnings. This and the
dividends paid after the sale of NiceCom made the shares more attractive to
Israeli investors, who may have pushed up the stock price, despite the lack
of dollar profits.
   It is not assured that a liquid market will develop for the ADSs. The
recent dollar equivalent share price in Tel Aviv is about 23X our $0.45 EPS
estimate for 1996. We do not believe this adequately discounts the risks of
buying the stock, and we would avoid the shares.

NEW ISSUES - PHYMATRIX SHORT TERM BUY

   Formerly known as Continuum Care Corp., this physician practice
management company provides or has entered into agreements to provide
management services to 112 physicians, including 56 oncologists, and
provides related medical services. It also owns a 44% interest in a newly
formed management services organization for a physician association based
in Connecticut of over 240 multi-specialty physicians and has a 50%
interest in a medical facility development company. The business is the
conglomeration of several physician management firms operated under common
control by CEO Abraham D. Gosman, who is also CEO of Meditrust and founded
The Mediplex Group, which was acquired by Sun Healthcare Group in June
1994.
   Several factors are combining to put the solo physician or small
partnership practice at a disadvantage to management organizations. For
example, the information systems that are necessary to respond to the
requirements of managed care organizations and the Medicare and Medicaid
programs are costly and usually beyond the means of most practices. By
joining a physician management organization, physicians can cut costs and
reduce the volatility of their earnings. In other words, the changing
payment structure of the U.S. healthcare system has made the practice
management model a better deal for most physicians. Healthcare reforms
being proposed should only bring more pressure to bear on physicians to
join management groups.
   Up to $32 million of offering proceeds will be used to repay
indebtedness to Mr. Gosman and about $50 million will be used to repay
obligations guaranteed by, or to substitute for collateral provided by
Gosman. On a pro forma basis, long term debt would be 18% of total capital.
The company is negotiating to obtain an acquisition/working capital line of
credit. Gosman will own 40% of the stock outstanding after the offering.
All of the shares to be issued to him and other management and founding
stockholders are subject to the holding requirement of the Securities Act,
and may not be sold in the open market until the second anniversary of the
closing date of the offering.
   The company intends to pursue an aggressive acquisition strategy, so
future results may vary substantially from our estimates. Industry
fundamentals favor physician management organizations, and because only a
small percentage of the approximate 650,000 physicians in the nation have
joined a management group, we think there are ample acquisition candidates.
As the company brings more physicians within its structure, it will realize
economies of scale and cost efficiencies will result in much improved
margins.
   We are projecting a pro forma loss for 1995 of $0.20 a share on revenues
of $128 million, including a $2.5 million charge in the fourth quarter to
write down certain acquired assets at their book value. In 1996, our
forecast is $160 million in revenues and EPS of $0.25. Tentatively in 1997,
revenues could top $200 million, and EPS could more than double. We
recommend purchase of the shares as a short term holding, with a price
target of 21.

NEW ISSUES - WILMAR SHORT TERM BUY

   Outsourcing is one of the important trends in American history. This
company markets and distributes repair and maintenance products principally
to the apartment housing market, and in 1995 initiated sales to the
hospitality, health care, and institutional markets.
   The primary marketing tool is the Wilmar Master Catalog, containing over
14,000 skus of standard and specialty plumbing products, 36% of sales in
the first nine months of 1995, electrical 19%, hardware 16%, chemical and
janitorial 6%, appliance parts 5%, window and floor coverings 5%, HVAC 5%,
paint and accessories 4%, and other products 4%. The catalog is
complemented by a local direct sales force in 34 markets and a telesales
force in other markets which maintain frequent contact with the company's
19,500 active customers. These efforts are augmented by national and
regional accounts serviced by senior management and by participation in
Buyers Access, a group purchasing organization of apartment property
management firms. Members of Buyers Access accounted for 23% of sales in
the nine months ended September 30, 1995.
   The company operates 10 distribution centers and offers next day
delivery for orders over $25, either by its own trucks or a contract
service. The company has found that customers order significantly more in
areas in which it offers next day delivery. Standard or customized billing
services can be provided, and electronic order access is available. The
company has developed foreign sourcing of a broad array of private label
products, which accounted for 18% of net sales in the first nine months of
1995.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to repay all company debt and
redeem all outstanding preferred stock. In March 1995, CEO William Green,
the sole stockholder at the time, sold a substantial interest in the
company to Summit Investors. Additional funding was borrowed to complete
the November 1995 acquisition of One Source, operator of a supply
distribution business in Miami, for $3.7 million. As a result of the
recapitalization, Green and Summit Investors have withdrawn $28 million in
capital from the company.
   Green will convert $5 million of preferred stock into common shares at
the offering price, giving him a 28% interest after the offering. Summit
Investors paid $55,000 for their 3.1 million shares, or 32% interest. Sales
of additional shares of common stock to the public are subject to a 180 day
underwriter's lockup agreement, although sales of the shares purchased by
the Summit Investors do not become eligible for sale under Rule 144 until
March 1997, unless the SEC amends the Rule to cut the holding period from
two to one years. Such an amendment is under consideration.
   We think the key to the company's growth has been the value added
services which it provides to property managers. Many properties are
heavily leveraged or under capitalized, so maintaining a repair and
maintenance products inventory is just one more headache. The company
solves this problem, and we believe most competing firms do not provide a
similar breadth of products and services.
   We think the company will continue to grow, gaining market share and
forcing out weaker, local firms. It made its first acquisition only last
November at a fraction of the value which the underwriters have placed on
the firm. Other acquisitions at favorable prices are likely to be available
for some time. Geographic expansion and new end market penetration also
present strong growth opportunities. The hospitality, health care, and
institutional markets accounted for only 1.5% of net sales in the first
nine months of 1995. We believe the company covers less than 50% of the
nation currently. On a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition occurred at
the beginning of 1995, we estimate EPS was $0.45 a share on sales of $72.5
million. Pro forma assuming the offering and related transactions occurred
on 1/1/96, we project EPS of $0.60 on sales of $90 million. It is still
early in the IPO cycle for outsourcing firms, which typically means that
the success of the first offering raises the valuation standard until the
quality of firms looking to capitalize on the trend deteriorates. We
recommend purchase of the shares as a short term holding with a price
target of 15.

NEW ISSUES - FYI INC. IPO

   Simultaneous with the consummation of the offering, this company will
acquire the seven companies, all of which provide document management
services primarily to health care institutions, professional services (such
as legal services) firms, and financial institutions. One or more of the
founding firms provide micrographic services, electronic image processing,
active document and file storage and maintenance, inactive document
archival storage, and information and database management services. These
services are provided for all three target markets.
   In addition, certain of the companies provide medical records release
services to health care institutions, litigation support to professional
services firms, and remittance processing to financial institutions. The
founding companies have been in business an average of 22 years and operate
33 facilities in 21 states. Selling is conducted at the local level,
typically by senior management, but the company expects to add a direct
sales force where appropriate.
   Proceeds from the offering will be used to pay the cash portion of the
purchase price for the founding companies, to repay debt, and for general
corporate purposes including acquisitions. Future acquisitions are likely
to be financed wholly or in part with common stock. Long term debt is
nominal. Negotiations are ongoing with a leading financial institution for
lines of credit in the aggregate amount of $25 million to be used for
additional acquisitions, working capital, and general corporate purposes.
   Insiders will own 39% of the stock after the offering. All of the
stockholders of the company, including the former owners of the founding
companies will be contractually prohibited from selling any of the shares
for a period of two years after the acquisitions are closed. Recently, in
November 1995, Ed H. Bowman, Jr. was appointed CEO of the company. Mr.
Bowman's previous experience was with First Data, HBO & Co., and Andersen
Consulting. Chief Development Officer Thomas C. Walker has been responsible
for the acquisition or divestiture of over 100 businesses over a 29 year
period.
   We think that the value added services which the company provides is a
more attractive business than the archival storage business of Iron
Mountain, another firm which is planning an IPO. Both firms are likely to
benefit from the growing trend for businesses to outsource their document
management operations and from consolidation within the industry. More
importantly, F.Y.I.'s proposed market capitalization is about 1.2X our
projection of 1996 revenues for the founding companies, versus the 2.1X at
which Iron Mountain is seeking to sell shares. Our pro forma combined EPS
estimate for 1995 is $0.85 on revenues of $47.5 million. Assuming
acquisitions add about $10 million in revenue in 1996, we project total
revenues of $65 million and EPS of $0.90 on 37% more shares outstanding. We
recommend purchase of the shares.

SGS-THOMSON (STM, 31 1/2, NYSE) SPECIAL SITUATION

By:
John D. Coyle, CFA
January 9, 1996


Investment opinion

   We are recommending the purchase of SGS-THOMSON as a low-risk way to
benefit from the strong demand expected in the semiconductor industry over
the next several years. Semiconductor stocks have been hammered in recent
months as investors have chosen to take profits in light of weaker than
expected results being reported by several companies, and amid signs of
pricing pressures in the highly visible memory segment. However, we do not
believe these factors portend an overall slowdown in the market, but rather
reflect isolated pockets of weakness in certain segments of the industry.
   SGS-THOMSON should continue to prosper in this uncertain environment, as
its product and geographic diversity makes it less susceptible to the risks
of more narrowly focused semiconductor companies. In addition, this
diversity gives us confidence in revenue and earnings visibility, a factor
that should be highly prized by investors during 1996.
   Finally, the volatility seen in the last several months underscores the
need for careful investment selection in this group. As such, we recommend
focusing on stocks that are not overly exposed to one industry or product
line and that can be purchased at a low multiple to future earnings.
SGS-THOMSON meets this criteria at just 7.4X our estimate for 1996 and
should be purchased by investors seeking above-average capital
appreciation.

Overview

   SGS-THOMSON is a leading manufacturer of semiconductor chips and devices
for a variety of end markets. The company sports a diversified line-up of
some 3000 products that are sold to more than 1500 customers, including
OEMs in the computer systems (27% of sales in 1995's first nine months),
telecommunications (23%), consumer products (19%), industrial (21%) and
automotive (10%) industries. Revenues are also well balanced globally,
with Europe, Asia-Pacific, the Americas and Japan accounting for 47%, 25%,
24% and 4%, respectively, of revenues in 1995's first nine months.
   The company's principal focus is on differentiated products (51% of
revenues in 1995's first nine months), a segment which mainly contains
analog and mixed-signal (analog/digital) integrated circuits (ICs). Analog
ICs provide the critical link between electronic systems and a variety of
variables including sound, light, temperature or speed. Mixed-signal
circuits combine analog and digital functionality on a single-chip to
process both analog signals and digital data. During 1994, SGS was the #1
worldwide producer of analog and mixed-signal devices.
   Because of the close relationships needed with customers to design
differentiated products, SGS-THOMSON is less vulnerable to pricing
pressures than commodity producers. In addition, these products have longer
life cycles than commodity devices, are less susceptible to technological
obsolescence and cost less to make as older and more reliable manufacturing
processes can be employed. Market projections are for differentiated
products to grow at a 21% annual growth rate through 1998.
   The balance of SGS's revenues are logic and memories (24% of revenues
in 1995's first nine months), discrete (16%), and standard & commodities
(9%). The company's logic devices, which include microprocessors,
microcontrollers and digital signal processors (DSPs), are generally
differentiated from competitive offerings by patents and specialized
product design skills. In contrast, the company's non-volatile memory
products (EPROMs, EEPROMs, SRAMs, flash memories, chips for smartcards) are
generally considered more commodity in nature and mainly differentiated by
price. The company does not manufacture DRAM memory chips. During 1994, SGS
was the #2 worldwide producer of non-volatile memories.
   SGS-THOMSON Holding II controls 69% of the outstanding shares and is
equally owned by a consortium of French and Italian shareholders that are
indirectly controlled by their respective governments.

Targeted products should help drive top line growth

   Despite its broad-based product portfolio, the company is also well
positioned to benefit from exposure to several promising growth segments in
the semiconductor industry. MPEG (motion picture experts group) chips,
which utilize advanced digital video compression to improve the quality of
video and audio, are gaining widespread acceptance in the fast-growing
multimedia computer segment. The company was the leading worldwide MPEG-2
supplier in 1994 and market forecasts are for the MPEG market to reach $2
billion in 1996, up from $600 million in 1995. The company is also
targeting the fast growing flash memory market. Flash memories can be
erased and reprogrammed electrically without having to be physically
removed from a system, like EPROMs. Because of their flexibility, low cost
and small size, the use of flash memories is expected to proliferate.
According to In-Stat, a Scottsdale, Arizona-based research firm, the flash
memory market is expected to grow 32% in 1996 from about $1.3 billion in
1995. Longer term, we expect the company to benefit from its license
agreement with Cyrix. Under the agreement, the company has the option to
manufacture and sell Cyrix's line of microprocessors, including its highly
touted M1 chip that is set to challenge Intel's Pentium family. Volume
production is set for 1996's second quarter but any meaningful contribution
is more likely to come in the 1997 time frame.

SGS benefiting from strong industry demand

   Revenues and earnings were up 40% and 37%, respectively, in the three
months ended September 30, 1995, and 34% and 32% for the nine month period.
The company has benefited from strong global demand for semiconductors
across all key product categories and geographies. We are estimating
revenue growth of about 25% in 1996, which assumes that the company will
grow in line with projected industry growth rates. The Semiconductor
Industry Association has forecast a 26% increase in worldwide semiconductor
sales for 1996, but we believe the company's growth rate is likely to be
slightly lower due to its lack of exposure to the fast-growing DRAM
market.
   Gross margins have trended down from the 42% rate experienced in 1994
and the first quarter of 1995, mainly due to costs associated with capacity
additions. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by recent management comments
that margins could range between 40% and 42% in 1996. Since margins are
currently at the low end of this range, we have built in some upside in our
forecast with a 41% gross margin estimate.
   The company continues to increase spending at healthy levels in an
effort to keep pace with growing demand. SG&A expenses grew as a percentage
of sales in 1995, excluding a $15 million non-recurring item, owing to
greater marketing efforts. The company continues to spend aggressively on
research and development, a trend we view positively. We expect little
diversion from these spending trends in 1996, and have conservatively
targeted these categories to grow cumulatively at rates slightly below our
25% earnings growth estimate.
   We are forecasting earnings of $4.25 for 1996, up 12% from our $3.80
estimate for 1995. The earnings gain is being restricted by an increase in
the tax rate to 26% from an estimated 20%. In 1995, SGS realized certain 
tax breaks from the initiation of capital expenditure programs in certain
countries. We also expect a 6% increase in the number of shares
outstanding, reflecting the October 1995 public offering of 8.9 million
shares at US$43.50 a share.

Company adding capacity to address demand

   SGS-THOMSON is aggressively expanding manufacturing capacity over the
next several years to meet projected industry demand. The company has
applied 1994 and 1995 investments to three new front-end fabrication
plants, two of which are now in operation. In addition, two older plants
are being converted to process newer and larger wafer sizes. The company is
expected to use the proceeds of US$377 million from its October public
offering to help fund these additions. Capital spending in 1995 is expected
to total some $900 million.

Is it time to buy semiconductor stocks?

   Semiconductor stocks went on a roller coaster ride in 1995, with an
impressive surge seen from the beginning of the year through September. As
tracked by the S&P Semiconductor Index, semiconductor stocks rose by more
than 70% during that time frame. This performance was then followed by
extreme volatility and subsequent profit taking that saw many semiconductor
issues fall by 30% to 40% from their highs. The S&P Semiconductor Index
finished up only 35% for the year. Is the 1995 sell-off a harbinger of
things to come for 1996?
   We don't believe so. Industry fundamentals are in place for selected
semiconductor issues to do very well in 1996. Our bias would be towards the
more broadly diversified companies versus companies that are overly exposed
to a particular industry, customer or product line. Furthermore, we would
stay away from companies specializing on more price-sensitive, commodity
products. We think this criteria is critical as pockets of softness are
beginning to surface in various segments of the market, particularly in the
commodity segment. We do not believe this portends a dramatic decline in
the demand for semiconductors, but rather a pause from the overheated
consumption levels of 1995 and heightened uncertainty about longer term
growth rates in key personal computer and telecommunications industries.
Our view is that growth in these segments will remain strong, although not
at the rates seen in previous years. In addition, the proliferation of
semiconductors in automobiles, electronics and appliances should complement
nicely the growth in PCs and phones. In summary, we expect semiconductor
issues to remain volatile over the next several months, but for investors
to eventually revisit higher quality names that can prosper in this
fast-changing industry.

Valuation

   Valuations on all semiconductor issues have come down dramatically since
the latter part of 1995, and many now sport single-digit P/E multiples on
1996 earnings. While we believe many of these issues warrant this type of
multiple because of imminent pricing pressures and the lack of clean
earnings visibility, other stocks have been unduly punished by overly harsh
investor sentiment towards the group.
   We believe SGS-THOMSON is one of those issues, as its broadly
diversified product line and customer base will prove to be a buffer
against periodic pockets of softness that inevitably surface in end
markets. In our opinion, the company's diversity effectively lowers the
risk of a customer or product driven event slowing sales and earnings
momentum. When coupled with the current low valuation on the shares, SGS is
likely to be an investor favorite when positive sentiment returns to the
group.
   With the shares trading at just 7.4X our 1996 estimate of $4.25 a share
and down from the high of 57 1/2, we see a strong likelihood of P/E
expansion as semiconductor stocks eventually return to favor. Based on our
favorable long term views of the industry, we can easily rationalize a P/E
multiple of 10 on 1996 earnings, giving the shares a value of $42.50, up
33% from current levels. We would also note that this valuation may prove
conservative based on what we view as the company's 15%-20% long term
growth rate. Based on the its low risk profile along with strong underlying
growth prospects, we recommend that investors accumulate the shares for
above average capital gains.

BIO-TECHNOLOGY GENERAL (BTGC, 5 7/8, NASDAQ) EMERGING GROWTH

By:
Thomas Tirney


Investment Opinion

   Bio-Technology General (BTG) is an overlooked biopharmaceutical with
excellent growth potential, several commercialized products, and a
promising drug pipeline. Lead products include BioTropin, authentic human
growth hormone (hGH); and Oxandrin, an anabolic steroid approved in various
indications for weight gain.
   BTG sells hGH overseas; the worldwide hGH market totals about $800
million to $1 billion. The company markets Oxandrin domestically, and U.S.
market could easily top $100 million. Both drugs are still in the early
stages of their product cycle and have yet to capture a meaningful share of
their markets; revenue growth has substantial upside potential. The most
promising pipeline drug is Androtest-SL, a sublingual form of testosterone,
which is being prepared for a New Drug Application with the FDA. 
Androtest-SL will be marketed to hypogonadal males and men with
testosterone deficiencies. The U.S. market is valued at about $625 million
and is growing approximately 16% a year.
   We predict revenue growth of 45%+ through 1997 and estimate earnings in
1995 at break-even, those in 1996 at $0.15 per share, and $0.45 in 1997. 
As BTG turns cash-flow positive in 1996 and with over $12 million in cash,
we doubt the company will see the need to do an offering of shares (all the
rage in biotechs these days) or raise capital through debt.
   Our 12-month price target is $12 based on a reasonable price/earnings
ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. Considering that most publicly traded
biotechnology companies, even 1995's success stories like Agouron
Pharmaceuticals and Cephalon have no immediate earnings expectations nor
any commercial drug products (no P/E's either), Bio-Technology General has
a compelling investment profile based on the fundamentals in this
high-growth, high-risk sector.

Overview

   This small-cap biopharmaceutical develops and manufactures
pharmaceuticals and genetically engineered products. BTG focuses on drugs
that treat endocrinology disorders, cardio/pulmonary diseases, opthalmic,
and skin disorders. Through marketing partners and distribution agreements,
the company sells its products in Western Europe, Japan, Israel, Canada,
the U.S. and Mexico.
   BTG's flagship drug is called Bio-Tropin, human growth hormone (hGH),
and is used to treat short stature, growth hormone deficiency, and
dwarfism. hGH is secreted from the pituitary gland and controls important
physiological functions essential to normal development and maturation. The
worldwide market for hGH is very large, estimated between $850 million and
$1 billion, and growing by about 10% each year. The major geographic
markets are the U.S. with a $300 million market potential, Western Europe
at $250 million, and Japan, slightly less than the U.S. Currently, BTG is
selling Bio-Tropin in Western Europe and Japan through licensees, as well
as in other smaller markets in East Asia and Latin America.
   Bio-Tropin accounted for approximately $7.2 million of BTG revenues in
1994 (65% of the total) mostly through sales in Japan by licensee JCR
Pharmaceuticals. JCR began selling Bio-Tropin in mid-1993 and is starting
to make inroads on capturing a more significant portion of the Japanese
market. Sales contributions from its Western Europe market was slight in
1994, as its licensee, the Ferring Group, had a late start: sales to the
Netherlands, Germany, and Sweden commenced in 4Q 1994. During late 1995,
Ferring started selling in the U.K., France, Spain, Denmark, Belgium,
Ireland, and Luxembourg. The 1995 comparisons in both the Japan and Western
Europe market have been very favorable and as Bio-Tropin is still in a
``launch stage'', projected growth rates are high. We estimate BioTropin
sales from Japan in 1995 at $11 million and will grow about 15% through
1997. In Western Europe, revenue contributions will approximate $2.3
million in 1995 and grow at 45%+ through 1997.

Problems with BioTropin in the United States may have clouded investors'
perception of the stock

   Unfortunately, BioTropin's biggest and most lucrative market, the United
States, is closed off . After obtaining FDA approval to market Bio-Tropin
in the United States, Genentech filed a suit claiming patent infringement
and was able to prevent BTG from selling its hGH domestically. Genentech
is, of course, trying to preserve market share of its own hGH drugs in
America. In August 1995, Novo Nordisk, a Danish pharmaceutical was also
slapped with a preliminary injunction by Genentech when it tried to sell
hGH products in the U.S., as well. BTG has appealed the ruling and expects
a decision by March 1996. Although there is a good chance that the company
could succeed in overturning the injunction, we are not including the
possibility of U.S. sales in our earnings model. Whatever happens with
the court case, we believe that Bio-Technology's present markets for
Bio-Tropin as well as revenues from other products will promulgate adequate
earnings growth in 1996 without U.S. sales.

Oxandrin addresses an underserved and growing market

   The problems related to Bio-Tropin has muddied the waters in relation to
the company's other promising products. In the unfolding of Genentech's
injunction, investors have forgotten about Oxandrin, BTG's approved drug
for weight gain. Oxandrin is an anabolic steroid used in patients suffering
from severe weight loss (``wasting syndrome'') due to chronic infection,
extensive surgery, or trauma. Wasting syndrome, clinically known as
cachexia, is a metabolic disruption frequently occurring in patients with a
compromised immune system. Cachexia causes the body to break down protein
stores to meet energy requirements rather than first using stores of fat.
The combination of losing body weight and muscle mass in a seriously ill
patient leads to a life threatening condition.
   Oxandrin has distinct advantages over the current crop of therapies used
in wasting syndrome. Megace, an injectable anabolic steroid, has a higher
liver toxicity profile and also may lead to androgenic effects in female
patients. Megace has also demonstrated limited efficacy in weight gain
through adding lean muscle mass. Weight gain with Megace adds mostly water
and fat. Human growth hormone, while effective in adding weight, is
prohibitively expensive at over $50,000 per treatment year. Reimbursement
for hGH in this indication is not expected by many insurance companies nor
from state Medicaid or AIDS Drug Assistance programs. Oxandrin on the other
hand, can be taken orally, halts weight loss, adds lean muscle mass, and
costs about $20 per daily dosage (roughly $6,000 per treatment year).
   Oxandrin, as discussed, is already approved for a variety of
indications. Additionally, BTG is trying to expand the labeling of Oxandrin
through Treatment Investigative New Drug trials. Treatment IND status
allows the company to be reimbursed during the trial. A Phase III
Treatment IND trial in AIDS cachetic patients is going forward in 1996 and
a Treatment IND trial for Turners Syndrome has already been completed. The
Treatment IND could ideally generate a revenue stream of $8 million
although our forecasts are more conservative at $5 million in 1996. 
Approximately 75,000 AIDS patients in the United States are cachetic.
   Severe weight loss is not just a symptom of AIDS patients. Cancer and
aging are two vast markets in which Oxandrin can easily be adopted. BTG has
a dialogue with medical specialists treating wasting conditions and
oncologists concerning Oxandrin's use. Cachetic cancer patients number
between 250,000 to 400,000 in the United States alone. We believe the
current labeling of Oxandrin will allow it to be given to cachetic cancer
patients.
   In November 1995, Bio-Technology General announced an alliance with
Quantum Health Resources to distribute Oxandrin nationally. Quantum's
therapies and services are provided through four regional centers, 20
licensed branches, and 17 service branches throughout the United States. 
Quantum's expertise is in long-term chronic disorders and specialized
disease management where the needs of patients differ markedly from acute
or short-term illnesses. Due to Quantum's recent problems with its mainstay
hemophilia service unit, we believe Quantum will place a strong emphasis
on growing Oxandrin business.

BioLon's smaller revenue contributions round out BTG's drug portfolio

   BioLon is a sodium hyaluronate product used in cataract surgery and
intraocular lens transplantation. It is a high-viscosity, gel-like fluid
which also has applications in dry eye syndrome and as a general contact
lens solution. Marketing partners sell BioLon in Canada, Spain, South
Korea, India, Mexico, and Israel. Labaoratoire Chauvin is launching BioLon
in Europe during 1996 and a New Drug Application is planned to be filed in
the U.S. Upjohn-Pharmacia sells hyaluronic acid in the United States under
the trade name Healon. Healon goes off patent in February 1996. Revenue
growth from BioLon will come principally from the U.S. and to a lesser
extent, Europe. Although competition will no doubt be fierce, revenue
contributions from BioLon will approximate $4 million in 1996 and about $6
million in 1997.

Androtest-SL represents the company's most promising pipeline drug

   This pipeline drug is a sublingual form of testosterone that is absorbed
in the bloodstream through the mucosal membrane under the tongue.
Androtest-SL is designed to treat hypogonadism, a testosterone deficiency
that affects about 250,000 males in the United States alone. Androtest-SL
is also being developed to treat delay of growth and puberty which affects
about 80,000 boys (U.S. market). Hypogonadal males, either through a
constitutional deficiency or through aging, suffer lower testosterone
levels which leads to impotence, suppressed libido, and loss of muscle
mass.
   Current therapies include testosterone injections, scrotal patches, and
transdermal patches attached to the upper thighs and stomach area. While
the intramuscular injections are being abandoned in favor of the new
transdermal patches (such as those marketed by Theratech and Alza), we
believe that Androtest-SL will provide an even more convenient alternative
for hypogonadal males. The obvious disadvantage that transdermal patches
have compared to injections is delivery. However, the patch must be worn
constantly which may lead to irritation and discomfort. As an oral tablet
taken three times a day, Androtest-SL provides a convenient alternative to
patches and painful injection.
   The drug has proved effective in Phase III trials and is being prepared
for registration with the FDA. An NDA filing is expected at the latest by
mid-1996 with sales commencing as early as mid-1997. Androtest-SL has
Orphan Drug status for constitutional delay of growth and puberty. Like the
Oxandrin market, the hypogonadal market is a segment that hasn't been
properly addressed in the past. Competing transdermal patch companies like
Alza and Theratech are attempting to expand this market for men with
impotency, mild testosterone deficiency, and males that experience lower
testosterone levels because of aging. Under this criteria, the expanded
market numbers between 3 million and 5 million males in the United States.
But even without such indications, Androtest-SL's ease of use and
competitive profile may help it capture as much as $12 million in revenues
when marketing commences in 1997.
   BioTropin, Oxandrin, BioLon, and Androtest-SL constitute the products
which will generate earnings growth in the next five years. Other products
currently being sold include psoriasis treatment, Silkis, sold in Europe
through marketing partner Cilag S.A. and Delatestryl, an injectible
testosterone product being phased out in favor of Androtest-SL. Aside from
Androtest-SL, drugs in development include Porcine Growth Hormone for the
production of leaner pork products; OxSODrol (Phase II/III trials) for the
prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns; and Bio-Hep-B, a
third generation vaccine against the hepatitis B virus.

Financial summary and valuation

   We're expecting Bio-Technology General to post break-even numbers when
it reports its fourth quarter and year-end results sometime in February
1996. Third quarter 1995 net income was $0.00 per share, which excluded an
extraordinary gain of $0.03 due to debt forgiveness. Bio-Technology General
reached a major turning point in 1995 as its revenues (including interest
income) matched its expenses and the company demonstrated the ability to go
forward in 1996 as a profitable company.
   The company will probably have a burn-rate of approximately $5 million
for 1995 and end the year with about $12 million cash and equivalents. With
only half a million in long-term liabilities and nearly $15 million in
working capital, the company has a credible balance sheet. We are
predicting earnings of $0.15 in 1996 and $0.45 in 1997 broken out in Table
1.
   In 1996, the company will be cash flow positive and will probably not
need to raise substantial capital in the form of a secondary offering or
debt. Also, resources for marketing and sales infrastructure are already
in place along with several international marketing partnerships. BTG has
bypassed the dilemma that many biotechs meet when products are approved
without a sales force to market them. However, should the opportunity
present itself and market conditions prove favorable, we would view a
secondary offering as a positive development since BTG would be issuing
shares from a position of financial strength.
   Both administrative and R&D expenses have been pared down in recent
years as management has made a commitment to keep operating costs
well-controlled. Expenses in both categories will increase modestly in
1996 and 1997. The company also has over $50 million in net operating loss
carryforwards which expire from 1996 through 2009, therefore no provisions
for income tax has been made in our earnings model.
   We think that Bio-Technology General is an overlooked biopharmaceutical
with excellent growth potential and a robust pipeline unusual for a
small-cap concern. Its products meet the needs of immature, underserved
markets and possesses a fundamental investment profile in a sector
notorious for pie-in-the-sky prospects. Our one year price target is $12.00
based on a price/earnings ratio of 27X 1997 earnings. The ratio reflects
an average of generic drug companies' and pharmaceutical p/e ratios. We
are using a we strongly recommend purchase of the shares.

Minimum of four IPOs added to S&P New Issues Index; closed end funds
excluded.

It may come as a surprise to many investors that both the number and dollar
volume of new issues brought out in 1995 slightly trailed year earlier
levels. Last year, 489 IPOs were added to S&P's New Issues Index, compared
with 496 the year before, while total dollars raised came to $31.1 billion,
compared with $34.0 billion in 1994. Both years significantly trailed the
record 672 deals and $56.9 billion raised in 1993. Despite the fireworks
surrounding many technology deals, they are typically smaller than those
for mature companies reentering the market via a reverse LBO or ADRs, REITs
or closed end funds, which were popular offerings at various times over the
last 10 years. Despite some highly visible reverse LBOs and ADRs such as
Nabisco Holdings, Royal PTT Nederland, ENI, Canadian National Railways,
AVX, Gucci Group and Estee Lauder, there were fewer reverse LBOs and ADRs
on the IPO roster last year.
   With the economy slowing down, there were many industries that were off
limits to underwriters during the year. Financials and technology were in,
but heavy industry, basic materials, consumer durables and consumer
nondurables were out. With overall market leadership narrow, underwriters
had to concentrate their energies in the few in-favor industries.
   Although the year ended with a bang, with $14.0 billion raised from 201
deals during the last quarter, we believe that both the number and dollars
raised in 1996 will be slightly lower than last year's totals. Standard &
Poor's is of the view that the total return of the S&P 500 will be less
than double digits and that intermediate term fixed income investments
could provide similar returns over the next 12 months. With the economy
exhibiting sluggish growth and interest in technology temporarily on the
wane, we think that underwriters will easily be able to beat the 61 deals
and $3.7 billion raised in the first quarter of 1995. That was when the
market was treading water while waiting for interest rates to level off.
Comparisons, however, will get tougher as the year wears on. Should the
economy show signs of picking up, a number of offerings could surface in
specialty retailing and consumer products and services.

Telecommunications equipment and Internet plays were the big winners

   The S&P New Issues Index almost doubled in value last year, its best
performance since 1991, when it rose 106.1%. It finished 1995 up 96.5%. The
index tracks the performance of new issues, including REITs and closed end
funds, for the first six months of trading. To be added to the index, IPOs
must be firm underwritings priced at or above $5, with an offering
capitalization of at least $5 million. We exclude bank and S&L conversions,
best efforts deals and unit deals that include warrants. The index is price
weighted.
   Fully 62 deals more than doubled last year based on offering price and
what they closed the year at. Another 77 rose more than 50%. Before you
get the idea that buying IPOs is like shooting fish in a barrel, though, it
should be pointed out that 135 deals fell in value, while another 109 rose
less than 20%. Put together, they amount to 50% of all deals brought last
year.
   The biggest winner was Premisys Communications, which sextupled in less
than nine months. The company makes integrated multiple access servers and
concentrators that support prevailing centrex and digital switch
technologies as well as emerging frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode
(ATM) technologies. Its products allow the proliferation of frame relay
based ISDN services within a traditional broadband network structure. Right
now it is delivering just about the only ATM concentrator around. Revenues
for the September quarter rose 149%, while earnings quintupled to $0.25.
AT&T is its major customer and accounts for a third of revenues. One danger
is that when AT&T splits up, the new entity that makes equipment may choose
a different vendor, or more likely, other more traditional switch
manufacturers will catch up technologically and cause profit margins,
currently quite high, to eventually come down. The shares are currently
trading at 80X consensus projected fiscal 1996 EPS.
   Three of the next four winners were Internet plays, Spyglass, Netscape
Communications and UUNET Technologies. Spyglass more than quintupled, NSCP
almost quadrupled, and UNET more than tripled. These companies went public
so early in their corporate lives that one could only conjecture as to how
fast they might grow. All three are trading at multiples quantum leaps
higher than just about any other non-Internet related or biotech growth
stock.
   We are of the view that the Internet will be the dominant mass
communications medium in the 21st century. Nonetheless, once forward five
year sales and earnings growth rates for these companies become defined,
their share prices will be adjusted downward. In the meantime, shares of
Netscape, the company with the best shot at becoming a dominant player in
Internet services, is trading at over 20X projected 1997 revenues!
   Just about all the other big winners were technology related. There were
nine software companies among the 25 biggest winners, plus three
telecommunications related companies. The only exceptions were Renters
Choice, Compdent, Sequana Therapeutics, Garden Ridge and Spin-Tech.
   PDT makes light activated drugs to treat or diagnose a variety of
diseases. The company has yet to generate revenues or a profit, but it is
entering phase III trials for a drug to be used on hard tumors. DSP
Communications is developing chipsets for wireless personal communications
applications. To date, sales have come from chipsets for Japanese digital
mobile phones. Customers include Kenwood, Kyocera and Sanyo. Renters Choice
runs 325 rent-to-own stores. Nine month earnings more than doubled on a 60%
increase in sales. Verity is a maker of tools for the dissemination of
texts over various electronic networks. Although the company is still
running losses, revenues are up substantially. Greatest interest is in its
Topoc search engine for the Internet.

As usual, small deals done by third tier underwriters populate losers list

   The largest deal that landed on our losers list was Asia Pacific
Resources. It has a 60.7% interest in a major Indonesian producer of pulp
and rayon and almost wholly owns another firm that operates the largest
single line pulp mill in the world. Three paper mills are planned, two in
China and one in Indonesia. Unfortunately, the company has not earned much
money since going public in early April. With economies slowing in most
major markets, the company could be expanding capacity at just the wrong
time.
   Electronics Communications provides cellular phone services and
equipment. Sales dropped over the last nine months, with operations going
to a loss due to one-time advertising charges. AHI Healthcare Systems
integrates individual physicians and small medical groups into local
managed healthcare delivery networks. Although revenues more than doubled
in the nine months to 9/30/95, a larger than expected loss was reported due
to high development costs. Losses are expected to continue for at least one
more quarter.
   Other losers brought by large underwriters include HighwayMaster
Communications. It offers a wireless communications network for use by
truckers. Although revenues rose substantially of late, losses failed to
narrow. Number Nine Visual Technology initially received a very favorable
reception by investors. This maker of graphics accelerator products for
personal computers continues to show a very positive sales trend, but a
loss was reported for the September quarter. Analysts expected earnings of
$0.25 a share.
   Many of the worst losers were brought out by small underwriters such as
Investors Associates, Hampshire Securities, John G. Kinnard, Needham & Co.,
Paulson Investments, Lexington Securities, and J.W. Charles. Small sole
underwritings tend to do well initially, but then tail off rapidly as time
goes on. Most of these deals have generally weak underlying fundamentals,
but are operating in industries that are currently in favor. The
underwriter insures success at the IPO by developing more than enough
demand to float the shares at the offering, and those that are retail
oriented often drive the share price higher by convincing its clients to
buy additional shares in the aftermarket. Then the underwriter moves on to
the next deal. Lacking sponsorship and with a market capitalization too
small to hit the radar screens of most buy side managers, the offerings
inevitably drift lower.
   Salomon Brothers brought out three deals that found their way on the
losers list, as did Alex. Brown. Even the most successful underwriters,
however, bring out companies that falter due to subsequent poorer than
expected results. Some deals that initially moved higher before plummeting
included Business Resource Group, Number Nine Visual Technology, Hello
Direct, TGV Software and EqualNet Holdings.

Goldman Sachs dominates list of biggest deals

   Of the 10 largest deals, Goldman, Sachs kept the books on six of them.
No one else had more than one in the top 10. Goldman's largest deal was
Nabisco Holdings, which went public early in the year. It advanced 33.2% in
value by year end. Other large Goldman deals were Prudential Reinsurance,
PMI Group, Intimate Brands, Canadian National Railway and Borders Group.
Morgan Stanley's largest deal was Royal PTT Nederland, which edged up 2.4%
in the last five weeks of the year, Smith Barney's was Union Pacific
Resources, up 20.8% in less than three months, CS First Boston's was ENI,
rising 4.2% in five weeks, and Merrill Lynch's was DST Systems, which
advanced 35.7% in two months.
   The best performer in the aftermarket among the 10 largest deals was
Prudential Reinsurance, which advanced 39.6% by year end. The runner-up was
DST Systems. Large deals with offering capitalizations of more than $100
million that rose more than 30% are on page 11.

As usual, technology and white shoe underwriters lead in IPO aftermarket 
    performance

   Technology, regional and white shoe underwriters usually lead the pack
in bringing out the most successful offerings, and 1995 was no exception.
Rauscher Pierce leads the list. Of its four deals, one, Renters Choice,
tripled, while another, Belmont Homes, doubled. Other regional houses that
brought out excellent deals were William Blair and Robinson-Humphrey.
   The major specialty technology underwriters, as usual, brought out deals
that did much better than average in subsequent trading. Alex. Brown,
Montgomery, Hambrecht & Quist and Robertson, Stephens all served both
investors and corporate clients in pricing their deals well. As is also the
norm, second tier technology underwriters such as Needham & Co., Miller,
Johnson, Kuehn, and Unterberg Harris, for the most part brought out weaker
than average deals when they took the lead. The exceptions this year were
Cowen & Co. and Volpe, Welty.
   Salomon Brothers has been struggling to remain a major underwriter of
equity issues. The poor performance of their deals in the aftermarket in
1995 will not make their task any easier going forward. The multi-office
retail brokers typically bring out poorer performing deals. PaineWebber has
landed in the lower half of the list for many years and appears there
again, as does Merrill Lynch, Prudential, Smith Barney and Donaldson
Lufkin. There were no exceptions to the rule this year.
   The most deals were brought by Goldman, Sachs, followed by Robertson,
Stephens, Alex. Brown, and Morgan Stanley. Both Goldman, Sachs and Morgan
Stanley have consistently brought out better than average deals. Of
Goldman's 36 IPOs, only six finished the year under water. Just five of
Morgan Stanley's offerings finished under their IPO prices.

Sector rotation likely in 1996

   From an investment perspective, over the next six months or so, we would
emphasize those groups that could generate strong corporate earnings growth
regardless of how the overall economy does. They include health care,
(particularly HMOs and subacute care companies), energy services (the
drillers), REITs, insurance, computer networking, telecommunications
equipment, and farm related businesses.
   We may also see more foreign stocks. Many emerging markets could turn in
better performances than the U.S. in 1996. Our bets are on the Czech
Republic, Argentina, Chile and the Philippines. Following on the heels of
Gucci, we would also expect an increased number of ADR offerings of family
owned consumer product companies based in Europe.
   With technology stocks in a deep freeze, many IPOs in this sector will
be postponed until the climate improves. That may not be until later in the
year. In the meantime, it appears that value could beat growth in a market
environment in which the total return of the S&P 500 this year may not
reach its long term average of 10.1%.
   At least for the first quarter, we would emphasize low P/E plays. Of the
tech companies that do venture forth in this environment, they are apt to
be better priced. Although they may not move much in the immediate
aftermarket, they could do well when technology comes back into favor,
possibly late this year.
   Groups we would not commit additional funds to now would be personal
computer related technology, cyclicals, nonprecious metals, and consumer
finance stocks.

C-CUBE MICROSYSTEMS

   A two-for-one split was paid to shareholders of C-Cube Microsystems on
December 19, 1995. The shares, now 48% higher than in November last year
when we upgraded them from hold to buy, are a bit off from their recent
all-time high of 65 (post split). The stock is likely to be quite volatile
along with the technology sector as other firms report earnings for the
fourth quarter. For this reason, we are lowering the shares (CUBE, 53 5/16,
NASDAQ) from buy to hold on continued positive long term fundamentals.
C-Cube reports earnings for 1995 on January 18, 1995.

SMALLCAP-NEW ISSUE MARKET REVIEW

By:
Robert S. Natale, CFA
Editor

The tug of war between value and growth goes on

   Last year, growth beat value. The growth half of the S&P 500 provided a
total return of 38.1%, as measured by S&P/BARRA, while the value half of
the index generated 37.0%. But, for the five years ended 12/31/95, value
generated a 16.9% compound annual total return, against 16.1% for growth.
In 1996, value could again have the edge. With P/Es well above the
historical norm and economic growth slowing down, investors are seeking to
reduce perceived investment risks by searching out less expensive stocks in
industries that have not already run up. Indeed, we would be looking to
place money in industries that run on their own operating cycles, that is,
that are less affected by what is going on in the overall economy.
   For example, oil service companies, especially the drillers, stand to
benefit from increased exploration expenditures by the major oil companies
this year. That is because new technologies such as 3-D seismic and
horizontal drilling have reduced finding costs, making the redevelopment of
older fields and of new small fields economical. In addition, after 10
years of depression, the supply of oil rigs is finally coming into balance
with demand. Day rates rose substantially last year even though natural gas
prices plummeted and oil prices went nowhere. Our favorites here are Global
Marine and Nabors Industries.
   Another group attractive to value and growth players alike is health
care. New rules coming out of Washington, D.C. could adversely impact
hospital and nursing home businesses, but the drive to reduce per capita
costs will push increased use of subacute rehabilitation services and
Medicare and Medicaid patients into HMOs. We have three rehab companies on
our buy list, Mariner Health Group, RehabCare Group, and TheraTx. All are
trading at or below the market multiple as measured by the S&P 500. HMOs on
our buy list are Pacificare Health Systems and United American Healthcare.
   Semiconductor companies now look like value plays in the sense that they
now sport low P/Es despite prospects for above average, albeit somewhat
cyclical, earnings growth. Many on our buy lists have been beaten up of
late and offer considerable appeal for investors looking beyond the
uncertainties surrounding the industry as excess inventories are worked
down. Industry growth this year will not match the 40% increase in
worldwide shipments experienced in 1995; 26% will be more like it. Still,
that should more than justify a recovery in P/E ratios. In addition to
SGS-Thomson, which is recommended in this issue, we like Exar, which makes
lower end application specific integrated circuits, Integrated Circuits,
which manufactures mixed signal Ics, and Sierra Semiconductor, which is
supplying chips to fast growing ATM and frame relay telecommunications
switch makers. All of these companies are trading at single digit multiples
against current forecasted 1996 EPS.
   We also suggest taking another look at real estate plays. With Standard
& Poor's predicting the total return for the S&P 500 to be less that 10% in
1996, REITs could provide comparable or better returns with less risk.
Except for retail properties, real estate values continue to climb,
particularly for office properties. Our favorites in this area include
Catellus Development, an almost pure play on the California recovery, First
Union Real Estate Trust, which has one of the lowest dividend payouts as a
percent of cash flow in the REIT industry, which bodes well for steady
dividend increases over the next 18 months, and Property Capital Trust,
which is liquidating, and we feel will provide a total return well into the
double digits as it does so over the next three to five years.
   Other industries that we would target for investment, either through
IPOs or otherwise, are domestic farming (i.e. Case and Tractor Supply,
insurance, and telecommunications equipment (Stratacom, Sierra
Semiconductor).
   Finally, some leading emerging foreign markets should also provide
better returns than the S&P 500 in 1996. We would play them via listed
closed end funds. Our favorites are Czech Republic Fund and First
Philippine Fund.
   Despite the weak start to the year by small stocks, we continue to
believe that they will beat the S&P 500 this year. Earnings growth for
companies in the SmallCap 600 is projected to be much stronger than the S&P
500 in 1996, while the P/E ratios of small stocks are only slightly higher.
Although investors are very unlikely to garner the same returns achieved in
1995, small stocks should provide excellent relative returns in 1996.

THE NEW CRA EXAMINATION PROCEDURES
Changes Designed To Reduce the Examination Burden Have Focused Regulatory
Attention on Community Reinvestment Results. The Interpretation of Key CRA
Standards Remains Subject to Substantial Examiner Discretion.

By:
Christina M. Gattuso*

In May 1995, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of
Thrift Supervision, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,
and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (collectively, the
``Agencies'') issued final revised regulations under the Community
Reinvestment Act (``CRA'') (the ``Revised CRA Regulations'').1 In the
preamble to that rulemaking, the Agencies noted that they would work
together to improve training for examiners, to increase interagency efforts
to apply standards consistently and reliably, and to minimize unnecessary
compliance burdens. Consistent with those efforts, on November 13, 1995,
the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (``FFIEC'')
officially released new CRA examination procedures that were jointly
adopted by the Agencies for monitoring an institution's compliance with the
Revised CRA Regulations (the ``Procedures'').
There are four sets of examination procedures -- procedures for large,
retail institutions; for small institutions; for wholesale and limited
purpose institutions; and for institutions with an approved strategic plan.
In accordance with the Revised CRA Regulations, examiners began using the
small institution examination procedures on January 1, 1996. The other
three sets of procedures do not become mandatory until July 1, 1997.
However, examiners will use the Procedures in conducting examinations of
those institutions that elect to be evaluated under the Revised CRA
Regulation prior to that date.2
In some instances, the assessment criteria set forth in the Procedures
mirror the twelve assessment factors under the prior CRA regulations.3
Examiners will still review and rate institutions on the geographic
distribution of their loans; their record of opening and closing offices;
their participation in community development projects; their real estate,
small farm, and small business loans; and their participation in government
loan programs for housing, small farms, and small businesses. Under the
Procedures, the examiners will continue to review, but the institution will
not be rated, on any practices by the institution that are intended to
discourage applications, any prohibited discriminatory or other illegal
credit practices,4 the institution's ability to meet community credit
needs, the institution's delineated community, and the institution's
willingness to explore other activities. Under the Revised CRA Regulations
and the Procedures, examiners will no longer look at, and an institution
will not be rated on, its ascertainment of community credit needs,
marketing, and board of director involvement in the CRA process.
   The Procedures emphasize that examiners are expected to exercise
judgement and common sense to minimize the burden imposed on the
examination process and to perform only those steps necessary to arrive at
an accurate assessment of the institution's CRA performance.5 Consistent
with the Revised CRA Regulations, the Procedures establish evaluation
methods based on a review of objective data that can also be used by
institutions to measure their own performance under the CRA. An examiner's
assessment of an institution's CRA performance will be based on a number of
objective factors, which include the number and amount of loans originated,
the amount of qualified investments, and the types of services provided by
the institution.6 However, by necessity the Procedures allow for examiner
discretion in the assessment process in order to account for the
differences among institutions and the communities they serve. While the
need for flexibility in assessing an institution's performance is
important, unless the examiners are provided with clear guidance and
comprehensive training, inconsistencies in CRA examinations are likely to
continue. The Agencies believe that the training examiners have received
and will continue to receive in the future will enable examiners to make
more informed judgements in the areas in which they have discretion and
should ensure consistency in the examination process.7

EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR LARGE RETAIL INSTITUTIONS
The Revised CRA Regulations provide that a financial institution with total
assets of $250 million or more or, regardless of size, one that is owned by
a holding company with total banking and thrift assets greater than $1
billion, will be examined under the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests.
The Procedures set forth the items that will be reviewed in assessing an
institution's performance under those three tests.

Examination Scope
The Procedures set forth factors that will be reviewed and compiled by the
examiners at the pre-examination stage to determine the scope of the
impending CRA examination.8 To make this determination, the examiners will
review the institution's prior CRA evaluations, information provided by
community contacts, and the lending data and demographic data reported for
each assessment area.9 The examiners will also consider the number of other
institutions in the assessment area and the opportunities available in the
assessment area for lending, investment and other services. Based on this
information, the examiners will determine the scope of their on-site and
off-site examinations.

Performance Context
The Procedures require the examiners to establish a ``performance context''
for the examination by evaluating information about the institution, its
community and its competitors. In this regard, the examiners will review
standardized worksheets and other agency information to obtain relevant
demographic, economic, and loan data on each assessment area under
review.10 The examiners will also review agency-prepared community contact
forms for groups within the institution's assessment area, and may contact
local community, governmental, or economic development representatives to
update such information.11 To determine the institution's ability and
capacity to serve its assessment area, the examiners will review Call
Reports or Thrift Financial Reports (``TFRs''), annual reports, supervisory
reports and prior CRA evaluations. The examiners will also consider any
information the institution provides on its local community and economy,
its business strategy, and its lending capacity, and any information that
otherwise assists in the evaluation of the institution.12 However,
examiners will not require the institution to create such information; nor
will they ask for any information other than what the institution has
developed as part of its normal business practice.
   Finally, by reviewing the public evaluations and other financial data,
the examiners will determine whether any similarly situated institutions13
serve the same or similar assessment area and, if so, whether they would
provide relevant and accurate information for evaluating the institution's
CRA performance. The Procedures note that the examiners should consider
whether such information would help to identify lending opportunities
available in the institution's assessment area that are compatible with the
institution's business strategy and consistent with safe and sound banking
practices; constraints affecting opportunities to make safe and sound loans
and qualified investments compatible with the institution's business
strategy in the assessment area; and successful CRA-related product
offerings or activities used by other lenders serving the same or a similar
assessment area.
   The development of the performance context will likely occur prior to
initiation of the on-site examination. The Revised CRA Regulations and the
Procedures make clear that an institution need not compile or maintain
information related to the performance context. However, to the extent the
institution compiles information to analyze the demand for loans,
investment and services within its assessment area, it would be to the
institution's advantage to provide such information to the examiner for use
in developing the performance context.

Assessment Area
Under the prior CRA regulations, an institution's delineated community was
reviewed and rated as part of an institution's overall CRA performance. The
Revised CRA Regulations require an institution to define its assessment
area but do not require that an examiner rate the institution's assessment
area. The Procedures and the Revised CRA Regulations state that examiners
will use the institution's assessment area unless they determine that ``the
assessment area does not comply with the requirements for assessment areas
set forth in the final rule.''14 Since this is not a rated area, an
incorrect identification or definition of an institution's assessment area
will not result in a downgrading of an institution's CRA Rating.15
As long as an institution's assessment area meets the requirements of the
Revised CRA Regulations, the examiners should not second guess the
assessment area. In order to meet the requirements of the Revised CRA
Regulations, the assessment area should consist of one or more metropolitan
statistical areas (``MSAs'') or contiguous political subdivisions. It
should also include the geographies16 where the institution has its main
office, its branches, and any deposit-taking ATMs, and the areas
surrounding such locations where the institution originated or purchased a
substantial portion of its loans. In addition, the assessment area should
consist of whole geographies; it should not exclude low or moderate income
geographies and should not illegally discriminate; and not extend
substantially across consolidated MSAs or state boundaries unless the
institution is in a multi-state MSA. If the examiners find that the
assessment area fails to meet these regulatory criteria, the examiners will
develop a revised assessment area and will evaluate the institution's
performance based on that revised assessment area.

Public File Checklist
The Procedures provide that there is no need for the examiners to review
each branch or each complete public file during every examination,
particularly if the institution has complied with the public file
requirements of the Revised CRA Regulations in previous examinations.
However, it is likely that the examiners will review the public files in
the first examination of every institution under the Revised CRA
Regulations and the Procedures. In cases where a review of the public file
is undertaken, the examiners will determine whether an accurate public
notice is displayed in the lobby of each branch, and whether the file(s) in
the main office and in each state contain all information required by the
Revised CRA Regulations.17

Performance Criteria
Lending Test
The Lending Test is the primary test for large, retail institutions, since
failure to achieve at least a Low Satisfactory rating in this area makes it
impossible to achieve an overall Satisfactory rating. The examiners will
rate the institution's lending performance under the following criteria:
lending activity; geographic distribution; borrower characteristics;
community development lending; and innovative or flexible lending
practices. The analysis under the Lending Test is similar to the analysis
conducted under the prior CRA regulations.
   After the examiners determine the loans to review for purposes of the
Lending Test,18 the examiners will test a sample of loan files to verify
the accuracy of data collected and/or reported by the institution and to
ensure that (i) affiliate loans reported by the institution are not also
attributable to another affiliate subject to CRA;19 (ii) loans reported as
community development loans meet the definition of community development
loans;20 and (iii) all consumer loans in a particular loan category have
been included, when the institution collects and maintains the data for one
or more loan categories and elects to have the information evaluated. The
examiners will also identify the dollar amount and number of loans under
evaluation that the institution has made or purchased within its assessment
area, taking into account the institution's resources and business strategy
and other information that the examiners gather under the performance
context, including population, income, housing, and business data. The
examiners will also review any analyses offered by the institution to
provide insight into the reasonableness of the institution's geographic
distribution of lending.21 If the areas of low- or no-loan penetration are
found in the institution's analyses, the examiners will review explanations
and determine whether the institution took action to address the
disparities.
   While the Procedures direct the examiners to supplement their review
with an independent analysis of geographic distribution as necessary to
determine the extent to which the institution is serving geographies in
each income category, they make clear that an institution is not required
to lend in every geography. The Procedures also permit the examiners to
compare the institution's lending performance to that of other lenders
within its assessment area if the examiners determine that such an analysis
would provide insight into the reasons for an abnormally low penetration of
lending in the assessment area. Taking all of these factors into
consideration, the examiners will determine whether the institution's
abnormally low loan penetration in certain areas should constitute a
negative consideration in rating the geographic distribution of the
institution's loans.
   In terms of borrower characteristics, the examiners will review any
analyses prepared by or for the institution to determine the reasonableness
of the institution's loan distribution by borrower characteristics. To the
extent necessary, the examiners will supplement the analysis provided by
the institution with an independent analysis. If the institution adequately
serves borrowers within its assessment area, the examiners will look to its
performance outside its assessment area based on borrower characteristics
to determine whether such performance would enhance the assessment of the
institution's overall performance.
   The examiners will also review the institution's community development
lending, using information obtained in the performance context to determine
the responsiveness of the institution to available community development
opportunities and the extent to which the institution has demonstrated
leadership in community development lending.
   Finally, the examiners will evaluate whether the institution uses
innovative or flexible loan products, and, if so, the degree to which the
loans serve low- and moderate-income individuals in new ways or serve
borrowers not previously served by the institution. In addition, the
examiners will look at the success of any innovative or flexible loan
products offered by the institution, including the number and dollar amount
of such loan products originated during the review period.22 To some
degree, an institution's rating under the Lending Test will be based on
objective data. However, examiners will still be required to determine
whether an institution's lending activity is reasonable or adequate, terms
that are not defined in the Revised CRA Regulations or the Procedures, in
order to reach a conclusion as to which rating to assign to the
institution.

Investment Test
The review of an institution's performance under the Investment Test is
similar to the examiners' review of this area under the prior CRA
Regulations. Under the Investment Test, the examiners will identify
qualified investments23 by reviewing the institution's investment
portfolio, and, if elected by the institution, the investment portfolio of
its affiliate(s). Investments that were made since the last CRA evaluation
and those that were made prior to the previous CRA evaluation but still
remain outstanding will be considered. The examiners will also consider
qualifying grants, donations, or in-kind contributions of property since
the last evaluation that are for community development purposes.
   In evaluating the institution's investment portfolio, the examiners will
determine whether the investments benefit the institution's assessment area
or a broader area that includes the institution's assessment area; whether
the investments have been considered under the Lending or Service Tests;
whether an affiliate's investments have been claimed by another
institution; the dollar volume of investments made to entities that are in
or serve the assessment area, in relation to the institution's capacity and
constraints, and the assessment area's characteristics and needs; the use
of any innovative or complex investments; and the degree to which the
investments serve low- and moderate- income areas or individuals, and are
responsive to available opportunities for qualified investments.24
   After considering the number and dollar amount of qualified investments;
the innovativeness and complexity of qualified investments; the degree to
which these types of investments are routinely provided by other private
investors; and the responsiveness of the institution's qualified
investments to available opportunities, the examiners will reach a
conclusion regarding the institution's performance under the Investment
Test. As with the Lending Test, there will be some degree of subjectivity
in reaching this conclusion since examiners will need to determine the
adequacy of an institution's qualified investments in order to assign a
rating.

Service Test
The Service Test evaluates the institution on the basis of the retail
banking and community development services provided by the institution.
With respect to retail banking service, the information used by the
examiners to evaluate the institution is similar to information reviewed
under the prior CRA regulations. As was the case under the prior CRA
regulations, the institution should be prepared to provide an explanation
for any material differences in the hours of operations or services
available at branches within the institution's assessment area.
   The examiners will also review the institution's record of opening and
closing branches within its assessment area since the previous evaluation
and the extent to which any such openings or closings have had a negative
or positive impact on low- and moderate-income geographies within the
institution's assessment area. In addition, the institution will be
evaluated on the basis of the accessibility and use of alternative systems
of delivering banking services in low and moderate income geographies and
to low and moderate income individuals.25 Finally, the examiners will
assess the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the institution's
service-delivery systems provided for all income areas within its
assessment area. In making such an assessment, the examiners are directed
to consider the degree to which services are tailored to the convenience
and needs of each geography.
   As part of the Service Test, the examiners will also review the
institution's community development services, which can include at the
institution's option, services through affiliates of the institution. The
examiners will identify such services and determine whether the services
qualify under the definition of community development services, benefit the
assessment area or a broader statewide or regional area encompassing the
institution's assessment area; and ensure that any services provided by
affiliates of the institution are not claimed by other affiliated
institutions. Taking into account the information gathered in the
performance context, the examiners will evaluate the extent of the
community development services offered by the institution; the
innovativeness of any such services, including whether they serve low- and
moderate- income customers in new ways or serve groups of customers not
previously served; and the degree to which they serve low- or moderate-
income areas or individuals and their responsiveness to available
opportunities for community development services.

Ratings
Based on the analysis discussed above, an institution will be rated
Outstanding, High Satisfactory, Low Satisfactory, Needs to Improve, or
Substantial Noncompliance for each of the Lending, Investment, and Service
Tests.26 These rating descriptions are relatively subjective in order to
provide the examiners with the flexibility to accommodate differences in
institutions and their communities. The Procedures do not provide any
guidance on interpretation of the descriptions. The examiners will total
the institution's scores on the three tests to assign the institution an
overall composite rating. Under the Procedures, an institution's assigned
rating can be no more than three times its score on the Lending Test.27 In
addition, the examiners must take into account the results of the fair
lending component of the institution's most recent compliance examination
and determine whether these findings should lower the institution's overall
CRA Rating. In determining whether to downgrade the institution, the
examiner will also take into account the nature and extent of any evidence
of discrimination, the policies the institution has in place to prevent
discriminatory or other illegal credit practices, any corrective action
taken, and any other relevant information.

EXAMINATION PROCEDURES FOR SMALL INSTITUTIONS
Generally
Under the new Procedures, the scope of the examination for small
institutions is streamlined, with the primary focus on the institution's
lending performance. If a small institution has more than one assessment
area, the examiners will select the assessment areas for on-site review
based on the institution's prior CRA performance, its lending activity in
the assessment area, information obtained from community contacts, and
demographic data on each assessment area.
   The performance context for small institutions generally includes the
same information that is reviewed in the performance context for
examinations of large, retail institutions. The primary difference is that
the examination is much more streamlined, and while the examiners will
review financial information and the prior CRA evaluations of institutions
of similar size that serve the same or similar assessment area(s), they
will not consider the same detail of information regarding similarly
situated institutions as will be considered in examining large retail
institutions. The review of the assessment area of a small institution is
the same as that of a large, retail institution, as is the review of the
small institution's public files.
   The examiners will review small institutions in five areas: (i) the
loan-to-deposit analysis; (ii) comparison of credit extended inside and
outside of the assessment area; (iii) distribution of credit within the
assessment area; (iv) review of complaints; and (v) investments and
services (at the institution's option to enhance a satisfactory rating.)

Performance Criteria
Loan-to-Deposit Analysis
Examiners will use the data contained in Call Reports and TFRs to calculate
the institution's average loan-to-deposit (``LTD'') ratio since the
institution's last examination by adding the quarterly loan-to-deposit
ratios and dividing by the number of quarters covered by the examination.
If the LTD ratio is high, the examiners will only analyze financial
information. If the ratio is low, the examiners will make a determination
about the reasonableness of the LTD ratio by reviewing information gathered
in the performance context, including the institution's capacity to lend,
the capacity of other similarly situated institutions to lend in the
assessment area, demographic and economic factors present in the assessment
area, and the lending opportunities available in the institution's
assessment area.28 If the examiners determine that the LTD is not
reasonable in light of the performance context, they will also consider the
number and dollar volume of any loans sold by the institution to the
secondary market, the innovativeness or complexity of community development
loans and qualified investments by the institution, to assess the extent to
which those activities compensate for a low LTD ratio or supplement the
institution's lending performance as reflected in its LTD ratio.
   Comparison of Credit Extended Inside and Outside of the Assessment
Area(s)
The examiners will review HMDA data, automated loan reports or other
reports generated by the institution to analyze the extent of lending by
the institution both inside and outside the assessment area. If such data
is not available or cannot be verified, the examiners will use sampling
guidelines to select a sample of loans originated, purchased, committed to
calculate the percentage of loans located within the assessment area. Only
if the percentage of loans or other activities inside the assessment area
constitute majority of the institution's lending and other activities will
the institution meet the standards for a Satisfactory rating under this
category. If such activities are less than a majority, the examiners will
consider information from the performance context with respect to economic
conditions, loan demand, and the institution's size, financial condition,
branching network, and business strategies.29 If an institution has a
significant amount of lending outside of its assessment area, it may want
to provide the examiners with a geocoded lending analysis since sampling
may not accurately reflect the institution's lending activity.

Distribution of Credit within the Assessment Area
The Procedures direct the examiners to determine first whether the number
and income distribution of geographies in the assessment area are
sufficient for a meaningful analysis of the geographic distribution of the
institution's loans in its assessment area. If such an analysis would be
meaningful and the necessary geographic information is collected by the
institution in the ordinary course of business, the examiners will
determine the distribution of the institution's loans in its assessment
area within the four geographies. While the Procedures state that the
absence of loans in any particular geography should not be a concern, the
examiners are directed to identify groups of geographies by income
categories in which there is little or no loan penetration.30 If the
institution collects information about borrower income or revenue, the
examiners will review such information to determine the distribution of the
institution's loans in the assessment area by borrower income and business
revenue, and to identify categories of borrowers for which there is little
to no penetration of loans.
   If an analysis of the distribution of loans would not be meaningful or
could not be performed, the examiners may analyze the geographic
distribution by street address rather than geography (if such data is
available and the analysis would be reasonable), or they may analyze the
distribution by loan size as a proxy for income or revenue of the borrower.
If the analysis shows that the institution is not penetrating some areas or
has low penetration in some areas, the examiners are directed to form a
conclusion about the reasons for the loan penetration using information
gathered in the performance context. If the institution is found to have
low penetration of some areas, it may be useful for the institution to
provide the examiners with data to justify its loan distribution.

Review of Complaints
The examiners will review all complaints received by the institution
regarding the institution's CRA performance and the institution's action
with respect thereto as well as any complaints regarding the institution
received by the Agencies.

Investments and Services
These areas will only be reviewed by the examiners at the institution's
option to enhance a Satisfactory rating. If the institution chooses to have
these areas reviewed, the examiners will consider the dollar amount of
qualified investments, the impact of those investments on the institution's
assessment area, and the innovativeness or complexity of the investments.31
With respect to services provided by the institution, the examiners will
take into account the same general information considered under the Service
Test for large retail institutions.

Ratings
A small institution will be assigned a Satisfactory rating if it meets each
of the standards set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations for that rating
or if it has exceptionally strong performance with respect to some of the
standards that compensates for weak performance in other standards.32 If an
institution fails to qualify for a Satisfactory rating, the examiners will
assign a Needs to Improve or a Substantial Noncompliance Rating depending
on the degree to which the institution's performance falls short of a
Satisfactory rating. The Procedures also direct the examiners to review the
results of the fair lending component of the institution's most recent
compliance examination to determine whether those findings should lower the
institution's overall CRA Rating.

PROCEDURES FOR LIMITED PURPOSE AND WHOLESALE INSTITUTIONS
Generally
Under the Revised CRA Regulations, limited purpose and wholesale
institutions are evaluated under separate examination procedures on the
basis of the community development test.33 The scope of the examination for
limited purpose and wholesale institutions will focus on community
development lending, qualified investments, and community development
services. In defining the performance context for the examination, the
examiners will review the same types of information reviewed under the
performance context for large, retail institutions except that the analysis
will focus on the information as it relates to community development. Thus,
to the extent the institution collects data to analyze the types of
community development opportunities in its assessment area, it should
consider providing such information to the examiners for their use in
establishing the performance context. The evaluation of the assessment area
is generally the same as for large, retail institutions.

Performance Criteria
Under the Community Development Test, the examiners will review the
institution's performance with regard to community development lending,
qualified investments, and community development services. The examiners
will review the number and dollar amount of community development loans
made by the institution and will test a sample of the institution's
community development loan files to verify that such loans qualify as
community development loans. The examiners also will review qualified
investments and other community development services provided by the
institution and, at the institution's option, will include activities by
affiliates and community development lending by consortia or third parties.
In reaching a conclusion about the institution's community development
performance, the examiners will take into account the degree of innovation
in community development lending activities and the responsiveness of the
institution to the opportunities for community development activities.34 To
the extent the institution is collecting information regarding community
development loans and qualified investments, the institution should provide
the examiners with such information, as well as information on the
beneficiaries of such loans and investments.

Ratings
The institution will be rated based on the examiner's analysis of the
institution's performance under the Community Development Test in
accordance with the criteria set forth in the Revised CRA Regulations.35
While the rating descriptions set forth in the Revised CRA Regulation are
highly subjective, the Procedures are fairly straightforward.

PROCEDURES FOR INSTITUTIONS WITH STRATEGIC PLANS
Generally
The examination scope for institutions with strategic plans will focus on
whether or not the institution has met the goals stated within its
strategic plan.36 In order to make such a determination, the examiners may
also consider the level of the institution's lending, investment and
service activity in the different assessment areas, particularly in low-
and moderate- income areas, the importance of the institution in meeting
the credit needs in its assessment area, information provided by community
contacts and the institution's prior performance evaluations.37
As part of the performance context, the examiners will consider any
information that the institution provides on its record of meeting the
goals of the strategic plan and will contact local community, governmental
and other representatives to update or supplement information about the
institution's record of meeting the plan goals. Since the institution is
likely to be gathering data to show its progress toward meeting its goals
under the plan, the institution should consider providing that information
to the examiners. The review of the institution's assessment area will
occur when the strategic plan is submitted.

Performance Criteria
The examiners will review the institution's performance to evaluate the
institution's record of meeting the performance goals set forth in its
plan. If the goals were not met, the examiners will determine whether the
plan goals were ``substantially met'' by considering the number of unmet
goals, the degree to which the goals were not met, the importance of those
goals and the reasons why the goals were not met.

Ratings
A rating will be assigned to the institution based on the goals and rating
objectives established by the plan. If the institution has not
``substantially met'' its goals, it can elect to be evaluated under the
small institution, large or retail institution, or wholesale or limited
purpose institution test, as appropriate.38 The examiners will also review
an institution's fair lending performance based on its most recent
compliance examination to determine whether evidence of discrimination
exists that should lower the institution's overall CRA Rating.

CONCLUSION
The Procedures are designed to reduce the burden associated with the CRA
examination process while at the same time ensure consistency in the
examination process. While the Revised CRA Regulations and the Procedures
shift the focus of the examination process from documentation to community
reinvestment results, examiners will continue to exercise a fair amount of
discretion in interpreting the CRA standards. For example, under the
Procedures, examiners will still be required to make subjective
determinations with regard to the ``innovativeness'' of loans and
investments and they will be required to differentiate between ``adequate''
responsiveness and ``poor'' responsiveness or ``excellent'' and
``reasonable'' dispersion of loans. In the past, the attempts by the
federal banking regulators to ensure certainty and consistency in the
examination process by revising their examination guidance and training
programs did not achieve the intended results. The success of the most
recent attempt by the regulators will be determined over time as
examinations are conducted pursuant to the Procedures. In the meantime,
institutions would be well advised to continue to maintain data to support
their CRA performance.

Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC''), between now and that
date, examiners will focus on five of the twelve assessment factors set
forth in the prior CRA Regulations -- geographic distribution of loans,
number of home mortgage and small business loans, participation in
government loans programs, participation in community development
activities and the bank's record of opening and closing branches. M.

factors under the prior CRA Regulation. For convenience, all citations to
the Revised CRA Regulations are to the OCC's regulations.
4. An institution's fair lending program is no longer rated under the
Revised CRA Regulations. However, the Procedures provide that an examiner
may decrease an institution's CRA Rating if instances of illegal
discrimination are discovered in the institution's credit practices. See,
e.g., Large Institution Examination Procedures at 14
5. The Procedures eliminate 50 steps, some of them multi-part, from the
old examination procedures under the prior CRA regulations. See Letter from
the Agencies to The Honorable Joseph P. Kennedy II, dated Jan. 3, 1996.
6. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.22 (b). For small institutions, the examiners
will look at objective factors such as an institution's loan to deposit
ratio; the percentage of loans located in the institution's assessment
area; and the geographic distribution of the institution's loans. See 12
C.F.R. Section25.26(a).
7. The Agencies are in the process of drafting an ``Official Staff
Commentary'' to the Revised CRA Regulations which will be published for
notice and comment in the Federal Register and which is intended to provide
the public and examiners with a consistent interpretation of the Revised
CRA Regulations.
8. The Revised CRA Regulations require large institutions to collect and
report certain data that will be used by the examiners to evaluate CRA
performance. See 12 C.F.R. Section25.42. The data will be reported to the
Agencies electronically in standardized format which will enable the
examiners to conduct much of the necessary analysis prior to the on-site
examination.
9. The Revised CRA Regulations and the Procedures address the means by
which an institution's performance will be reviewed if it has multiple
assessment areas. For purposes of this article, an institution's assessment
area is referred to in the singular.
10. The Agencies have devised standardized worksheets for use by the
examiners in determining community profile, economic patterns, and lending
distribution.
11. The examiners will conduct interviews with local community, civic, or
government leaders to help learn about the community, its economic base,
and local community development initiatives. These interviews may be
conducted prior to the examination or as part of the examination.
12. While an institution is not required to provide such information to
the examiners or to create such information, it may still be advisable to
maintain the data necessary to respond to any issues that may be raised in

institution's CRA performance; the institution's most recent CRA Public
Performance Evaluation; a map of the assessment area; a list of services
provided by the institution; and, if applicable, the number and amount of
consumer loans make to the four income categories of borrowers and
geographies and the number and amount located inside and outside the
assessment area.
18. This will be accomplished by reviewing the institution's most recent
HMDA and CRA Disclosure Statement, interim HMDA Loan Application Register
(``LAR''), and any interim CRA data collected by the institution; a sample
of consumer loans if consumer lending represents a substantial majority of
the institution's business and any other information the institution
chooses to provide regarding its lending activities. The institution may
also provide information on small business loans secured by non-farm
residential real estate, home equity loans not reported for HMDA, unfunded
commitments, and information on loans outstanding and loan distribution
analysis conducted by and for the institution, including any explanations
for identified concerns or actions taken to address such concerns. Large

19. Examiners will accomplish this by requesting the institution to
identify how loans are attributed and how it ensures that all loans within
a given lending category (e.g., small business loans, home equity loans,
and other types of loans ) in a particular assessment area are reported for
all of the institution's affiliates if the institution elects to count any
affiliate loans. Id.

THE DUTY TO RESPOND

The SEC Has Issued Two Reports on Management's Duty To Respond to Employee
Misconduct. A Company That Meaningfully Investigates Alleged Misconduct,
Ensures That It Will Not Be Repeated, and Appropriately Sanctions the
Wrongdoer Will Be Judged More Leniently than the Errant Employee.

By:
John K. Carroll*

Traditionally, the government has exercised its discretion over whether to
punish a public company for the misconduct of its officers or employees
based upon several factors: the seniority of the officer or employee
involved; the degree to which the company benefited from the misconduct,
the vulnerability of the victims; the extent of harm inflicted; and, to a
lesser degree, the foreseeability of the misconduct. The consequence of
basing prosecutorial discretion on this mix of factors has been to leave
companies -- and their innocent shareholders -- at the mercy of errant
employees. By the time a company learns of the misconduct, it may already
be too late to avoid governmental punishment.
In recent actions, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``SEC'') has
indicated strongly that a new factor should be added to this mix. The SEC
has made clear that it will calibrate corporate punishment based on the
steps taken by a company, through its board and senior management, on
learning of alleged employee misconduct. In so doing, the SEC has
delineated a ``duty to respond,'' i.e., the responsibility of senior
management to investigate, deter, and punish employee and management
misconduct. This duty to respond imposes new obligations on companies
confronted with employee misconduct. In a realistic sense, it promises that
a company's punishment, if any, will depend on the knowing and intentional
conduct of its managers.
   In two reports, one issued at the end of last year, the SEC specifically
addressed the duty to respond to employee misconduct.1 A public company
whose management meets this duty can argue compellingly that it should be
judged separately from its errant employees and should be treated
leniently.2 Managers who fail to respond will be criticized and sanctioned.
Indeed, a lackadaisical management response may amplify a company's
exposure and even jeopardize its viability. This article will review the
Cooper and Gutfreund reports and examine the three steps required to
fulfill the duty to respond articulated in those reports.
THE COOPER COMPANIES
Background
In November 1992, a grand jury in the Southern District of New York
returned a 24-count indictment against the Cooper Companies, Inc. and Gary
Singer, Cooper's chief executive officer.3 In substance, the indictment
charged Singer in two fraudulent schemes relating to his position as CEO of
Cooper. The first scheme, which involved front-running, benefited both
Singer and Cooper. As set forth in the indictment, Singer was tipped by the
manager of a high-yield mutual fund with information regarding the
securities the manager intended to purchase for the portfolio. Singer
profited by going into the market ahead of the fund, purchasing bonds for
accounts he controlled, including Cooper accounts, and reselling the bonds
to the fund at a profit. In return, Singer caused payments to be made by
Cooper to the manager.
   Singer's second scheme directly victimized Cooper. Singer caused Cooper
to sell high-yield bonds at below-market prices from Cooper's position to
Singer and his family. Singer and his family then resold these bonds in the
market at a profit. Singer failed to disclose these related-party
transactions on internal Cooper questionnaires circulated among the
company's management.
   Cooper Company itself was indicted as a participant in Singer's first
scheme, even though the company was the direct victim of Singer's second
scheme and its shareholders were the direct or indirect victims of all of
Singer's misconduct. Simultaneous with the filing of the indictment, the
SEC filed a civil action against Cooper, Singer, and his brother Steven
Singer arising out of the same series of transactions.4
   On January 13, 1994, following a jury trial, Singer was found guilty in
connection with each of the schemes.5 The company was also convicted in
connection with the front-running scheme. Eleven months later, on December
12, 1994, the SEC settled its civil charges against Cooper. As a part of
that settlement, the company agreed to be permanently enjoined from further
violations of specified sections of the securities laws, and from any
further employment of Gary or Steven Singer. In addition, Cooper was
ordered to disgorge $1.4 million plus interest, and to pay a civil penalty
of $1.15 million. The settlement permitted Cooper to offset these payments
against fines and restitution and interest payments made in connection with
the criminal conviction.6
The Board's Failure to Respond
The charges against Cooper in both the indictment and the SEC complaint
represent starkly the inherent paradox when a fraud charge is brought
against not only an employee but a public company itself. Why should
innocent shareholders suffer the financial consequences of their company's
indictment for the misconduct of an employee, albeit the chief executive
officer? This issue is especially germane to the Cooper case because the
company and its shareholders were the direct and intended victims of much
of Singer's misconduct. In its recent report, the SEC answered that
question by sharply criticizing Cooper's board for failing to respond to
its knowledge of Singer's misconduct. The board's failure is worth
discussing at length.
   As discussed in the report, Cooper's directors were first notified of
alleged misconduct by Singer in January 1992, when the SEC issued a Formal
Order of Investigation of the Cooper Company.7 The board responded to the
SEC notice by disclosing the pendency of the investigation in the company's
form 10-K filed at the end of January. There is no indication that the
board took any other action in response to the subpoena.
   In early February 1992, the gap between the interests of the company and
those of the Singers widened. In response to SEC questioning, both Singers
asserted their Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to testify. At the
time he invoked his privilege, Gary Singer was Cooper's CEO and Steven
Singer was acting chief operating officer. Gary Singer had the authority to
trade in the company's securities accounts. Steven Singer was formally
elected COO just days following his refusal to testify.
   In March, after being formally advised that the company was being
investigated by the U.S. Attorney's office, the board authorized an
internal investigation by independent counsel. The board was subsequently
informed that independent counsel was unable to interview either Singer
brother. The investigation did reveal, however, that Gary Singer had
diverted $600,000 in trading profits from the company to personal and
family accounts.8
   The government investigation continued, and in May charges were filed
against the two men who participated in the front-running scheme with Gary
and Steven Singer. In connection with his guilty plea, one of these men
identified Gary Singer as a co-conspirator. Although the board was aware of
these developments, it took no action in response. Subsequently, Steven
Singer caused the company to issue a press release in which the company
denied knowledge of any wrongdoing on the part of management. Although this
was clearly false, the board took no action.
   Until the end of May when he agreed to take a leave of absence, Gary
Singer continued in his capacity as CEO. Even after his departure, the
board approved the continuation of his pay and benefits and authorized the
relocation of his offices. The company issued a press release about his
leave of absence that included a denial by Singer that he had participated
in any illegal activity. This press release was also the first public
disclosure of Gary and Steven Singer's refusal to testify before the SEC or
to cooperate in the Company's internal investigation.
   During the late summer and fall of 1992, Gary and Steven Singer
continued to participate in the business of the company. Gary Singer
attended board meetings, was present at the company's headquarters, and
continued to have contact with the company's securities brokers. Steven
Singer was re-elected as COO in late July. It was not until November 1992
that the board finally determined that additional supervision of Steven
Singer was needed in light of his assertion of the Fifth Amendment in his
January testimony.
   The 21(a) Report
The SEC unsparingly criticized the board's failure to respond to the
allegations of the Singers' misconduct. As the Commission reported,
Cooper's board had an affirmative obligation to act; by not acting, it
failed to meet its duties. The Commission explained that it is
[e]ssential for board members to move aggressively to fulfill their
responsibilities to oversee the conduct and performance of management and
to ensure that the company's public statements are candid and complete.
   In this case, Cooper's Board failed to satisfy its obligations when
confronted with serious indications of management fraud. After the Board
learned that a member of senior management had concealed fraudulent
self-dealing transactions and thereby caused the company's outstanding
reports to be inaccurate, the Board failed to take immediate and effective
action to protect the interests of the company's investors. The Board's
inaction allowed a second corporate officer, who himself was allegedly
involved in the fraudulent front-running scheme, to direct the issuance of
a press release on behalf of the company falsely denying any knowledge of
wrongdoing. By failing to take immediate and decisive corrective action on
these matters, the Cooper Board appeared to prefer management's interest in
keeping the facts secret over the investors' interest in full, fair, and
accurate disclosure under the federal securities laws.9
   The consequence of the board's inaction was dramatic. By aligning
Cooper's interests with the Singers' fate, the board nullified its chances
of receiving lenient treatment from the government. Indeed, the indictment
of Cooper, in spite of its status as victim in one of Gary Singer's
schemes, can be traced directly to the board's failure to respond
appropriately to the allegations of employee misconduct.
GUTFREUND
The Failure to Respond
The facts relating to misconduct on the government trading desk at Salomon
Brothers in 1991 have been rehearsed thoroughly.10 The details of
management's failure to respond to that misconduct are particularly
instructive when considered along with the Cooper matter.
   In late April 1991, John H. Gutfreund, Thomas W. Strauss, and John W.
Meriwether, three members of Salomon's most senior management, learned that
Paul Mozer, the head of the firm's government trading desk, had submitted a
false bid in an auction of Treasury securities. Promptly upon learning of
the false bid, these three senior managers and Donald M. Feuerstein,
Salomon's chief legal officer, convened and discussed Mozer's misconduct.
They concluded that Mozer's misconduct should be reported to the
government. Nevertheless, they did not even discuss ``investigating what
Mozer had done disciplining him, or placing limits on his
activities.''11
   Salomon's supervisors compounded this failure by not acting on their
decision to self-report for more than three months. In the interim, Mozer
committed additional violations of the securities laws. In early July 1991,
Salomon retained outside counsel to investigate a separate allegation of
misconduct relating to the government trading desk. In the course of that
investigation, Feuerstein disclosed Mozer's earlier misconduct to counsel.
Thereafter, counsel widened its inquiry and uncovered additional
auction-related misconduct.
   In August 1991, four months after concluding that Mozer had engaged in
substantial misconduct, Salomon finally suspended Mozer and three others
and publicly disclosed that it had uncovered irregularities on its
government trading desk. Within days, Gutfreund, Strauss, Meriwether, and
Feuerstein resigned their positions.
The Commission's Criticism
The Securities Exchange Act imposes upon broker-dealers a specific duty to
supervise that does not explicitly apply to other public companies.12
Failure to meet supervisory obligations can serve as a basis for
sanctioning individuals as well as the broker-dealer itself. Gutfreund,
Strauss, and Meriwether each were sternly punished for their failure to
supervise.13
Although section 15 reaches only broker-dealers and the employees of
broker-dealers, it would be naive for any public company to ignore the
clear duty to respond set forth in Gutfreund:14
   The supervisory obligations imposed by the federal securities laws
require a vigorous response even to indications of wrongdoing. Many of the
Commission's cases involving a failure to supervise arise from situations
where supervisors were aware only of ``red flags'' or ``suggestions'' of
irregularity, rather than situations where, as here, supervisors were
explicitly informed of an illegal act.
   Even where the knowledge of supervisors is limited to ``red flags'' or
``suggestions'' of irregularity, they cannot discharge their supervisory
obligations simply by relying on the unverified representations of
employees. Instead, as the Commission has repeatedly emphasized, [t]here
must be adequate follow-up and review when a firm's own procedures detect
irregularities or unusual trading activity.'' Moreover, if more than one
supervisor is involved in considering the actions to be taken in response
to possible misconduct, there must be clear definition of the efforts to be
taken and a clear assignment of those responsibilities to specific
individuals within the firm.
   In Gutfreund, the Commission upbraided Salomon's managers for their
failure to investigate responsibly ``what had occurred and whether there
had been other instances of unreported misconduct.'' Until that inquiry was
complete, Salomon should have increased supervision of Mozer and
appropriately limited his activities.
   Another precedent, In the Matter of the Boston Company, Inc., provides a
stark and encouraging contrast to the results in Gutfreund. There the
Commission lightly sanctioned Boston Co.'s management because, in the
Commission's view, it had met its obligations under the duty to respond. As
set forth in the Commission's report, Boston Co. used improper accounting
practices and, as a result, overstated its income by $44 million for the
first three quarters of 1988. As a result, Boston Co.'s parent, Shearson
Lehman Brothers, overstated its income for the same period.15
A portion of the overstatement resulted from the improper characterization
of certain income and expenses, done at the direction of ``certain''
company officers. Citing the exemplary response of management from both
companies, including the firing of Boston Co.'s CEO, the institution of
internal controls, and cooperation with the SEC, the Commission issued a
simple ``cease and desist'' order against Boston Co. and took no action
against Shearson.16 According to one news report of the settlement, the
Commission chose leniency over the stiffer sanctions recommended by its
enforcement staff because of management's response upon the discovery of
misconduct.
THE DUTY TO RESPOND
With the Cooper and Gutfreund cases, the Commission has imposed upon the
senior managers of public companies the obligation to ``take immediate and
decisive corrective action'' when ``confronted with serious indications of
management fraud.'' In practice, this duty to respond requires that, upon
learning of allegations of misconduct, management and the board (i)
investigate the allegations to determine whether they are substantial, (ii)
take steps to deter repetition of any misconduct, and (iii) if warranted,
sanction the employees involved.
   This duty does not necessarily require that a company report its
findings to the government,17 although such a duty may arise from another
source.18 Alternatively, the company may also determine that the benefits
of self-reporting exceed the almost certain costs.19
In sum, Cooper and Gutfreund should be read to impose a duty to act rather
than wait for government reaction. The company is obligated to investigate,
make a determination, and act based on that determination. It is important
to note that the duty to respond is not an obligation to accede to every
government allegation of misconduct. Rather, the duty is met when
management can answer a regulator's questions by stating, ``We responsibly
investigated the alleged misconduct and took the actions that we deemed
appropriate based upon that responsible investigation.''20
Meaningful Investigation
When management reasonably suspects that an employee has engaged in
misconduct that has brought a benefit to the company, the company should
conduct a meaningful investigation of the misconduct. The scope of a
meaningful investigation differs with the situation, but it always includes
two steps. The company must first review relevant company documents and
then interview current employees with access to relevant information. If
these two steps are not completed, company management will have failed in
its duty to respond and both management and the company will face increased
jeopardy of being charged.
   A meaningful investigation can be completed by internal counsel,
accounting, business, or compliance personnel. Conducting a review
internally does raise certain risks, however. A review conducted by
non-legal personnel will not be protected from discovery by the
attorney-client privilege.21 Similarly, review should never be conducted by
personnel who had even tangential connection to the conduct under review.
Where an employee is both a fact witness and an investigator, the
likelihood that the results of the internal investigation will be disclosed
increases greatly.22 At the same time, internal counsel may not have
sufficient perspective to conduct an arm's-length review and the friction
generated by an internal inquiry can limit the ability of internal counsel
to conduct his or her day-to-day advisory duties.
   No hard and fast rule governs whether and when employees should be
invited to retain their own counsel.23 Typically, independent employee
counsel is not used at the beginning of an investigation. At such an early
stage, the company does not know whether the employee's interests have
diverged from the company's. The employee must be fully informed, however,
that counsel is representing the company, not him or her personally.24 The
investigating counsel should specifically advise the employee that the
results of his or her interview will be used in the company's best
interests and that the company controls the use of interview notes or
memoranda. Such use may include disclosure to the government if the company
later determines to waive its own privilege.
   Separate representation is advisable when and if the employee's
interests are no longer co-extensive with the company's. A strong employee
defense benefits the company since the company may be vicariously liable
for the employee's wrongful conduct.25 By retaining separate employee
counsel, a company can present a separate face to an investigating
regulator or prosecutor. For example, if the company chooses to adopt a
conciliatory posture, employee counsel will be able to defend aggressively
a position that company counsel could not advocate. Finally, internal
inquiries strain company morale. Some of that strain may be mitigated if
employees perceive that the company will support their separate defense.
   Regardless of whether the company provides employee defense,
management's primary obligation is to ensure that employees central to the
inquiry are interviewed. The employee, no matter what his or her level of
management, cannot be permitted to refuse to speak with the company's
investigators. As the Cooper matter makes clear, failure to interview the
central subjects in an internal inquiry results in the unification of
interests -- and outcomes -- for the company and the individual.26 Where
the employee did not act wrongfully, such an identity of interests is
appropriate; where the employee did act wrongfully, the company must
separate its interests from the individual's. The only way a company can
make that evaluation is by learning the facts. A company that must concede
to a regulator or prosecutor that it failed to interview the central
subject has forfeited its ability to argue compellingly that it should be
viewed differently from an errant employee.
   Ultimately, the company's obligation is to inquire into a situation
thoroughly enough to determine whether wrongful conduct occurred. Cooper
stands for the proposition that a company is obliged to reach its own
independent conclusions and act based upon those conclusions rather than
postpone that responsibility by waiting for a regulator, prosecutor, or
court to reach judgment.27 A regulator expects the company to accept the
responsibility of supervising employee conduct rather than demurring and
relying upon government action.28
Ensuring That It Will Not Happen Again
The Gutfreund matter likely would have been more containable had management
promptly inquired into Mozer's prior conduct upon first learning of the
false bid. Instead, the company's exposure increased dramatically when
misconduct on the treasury desk repeated itself after management's initial
discovery. In effect, Salomon lost its ability to argue convincingly that
it had been deceived by its own employee. By failing to take corrective
steps, management allowed misconduct to happen on management's watch.29
A company discovering employee misconduct must act to ensure that such
misconduct will not happen again. Often corrective steps may involve no
more than increased supervision. Pre-clearing employee activity by an
immediate supervisor frequently fulfills this need.
   On occasion, more is required. Counsel may recommend that new business
or compliance policies be adopted. The company may determine during the
course of its investigation that it wants to change the way it pursues a
particular business or exit that business entirely. Particularly where
class action or shareholder suits loom a company may determine that
business practices should change.
Internal Sanctions
The internal review may reveal that the employee has acted wrongfully. The
company must act on this information. In the most extreme circumstances, an
employee may have to be terminated and/or reported to a regulator. More
often, the appropriate sanction will be a change in job responsibilities or
title or a reduction in bonus or some other economic penalty.
   By acting decisively, the company not only strengthens its argument that
it should be judged separately from the employee, it also gains credibility
in the government's investigative process. By appropriately sanctioning an
employee who has acted wrongfully, the company bolsters its ability to
argue that another employee acted correctly. The company in effect
validates its vote on the conduct of the employees it will aggressively
defend.
   Companies in a regulated industry engage in a constant dialogue with
their regulators. How a company acts in one circumstance will condition the
regulator's expectation in the next. A company that is not perceived as
accepting the responsibility of self-regulation will have difficulty
convincing the government that its fate should be considered separately
from the fate of the employee in trouble.

26. Whether an employee asserts a privilege before a regulator or grand
jury is a separate issue. For the company to evaluate its position
meaningfully, it must have access to the employee and his or her
information. How the employee defends personally is an issue for the

ASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUES IN REAL ESTATE SECURITIZATIONS

By:
Karsten P. Giesecke and Michael Ready Treanor, Jr.*

The volume of new issuances of commercial (including multifamily)
mortgage-backed securities (``CMBSs'') has grown at a tremendous pace since
1991, and significantly more CMBSs are likely to be issued in the future.
For example, only two percent of non-multifamily commercial mortgage loans
have been securitized.1 Much of this increased CMBS volume has been in the
form of registered public offerings, even though public offerings of CMBSs
implicate co-registration and disclosure issues not present in traditional
mortgage or asset-backed transactions. Disclosure issues arise in a CMBS
transaction largely due to the economic significance of individual mortgage
loans that back a CMBS. In particular, where individual mortgage loans or a
group of related mortgage loans constitute a significant portion of the
assets underlying a CMBS offering, borrowers or other parties may be
required to sign the registration statement as ``co-issuers,'' or the user
may be required to provide financial disclosure regarding the borrowers or
the properties backing such a CMBS. This article will discuss the current
rules governing co-issuer registration and financial disclosure applicable
to registered CMBS offerings.
COMMERCIAL OR MULTIFAMILY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES
Mortgage-backed securities are securities backed by one or more mortgage
loans in a structure designed to protect investors from credit risks (other
than those associated with the underlying mortgage loans), particularly
against claims by creditors of the issuer or sponsor of the transaction.
Such securities can therefore be rated based on anticipated cash flows
from, and credit risks associated with, such mortgage loans.
   Registration of public mortgage-backed securities may be accomplished
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), by filing
a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
``Commission''), usually using either form S-11 or form S-3. Form S-11 may
be used for the registration of securities of certain real estate companies
and is available for the issuance of either (i) securities issued by real
estate investment trusts, or (ii) securities issued by issuers whose
primary business is that of acquiring, and holding for investment, real
estate or interests in real estate or interests in other issuers whose
business is investing in real estate.2 Since amendments made to form S-3 as
announced in the Commission's Rel. No. 33-6964 (1992) (the ``Asset-Backed
Shelf Release''), form S-3 is available to, among others, issuers of
``asset-backed securities'' that are offered for cash and which are
``investment grade.''3 Unlike form S-11, form S-3 permits the issuer to
incorporate by reference reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the ``1934 Act''). Only issuers using form S-3 have the
additional benefit of the no-action position of the staff of the
Commission's Division of Corporation Finance (the ``Staff''), which permits
delivery of certain computational materials and collateral information
before delivery of a final prospectus.4 Registrants using both form S-3
and form S-11 may also be able to offer securities on a delayed basis
pursuant to the Commission's 1933 Act rule 415.5
   Mortgage loans backing traditional single-family residential
mortgage-backed securities generally contain large numbers of homogeneous
mortgage loans, thereby rendering each individual mortgage loan
statistically insignificant and allowing rating agencies to rate a
transaction based on a statistical analysis of the pool as a whole. The
Commission similarly has concluded that, for traditional single-family
residential mortgage-backed securities, financial information concerning
the related borrowers is unimportant to the investment decision.6 In
contrast, because the initial principal balance of a typical commercial or
multifamily mortgage loan is much higher than the principal balance of the
individual obligations backing other securitizations of pooled assets, CMBS
pools often include fewer mortgage loans, with each individual asset
representing a larger percentage of the pool (an ``asset
concentration'').7
   The Commission has identified two principal consequences of asset
concentration. First, the Commission has indicated that ``asset-backed
offerings with significant asset concentration may involve one or more
co-issuers under Securities Act Rule 140.'' In addition, the Commission has
indicated that ``if a significant amount of the asset pool represents the
obligations of a single obligor or related obligors, financial information
and other disclosure about the obligor(s) may be required.''
   In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release the staff declined expressly to
identify asset concentration limits, indicating instead that existing
disclosure rules would continue to apply. The Staff has since settled on
three key concentration levels as being important. A mortgage loan
representing 45 percent of a pool triggers co-issuer requirements, a
mortgage loan representing over 20 percent of a pool triggers requirements
to file full audited property-level financial statements, and a mortgage
loan representing over 10 percent of a pool triggers requirements for
condensed unaudited property-level financial statements.
CO-REGISTRATION AND RULE 140
The Asset-Backed Shelf Release stated that securities backed by the assets
of a single obligor or group of related obligors are not ``asset-backed
securities'' for purposes of the new form S-3 rules.8 As a result, an
issuer relying on characterization of its securities as ``asset-backed
securities'' to make such securities eligible for form S-3 and shelf
registration under rule 4159 must involve at least two obligors or groups
of related obligors.10
Of greater significance than the prohibition against shelf registration for
single obligor pools is the requirement that, where significant asset
concentration exists, one or more borrowers with respect to the underlying
mortgage loans may be required to co-register the issuance of the
securities.11 Rule 140 of the 1933 Act provides that:
[a] person, the chief part of whose business consists of the purchase of
the securities of one issuer, or of two or more affiliated issuers, and the
sale of its own securities ... is to be regarded as engaged in the
distribution of the securities of such issuer or affiliated issuers within
the meaning of Section 2(11) of the [1933 Act]. [emphasis added]
   In simpler terms, rule 140 provides that when an issuer of a security
(the ``Delivered Security'') uses the proceeds of the sale of the Delivered
Security to acquire securities of another issuer (the ``Underlying
Security'') from such issuer, the issuer of the Delivered Security is also
deemed to be engaged in a distribution of the Underlying Security.
Accordingly, the Underlying Security is also being publicly offered and the
``issuer'' of the Delivered Security, who is deemed to be directly
accessing the capital markets, must sign the related registration statement
as a registrant in the public offering of the Delivered Security. The view
of the Staff that rule 140 is applicable in the context of a commercial
mortgage loan-backed securitization suggests that the Staff views mortgage
loans (including those providing for recourse only against the mortgaged
property) as securities requiring registration if sold in a public
offering.12
   In order to determine the applicability of rule 140 to a particular
securitization, it is necessary to determine whether the ``chief part'' of
the business of the issuer of the Delivered Security is the purchase of
Underlying Securities of a single obligor or related obligors. The Staff
has taken the position that where obligations backing securities include
the obligations of a single obligor or related obligors constituting at
least 45 percent of the mortgage loan pool backing such securities, rule
140 is implicated and such obligor or related obligors must co-register.
   Rule 140 has generally been viewed as applying only where a person
purchases securities from an issuer, and therefore, would not apply where
mortgage loans made to a non-affiliate are acquired in the secondary market
and not from the borrower. In addition, there have been indications from
the Staff that it is reconsidering the inapplicability of rule 140 to such
secondary market purchases and may expand its breadth.13 In the context of
commercial mortgage securitization, the Staff has taken a broader position,
to the effect that rule 140 applies if the issuer of the Underlying
Security financially benefits from the securitization (as a result of which
the issuer of the Delivered Security may have leverage to require the
involvement of the issuer of the Underlying Security in the offering of the
Delivered Security). In such cases, it is appropriate to determine whether
``significant involvement'' exists based on the individual facts and
circumstances presented.
   Where co-registration is required, securities which might have been
eligible for issuance under rule 415 of the 1933 Act on a delayed or
continuous basis (i.e., a shelf registration) will now, as a practical
matter, be required to be registered on a separate registration statement
(i.e., on a one-off basis) because of the need to include the related
obligor as a co-registrant.14 This has the effect of increasing the costs
associated with a CMBS transaction by requiring the preparation of a full
registration statement for each new issue. In addition to the time and
expense of issuing securities on a one-off basis, forcing an obligor to
co-register means that the obligor will be liable as an issuer under the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act and may become subject to the reporting
requirements of the 1934 Act.15
   In addition, the co-registration concentration levels trigger issuer
financial statement disclosure requirements with respect to the obligor of
the Underlying Security. Under regulation S-X, sections 3-01 and 3-02, the
borrower's financial statements must be included in the disclosure to
potential securityholders. Regulation S-X, section 3-01 requires each
registrant to file a consolidated audited balance sheet as of the end of
each of the two most recent fiscal years or, if the registrant has been in
existence for less than one fiscal year, as of a date within 135 days of
the date of filing the registration statement.16 Furthermore, section 3-02
requires the registrant to file a consolidated audited statement ``of
income and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years preceding the date
of the most recent audited balance sheet being filed or such shorter period
as the registrant (including predecessors) has been in existence.''17 For
filings made more than 134 days after the end of the fiscal year, an
unaudited interim balance sheet and a corresponding statement of income and
cash flows must be provided.18
   In a typical CMBS securitization, the mortgagor is often a newly-created
special purpose entity which has as its sole asset the ownership of the
underlying real property, and, accordingly, it might be expected that the
mortgagor's financial statements only cover a short period of time. The
requirement of section 3-02 that the registrant's statement of income and
cash flows include predecessor businesses may, however, create significant
difficulty if mortgage loan borrower financial statements are required.
Since the special purpose vehicle may be considered a successor to the
earlier business from which it acquired the property, financial statements
of such predecessor business may be required. Such predecessor financial
statements may not be readily obtainable. Section 3-05 of regulation S-X
addresses predecessor business financial disclosure and indicates that a
determination of whether a business has been acquired is to be made with
reference to the guidance set forth in regulations S-X, section 11-01(d).
Under section 11-01(d), an acquisition of a business occurs when, in light
of the facts and circumstances involved, ``there is sufficient continuity
of the acquired entity's operations prior to and after the transactions so
that disclosure of prior financial information is material to an
understanding of future operations.''19 Such continuity is more likely to
be viewed as present if the special purpose vehicle is related to the prior
obligor. To resolve predecessor business issues, it is likely that a
discussion with the Chief Accountant's Office of the Commission would be
appropriate.
PROPERTY-LEVEL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
As previously indicated, in instances where sufficient asset concentration
exists, the Commission requires disclosure of financial information
concerning the specific assets constituting the pool.
   The Staff has taken the position that, in the event that a single
mortgage loan exceeds 20 percent of the pool, audited financial statements
with respect to the property, as described in sections 3-01 and 3-02 of
regulation S-X, are required. As described above, sections 3-01 and 3-02
generally require audited balance sheets for the two most recent fiscal
years and audited income statements and statements of cash flows for the
three fiscal years preceding the date of the most recent audited balance
sheet being filed. In addition, for filings made after 134 days subsequent
to the most recent fiscal year, a balance sheet as of an interim date
within 135 days of the date of filing together with a related interim
statement of income and cash flows, which in each case may be unaudited,
must be provided. Staff Accounting Bulletins 71 and 71A (``SAB 71/71A'')
state that where ``the amount of a loan exceeds 20 percent of the amount in
good faith expected to be raised in the offering, disclosure would be
expected to consist of financial statements for the underlying operating
properties for the periods contemplated by rule 3-14,''20 which indicates
that, for acquired properties, financial statements are for shorter
periods. Rule 3-14 does not apply in the case of acquired businesses,
however, as to which rule 3-01 and 3-02 financials (including as required
for predecessor businesses) must be included. In many cases (including in
particular where the acquired assets are in the form of a business, such as
hotel or nursing home loans), the Staff has viewed acquired mortgage loans
as acquired businesses.
   The Staff has taken the position that ``condensed'' financial
information should be provided as to assets that constitute more than 10
percent but not more than 20 percent of the entire pool.21 Condensed
financial information is financial information generally presented in
accordance with article X of regulation S-X and generally consists of
consolidated unaudited statements similar to those required in a form 10-Q
filing under the 1934 Act.
ADDITIONAL ASSET CONCENTRATION ISSUES
While the Staff's position with respect to asset concentration provides
guidance to CMBS issuers, it leaves unresolved many issues regarding
exactly what constitutes asset concentration. In particular, in what
instances do the relationships between borrowers, cross-collateralization,
common tenants, or other common features between mortgage loans result in
such mortgage loans being treated as a single mortgage loan for the
foregoing analysis, or result in the underlying borrowers being treated as
a single borrower? The analysis is a factual one resolved on a case-by-case
basis, generally after prior consultation with the Staff. Nevertheless,
certain guidelines are available.
   In the instance of a pool consisting of fully cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted mortgage loans securing the debt of unrelated obligors, the
Staff has indicated that such a pool would be treated as a single loan
subject to the 10 percent or 20 percent financial reporting standards, as
appropriate, even though the individual obligors may be completely
unrelated.22 In addition, the underlying borrowers are generally regarded
by the Staff as a single borrower under the assumption that they are acting
in concert. This may not be the case where it can be proven that the
unrelated obligors have voluntarily cross-collateralized and
cross-defaulted without the expectation of a pecuniary or other benefit,
which would seem to be an exceedingly rare situation.
   In addition to obligor-based asset concentration, other types of
concentration may trigger the need for additional financial disclosure. In
the event that there is a concentration of tenants, financial statements
for such tenants may be required,23 although it is unclear at what level of
concentration such financial statements will be required, and, if required,
the nature of such financial statements (i.e., audited or condensed).24
Furthermore, in the event of a concentration of managers, the Staff has
indicated that it may require financial statements for such managers
because of a perception that the bankruptcy of a significant manager could
affect securityholders.25

Reg. (Sept. 14, 1994.)
2. See General Instructions to form S-11.
3. ``Asset-backed securities'' include qualifying mortgage-backed
securities (including commercial mortgage-backed securities). ``Investment
grade'' means that at the time of the sale to the public, the securities
are rated by at least one nationally recognized statistical rating
organization in one of its generic rating categories signifying investment
grade (typically one of the four highest categories). Form S-3 is also
generically available to large, widely-held issuers, to subsidiaries of
such companies, and for securities guaranteed by such companies. See
General Instructions to form S-3.
4. Because mortgage-backed securities are frequently not structured (and
therefore a final prospectus cannot be printed) until after certain
institutional investors have decided on their particular requirements after
receipt of certain information, the Staff has permitted delivery by
registrants of asset-backed securities on form S-3 of certain computational
materials and collateral information prior to the delivery of a final
prospectus. See Kidder, Peabody Acceptance Corporation I (avail. May 20,
1994); Public Securities Association (avail. May 27, 1994).
5. Rule 415 or, as it is commonly referred to, the ``shelf rule'', permits
certain securities to be offered on a delayed or continuous basis, thereby
avoiding the necessity of preparing a new registration statement for each
offering, and thus greatly speeding up the time required to issue new
securities and reducing related costs. Rule 415 is available to offerings
which ``qualify'' for form S-3 and, therefore, in the event an offering
``qualifies'' for form S-3, the offering may be registered under another
form (such as form S-1 or form S-11) and still offer securities ``off the
shelf''. Rule 415 is also available for ``mortgage-related securities,''
which include certain securities rated in one of the two highest rating
categories by a nationally recognized statistical rating agency and which
are backed by qualifying residential mortgage loans.
6. The Commission indicated in the Asset-Backed Shelf Release that in a
situation where asset-backed securities are secured ``by a pool of
financial assets representing obligations of a large number of obligors ...
the information about the financial condition of any one obligor is not
important to an investment decision.''
7. Larger pools of commercial or multifamily mortgage loans may avoid
asset concentration issues. This is particularly true for ``conduit''
programs providing for acquisition of mortgage loans from multiple sources
which, as part of the program parameters, limit the size of mortgage loans
specifically to avoid asset concentration concerns.
8. Id. at page 22 ``... the definition does not encompass securities
issued in structured financings for one obligor or related group of
obligors''. See also Rel. No. 33-6943 (notice of proposed rulemaking) at 25
(``Structured financings would not be considered asset-backed securities
for the purposes of the proposed revisions to form S-3 where a substantial
portion of the underlying assets are originated by one obligor (including
affiliated entities).'')
9. Single-loan multifamily mortgage-backed securities may still be
eligible for shelf registration if they constitute ``mortgage-related
securities'' as used in rule 415.
10. As described below, unless the underlying mortgage loans were acquired
in secondary market purchases so that rule 140 would not apply, or
co-registrants are already included in the shelf registration statement, as
a practical matter at least three obligors or groups of obligors would be
required.
11. In the Asset-Backed Shelf Release, the Staff stated that, in instances
where there is significant asset concentration, such an asset-backed
offering ``may involve one or more co-issuers under rule 140.''
12. But see Bob Reves, et al. v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56 (1990).
13. Although open-market purchases of commercial mortgage loans may not
trigger rule 140 (assuming no involvement at all by the obligors under such
loans in the new offering and regardless of the existence of asset
concentration with respect to the mortgage loans), they could potentially
trigger the requirement for property-level financial statements in the
event that mortgage loans of a single obligor or group of related obligors
exceed the 10% or 20% thresholds described below.
14. The Staff has taken the position that the amendment of a shelf
registration statement so as to add or change a co-registrant is not
permissible.
15. But see Linpro Income Fund I Partnership (avail. Nov. 29, 1986) and
Rockefeller Center Properties & RCP Associates (avail Jan. 2, 1986)
(co-registrant not required to file 1934 Act reports). Furthermore, this
article does not attempt to address the potential applicability of the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to the mortgage notes insofar as they are
considered debt securities by the Commission.
16. Reg. 210.3-01(a).
17. Reg. 210.3-03(a).
18. Regs. 210.3-01(e), 210.3-02(b).
19. Reg. 210.11-01(d). Additional factors are also included such as
whether the nature of the revenue-producing activity will remain
essentially the same as before the transaction and whether certain
enumerated attributes such as physical facilities, sales force, and trade
names (to name a few) will remain in place after the transaction.
20. SAB 71, interpretive response to Question 1.
21. Comments of Linda Quinn, Director of the Division of Corporate
Finance, at the ABA Annual Meeting on August 9-10, 1994. The requirement to
provide condensed financial information is not based on any published
position of the Commission. Indeed there is some authority indicating that
audited financial statements would be required, at least with respect to
investment-type arrangements. In the Staff Accounting Bulletins, Topic 1 --
Financial Statements, I. Financial Statements of Properties Securing
Mortgage Loans, the Staff indicated that ``separate audited financial
statements should be provided for any investment-type arrangement that
constitutes 10% or more of the greater of (i) the amount of minimum
proceeds, or (ii) the total assets of the registrant, including the amount
of proceeds raised'' and this language has been cited by the Staff in
support of its asset concentration thresholds. Of course, the Commission
bases its standards only in part on the Staff Accounting Bulletins, as the
interpretive responses in Topic 1 were not specifically drafted for CMBS
transactions.
22. Such an analysis would create the result that audited property level
financial statements should be included on an aggregate basis. Such
financial statements, however, are not always available and the exact
nature of financial disclosure must generally be resolved in discussions
with the Staff.
23. Unlike the requirement for obligor financials which, in a non-recourse
transaction, is of nominal investor interest, financial information
concerning major tenants appears to be of significant investor interest as
the availability of funds to pay securityholders will depend on the
timeliness of the lease payments by major tenants.
24. The Staff has indicated that, in cases where there is tenant
concentration but the tenant is not involved in the offering (and,
accordingly, audited financial statements, and related auditors' consents,
cannot be obtained), the transaction may still proceed as a registered
public offering provided that the tenant is a publicly reporting company
and its public filings (including audited financial statements) can be
referenced in the prospectus.
25. This view is mitigated by provisions in the relevant documents which
provide for replacement of the manager and the use of a lockbox or other
mechanism to protect the cash flow from creditors of the manager.

ADMINISTRATION SEEKS REPEAL OF KEY AUDITING REQUIREMENTS
IBAA Pushes Reforms

In response to banking industry pressure, the Bush
administration is drafting legislation that would undo several key
auditing and regulatory requirements contained in the 1991 Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA).
     If submitted, the bill could set the stage for a
heated fight pitting the administration against congressional
Democrats and Republicans who feel the requirements are necessary to
protect federal deposit insurance funds.
     The proposal, requested by the Independent Bankers
Association of America (IBAA), would repeal a FDICIA provision
requiring outside ratios of market value to book value for publicly
traded bank and thrift stocks.
      Permit rural financial institutions with less than
$100 million in assets to self-certify their compliance with the
Community Reinvestment Act.
      Allow regulators to grant all institutions CRA
credit for making loans to depressed areas that are outside an
institutions delineated community.
      Clarify that the standards for safety and soundness
mandated by the FDICIA do not require micro-management of
institutions management and operations.
      Repeal the small business and small farm reporting
requirements imposed by the FDICIA.
      Postpone for a year the truth-in-savings provision
of the FDICIA.
      Specify that the FDICIAs aggregate lending limit
exceptions for insider loans would also apply to loans secured by
Treasury obligations.
      Repeal a FDICIA provision requiring regulatory
agencies to establish detailed compensation standards for officers,
directors and employees of healthy institutions.
      Require regulators to demonstrate immediate and
irreparable harm before seizing or freezing assets in advance of an
administrative law judge hearing of accused institution officers,
directors and outside professionals.
     According to the IBAA, the above amendments actually
constitute a scaled-back list of regulatory reforms the
administration feels it can implement this year if a majority in the
banking and insurance industries agree to a broader legislative
package on interstate banking liberalization. That package includes
substantial home office protection for banks and thrifts in smaller
communities, reauthorization of insurance sales by community banks in
towns of less than 5,000 people and limitations on court-sanctioned
insurance underwriting and sales by the nations largest banks.
     Interestingly enough, a bill that would mandate some
of the FDICIA reforms sought by the administration and the IBAA has
been introduced by Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan.
     Doles legislation would exempt institutions with
under $100 million in assets from CRA requirements if they are
located in towns with populations of 20,000 or less. It also would
provide a CRA safe harbor for institutions with assets of $300
million or less, if they have satisfactory CRA ratings.
     The bill would require banking regulators to
coordinate their actions to ensure consistency and uniformity of
standards.
     It would clarify that regulators are empowered to set
levels below which certified or licensed appraisers are not required
to perform appraisals.
     Moreover, the measure would require regulators to
perform an economic impact analysis on any rule that affects more
than 20% of all small institutions.
     In addition to the reforms, Doles legislation would
impose a 15-month moratorium on Office of Thrift Supervision approval
of any interstate branching applications by federal associations
submitted under a rule that became effective last month.
     The IBAA opposes the regulation, fearing that it
could prompt large banks to seek interstate branching equity in the
federal courts.

IRS DEBT RESERVE PROPOSAL SETS OFF THRIFT OBJECTIONS

An Internal Revenue Service proposal to tighten the
tax requirements on bad debt reserves of savings and loan
associations has triggered loud protests from the thrift industry.
     The tempest was ignited by an IRS plan to require
S&Ls immediately to recapture into income their bad debt reserves
when they change to a commercial bank charter or when they diversify
and their home mortgage-related assets decline below 60% of their
total assets.
     In other words, the entire amount of bad debt
reserves would have to be included immediately in an institutions
taxable income instead of being capitalized over the life of the
troubled debt portfolio involved.
     Under the IRS revision, thrifts that switch charters
or flunk the IRS version of the thrift lender test would be
confronted with a much harsher tax schedule than commercial banks,
one that would place them at a competitive disadvantage, the S&L
industry argues.
     Moreover, it would prevent thrifts from expanding
their services more fully to meet the needs of their customers,
contends the Savings & Community Bankers of America (SCBA), a new
trade group formed by the merger of the U.S. League of Savings
Institutions and the National Council of Community Bankers. The SCBA
contends that the IRS regulation would thwart the Treasury
Departments broader efforts to modernize the banking industry and
permit savings institutions to offer a wider array of products and
services. Asserting that there is no statutory language authorizing
IRS to alter the existing bad debt reserve formula, the SCBA
recommends that the agency withdraw its proposed rule.
     IRS set procedures for bad debt reserve recapture
after commercial banks were compelled to recapture their reserves in
accordance with the 1986 Tax Reform Act. The new procedures permitted
banks to pay the tax over the life of the loan portfolio to which the
reserve applied.
     For thrifts, however, the agency is proposing, in
effect, a more rapid bad debt reserve repayment schedule if they
change charters or fail the IRS version of the thrift lender test.
     During a hearing before IRS this week, Abraham Ossip,
an SCBA representative, warned that the proposal would generate a
severe problem for institutions with large reserves built up between
1950 and 1980, when Congress gave thrifts an incentive for a
commitment to home mortgage lending by authorizing large additions to
the bad debt reserve.
     Ossip, corporate tax director for the Dime Savings
Bank in New York, maintained that existing IRS regulations strongly
indicate that savings institutions should be allowed to switch
commercial bank charters without tax penalty as long as they remain
committed to residential lending.
     In a lengthy supporting document filed with IRS, SCBA
analysts point out that a distinguishing difference between the
reserves of banks and thrifts is that thrifts historically were
permitted much larger reserve additions with respect to their
qualifying loansprincipally residential mortgage loans.
     The reserve additions to the qualifying reserve bore
no relationship to any anticipation of actual loan losses when
computed as a percentage of taxable income, the trade group
emphasizes. This percentage, which could have been as high as 100% of
taxable income at the inception of thrift taxability, was gradually
phased down until the 1986 Tax Reform Act set the current percentage
at 8% of taxable income.
     This statutory requirement, designed to safeguard the
capital levels of thrifts, created a standard of qualifying levels
for historically profitable S&ls that was far in excess of that which
would have been established using the bank reserve method, the SCBA
notes.

FASBS NEW UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES PROJECT DEALS WITH ISSUE OF
JOINT VENTURE FINANCING

The Financial Accounting Standards Board is studying
whether to require companies that enter into a joint venture to book
debt used to finance part of the venture.
     The FASB proposal would change current practice,
which requires that such debt be treated as an off-balance-sheet
financing.
     The proposed change would be in line with the views
of regulators, who think this item should appear on companies books.
Failure to disclose the liability could mislead users regarding the
true financial condition of the company, banking regulators argue.
     The project is part of a broader attempt by FASB to
develop accounting and reporting standards for affiliated entities,
an area that is being watched closely by bank regulators.
     The Board will discuss the diverse accounting methods
used by various industries,including international accounting
standards, for joint ventures on June 16, according to FASB Project
Manager Ron Lott. In addition, FASB staff will present case studies
that show current inconsistencies and the problems they spawn, he
says.
     Banks and thrifts that establish joint ventures with
other entitiesa real estate developer, for examplewould be included
in the scope of the project. Some banks have joint ventures in data
processing.
     But initially, the Board will avoid using the term
joint venture because it means different things to different people,
says Lott. The Board will try first to develop a uniform standard
without making distinctions between types of joint ventures. If that
doesnt work, then the Board may be forced to come up with a formal
definition of joint venture.
     Commonly, people think of joint venture as being an
investment by two people, each owning an equal amount and exercising
joint control over the investment, Lott says. This is typical in a
situation involving real estate.
     According to Lott, the absence of any clear standard
for reporting joint ventures has led industries to use varying
methods. For instance, one company used three methodsequity method,
proportionate consolidation and costin accounting for various joint
ventures.
     And those are just three methods I could name off the
top of my head. There may be other methods without names, Lott says.
     Current rules for consolidation require a 50%
ownership of a subsidiarys common stock. The equity method is used by
an investor who owns between 20% and 50% of the companys common
stock, although there are situations when an investor may use this
method even though more than 50% is owned. The cost method is used if
ownership is 20% or lessa stock investment that is required to be
marked to lower of cost or market.
     According to Lott, entities that fall between the 20%
to 50% range will fall within the scope of the joint venture project.
It affects anything not covered by either the consolidation standard
or the stock investment standard, says Lott.
     Other projects focusing on other aspects of the
consolidation issue also are under way. Two discussion memoranda are
out for comment: New Basis Accounting and Consolidation Policy and
Procedures. The Board decided to consider the need for and timing of
public hearings on both documents after comments, due by July 15,
1992, are received.
     The Board also has commissioned a research study on
disaggregated disclosures, which is expected to be completed later
this year.

INCIDENTS OF FRAUD BY INDUSTRY ACCOUNTANTS SHOW DISTURBING UPWARD
TREND, FBI SAYS

George Brooks
Fraud is on the rise at financial institutions
nationwide and the perpetrators are no longer from within the teller-
to-middle-management range, according to an FBI expert on fraud.
     Accounting staff committed 13% of about 150
embezzlements over $250,000 in institutions across California, for
example, Special Agent Robert DeMaria told accountants attending a
recent meeting of the Financial Managers Society in San Francisco. At
least 13% of the total dollar losses in the 350 cases of fraud
reported last year in the state wound up in accountants pockets.
     The FBIs profile of an embezzler is a person 33 years
of age who has been with a company at least five and a half years,
and with an average time on the job of more than three years. The
embezzlers work performance rating usually ranges from good to
excellent or outstanding.
     The potential embezzler is a highly desirable
employee, reliable, bright, motivated, and trustworthy, says DeMaria.
He or she is an achiever with high self-esteem, an independent worker
who is self-sufficient and has good self-control.
     The embezzler is married with children, optimistic,
empathetic, well-educated and has never been arrested. His or her
greatest fear is being found out by family and friends, DeMaria
concludes.
     Leading DeMarias list is collusion between insiders
and outsiders (39% of incidents, resulting in 32% of total losses),
followed by electronic data processing and support staff (19% of
incidents, resulting in 22% of total losses). Warehouse personnel
equalled accountants notoriety by committing 13% of reported fraud
but ended with less cash in their pockets7% of total losses.
Dishonest treasurers admitted to 7% of the incidents but walked away
with only 6% of the fraud-related losses in their pockets.
     Although the percentage of fraud being committed at
the executive level may appear small (9% of some 350 cases handled by
the FBI last year), the culprits accounted for 20% of the total
losses.
     Half of the fraud reported in California was
discovered by accidentthrough called-in tips, for exampleaccording to
DeMaria. Only 19% was uncovered by internal auditors, while
management controls snared only 10% of the perpetrators.
     DeMaria cites three reasons people commit fraud:
situational pressure, opportunities that create an environment for
fraud and personal characteristics that may drive a person to commit
fraud.
     Situational pressure could push somebody to embezzle
against or in behalf of a company, for example, falsely boosting a
companys revenues to impress stockholders and artificially inflate
stock prices, he says. We have several pending investigations in that
area.
     Other reasons include high personal debt, financial
loss, inadequate income, extravagant lifestyle, excessive gambling,
job frustration or inequity whether imagined or real and undue family
or community expectations.
     However, weak or dishonest management, or simply one
corporate manager calling the shots, also ranks as one of the major
causes of institutional fraud, DeMaria notes.
     In one case, DeMaria and his team arrested a 54-year-
old accountant for embezzling some $3.2 million from the bank where
she worked. During that time, the bank was under investigation by the
FBI for certain questionable deals that put it on the brink of
failure. Despite the presence of the agents, the accountant continued
to carry out her scam under their noses for nine months until her
arrest.
     Asked why she did it, she replied, For years, I have
watched (the owner) and his cronies go into his little office to
figure out how to plunder this institution. Very simply, I decided to
get my share before this thing collapsed.
     Like any good accountant, she kept records of every
illegal transaction management ever made. Her books led to the arrest
and conviction of 18 top management officials. For cooperating with
authorities, her jail time was reduced to 67 days.
     Some embezzlers do it for bizarre reasons, too. One
accountant was arrested by the FBI for embezzling $4,312.16. Puzzled
by the exactness of the amount, DeMaria asked the felon why he took
that specific amount.
     Attending conferences and speaking to colleagues who
were employed in companies similar to mine, I found out I was being
underpaid, he said. So I netted it all out and figured how much the
company owed me. Thats how much I took.
     Insiders who commit fraud are mostly first-time
offenders, 90% of whom are motivated by greed, says DeMaria.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Core Capital to Total Adjusted Assets Ratio (or leverage ratio).  The
proposal raises the core capital level for all but the strongest
thrifts from 3% to 4% and sometimes 5%. The agency is moving toward
required consistency with national bank requirements.
Undercapitalized S&Ls would be required to submit capital plans
within 60 days of finalization of the rule.
Federal Register, Friday, April 26, 1991.

Qualified Thrift Lender Test. The agency has passed a regulation
giving most savings and loan associations a two-year extension of
their existing QTL status. Meanwhile, Congress is considering
legislation that would liberalize the test.
Capital Plan and Compliance. OTS is considering allowing thrifts
operating under approved capital plans to be deemed in compliance
with capital standards.

Recourse. Proposal defines recourse, the acceptance of the risk of
any loss associated with owning an asset, the same way FFIEC does.
OTS would not use that definition to determine capital adequacy.
Comment ended May 16.

Allowable Dividend. The agency is considering a proposal to reduce
the amount a healthy thrift can pay in dividends to 75% of its net
income (based on the most recent four-quarter period).
Comment ended May 16.

Interest Rate Risk-Related Capital Requirements. The controversial
proposal has been temporarily tabled for further review. It requires
thrifts to assess the value of their portfolios subject to swings in
the interest rate of 200 basis points up or down. The rule would
require a thrift to calculate 50% of the greater loss in value, and
hold capital reserves against it.  No cap has been set on the amount
that could be required to be held in reserve. OTS has said it
probably will be 2% for most thrifts. The 2% cap could either be
added to the 8% reserve requirement held against credit risk, or it
could be part of the 8% reserve requirement with the credit risk
reserve requirement reduced to 6%.

Risk-based Capital. Weights assets based on risk and treats loans
sold with recourse as if not sold. The current focus is on a lower-
of-cost-or- market-value approach for purchased servicing. OTS issued
capital rule with tough treatment for REO and delinquent loans.

Interest rate risk component could be added to or incorporated into
the 8% rule. Early intervention and marginal capital options
proposals still to come. Compliance is required by Dec. 31, 1992.

Leverage Ratio. The core to total adjusted assets ratio  for state-
chartered nonmember banks that have been rated CAMEL 2 by examiners.
The capital to assets ratio (leverage) must now be 4% for banks that
fall into that classification. According to the FDIC some 7,500 state
nonmember banks and 500 savings banks will be affected by the rule
change.

SAIF to BIF Conversion Fees. The entrance fee paid when an insured
thrifts deposits are transferred to a bank or bank holding company
has been lowered by the board. The board voted to decrease the fee
from 54 cents per $100 of transferred deposits to 18 cents. The move
will primarily affect banks or holding companies purchasing thrifts
that have failed from government receiverships.

Use of Purchased Mortgage Servicing Rights in Capital. The FDIC has
set the limit on the amount of purchased mortgage servicing rights
that may be counted toward core capital at 50%. As much as 100% of
tangible capital may be composed of PMSR. The FDIC also removed a
six-year phase-in provision, replacing it with a grandfather clause.
All PMSR on the books as of Feb. 9, 1990, will be grandfathered and
gradually phased out.

FEDERAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS EXAMINATION COUNCIL

Loan Splitting.  The FFIEC  proposed guidelines for accounting when
Returning a Loan with a Partial Charge-off to Accrual Status appeared
to be going nowhere. They would have allowed thrifts and banks to
charge off nonaccruing portions of loans and return the performing
portion to accrual status. Letters received during the comment
period, however, were almost universally negative. Banks and thrifts
felt the types of loans that would qualify (in-substance foreclosed
loans were not to be eligible for splitting) would have been few and
the benefit of the proposal to institutions would have been minimal
at best. Both the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the AICPA
have expressed opinions that the proposal did not conform with
generally accepted accounting principles. Sources in the federal
regulatory agencies think the proposal will simply die.

Applications, Reports and Notices Submitted  by Thrift Holding
Companies (91-3051). OTS is proposing to streamline and simplify the
reporting requirements of S&L holding companies.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights. The SEC has asked the FASB to
clarify criteria for determining whether mortgage servicing sales
should be treated as sales or financing.

Financial Instruments: Debt Securities Held as Assets. The board is
discussing what instruments should be included in the scope of a
possible project addressing the use of market-value accounting for
investments in marketable debt securities and maybe other
instruments.

Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This proposed
interpretation of existing guidance  will clarify the circumstances
under which amounts recognized for forward contracts, interest rate
and currency swaps and similar contracts may be offset in the
statement of financial position and presented as a net amount. The
board has tentatively decided to let the proposal affect financial
statements issued for periods ending after Dec. 15, 1992.

Accounting for Inome Taxes. Tentatively, the board wants to end dual
criteria for recognition of deferred tax assets. Only a more likely
than not criterion would be required. It wants to put procedures in
place to measure a deferred tax asset or liability using a rate
convention and to determine whether a valuation allowance is
necessary. It wants to apply the classification convention used in

APB Opinion #11 and FAS #37 to the classification of deferred assets
or liabilities in a classified balance sheet. It wants to prohibit
methods of intercorporate tax allocation that are inconsistent with
the overall method of accounting for taxes. It wants deferred tax
liabilities and assets for a particular jurisdiction to be offset and
presented as one net current amount and one net noncurrent amount.
Also, it wants the amount of valuation allowances to be disclosed.

Accounting for Investments with Prepayment Options.  Board asked for
an exposure draft to be prepared by the staff on its tentative
conclusions. They are: in the case of such securities as ARMs,
changes caused by anticipated prepayments should be accounted for
with revised calculations of the periodic amortization and recognized
through a cumulative adjustment in the current period. The
prospective recognition of those effects (as allowed in Statement 91)
would be precluded; deferred servicing fees and purchased mortgage
servicing rights are not included in the project; no additional
disclosures are required for entities complying with guidance, but
they would be required to disclose circumstances in which prepayments
are being anticipated; transactions after Dec. 15, 1992,  would be
affected; retroactive application is urged.

Impairment of Assets and Present-value Based Measurement of
Accounting. Public hearings on the discussion memoranda, Accounting
for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable Intangibles
and Present-Value-Based Measurements in Accounting,were held Aug. 21-
23.

Interest Methods Project. Public hearings were held Aug. 21-23, 1991,
in New York.

PROPOSED IRS LOAN LOSS RECAPTURE RULE FOR S&LS HEAVILY CRITICIZED
BY TAX LAWYER

The following is excerpted from comments by Donald B.
Susswein, a tax partner at Thacher, Profitt & Wood in New York, at
the Internal Revenue Services June 5 public hearing on regulations
that would impose restrictive guidelines on loan loss reserve
recapture for savings and loans that convert to banks. First of two
excerpts.
     The IRS has taken the position in the proposed
regulations that the large bank reserve recapture timing rules of the
1986 Tax Reform Act apply to some large banks, but not to all large
banks. Large banks that were formerly thrifts are not eligible, in
the IRS view.
     As many others commentators have noted, this position
directly contradicts the position previously taken by the Treasury
Department in public testimony to the Congress on Oct. 26, 1989, and
also directly contradicts the interpretation given in the Joint
Committees General Explanation of the 1986 act.
     There is nothing wrong, of course, in a government
agency changing its position when it discovers that it has made a
mistake in interpreting the law.
     Where there is such a complete change from a
consistently held position, the IRS would appear to owe the public a
convincing explanation of the statutory basis for its change in
position. These regulations purport to interpret a statute. They are
not legislative regulations.
     The preamble skips over problems of statutory
language and construction, and goes directly to the IRS policy
concerns.
     Policy concerns alone, no matter how valid, are
irrelevant to the issue of statutory interpretation unless the
Service can first articulate a convincing case that the statute
itself is ambiguous. This has not yet been attempted.
     Even if ambiguity were subsequently demonstrated, the
Services stated policy concerns would not support its proposed
statutory interpretation. In addition, the IRS can actually address
its stated policy concerns much more effectively than the way
outlined in the proposed regulations.
     The core policy issue in this area seem to be Section
593(e).
     Under that provision, thrifts are subject to partial
recapture to the extent they distribute untaxed earnings accumulated
in their reserve balances.
     Once a large thrift becomes a large bankand begins
recapturing all of its reserves over a multi-year periodit is
apparently no longer subject to the partial recapture rules of
Section 593(e).
     The IRS does not like this result, and apparently
would have preferred that Congress maintain a continuing role for
Section 593(e).
     This policy argument is historically quite relevant
to the issue of congressional intent, since one of the options before
the Congress in 1985 was an approach to recapture that would have
similarly stressed the policy concerns underlying Section 593(e).
   The Joint Committee staff recommended an option under
which thrifts changing to the specific charge-off method would
automatically recapture only the bank portion of their reserves,
while the remainder would be subject to the continued application of
Section 593(e).
     The IRS apparently would have preferred this
approachsince it would have treated the bank portion the same way
bank reserves are treatedand it would treat the thrift or subsidy
portion in the way thrifts reasonably expected those reserves would
always be treatedi.e., recaptured if, and only if, they liquidated or
attempted to distribute untaxed amounts in their reserves to
shareholders.
     There is much to be said for this approach as a
policy matter. I suspect that many in the thrift industry might agree
that it would have been wiser had the Congress adopted this Joint
Committee approach to the timing of recapture, rather than the
elective cut-off method.
     But the IRS is purporting to make a statutory
construction argument, not a pure policy argument. In that regard,
there is a world of difference between Congress making an unwise
policy decision, and making an unreasonable or insupportable policy
decision.
     It is not enough for the IRS to say, or even prove,
that choosing the cut-off method, over the Joint Committee option,
would have been unwise.
     To make its statutory argument, the IRS must argue,
and must demonstrate, that it would have been so insupportable or
unreasonable that no one can rationally conclude that Congress could
have made that choice.

STATE BANK INVESTMENT LIMITS CALLED INCONSISTENT WITH LAW

The FDIC is proposing to impose more stringent restrictions on the
exercise of equity investment powers by insured state savings banks
than Congress intended, the thrift industry asserts.
     Paul Schosberg, president of the Savings & Community
Bankers of America, contends that the FDIC proposal takes a much
narrower view of those powers than Congress intended when it enacted
them in  the 1991 Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement
Act.
     The FDIC interpretation, which the FDIC says would
put state banks insured by the Savings Association Insurance Fund on
a par with those insured by the Bank Insurance Fund, unjustly
restricts the amount a savings bank can invest in equities and mutual
funds, Schosberg maintains. He is urging the FDIC to reconsider.
     In an amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation Act, the FDICIA generally limits the activities and
equity investments of a all state-chartered banks insured by the SAIF
and the BIF to those permissible for national banks.
     The dispute between the FDIC and the industry centers
around the agencys interpretation of a grandfather clause in the
provision, which became effective last Dec. 19.
     Specifically, the provision creates a limited
grandfather for investments in common or preferred stock or shares of
investment companies.
     This grandfather exception pertains to savings banks
located in states that, as of Sept. 30, 1991, permitted them to
invest in such stock listed on a national securities exchange or in
shares of an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. These banks must have made or maintained
investments in listed stock and registered shares during the period
from Sept. 30, 1990, to Nov. 26, 1991 (the window period).
     Under the FDICIA amendment, those institutions could
acquire or retain, with FDIC approval, listed stock or registered
shares to the same extent that they did during the above period, up
to 100% of their capital.
     But Schosberg claims the FDIC is ignoring the spirit
and letter of the provision in its proposed rule. He argues that the
proposal defines equity security authority using restrictions that go
far beyond the discussions that led up to the FDICIA and far beyond
its language.
     The proposal divides equity powers into two groups:
mutual fund holdings and holdings of common and preferred stock.
     Under the proposed rule, an institution that had
mutual fund and equity holdings during the window period could
continue to invest in the holdings, but only up to the highest level
invested during that period. The total of all such investments could
not exceed 100% of capital.
     We will suggest that the FDIC return to what we
believe was the intent of Congress, Schosberg says. State banks
holding either mutual funds or stocks during the window period should
be permitted to invest in either type of security in the future, up
to 100% of capital.

ADC LOANS FOR HOUSING ARE NOW REGARDED AS THRIFT INVESTMENTS UNDER
THE QTL TEST

In an effort to help ease the nations credit crunch
and stimulate the housing market, the Office of Thrift Supervision is
now permitting some acquisition, development and construction (ADC)
loans to be treated as qualified investments under the qualified
thrift lender (QTL) test.
     To be eligible, the ADC transactions must involve
residential housing projects and bear little risk, according to new
Thrift Bulletin 20-2, which also offers guidance on QTL test
requirements regarding starter homes and credit-needy areas.
     ADC loans for development of commercial structures
will continue to be ineligible for qualified thrift investment (QTI)
status.
     OTS move is consistent with a Bush administration
directive asking regulators to moderate tough regulatory requirements
that discourage insured lenders from making real estate-related
loans, as long as the action does not pose a threat to the safety and
soundness of the institutions involved.
     ADC transactions received a bad reputation during the
1980s when government studies implicated them in the savings and loan
industry debacle. As a result, Congress and federal regulators
imposed restrictions on such transactions, most of which were
considered high-risk.
     For an ADC transaction to qualify as an investment
under the QTL test, it must meet the following criteria:
      Both stages of an acquisition and development loan
must be funded in a single combination. The financing must be a loan,
not an investment.
      The S&L involved must demonstrate that the property
is reasonably certain to be developed as domestic residential
housing;
      The property must be zoned exclusively for
residential use;
      The property must be zoned to permit residential
use, and the deed must have legally enforceable covenants that
restrict its use to sites for structures designed primarily for
homes; or
      The property must be zoned to allow residential use,
and the borrower must certify that he or she intends to construct
dwelling structures immediately on almost all of the property.
     S&Ls must have at least 65% of their assets in
housing and housing-related assets in order to pass the QTL test. If
they fail it, they could be compelled to convert to commercial bank
charters.
     QTL test provisions allow thrifts to include in their
qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans and
investments used to buy, build or develop starter homes or starter
home developments.
     To be classified as a starter home loan for QTL test
purposes, TB 20-2 says, a loan must be:
      Secured by a one-to-four family home, condominium or
cooperative, or by a development where 75% or more of the
developments value consists of such homes;
      Located in the associations Community Reinvestment
Act community; and
      Valued when the loan is made at an appraised value
of 60% or less than the median value of newly constructed one-to-four
family homes in the thrifts CRA community.
     If no median value figures are available for the
associations CRA community, OTS explains, the institution may
estimate the value by relying on data provided by the Federal Housing
Finance Board, the National Association of Home Builders or private
firms.
     Federal laws and rules also let thrifts include in
their qualified thrift investments 200% of the dollar amount of loans
made to small businesses or for construction, development or
improvement of residential housing or community service facilities
within credit-needy areas.
     The term credit-needy area includes areas within the
thrifts delineated CRA community that meet one or more of these
criteria:
      Census tracts, counties or areas in a Metropolitan
Statistical Area with median household income that is 80% or less of
the MSA median.
      Census tracts where loans by all institutions, as
reported by the most recent available Home Mortgage Disclosure Act
data, total 50% or less of the average loan volume for all census
tracts in the MSA, and the median household income is 120% of the MSA
median.
      Areas that have been designated as credit-needy by
federal, state or local government and that receive some form of
credit-related targeted assistance from such governments.
     If none of the above data are available for the
associations community, credit-needy areas may be identified after
consultation with local government and community representatives, TB
20-2 says.
      In addition, it says, if the loan is for a small
business or a community service facility,  it may be classified as
being for a credit-needy area for QTL purposes if it is made to a
small firm owned by a person whose home address is within the credit-
needy area, or if it is made to a community service facility that
primarily serves people whose homes are in the credit-needy area.

OTS, CBO DISAGREE STRONGLY ON THE INDUSTRYS CONDITION
700 More S&Ls At Risk?

Bob Duke
Are the shadows of misfortune that have stalked the
savings and loan industry for more than a decade fading or growing
larger and darker?
     Like beauty, the answer lies in the eyes of the
beholder. This was evident last week when a favorable report on the
industrys condition issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision was
shot down by Robert D. Reischauer, director of the Congressional
Budget Office.
     Although the industrys net income for the first
quarter of this year totaled $1.6 billion, a figure nearly equal to
that for all of 1991, Reischauer contended that the industrys future
remains bleak.
     He told the Senate Banking Committee that an
additional 500 to 700 savings institutions might fail during the next
three years, substantially boosting the cost of the taxpayer-financed
industry cleanup.
     Reischauer said the only reason that the industrys
condition seems  good now is that so many insolvent and troubled
institutions have been removed from the scenario.
     The cost of this effort has been high, and the
cleanup of the thrift crisis is not over, he stated.
     Reischauers comments chilled the festive atmosphere
that had prevailed earlier when OTS Director Timothy Ryan announced
at a briefing that the industrys strong first quarter earnings this
year, coupled with its solid performance last year, strongly
indicated that the industry was becoming capable of sustained
profitability and stability.
     Ryan emphasized, too, that the industrys capital
position had improved greatly over the past two years.
     Furthermore, he pointed out that the 1992 first-quarter profit
marked the fifth consecutive quarter that the industry
had been profitable. In addition, he said, this was the first time
since 1986 that quarterly net income had exceeded $1.5 billion.
     Later, in testimony before the Senate Banking
Committee, Ryan declared that the end of the industry cleanup was in
sight.
     We have closed over 700 failed thrifts with nearly
$360 billion in assets since the Financial Institutions Reform,
Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 became law, Ryan said. All
critically undercapitalized institutions that we have identified as
being nonviable should be resolved, or have active resolution
strategies in place, this year, if the Resolution Trust Corporation
is granted funding and the current real estate markets do not worsen.
     Ryan said only 37 nonviable institutions remain
unresolved.
     Reischauer sees the situation differently, arguing
that when the cleanup is finally over, it will have cost the public
$215 billion (in 1990 dollars), and fewer than 1,400 thrifts will
remain on the financial services industry landscape. At present,
there are 2,064 S&Ls in the private sector, compared with 2,096 at
the end of last year and 4,000 in 1980.
     If 500 to 700 more savings institutions go under, as
Reischauer believes, then there will almost certainly be a merger of
OTS with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Ryan
advocates such a consolidation,  and there is considerable
congressional sentiment favoring it. Proponents argue that there is
no logical reason for the perpetuation of a costly federal agency to
regulate a shrinking industry.
     Whatever the case, OTS-OCC merger legislation is sure
to be introduced  in Congress next year by House Banking Committee
Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, or some other member of his
panel.
     Meanwhile, in his congressional testimony, Reischauer
warned that if the Resolution Trust Corporation stops accepting
institutions for resolution by October 1993, as scheduled, and
transfers the remaining case load to the FDIC-administered Savings
Association Insurance Fund, the fund will be unable to handle the
task without additional federal resources.
     This situation has been worsened by the failure of
the administration and the Congress to agree on continued funding for
the RTC, and the premature setback of RTC resolution operations
before completing its task, he said.
     While Reischauer concedes that industry profits have
improved, he thinks the situation could change quickly if the present
favorable interest-rate environment took a negative turn.
     But Ryan maintained that capital was the best measure
of the thrift industrys safety, since it provides a buffer between
the institution and the SAIF, and between it and American taxpayers.
     Today, the industrys tangible capital is over 5% of
total assets, Ryan told the Senate Banking Committee. In the second
quarter of 1989, the industry reported tangible capital of only 3%.

OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION

Here are the most significant rules, proposed regulations
and policy statements affecting savings and loan associations issued
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FASB, Treasury, FFIEC and the
Federal Reserve. New or updated entries are marked with a star.*

*Thrift Bulletin 20-2. This bulletin says acquisition,
development and construction  (ADC) loan transactions involving
domestic residential housing now are considered qualified thrift
investments under the qualified thrift lender test.

Operating Subsidiaries of Federal Savings and Loan
Associations (92-8). This proposal would allow federal S&Ls to
establish and acquire operating subsidiaries just as national banks
are authorized to do. These subsidiaries would be distinguishable
from service corporation subsidiaries and would be empowered to
engage exclusively in activities permitted for all federal
associations. Comment period expired May 15.

Regulatory Capital: Intangible Assets (92-142). This
proposal would allow purchased mortgage servicing rights (PMSRs) and
purchased credit card relationships (PCCRs) to be defined as
qualifying intangible assets, and therefore includable in core
capital (the leverage ratio). Singly, PMSRs could count up to 50% of
core capital, while PCCRs could be includable as only up to 25% of
the leverage ratio. If aggregated, the core capital inclusion
limitation for these two intangibles is 50%. Comment period expired
May 15.

Bonds for Thrift D&Os, Employees, and Agents (91-733).
This final regulation requires S&Ls to secure fidelity bond insurance
coverage consistent with safety and soundness standards.Unlike OTS
previous standards, the rule does not require coverage under a
specific standardized form and does not specify minimum amounts of
coverage. The regulation brings thrift fidelity bond requirements in
line with those for commercial banks.

Branch Offices, Exclusive Leases, and Similar Agreements
(92-136). This proposed rule would eliminate regulations (considered
obsolete by OTS) that prohibit thrifts from entering into leases and
other arrangements that give associations the exclusive right to
occupy the premises of a chain store or regional shopping center. OTS
believes existing federal and state laws addressing anticompetitive
behavior are sufficient to address potential abuses that might arise
in this area. Comment period expired May 15.

Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (91-500).
This proposed rule requires all thrifts to maintain their membership
in the system. Comment period expired May 15.

Applications Restructuring (92-134). This final rule
expedites the processing of applications submitted to OTS by savings
institutions with MACRO (examination) ratings of one and two and
which have satisfactory Community Reinvestment Act and other
regulatory compliance ratings.

Interstate Branching Rule (91-133). This final rule
permits healthy federal savings and loan associations to branch
nationwide.

Residential Bridge Loans (91-721). This final regulation
reduces to 50% from 100% the risk-weighted capital required for loans
made to builders to construct presold homes.

Regulatory Bulletin 27. The bulletin provides guidance to
regulatory personnel for the review of employment contracts and
clarifies OTS policy regarding unsafe and unsound practices relating
to executive compensation and employment contracts.

Thrift Bulletin 50. This guidance bars S&Ls with MACRO
ratings of four or five from entering into third-party contracts
outside the normal course of business unless the contract is approved
by the regional OTS director.

Thrift Bulletin 38-3a. This bulletin requires an acquired
or resulting association in a voluntary unassisted transaction tot
meet the fully phased-in capital requirements applicable at the time.

Reports, Applications, Notices Submitted by S&L Holding
Companies. This proposed rule would streamline the documents process
for holding companies.

Leverage Ratio (Core Capital) Rule (90-3039). This
proposal would impose a core capital requirement of between 4% and 5%
on institutions with MACRO ratings below MACRO 1. MACRO 1 thrifts
would continue to have a 3% requirement.

Miscellaneous Capital and Capital-Related Amendments (90-
4015). This final rule clarifies certain provisions in OTS minimum
capital standards rule, including the provision on recourse
arrangements.

Mutual Holding Companies (90-4017). This proposal would
let mutual savings institutions establish mutual holding companies in
order for them to generate additional capital.

Transactions with Affiliates and Subsidiaries. (90-543).
This rule implements restrictions imposed on affiliate transactions
by FIRREA.

Thrift Bulletin 45. This bulletin prescribes the
notification procedures that must be followed by troubled thrifts and
thrift holding companies when they hire senior executive officers and
appoint board members.

Thrift Bulletin 38-3. These guidelines set forth OTS
policies that will be applied to significant voluntary unassisted
transactions.

Thrift Bulletin 5a. This bulletin outlines the limited
capital maintenance obligations that will be imposed on acquirers and
owners of savings associations.

OTS Interim Final Rule on Loans-to-One-Borrower
restrictions.The rule generally bars thrifts from lending more than
15% of their unimpaired capital and surplus to one borrower. However,
they may lend an additional 10% of their capital and surplus to one
person if the loans are secured with readily marketable collateral.

Risk-based Capital Rule. The regulation requires thrifts
to meet an 8% minimum capital requirement, including 3% core capital
and tangible capital of at least 1.5%. Full compliance with the
standard is required by Dec. 31.

Thrift Bulletin 13-2. This bulletin urges thrifts with
more than $500 million in assets or with investments in high-risk
mortgage strips to implement interest-rate risk policies adopted by
their boards.

Regulatory Enforcement Bulletins 90-331, 90-332, and 90-
333. These policies generally are designed to create an enforcement
climate in which deficiencies at S&Ls are corrected before they can
pose a significant risk to the Savings Association Insurance Fund.
The guidelines provide that a violation or unsafe or unsound practice
by a thrift with a MACRO rating of 3, 4 or 5 warrants an enforcement
action unless the OTS is satisfied that the problems are being
corrected.

Final Rule on Divestiture of Certain S&Ls. The rule
requires owners of thrifts operating under capital maintenance
agreements to comply with the agreements before trying to sell the
institutions.

Regulatory Bulletin 24. The bulletin permits higher limits
for loans to one borrowerup to 30% of unimpaired assets and capital
surplus, or double the general 15% restriction proposed by the OCCin
cases where a qualified thrift invests in the development of domestic
residential housing.

Thrift Bulletin 38-2. These guidelines advise S&Ls that
have been operating under capital or accounting forbearances that the
forbearances must be eliminated in determining compliance with
capital standards.

Trading versus Investment. Although the OTS has completed
its policy statement on accounting for securities held for trading,
investment and sale, it has been delaying implementation to give the
accounting community time to develop its policy.

Thrift Bulletin 12. This bulletin establishes guidelines
for the use of high-risk mortgage derivative products and mortgage
swaps, and limits the use of such products by weakly capitalized and
otherwise troubled thrifts.

Excess Servicing Bulletin. The bulletin instructs thrifts
to stop overstating the value of excess servicing by refraining from
booking the asset at above-market value.

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

Here are the most significant rules, proposed regulations
and policy statements affecting savings and loan associations issued
by the Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Housing Finance Board,
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, FASB, Treasury, FFIEC and the
Federal Reserve. New or updated entries are marked with a star.*

Sale of Mortgage Servicing Rights. The SEC has asked FASB
to clarify criteria for determining if mortgage servicing sales
should be treated as sales or financing.

Offsetting Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. This
proposed interpretation of existing guidance will clarify the
circumstances under which amounts recognized for forward contracts,
interest rate and currency swaps and similar contracts may be offset
in the statement of financial position and presented as a net amount.
The board has tentatively decided to let the proposal affect
financial statements for periods ending after Dec. 15.

Accounting for Investments with Prepayment Options. FASB
reached the following tentative conclusions: In the case of such
instruments as ARMs, changes caused by anticipated prepayments should
be accounted for with revised calculations of the periodic
amortization and recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the
current period. The prospective recognition of those effects (as
allowed in Statement 91) would be precluded. Deferred servicing fees
and purchased mortgage servicing rights are not included in the
project. No additional disclosures are required for entities
complying with guidance but they would be required to disclose
circumstances in which prepayments are being anticipated.
Transactions after Dec. 15, 1992, would be affected. Retroactive
application is urged.

S&L Audit Guide. The guide, drafted by the S&L Committee is
effectively complete. While little in the way of new accounting is
outlined, the focus of the guide is risk.

The Treadway Steering Committee, composed of five accounting groups,
has issued policy guidelines to combat fraud and misreporting by
accountants. The guidelines identify nine inter-related components that
interlock to form an effective internal control system.

OCC GIVES NATIONAL BANKS THE GREEN LIGHT TO BECOME FEDERAL HOME LOAN
BANK MEMBERS

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has
given the green light for national banks to become share-holding
members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and to buy preferred
stock in the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.
     This authority is outlined in two interpretive letters issued by
the OCC Office of Chief Counsel.
     Robert B. Serino, OCC deputy chief counsel, says Section 704 of
the 1989 Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act
clearly authorizes national banks to join the FHLBank System and to own
stock in it if they meet the stipulated housing and safety and soundness
requirements.
     The section repealed a provision in the Federal Home
Loan Bank Act that expressly barred national banks from becoming
members and stockholders in an FHLBank, he says.
     Serino cautions that if a national bank decides to
apply for FHLBank System membership, it should make sure it complies
with the OCCs general rules relating to prudence and appropriate
banking practices.
     For example, he says, if a national bank owned
FHLBank stock exceeding the amount required by federal law for system
members, it could create concern at the OCC.
     Serinos interpretive letter is expected to eliminate
any lingering doubts by national banks as to their authority to join
the FHLBank System as members and shareholders. Some national banks
have been reluctant to seek system membership because of those
doubts, the OCC says.
     Serino notes that the FIRREA conference report
emphasizes that Section 704s purpose is to expand system membership
to include commercial banks and credit unions that engage in mortgage
lending.
     The report says a bank or credit union would qualify
for system membership if its financial condition were sound and its
management and home-financing policy consistent with sound economic
financing.
     This expansion of Federal Home Loan Bank membership is intended
to promote and sustain housing finance and the Banks, the report
continues. The [Joint Conference] Committee believes that the
extension of membership to insured commercial banks and credit unions
that engage in mortgage lending will strengthen the Banks and their
ability to support the mortgage market.
     Serino stresses that the OCC neither encourages nor
discourages national bank membership and investment in the FHLBanks.
Such decisions, he points out, are the responsibility of the national
banks management and boards of directors.
     Meanwhile, in regard to Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation
(Freddie Mac) preferred stock, OCC Chief Counsel William
P. Bowden Jr. says in an interpretive letter that it is permissible
for national banks to purchase the stock as long as they observe safe
and sound banking practices and proper accounting in undertaking the
transactions.
     While the statutes permit unlimited investment, as with any equity
issue, there are market risks, and share prices may decline due to
changes in market interest rates, the issuers financial standing or
government tax policies, Bowden warns. Therefore, the OCC believes that
prudential limits of this sort typically are an element of safe and sound
banking practice.
     The chief counsel says Freddie Mac plans to issue its
preferred stock under Section 306(f) of the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation Act, with the stock carrying an investment grade
rating from a national rating agency.
     Congress, Bowden explains, has exempted Freddie Mac
instruments of that type from the statutory underwriting and stock
investment restrictions normally imposed on national banks.

APPLICATION FEES ASSESSED HEALTHY INSTITUTIONS WILL DECREASE UNDER
OTS MODIFIED SCHEDULE

Beginning June 30, processing fees assessed healthy savings and loan
associations in connection with certain significant applications will
be considerably lower.
     For other thrifts, the Office of Thrift Supervision
fees essentially will remain as they are under the present schedule
applicable to all institutions.
     Healthy institutions are eligible for lower application fees under
an expedited processing program authorized by the OTS new applications
regulation.
     To qualify for the expedited program, a thrift must
meet or exceed its minimum regulatory capital standards and have
composite MACRO examination ratings of one or two, as well as have
satisfactory regulatory compliance ratings.
     The revised fee structure for applications is
outlined in new Thrift Bulletin 48-8.
     Although healthy institution managers are delighted
with the modified fee formula, managers for undercapitalized ones
naturally are upset at the change.
     Harold L. Levi, a former Federal Home Loan Bank Board
attorney who represents several undercapitalized institutions,
contends that the new formula is unfair and that lower fees for
certain applications should be  determined on a case-by-case basis.
     Levi, managing partner in Harold L. Levi Associates
in Washington, says the formula is inconsistent with OTS general
policy of adopting rules applying to the industry as a whole.
     In any event, classification as being healthy will
mean much lower applications processing fees in some instances.
     For example, expedited interstate and intrastate
branch applications will cost $650 for healthy institutions, compared
with $1,900 for standard or unexpedited applications. For an
expedited change-of-location application, the fee will be $250,
compared with $900 for a standard application.
     While undercapitalized institutions will have to pay
$1,400 for bylaw amendment applications, healthy institutions wont
have to pay anything, since their submissions will be regarded by
authorities as preapproved.
     Well-capitalized thrifts wont be assessed any processing fee for
charter amendment applications, but undercapitalized ones will have to
pay $1,400.
     Ailing S&Ls will have to pay $5,300 for applications
involving the inclusion of subordinated debt and mandatorily
redeemable preferred stock in capital. In contrast, healthy
institutions will be assessed only $1,700.
     For a finance subsidiary application, the processing
fee will be $6,650 for a standard one and $2,000 for an expedited
filing. An application for an exemption from the loans-to-one-
borrower requirements will cost a healthy S&L $825, compared with
$2,500 for an undercapitalized one.
     For other applications, the present fee schedule generally will
prevail for all savings associations.
     Because the new applications restructuring regulation
will replace certain applications with simple notices, OTS expects
the time and cost associated with processing such transactions to
decrease.
     Accordingly, the fees relating to transactions and
activities that formerly required applications have been reduced, TB
48-8 says. The new fees are based on the existing fees imposed on
applications estimated to have similar processing times.
     The bulletin notes that the assessment schedule no
longer contains fees for applications for agency offices, temporary
changes of location, investments in office buildings, brokered
deposits, liquidity penalty and affiliated transactions.
     In addition, it points out, the schedule combines the
subordinated debt regulation with the mandatorily redeemable
preferred stock rule.
     The application fee schedule reflects that change,
the bulletin says. The fee for the combined application is the same
as the existing subordinated debt fee.
     Change of control applications will continue to cost
all S&Ls $12, 400, plus $23 to cover the FBIO background check.

Long-Term Prime Rate Up


   The long-term prime rate at long-term credit institutions,
including the Industrial Bank of Japan <8302>, is expected to
rise for the first time in four months.  IBJ will review trading
trends on interest-bearing debt and make its decision as early
as next week.  Implementation will follow soon after.  The Long-
Term Credit Bank of Japan <8303> and the Nippon Credit Bank
<8304> will likely follow suit.  The bank-to-bank gap on the
coupon rate for interest on interest-bearing debt will probably
remain.  At December- end, this was 1.7% at IBJ; 1.9% at LTCB;
and 2.05% at NCB.

Dai-Ichi Kangyo in Electronic Settlement


   In a first for Japanese banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank <8311>
plans to establish a special section for fund settlements, in
response to the growing number of companies engaging in cross-
border, electronic data transfer.  As outlined in the bank's new
medium-term business plan, on which the bank will embark in
April this year, Dai-Ichi Kangyo will make electronic settlement
services the new pillar of its international network business.
If trials of electronic settlements on the bank's corporate
network succeed, the resulting service will help Dai-Ichi Kangyo
secure main bank status.  The bank may also team up with foreign
banks and data communication businesses.

Nov. Construction Equipment Shipments Down


   The Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association
announced that November 1995 shipments of construction equipment
fell 9.4% YOY, to a value of 143,116 million yen, dropping for
the third consecutive month.  Of this figure, domestic shipments
decreased 10.0%, to 108,432 million yen, while exports fell
7.4%, to 34,684 million yen, as a result of increased overseas
production.  By product, shipments of hydraulic excavators
dipped 8.2% YOY, to 3,476 units, and shipments of mini-shovels
fell 6.5%, to 4,109 units.  However, demand for wheel loaders,
particularly smaller models, expanded 21.4%, to 1,671 units.

PRU-BACHE DRIVES MORTGAGE ANALYTICS
WITH INTEL'S iPSC/860 SUPERCOMPUTER

Prudential Bache Securities Inc. is retooling its fixed income
analytics desk around Intel Corp.'s newly-announced iPSC/860
supercomputer. The new parallel-processing supercomputer, which
was unveiled at the World Trade Center on Jan. 8, utilizes up to
128 of Intel's high-performance, 64-bit i860 microprocessors and
can deliver up to 7.6 billion floating point operations per
second (GFlops).

  About a dozen of Pru-Bache's 400 traders and salesmen currently
have access to applications running on an iPSC/2, a precursor of
the new iPSC/860. "Over the next six to 12 months, all
parallelizable, cpu-consumptive applications will be
parallelized, and a large number of our traders and salesmen will
be using them," says Vincent Pica, managing director of Pru-
Bache's financial strategies group.

  The IPSC/2, an 80386-based supercomputer, was installed at the
investment firm's New York office in mid-1989. In April, the
IPSC/2 will be upgraded to performance levels of the new
iPSC/860. The upgrade will result in a iPSC/2-860 hybrid, one
that uses eight i860s and 24 386 chips.

  In parallel processing computers, problems are divided into
many parts and executed simultaneously, resulting in execution
times that far surpass serial or batch processing methods.

  Pru-Bache claims it is the first securities firm to use the new
generation of supercomputers from Intel. The new machines are the
first commercial products resulting from the joint Intel-DARPA
(Defense Advanced Research Project Agency) Touchstone project.
Seeking to set new standards for supercomputer performance,
Touchstone hopes to develop a 2000 processor, 150-GFlop machine
by 1992.

  The air-cooled iPSC/860 machine, with anywhere from eight to
128 microprocessors, ranges in price from $265,000 to $3.5
million. Intel claims that the new machine out-price-performs a
comparable Y-MP supercomputer from Cray Research Inc. by a factor
of 10.

  Pru-Bache has been using the iPSC/2 machine as a server on its
ethernet network which also links IBM mainframes, Digital
Equipment Corp. VAX minicomputers and Sun Microsystems Inc.
workstations. The initial applications fitted to the
supercomputer have been geared toward the firm's mortgage-backed
securities trading business, but future developments will address
government and corporate bond analysis needs.

  Current applications running on the iPSC/2 include the creation
of collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and predictive
performance analysis. "There is an evolving need on the part of
sophisticated clients to know how these securities will act over
a wider range of interest-rate scenarios, requiring more fire
power," says Pica. Last year Pru-Bache created over $13 billion
worth of "engineered" securities, he says.

  The high-speed capability of the Intel machine has prompted
Pru-Bache to take on more arcane and computationally intensive
functions, such as the tax arbitrage associated with CMO
residuals. "Without the arbitrage values, while [an issue] may
have a high yield before tax, it may have a very low yield after
tax," Pica says.

  After-tax residual calculations that once took 20 minutes to
execute on the firm's DEC VAX now take 90 seconds on the Intel
iPSC/2. And converting the residual program to run in the
supercomputer's parallel processing environment required only 40
lines of code.

  The supercomputer is also being used to speed programs used in
the analysis of adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities. All
the required software conversion -- including the development of
parallel scheduling algorithms that allow multiple users to
interact with the iPSC/2 simultaneously -- has been performed
collectively by Pru-Bache and Intel.

  Along with its low price, Intel hopes to win customers by
covering all the compatibility bases. The iPSC/860 purportedly
can be linked to DEC VAX, IBM and/or UNIX-based environments.
TCP/IP and ethernet standards are also supported. The iPSC/860 is
available with up to 2 gigabytes of RAM. Disk storage in excess
of 100 gigabytes can be linked to the machine.

  "With any parallel computer that's new, regardless of who the
vendor is, you have the potential of being left high and dry with
the technology," says William Anderson, executive vice president
of information systems at Pru-Bache. He adds: "With Intel, at
least from a chip point of view, they control the chip that makes
it all happen. "

  "We were familiar with [Intel's] management through previous
associations," adds Pica. "We were impressed by their involvement
with DARPA...and Intel had a natural advantage being the
manufacturer of the both the 386 and 860 chip."

REUTERS TRADING SYSTEMS EXEC
DEPARTS AFTER TRIARCH FIASCO

  Reuters Holdings PLC and Mario Rosi, its global product group
leader for trading room systems, have gone their separate ways.
The break comes in the wake of the recent collapse of Reuters'
bid to install its TRIARCH 2000 digital data distribution system
at National Westminster Bank (TST, Oct. 9, 1989).

  Rosi's departure was expected for some time -- the final straw
being the Nat West fiasco, sources say. Revenues at Reuters' Rich
subsidiary are said to have gone from about $150 million in 1987
to $50 million in 1989. The 1989 total is said to include
continuing service contract revenues of about $25 million, but
not PRISM revenue because it isn't a U.S.-developed product.

  Rosi was replaced by David Morgan, formerly Reuters'
international marketing manager for trading room systems and
Rosi's subordinate. Morgan could not be reached for comment.

  Morgan's ascendance is said by insiders at Reuters to be a blow
for Rich president Peter Leger. Like Rosi, Morgan will be based
in London and report to David Ure, managing director of Reuters
Europe, Middle East and Africa Ltd. As a product group leader,
Morgan will also report to Andre Villeneuve, who chairs
Reuters'international product planning committee in addition to
his regional management responsibilities.

  Sources say part of the reason Leger was passed over was that
Ure wasn't willing to let North American management gain control
of another product group. John Hull is product group leader for
transactional services, and Buford Smith is product group leader
for real time information.

                       An Amicable Parting

  A spokesman in Reuters' London office stated last week that
Rosi "had resigned, effective immediately, for personal reasons."
Sources at Reuters say the senior executive was offered the
position of director of operations in Italy, an offer he flatly
refused.

  Reached by phone at his London home, Rosi corroborated Reuters'
statement, saying that circumstances surrounding his departure
were "totally" amicable. Asked if the failure of Triarch 2000 in
any way contributed to his motives for leaving, he said "not at
all....I decided the time was right to take on something new,
different and more challenging." Rosi says he is looking into
"several options" for employment in the industry, including
"setting up my own company."

  Though Reuters would not elaborate on the details of Rosi's
departure, his Reuters stock holdings are likely to have been
considerable. Executives were given shares of Reuters stock
before the company went public; stock options have subsequently
been offered over the past few years. Rosi had been with Reuters
for 16 years.

SEC SAYS RMJ'S OPTIONS
SYSTEM IS NO EXCHANGE

  The Securities and Exchange Commission has ruled that RMJ's
Over-the-Counter Options Trading System is not an exchange and
that Delta Government Options Corp., the system's clearing
agency, can operate as such.

  Last summer, the commission was ordered to define an exchange
by a Chicago federal appeals court which heard a case the Chicago
futures exchanges brought against the SEC (TST, Sept. 11, 1989).
The court opinion was a key event in the futures exchanges'
sustained legal campaign against the RMJ system, which they
viewed as a competitive market.

  A spokesman for the Chicago Mercantile Exchange says the
exchange "will review the SEC rule and consult with the Chicago
Board of Trade on future action we would take, if any." A CBOT
official says the exchange won't decide what to do until the SEC
issues an official order, expected this week.

  The uninterrupted operation of RMJ's system hinged on the
commission's ruling. Had the commission ruled that the system was
an exchange subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
operation of RMJ and Delta might have been temporarily stopped
while appropriate registration was sought.

  The ruling also paves the way for action on the SEC's proposed
rule on proprietary trading systems (TST, Aug. 14, 1989), which
the commission had shelved while pondering the RMJ case. The
decision is likely to help sponsors of proprietary systems
understand what innovations they can and can't make.

  TST learned about key points discussed at the commission
hearing, held on Jan. 5, although SEC officials won't discuss
what was said until the commission issues an official order. The
Chicago court order requires the commission to issue its order by
Jan. 18, SEC officials say.

  The key to the SEC's decision is that RMJ's system functions as
a so-called billboard without intermediary market makers who
continuously make a two-sided market, according to Stephen
Lynner, president of RMJ Options Trading Corp., who attended the
commission hearing. Says Lynner: "In the SEC's mind, what most
clearly delineates an exchange in the rules and procedures
imposed by its sponsors is a requirement that a subgroup of
participants in the system make bids and offers on the securities
in the system on a continuous basis. We don't have anything in
our procedures that requires anybody to do that."

  Instead, RMJ's billboard system "displays indications of
interest of the price at which someone wants to buy or sell, but
there is no requirement that anybody put up an offer." Indeed,
many days have gone by, especially since the Chicago court issued
its order last summer, when no participants have put up bids or
offers, Lynner says.

  The RMJ system advertises indications of interest to buy or
sell, but executions are done by telephone. In the RMJ system, a
potential buyer calls an RMJ broker to enter a bid into the
system, which other system participants will see on dumb
terminals. A potential seller calls the broker to indicate his
interest. By phone, the broker confirms the deal with both
parties and consummates the transaction with a keystroke.

                       What's an Exchange?

  During the commission hearing, which lasted over an hour, staff
in the SEC's division of market regulation presented arguments to
the commissioners about what constitutes an exchange, according
to Lynner. He says that among the features the staff said
distinguish RMJ's system from an exchange are the following: the
absence of a physical trading floor; no concept of members who
buy a seat; and the idea that the system's sponsor selects what
securities will be traded.

  But, says Lynner, the staff indicated that even "the presence
of any of those things with a billboard doesn't turn the system
into an exchange." Rather, he says, the SEC staff suggested that
"the expectation of a two-sided market may draw the system into
more of an exchange than a billboard."

  Last summer's Chicago court order created a "dearth of
interest" from the 23 participants in RMJ's market, Lynner says.
Now that the SEC has ruled in RMJ's favor, Lynner expects
transaction volume to pick up shortly. He says the system's
screens are already "filling up with bids and offers," that
spreads are tighter and that in general "people are spending more
time with the system."

KAPITI AND AREGON JOIN FORCES
IN MOVE SEEN AS CONSOLIDATION

  U.K. financial software firms Aregon International Ltd. and
Kapiti Ltd. have merged in what appears to be a shotgun wedding
arranged by venture capital companies Advent Ltd. and Electra
Investment Trust, which have stakes in both companies.

  The combined company will operate under Kapiti's name. Barry
Roberts, Aregon's managing director, becomes executive chairman
of the combined company. Dick Willott remains as Kapiti's
managing director. Sources say Aregon has been up for sale for
some time.

  Kapiti and Aregon have not crossed paths before at client
installations, despite Kapiti's customer list of 500 institutions
worldwide. Previous cooperative ventures thus didn't play a role
in bringing the two parties together.

  Sources at the newly combined company attribute the move to
product synergies. But sources say it's more likely that
investors Advent and Electra saw the merger as a means of
maintaining product lines while reducing costs.

  The move makes sense for Kapiti, which last year launched a
front-office deal-capture module to its Equation back-office
package. Customers balked at the module's primitive functionality
and high price, sources say. Aregon's FIST, a digital feed
handler and development toolkit, and its new TS-STAR decision
support software could enhance Kapiti's credibility in the front
office.

                     Picture of Aregon Gray

  But for Aregon, the picture is different. Aregon has been going
through a bad patch lately, sources say, although the emergence
of TS-STAR has sparked some market interest. Some of the
company's problems are said to spring from its relationship with
DEC.

  Aregon, which has traditionally based its products on the
VAX/VMS platform, has looked to DEC and in particular the
company's DECtrade initiative as a vehicle to carry it into the
market for large trading-room systems.

  DEC, however, recently acquired the PriceWatch package from
Security Pacific Corp.'s Sequor Group subsidiary. Both FIST and
PriceWatch perform a similar function within DECtrade; they both
manage incoming data feeds and deliver real-time market data to
user positions. DEC's purchase of PriceWatch suggests it will be
favored by DEC over FIST. Observers say Aregon regarded its
involvement in DECtrade as "vital" to the company's future.

  Aregon has attempted to widen its possible market through a
marketing agreement with IBM (TST, Feb. 27, 1989). But that
accord has yet to bear fruit.

  The new Kapiti will post 1989 sales of more than 21 million
pounds sterling and pretax profit of 3.5 million pounds sterling.
The company's products will include Aregon's FIST and TS-STAR
packages and Kapiti's Equation. The complementarity of the
products, according to Jeremy Wood, executive director at Aregon,
is "obvious."

  Aregon says the merger gives it access to an international
sales and marketing infrastructure that will improve distribution
channels for its products. Aregon's two offices, in London and
New York, will be merged with those of Kapiti. Kapiti, a supplier
of back-office processing software primarily to foreign branches
of major banks, will gain access to Aregon's client list of more
than 20 trading institutions.

                     It Couldn't Not Happen

  Aregon's products cater to the front-office trading
environment. FIST is a digital feed handler that features an
applications development toolkit. U.S.-based users of the system
include J.P. Morgan & Co., Goldman, Sachs & Co., Bankers Trust
Co. and Citicorp, Wood says. TS-STAR is a recently launched
analytics package that delivers easy-to-digest graphical
representations of financial data relationships (TST, Nov. 6,
1989).

  Kapiti's Equation is a back-office processing system that
covers all functions of a bank's international department or
foreign branch office, including money markets and capital
markets trade processing. According to Peter Nizich, senior vice
president at Kapiti Inc. in New York, Equation "serves as the
mainframe for the branch office." The package runs on an IBM
AS/400 computer with user access via IBM PCs on a local area
network. Users in the U.S. include First Interstate Bank and
National Australia Bank.

  Both Wood and Nizich agree that the merger is almost certain to
result in the development of a front-to-back-office package. "I
couldn't see how it couldn't," says Wood. Nizich is certain an
interface between FIST and Equation is technologically possible
and will be forthcoming.

TGB SEEKS CAPITAL AFTER
ASSETRONICS DEAL COLLAPSES

  The purported acquisition of interdealer bond broker TGB Corp.
by Assetronics is off, according to Henry Wattson, head of TGB.
The deal was to have given Assetronics a 20% interest in the
brokerage innovator. TGB's regulatory capital has dipped below
requisite levels, resulting in a suspension of trading.

  Reported in the trade press as a fait accompli, the acquisition
failed because Assetronics and its founder Jerry Kaplan reneged
on their buyout intentions, according to Wattson. Commenting on
the reasons behind the aborted acquisition, Wattson says
Assetronics' Kaplan "got cold feet."

  A letter of intent had been signed by Assetronics, according to
a source close to the deal, stating that the companies would
effectively combine their resources. The agreement was terminated
when "contingent conditions in the letter were not met", the
source says.

  Founded in 1988, TGB hoped to gain market share by slashing
commissions and using technology to redefine the broker-trader
relationship (TST, July 5, 1988). TGB brokers enter orders into
an automatic order matching system, rather than executing trades
by voice. TGB was partially capitalized by primary dealers and
planned to generate income by selling transaction information.

  Assetronics has no business or holdings except cash, and is
looking for acquisitions and/or mergers, a source says.

  With Wattson's proven track record in interdealer bond
brokerage, TGB was widely regarded as a company to watch.
Although TGB still is planning for the future, it is now mired in
financial troubles. "As of yesterday we were $40,000 under-
capitalized," Wattson said last week. "We ran out of regulatory
capital."

  "What we're trying to do right now is refinance," Wattson says.
"TGB is close to finalizing a deal with another source of
capital....we've got other irons in the fire." Details were not
available. Until it comes up with the requisite funds, TGB is not
permitted to function as an interdealer broker for any securities
transactions.

CBOE-AMEX STUDY REJECTS
PHLX-PSE-NYSE FINDINGS

  A new study on multiple listing of options strongly opposes the
recommendations of an earlier study sponsored by the Pacific,
Philadelphia and New York stock exchanges' task force. The study,
commissioned by the Chicago Board Options Exchange and the
American Stock Exchange, rejects the earlier study's proposed
Options Market Integration System (OMINTS) (TST, Oct. 23, 1989)
for multiple trading of options.

  The exchanges' lack of cooperation has prompted Richard
Breeden, chairman of the SEC, to force them to the negotiating
table.

  In a letter to exchange officials this week, Breeden has
amended the planned rule change set to take place on Jan. 22
(TST, June 5, 1989). The lottery system for newly-traded issues
will be phased out as planned, but Breeden has decided to extend
the ban on multiple listing of existing issues until the five
exchanges sit down and discuss a plan for linking the exchanges.

  The CBOE-AMEX study says OMINTS, a proposed intermarket order-
routing system similar to the Intermarket Trading System (ITS)
that has linked U.S. stock exchanges since 1978, is redundant,
outdated and would not serve the best interests of investors.

  The CBOE and AMEX are the largest U.S. options exchanges in
terms of trading volume, with 44% and 30% of the market
respectively. Philadelphia has 13%, the Pacific exchange 11% and
the NYSE a 2% share.

                       Staying Competitive

  While Nicholas Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange defends OMINTS as "a logical first step," the authors of
the CBOE-AMEX study say the system would "lock the market into an
old concept that will significantly impair the ability to develop
new and more advanced solutions later."

  The new study questions the OMINTS feature which allows
specialists to choose between meeting the best inter-exchange bid
or offer, and thereby executing the order, and re-routing a
customer order. The study says this reduces the immediacy of
execution, and that the broker initiating the trade from his
office should decide the final destination of a customer order.

  This, the authors believe, will compel each market maker to
maintain a competitive bid or offer, and thus help to keep the
markets competitive and allow the investor to execute quickly and
cost-effectively. Both studies claim to propose measures that
will prevent market fragmentation -- the task forces's by
implementing an integrated order-routing system and the CBOE-
AMEX's by preserving competition.

  The new study, jointly authored by Yakov Amihud, professor of
finance at New York University's Stern School of Business and
Haim Mendelson, professor of decision sciences and information
systems at Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, was
prepared in response to the SEC's white paper calling for
comments on multiple listing of options. The Pacific-
Philadelphia-New York study was executed by Tellefsen Consulting
Group Inc.

                         Looking Forward

  In keeping with the CBOE and AMEX's desire to take a more
forward-looking approach, the professors have released only an
interim study. They will not release their final recommendations
for a market integration system until after multiple trading
commences, allowing the impact of multiple listing to be
assessed.

  In a letter to Chairman Breeden, Nicholas Giordano, president
of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, says the CBOE-AMEX study
offers no "concrete alternatives to or legitimate criticisms of
OMINTS" and therefore the members of the task force are convinced
OMINTS is the best alternative.

  Although the exchanges continue to argue over how to integrate
the options markets, they all consider development of new pricing
systems for their specialists a top priority.

  Options specialists at the AMEX have started using The Options
Pricing System (TOPS), a computerized options pricing model that
updates prices as the underlying stock prices change. TOPS was
jointly developed by the AMEX and David Bruce & Co., a Chicago
financial software developer, and the Securities Industry
Automation Corp.

                        Faster is Better

  Selected CBOE market makers have had an online analytical
system installed. PC Auto Quote uses different pricing models to
quickly calculate option prices (TST, Oct. 23, 1989). The pilot
system uses IBM PS/2 terminals with touch sensitive screens and
has been installed at three booths covering four equity options
series. The exchange's floor procedure committee approved the
installation of the pilot as a test to see if online systems help
to increase order flow.

  The Philadelphia Stock Exchange is also developing an auto-
quote system for options specialists. The auto-quote system has
been in use for a few years on the exchange's currency floor.
Officials say the exchange hopes to have the entire options floor
operational by April. The auto-quote system updates options
prices as the underlying security moves. The exchange is also
using software developed by David Bruce, but because the software
will run on a high-powered workstation, exchange officials claim
Philly market makers can update prices six times faster than
users of Amex's TOPS system.

  The Pacific Stock Exchange will have an auto-quote system tied
to its online Pacific Options Exchange Trading System (POETS) to
allow specialists to quickly update options prices.

  The NYSE is in the process of installing an online automatic
quote system for its specialists. The system will carry quotes
for all issues traded on the NYSE.

TELERATE PLANS BROKER VERSION
OF TTS TO RIVAL REUTERS SYSTEM

  In response to Reuters Holdings PLC's planned launch of its
Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange order-matching system, Telerate
Inc. is developing a rival system that will preserve the role of
the broker in the interbank market. Telerate has traditionally
maintained close relationships with brokers, particularly with
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., which provides Telerate with U.S.
government securities prices under an exclusive arrangement.

  The proposed system will display executable, two-way prices
contributed by foreign exchange brokers. Subscribers to
Telerate's Trading Service (TTS) will be able to view and hit
firm broker prices through their TTS slates instead of having to
trade over the telephone. Telerate says it is talking to brokers
about participating in the system but has yet to conclude a firm
agreement.

  The system will use the same worldwide network Telerate built
to support TTS. Telerate says development of the system -- dubbed
the Broker Version -- is 85% completed. The only upgrade required
to access the new system will be installation of a color version
of the monochrome TTS dealer slate. TTS is a conversational
interbank trading service that competes with Reuters' Monitor
Dealing and Dealing 2000 systems.

  Dealing 2000-2, which is slated for rollout before the third
quarter of this year, will make Reuters the sole intermediary for
its own screen-based market. The system is expected to take some
business away from the telephone-based forex broker market.

  Telerate says its Broker Version will retain the existing
broker structure of the over-the-counter foreign exchange market.
In that structure, banks telephone brokers to get two-way prices
on any currency combination. The brokers match sellers and
buyers, taking a cut in the process.

                      Black Boxes Premature

  In more direct competition to Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 is RADAR,
a black-box order-matching system under development by RADAR
Financial L.P., a joint venture comprising MAI PLC, Euro Brokers
Inc. and a number of as yet undisclosed partners (TST, Oct. 23,
1989). But according to Jim Wiseman, chief designer of TTS,
Telerate doesn't believe the foreign exchange market is ready for
an anonymous black-box trading system.

  A TTS user would access the Broker Version by hitting a field
on his slate marked with the letter B. This would change the
format of both the slate and the screen in front of the trader.
The Broker Version slate shows the same function fields along the
lower edge of the slate.

  Above the function fields, the slate is divided horizontally
into two segments. The lower segment contains the bank's own
rates for selected currency pairs. The upper segment shows the
best three broker bid and offer rates for the currency pair the
trader is dealing in. The bids and offers are arranged in a
pyramid formation, with the best bid and offer side by side at
the top-center of the slate.

                          Hit the Field

  To hit a broker at a particular bid or offer, the trader
touches the relevant field on his slate. At this point, the
transaction is immediately executed, with the system
automatically exchanging settlement details between the two
parties. If the trader hit the best bid or offer on the slate,
the previous second-best bid or offer moves to the top of the
pyramid and the new third-best bid or offer joins the pyramid at
the bottom. If the trader hits the second- or third-best bid or
offer, the system automatically hits the best bid or offer at the
same time and calculates the average rate for the transaction.

  At the center of the pyramid is a field that displays details
of the most recent three transactions the trader has completed
that day. Included in the data are the identities of the
counterparties with which the deals were struck. The trader is
able to scroll up and down in this field, giving him access to
transactions made earlier in the day.

  Meanwhile, a fifth quadrant superimposed onto the center of the
trader's screen displays the best three broker bids and offers in
the system, plus the bank's own rates. An incoming call from a
counterparty on the TTS network would automatically take
precedence on the screen over the broker quadrant.

STRATUS TOUTS JAPANESE
DEAL STRUCK LAST SPRING

  Security must be pretty tight in Japan these days, because
Yamaichi Securities has only just allowed Stratus Computer Inc.
to announce a $1.9 million deal the computer manufacturer struck
last spring with Toshiba Engineering Co. Two of the three XA
2000s Yamaichi acquired in the deal have actually been up and
running since last summer.

  A Stratus Computer Inc. press release dated Jan. 2 and sent to
TST offices via Federal Express, fax and ordinary mail boldly
claims: "Stratus wins $1.9 million contract to supply Yamaichi
Securities with online trading system."

  The third Stratus XA 2000, which was also delivered last
summer, will support a trading system to be developed by systems
integrator Toshiba for Yamaichi. Stratus' contract is actually
with the systems integrator, which is developing the futures and
options trading system that will run on Stratus computers at
Yamaichi offices in Japan.

                     Economic with the Facts

  The release also says that "the Stratus-based system...is
already online," distributing "real-time futures and options
prices listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange to Sun Workstations" on
Yamaichi's trading floor and at branch offices.

  A long discussion starting on page 2 of the press release
describes in detail what seems to be a ticker plant, not a
trading system. There is no further mention of the futures and
options trading system in development.

  A little investigation helped sort out the situation. Yes,
Stratus assures us, the release does describe a ticker plant that
uses Stratus technology, and that system has been in operation
since the summer. A Stratus XA 2000 model 120 receives the
prices, and a model 110 distributes the data to broker
workstations, Stratus says. Yamaichi wanted a second machine to
perform the ticker plant function usually performed by one
because the firm plans to run other, as yet undisclosed
applications on it, Stratus explains.

  Now that the ticker plant is up and running, a trading system
is being developed, Stratus says. The third Stratus, another
model 120 Yamaichi got in last spring's deal, is being used by
Toshiba Engineering to develop a new application for futures and
options trading, Stratus says.

TECHNOLOGY FORECASTING AND
HUMAN FACTORS AT HP SEMINAR

  Hewlett-Packard's recent seminar on Technological Challenges
Facing the Securities Industry might well have been subtitled
True Confessions of Trading Systems Design. Two speakers, Scott
Abbey, managing director and head of worldwide operations for
Morgan Stanley & Co., and George Kenney, senior vice president of
O'Connor & Associates, offered unusually candid and informative
presentations. The meeting was co-sponsored by Business Week.

  Morgan Stanley does its share of strategic technology
forecasting, striving to identify the shape of trading systems to
come. Before airing his latest prognosis, Abbey turned the clock
back five years to review Morgan Stanley's then-current vision of
trading systems of the future.

                    "What hasn't happened..."

  * The attempt to satisfy all the trader's needs -- market data,
position management, analytics etc. -- with a single device was
"one of the driving forces" of Morgan Stanley's development
effort in the early-to-mid 1980s. But it met with "tremendous
resistance."

  Not only was it difficult to create a single system as good at
multiple applications as separate systems would be, but traders
insisted on being able to see all their data all the time.

  * Morgan Stanley had expected to see a reduction in the average
number of devices per trader. Instead, the "tower of power" at
many traders' desks is actually getting higher.

  * Large screen devices with partitions -- like the IBM 3290
plasma display -- were a hot prospect until Abbey & company found
out that traders didn't like not being able to see over their
terminals.

  * Abbey and his team also looked into windowing systems on
normal-sized displays, but traders were adamant about being able
to see "all the information," so overlapped windows were
discarded.

  * He had expected much of the analytic workload to migrate from
mainframes to workstations. Instead, "a lot of the MIPS on the
desk" are being applied to the user interface.

  Meanwhile, "a tremendous number of Lotus spreadsheets" have
popped up on PCs. But PC power hasn't replaced any mainframes. In
fact, there are even more mainframes, due to increased demand for
local data collection, storage, processing and retrieval.

                     "What Has Happened..."

  * Five years ago, Abbey decided to pay the small incremental
price of making his firm's terminals "graphics-capable." Today, a
lot more graphics are being used at Morgan Stanley -- for
spreads, trends and graphical user interfaces.

  * There's been a significant increase in the use of internal
data. Five or 10 years ago, capital markets traders used external
(market) data almost exclusively. Today, more traders have access
to position data, internal research and customer data.

  * More interactive software is allowing traders greater
flexibility in configuring and passing data among applications.

                           What's Next

  Undaunted by his spotty forecasting track record, Abbey went on
to share his predictions for the next five years.

  * The availability of high resolution intermediate-sized (12"-
15") monitors will result in increased use of windowing
interfaces and mice. The higher resolution and larger size will
satisfy traders' need to see all their data, while the shape of
the monitors won't obstruct vision.

  * Mainframe applications developed for the batch environment
will continue to be grandfathered -- partly because of the
investment in new applications that talk to the old ones, and
partly because of the need to amortize the old applications
themselves. Systems designers, Abbey seems to say, will continue
to be held hostage by financial inertia.

  This prediction may hold more meaning for Morgan Stanley -- as
developers and users of the omnipurpose, mainframe-based Tradepro
trade processing behemoth -- than for other firms.

  * Workstations will be the focal point for integration of data
from heterogeneous in-house mainframes as well as outside data
sources. Morgan Stanley has devoted a lot of resources to develop
connectivity software that will allow workstations to run
applications that crunch data from remote, mainframe databases.

  * Some of the incremental power of new workstations will
support more sophisticated graphical user interfaces. For a 15 or
25 MIP machine, says Abbey, one to three MIPS of window
management is insignificant.

  * A lot of money will be wasted on workstations simply because
they're sexy and the salesman does a good job, and because buyers
look at the one-off cost rather than quantity.

  * Another dumpster load of money will be wasted because people
don't understand how to build distributed systems. "Despite what
anybody says," says Abbey, "I don't believe that that technology
exists and is widely understood."

  Abbey believes it will take a lot of blood, sweat and tears,
thousands of programming hours and "not a lot of profits" to make
a distributed system work. But he believes the investment is
necessary. "There's no way around it; we have to fail and we have
to stand up to our management and say, this is why we have to do
it."

                     The Facts of Half-Life

  Now with O'Connor, George Kenney came from the American Stock
Exchange where he guided the development of a theoretical options
pricing system (TOPS). The system was developed, Kenney says,
because specialists on the floor of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange were consistently out-quoting the AMEX specialists.
Kenney's AMEX experience left him with a healthy respect for the
human and political factors of systems design.

  The first duty of a trading systems designer, according to
Kenney, is to survive long enough to complete a project.
Unfortunately, "the time it takes to implement and design an
architecture greatly exceeds the half-life of MIS directors."

  At the AMEX, Kenney lasted two years. His successor, says
Kenney, must decide whether to complete the project Kenney
started or throw it away or do something that will have his name
on it. Kenney advises systems architects to make a "sober
assessment of the political climate, both yours personally and
that of the firm."

TECHNOLOGY FORCASTING
PART TWO

                     Consider the Lowly User

  But the biggest challenge facing the systems designer, says
Kenney, is making "the impedance match between these great
systems you're spending all this money to design and this poor
user who has to use it."

  Kenney had just come from visiting the New York offices of his
new employer. And while praising O'Connor's "tremendous
technology," he also points out that "a lot of the users really
don't know how to turn the systems on, so 95% of the sparkle that
system can deliver is really lost."

  Systems designers, says Kenney, are the least qualified people
to make the match between systems and users because they think
differently from users. Designers, for example, are comfortable
with "hidden information," while users are not.

  Kenney told of a brief encounter with one AMEX specialist
during tests of an electronic display book. The specialist
remarked, You see this ticket? I can touch it. I can smell it,
and I trust it. And I don't trust this electronic book. You'll
sneak orders into it and I'll never know about them.'

                       Eggheads Under Fire

  Systems designers, according to Kenney, don't like talking to
users. Instead, they like to deal with system specifications.
"They get the specs and then go hide behind them and design their
system and then they sort of throw it over the wall," said
Kenney.

  Talking to users is "very painful" for systems designers,
according to Kenney. "It takes time -- time away from valuable
design." Kenney likens the state of computer systems design to
automotive engineering in the 1940s.

  Apropos of systems design, Kenney acknowledges his intellectual
debt to John D. Gould, a human factors scientist at IBM's
Hawthorne, New York research center. Gould's paper, "How to
Design Usable Systems," will appear as a chapter in the "Handbook
of Human-Computer Interaction" edited by Martin Helander and to
be published by North-Holland Press.

  The Gould paper describes "good computer systems" as "easy to
learn, easy to use, contain[ing] the... functions that allow
people to do the things they want to do, and that are well-
liked." To meet these goals, Gould says designers should learn to
pay more attention to users and the user interface throughout the
design process.

                  How to Design Usable Systems

  Several clever tactics for increasing user orientation -- both
in the conceptual and testing phases -- are advocated by Gould,
including:

  * Begin writing the user manual before any code is written --
in some cases the draft user manual can become the definitive
design document;

  * Define explicit behavioral targets (not MIPS or I/O rates)
for systems performance and test for them. A behavioral goal
might be, after an hour's unsupervised exposure to the system, a
trader must be able to execute 10 trades, accurately enter the
trade data, and check his position, in two minutes';

  * Eliminate intermediaries, such as marketing research people,
between systems designers and users;

  * While observing users, ask them to think aloud about what
they are doing as they are doing it;

  * Schedule design meetings in users' work areas;

  * Observe and videotape users in their work environment --
videotapes "are often much more convincing than charts and oral
reports;

  * Include users on the design team -- participative design
improves the probability of user acceptance;

  * Sketch user scenarios and show them to the design team to
provoke arguments about the user interface;

  * Create mock-ups and simulations -- one group simulated a
"listening typewriter" by having a concealed typist enter what
users said.

                   Living in a "Sea of Change"

  Like Kenney, Gould accuses systems designers of avoiding
contact with users whenever possible. As a result, designers tend
to design systems to satisfy themselves, not users. "Smart
systems designers like to build projects that have high
intellectual content," says Kenney.

  Gould also thinks designers must learn to embrace failure in
order to succeed. Since nobody, no matter how gifted, gets it
right the first time, designers must commit to an iterative
process, says Gould, and be willing to work in the midst of a
"sea of change."

  Of course, an iterative design process is only possible with
the right tools. Gould acknowledges the need for a user interface
management system (UIMS).

  The UIMS, says Gould, "provides for a well defined interface
between that portion of the code that contains the user interface
and that portion of the code that implements the functions of the
user interface." Gould cites "Apollo Computer's ADM" and
"Cosmic's (NASA software) TAE" as examples of commercially
available UIMSs.

                      Off the Drawing Board

  Kenney actually used some of Gould's techniques while
developing AMEX's TOPS. He hired two industrial psychologists who
spent three months gaining the confidence of the specialists and
developing a model of the user interface. He formed a users
committee and developed story boards depicting user scenarios. He
designed a mock-up of a custom keyboard, and prototyped a
simulator for users on a PC.

  "The users were becoming authors; they became invested in the
system," says Kenney. "And user satisfaction is key to the
survivability of the MIS director." Key, but no guarantee.

  In 1990, Wall Street's most significant technology decisions
will focus on distributed system infrastructure -- the choice of
network, operating system and database software. These decisions
will affect a firm's ability to use future vendor offerings for

CORPORATIONS ADVISED TO FOCUS ON MARKET RISK 

     Corporate finance professionals are finding they don't know
enough about measuring market risk to meet new  U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed regulations.  The SEC wants
executives to evaluate and disclose the market risks their companies
face and how they use derivatives as a hedge.  While the action is
intended to give investors a better understanding of the risks
involved with hedging, a new survey suggests many corporate finance
professionals don't fully understand the risks themselves.
     While there has been a dramatic effort in the last year or two to
establish or update corporate investment policies, "where we get into
a little bit of a problem is in the risk measurement and control
element of those policies," says Robert Baldoni, managing director  of
Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting.

Stumped by Value-at-Risk

     Emcor polled treasury executives recently at multinational
corporations and found that two-thirds of the more than 80 respondents
believed they did not have an adequate understanding of value-at-risk
(VAR).  
     Widely endorsed, VAR is considered an essential component of the
new SEC proposals.  The VAR approach looks at the entire corporate
risk profile, not just the individual transaction -- which is where
corporations tend to focus, says Baldoni.  "Many people are getting
involved in complex transactions and are not necessarily aware of the
ramifications," he says.  
     The SEC action comes exactly a year after the bankruptcy filing
of Orange County, Calif.  The municipality lost more than $1.5 billion
in ill-advised derivatives trades.  Similar recent disasters led the
SEC to review the annual reports of some 500 public companies to gauge
how well market risk was being evaluated and reported to investors.
     As a result of that investigation, the SEC is calling for new
quantitative and qualitative disclosures of hedging activity.  The
accounting policy for derivatives will have to be detailed within the
corporate financial statements. And the agency wants to see "a
narrative discussion" of the company's primary market risk exposures
and how those exposures are managed.  TREASURY MANAGER'S REPORT,
January 19, 1996                                                      
     To the extent that derivatives or other financial instruments are
used to hedge a company's primary market risk, the SEC proposes three
alternatives to disclose the associated risks:

     * The first option is to present a table with "common inputs to
market risk measurement methods," so that investors and analysts can
plug the data into their own models and do their own risk analysis;  

     * Alternatively, corporate financial executives may choose to
present a  "sensitivity analysis," illustrating the potential impact
of certain hypothetical market moves.  The SEC cautions that a
detailed explanation of the modeling techniques and parameters must be
included so that investors understand the analysis;

     * The third option is a VAR model which calculates the net effect
of all of the hedges used entity-wide.  The risk projection is
expressed as the most that could be lost over a specific period -- a
day, a week, a month -- with a statistically-derived confidence level. 
In other words, a typical VAR expression would be that over the next
quarter there is a 90 percent confidence level that the loss potential
due to market activity will be no more than x dollars.  To have that
kind of overarching measure of market risk requires some sophisticated
number crunching.

Why VAR, Why Now?

     Little about the VAR concept is new, except the need to apply it
in a corporate environment.  Financial institutions with dynamic
trading operations long have used the approach.  And while most
corporations have fairly simple and stable hedging positions, Baldoni
says that's changing:  "As we have gotten into more complex
instruments the risk profile has changed.  And unfortunately, the
instruments that are being offered are way ahead of the control
systems in most of these institutions." 
     The basic statistical concepts of standard deviation, variance
and covariance are at the heart of the so-called "analytic approach,"
to VAR, but various simulation methods can also produce VAR
measurements.  However, even the most vigilant risk manager may be
stumped by where to get the numbers.  
     Until New York-based J.P. Morgan introduced its RiskMetrics
database in the fall of 1994, there wasn't a reliable, consistent
source of data, says Mike Salzberg, partner with Price Waterhouse in
New York.  
     "One of our goals is to demystify derivatives," explains Jacques
Longerstaey, head of the Market Risk Research unit at Morgan.  The
firm provides free access to data on commodity futures, fixed-income,
equity and currency markets, as well as volatility measures and
correlations.  The RiskMetrics data is available via the Internet
(http://www.jpmorgan.com), and such information services as Bloomberg,
Reuters and Dow Jones Telerate.  
     Access to data has not been the only barrier to widespread use of
VAR.  In fact, 84 percent of the respondents in the Emcor survey
indicated they have not used the RiskMetrics database.  
     A majority indicated they simply don't have the software to make
use of the data, which is probably not surprising considering a base
level VAR package runs from $100,000 to $200,000 a year, according to
Baldoni.  He adds that cheaper packages on the market are not very
good.  
     "To pay for the software and get your people trained you've got
to have the deal flow to justify it," he says.  Most corporations
don't, and will choose to outsource the analysis. 

Who Is Responsible for VAR?

     Under the new SEC proposals, a corporation will be held
accountable for the risk quantification that is put before the public. 
"I think it's beginning to open up a very interesting issue," says
Salzberg of Price Waterhouse.  "Once it starts getting into the area
of actually disclosing numbers, who's responsible for that number?  Is
it the risk manager?  The capital markets guy?  The CFO who signs his
name on the report?"  
     Baldoni says his goal with the VAR concept is to make the numbers
understandable to the highest levels of the corporation, "so, 10 or 12
months later when something goes wrong people aren't saying, 'Oh, I
didn't know.'"
     The SEC's stated goal is to make risk quantification
understandable to investors, and that, Salzberg says, will have
repercussions in the market.       "Suppose I divide VAR into revenue?
What I wind up with is a risk-adjusted value," allowing investors to
gauge how much they're putting at risk to make that return, he
explained.  
     "That's how we choose between investments," adds Salzberg, and 
"right now we can't do that."  But he cautions that VARs should be
considered directional measures, and not absolute numbers.
     "Establishing an historic pattern of risk-adjusted numbers will
allow investors to look back and see how accurate the company has been
in determining its risk profile," he says.  (Robert Baldoni, Emcor
Risk Management Consulting, 914/591-4790; Jacques Longerstaey, J. P.
Morgan, 212/648-8321; Michael Salzberg, Price Waterhouse, 212/596-
8945; Michael H. Sutton, SEC, 202-942-4400.)

CORPORATE-VALUE-AT-RISK

        The value-at-risk (VAR) approach was developed by and for the
trading operations of financial institutions, but has been endorsed
for corporate use by the Group of Thirty, the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association, the Financial Executives Institute and now
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
        Irvington, N.Y.-based Emcor Risk Management Consulting
developed a proprietary risk measurement system which they call
Corporate-Value-At-Risk (CVAR).  The concept embodies four distinct
measures, each of which can employ the full range of statistical
analysis -- variance, covariance, historic scenario analysis, Monte
Carlo analysis, etc.:

* Operating Exposure

This measures the underlying risk exposure that results from the
company's operating activities to determine if there is enough risk to
warrant the time spent managing it.

* Financial Instrument Exposure

This step applies the same analysis specifically to the financial
instruments chosen to manage the company's underlying risk.  These
tools include such things as securities, debt and hedge instruments.

* Operating Exposure and Hedges

Step three is to overlay measures one and two and run the same risk
analysis a third time.  This measure, when compared with the company's
initial operating exposure, should indicate a lower overall level of
risk.

* Counterparty Exposure

This analysis focuses on the company's risk exposure to each financial
institution that serves as a counterparty.  It provides a measure of
the upside potential of the hedging portfolio, so that the company
stays below its counterparty credit limit.

SENATE BILL TIGHTENS UP ON PENSION PLAN AUDITS

The Pension Audit Improvement Act (S. 1490), introduced in the U.S.
Senate last month, would eliminate limited scope audits, enhance the
qualifications necessary for pension plan auditors and require those
auditors to promptly notify authorities of any serious violations. 
All of which, it is expected, will significantly raise the cost of
plan administration.  
        The measure was introduced in the midst of the holiday
season, betwixt government shutdowns and before the east coast
disappeared under a blizzard.  
Because of the timing, reaction against the bill has been muted, "but
my guess is you're going to see mobilization," says Paul Doxsee, vice
president of St. Paul, Minn.-based Pension Solutions Inc., the
marketing arm of MSI Insurance Group which specializes in 401(k) plan
administration for firms with fewer than 500 employees. 

When Is An Audit Not An Audit?

        Plan administrators, under current law, can exclude certain
pension plan assets from the annual audit as long as those assets are
invested with a regulated institution such as a bank or insurance
company.  The assumption has been that those assets are being audited
elsewhere.  About half of the required audits under the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) contain a "limited scope
disclaimer." 
        "Potentially, the majority of the assets in a plan aren't
audited, and then you're not getting the full benefit of an audit,"
says Sue Hicks with the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants (AICPA) in Washington, D.C.      
        Since 1987 the U. S. General Accounting Office and the U.S.
Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General have issued separate
reports questioning the suitability of limited scope audits.  
        To further dramatize the situation, U.S. Secretary of Labor
Robert B. Reich announced in November that Department of Labor (DOL)
investigators had more than 300 civil- and criminal inquiries underway
against companies accused of improperly diverting 401(k) funds. 
Doxsee acknowledges DOL has found some bad apples, but says, "I think
they've already heightened the awareness ... why do they need the
audit requirement on top of it?"
     Although the independent Washington, D.C.-based, Employee Benefit
Research Institute (EBRI) has not taken an official position on the
bill, organization president Dallas Salisbury says the bill's reforms
come at a relatively high price "with the principal beneficiaries
being the nation's accounting firms." 
   Whatever the cost, it's outweighed by the benefits, says the
AICPA's Hicks.  The benefits, however, may be in the eye of the
beholder.  While DOL  traditionally has found most 401(k) problems in
small firms, plans with fewer than 100 employees are exempt from
audits altogether.  "This would be a further cost and discouragement
for large plans while not doing anything to get at the problems
related to small plans," says Salisbury.      
   According to Hicks, AICPA committees have estimated the
legislation would push up the cost of a pension plan audit by 10
percent-to-40 percent.  "I would say that for some of our clients who
are marginally profitable, that increase may force a decision to
discontinue the plan.  That's very real.  To a small employer, $500 to
$1000 matters a great deal," says Doxee.  (Paul Doxee, Pension
Solutions, 612/631-7760; Sue Hicks, AICPA, 202/737-6600; Dallas
Salisbury, Employee Benefit Research Institute, 202/659-0670.)

RESOURCEIQ OPENS WINDOW TO EUROPE

   Privately-held ADS Associates Inc. is considering conquering the
world, again.  The Calabasas, Calif.-based software developer has
established sales and service outposts throughout the world to support
Global Trader, a leading broker-dealer work station used by central
banks and global financial institutions.  But the company's treasury
management workstation, Resource, has barely ventured outside North
America.  That may change this year.
   "Our new Windows product was designed with an eye toward
international applications," says Harvey Holman, vice president for
sales.  "The DOS-based Resource product was very much North America-
oriented," he adds.
   The Windows release, ResourceIQ, is due out in June and is
expected to introduce several unique features.  Among them, a "drag
and drop" capability that allows figures and graphs to be moved to
outside applications without the intermediary step of going to an
ASCII flat file.
   Similarly, a spreadsheet figure showing an account surplus can be
moved and dropped on a wire transfer icon and automatically moved into
an overnight investment.  "Through an application programming
interface, all the appropriate wire transfer information moves along
with the figure," says Holman.
   In addition to the new gee-whiz functionality, ResourceIQ has
gained derivatives, sensitivity analysis and risk analysis
functionality from Global Trader -- "all the things that corporates
want, but have traditionally not been able to afford," says Holman.  
Whereas a Global Trader workstation runs between $1 million and $3
million, the average Resource installation costs $30,000-to-$80,000.
   Annette Sneckenberg, financial operations manager for a $3 billion
Omaha-based conglomerate, settled on the ADS Resource workstation a
year ago after grilling three vendors.  "Overall, they had the better
package, and the people who came to do the demo were so knowledgeable
we couldn't stump them on anything," Sneckenberg says.  Her firm,
privately-held Peter Kiewit Sons, has more than 250 subsidiaries.  "We
were looking for an investment system that could run the gamut," she
says.  (Harvey Holman, ADS, 818/591-2371; Annette Sneckenberg, Peter
Kiewit Sons, 402/536-3623.)

Commentary

     The corporate bond market seems to be on hiatus, apparently
taking its cue from the federal government shutdown in Washington,
D.C.  With neither economic indicators nor a federal budget to guide
forecasts, corporate credit issuers are on the sidelines.
     Beyond Wall Street, the federal government shutdown has blacked
out more than data.  Billions of dollars in civilian and military
export licenses are held up at the Commerce Department; Small Business
Administration loans have dried up; and government contractors have
been idled.  
     At the same time, the East Coast blizzard silenced major
retailing centers from Boston to Richmond.  Wall Street's manic
reaction to the federal budget talks sank the stock and bond markets
last week when political differences appeared to put off any hope of a
balanced budget pact.
     The Standard & Poor's 500 Index is down over 2.5 percent for the
year to date.  Similarly, the bond market has given back its late
December gains, pushing the 30-year U.S. Treasury bond over the 6
percent mark.  The Federal Reserve Board's open market committee meets
again Jan. 30, but most market analysts expect the Fed is as much in
the dark as they are and so will put off any interest rate action.  
     What little information the market has comes from the Fed this
week with its report on December industrial production and capacity
utilization.  The U.S. Labor and Commerce Departments are expected to
be catching up this week on overdue reports covering gross national
product, employment, retail sales and producer and consumer prices.

FIRMS WORRY ABOUT BUDGET FIGHT

   A poll conducted last month by the Morristown, N.J.-based
Financial Executives Institute (FEI), found that senior financial
executives in the United States are concerned about the failure of
President Clinton and the U.S. Congress to reach a balanced- budget
agreement.  Asked how a budget impasse would directly affect their
companies, 68 percent predicted higher interest rates; 56 percent
expected reduced sales; 40 percent believed it would negatively affect
employment; and 50 percent said it would decrease their companies'
stock prices.  An earlier FEI membership poll, conducted in early
November, found most of the respondents in favor of Congress' tough
tactics -- two-thirds of the respondents said they favored tying an
extension of the federal debt ceiling to passage of the budget
reconciliation package.  (Jim Kaitz, FEI, 202/659-3700.)

SEC COULD WANT DISCOUNT BACK

The U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's recent budgetary lapse
resulted in a firesale on securities registrations (TMR, Nov. 24).  In
the absence of a new Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
appropriation amending the filing rate set in the Securities Act of
1933, filers were paying 1/50th of one percent of the value of their
filing.  With the emergency funding measure passed on Jan. 6, that
rate goes back to 1/29th of one percent.  But the SEC says filers who
got away with the lower rate between Dec. 15 and Jan. 8 may be
required to make up the difference. (SEC Office of Filer Support, 
202/942-8900.)

BANKS PUSH CHECKS ON CD-ROM

Several major banks have come to market in recent weeks offering check
images on CD-ROM.  The new technology uses search and retrieval
software to pull up a check image on a personal computer screen as
opposed to pulling a paper check out of a storage box, or waiting for
the check to clear.  New York-based Chase Manhattan Bank announced a
CD-ROM enhancement for its ImageAccess check disbursement customers. 
These are customers who issue thousands of checks a month.  Each CD
can store up to 25,000 checks.  Similarly, Chemical Banking Corp.'s
New York-based Geoserve division now offers check images on CD to
controlled disbursement customers of Chemical Bank Delaware.  And Bank
of Boston is offering corporate customers check image delivery on CD
as an alternative to receiving traditional paper or microfilm.  "Many
customers anticipate that they will be able to resolve telephone
inquiries while the payee or customer is still on the phone," says
Mary Ann Hardy, Bank of Boston image product development manager.

NEW MESSAGE SERIES LAUNCHED

   S.W.I.F.T. and the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA) introduced a new series of derivatives messages.  The new
message types are MT 360, single currency interest rate swap
confirmation; MT 361, cross currency interest rate swap confirmation;
and MT 362, interest rate swap reset confirmation.  The new messages
are intended to improve the ability of swap dealers to execute
confirmations and to reduce the operational risk in interest rate swap
transactions.  "Control of operational risk is of primary importance
for the financial services industry," said Peter Guldentops, S.W.I.F.T
senior manager for standards.  (Ian Fraser, S.W.I.F.T., 011/32-2-655-
4430; Carolyn Jackson, ISDA, 212/332-1200.)

STOCK OPTION ACCOUNTING WORRIES HIGH TECH FIRMS 

   Corporate financial officers may have won a round with the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), but now many are finding
they still have a lot to lose.  After facing years of opposition, the
FASB agreed in October to back down from its plan to require that
corporate financial statements reflect the value of stock options
granted as compensation.
   The FASB wanted corporations to fix a cost to those options and
charge it against earnings.  While that won't happen, effective
January 1 the FASB is requiring that the same valuation be included in
corporate financial footnotes.  "This is one footnote I hope the
readers of our financial statements don't read," says Chris Paisley,
chief financial officer for 3Com Corp., a Santa Clara, Calif.-based
high technology firm.
   It's not that Paisley has anything to hide, other than a profound
befuddlement over how to value the thousands of options his company
grants each year.  All 4,600 of 3Com's employees receive options as
part of the company's bonus and incentive program.  "We were obviously
none too thrilled with this pronouncement," says Paisley.  Start-up
high tech firms like 3Com routinely use stock options in lieu of
scarce cash to attract top talent.   

FASB Provides Questionable Model  

   The FASB's Statement 123 explains that for stock options "fair
value is determined using an option-pricing model that takes into
account the stock price at the grant date, the exercise price, the
expected life of the option, the volatility of the underlying stock
and the expected dividends on it, and the risk-free interest rate over
the expected life of the option."
    "When CFOs realize the complexity of what they're going to have
to do, they're going to be in shell shock because it's not going to be
an easy compliance by any stretch," says Cheryl Breetwor, president of
Sunnyvale, Calif.-based ShareData, which provides software for stock
option accounting to some 2000 customers throughout the United States. 
To date, ShareData has produced software that merely tracks a
company's stock options, keeping up with who's vested, and how many
options have been exercised.  Putting a value on those options is
something else.
   "It's not nearly as simple as the FASB has made it sound.  It's
going to be very costly," she says.  Not only will the software will
be expensive, but so will the consulting help Breetwor assumes
companies will need in making projections about stock price,
dividends, length of employee service and interest rates, all of which
are needed to feed the FASB model.   (Cheryl Breetwor, ShareData,
408/746-3666; Chris Paisley, 3Com, 408/764-5000.)
