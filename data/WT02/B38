TRENDWATCH:  BANKS FEAR RE-FINANCING OF SMALL BUSINESSES

THE YOUNG Thai banker was despondent. "The board thinks that anyone
seeking re-financing is potentially a bad debt case," he said,
recounting how the bank's board turned down a package he put together
to re-finance the business of a small property company.

"The company was paying 17 percent to a finance company for a 700
million baht ($16 million) project. They have had a five-year track
record of on-time payment," the banker said.

There was also a strong fee-based component. He had proposed a 400
million baht facility at 15 percent per annum, with a 1 percent
up-front fee and a 40 million baht revolving facility at half a
percentage maintenance fee per month.

The banker reckoned the deal was turned down because of his bank's
strongly conservative culture. A lack of competitiveness in the Thai
banking industry preclude large and established banks from moving
aggressively to capture new businesses away from other banks.

Around the region, sustained economic growth averaging 10 percent in
much of Asia has been creating a strong cohort of well-run small
businesses in growth industries.

A senior Malaysian banker told Asian Banker, "typically, a small
business that is begun with little more than the wits of the
entrepreneur would turn to factoring to manage its cash flow. A low end
financial institution may also be interested."

A Filipino banker admitted: "Often, it's a case of us not understanding
their business. In the Philippines, we'd rather lend to the
co-operatives who, in turn, lend to these small businesses." But even
with a strong track record, they continue to be viewed suspiciously by
bankers.

Finance companies in Malaysia and Thailand charge up to 4 percent over
published prime rates. When Filipino banks do lend directly to small
businesses, the rates are exorbitant, at 7 percent-8 percent over
prime.

The problem is that by the time these small businesses reach a stage of
maturity to warrant the interest of banks, the competition would have
become very tough. Competition at a mature stage is not only between
banks, but with non-bank financial institutions, the venture
capitalists, merchant banks and even other corporations.

Malaysia appears to have the most progressive environment of
competitive re-financing in the region. "Nobody advertises it aloud,"
the Malaysian banker said,"but it sometimes goes down to the level of a
bank asking to see the letter-of-offer of the original financier and
simply substituting that with a better offer." He joked that if the
original bank had a good reputation, the competitor would not need to
bother doing its own due diligence.

In Singapore and Hong Kong, government incentives play a critical role
in getting favourable terms for targeted small businesses they want to
promote. Singapore banks charge as low as a quarter percent over prime
for loans under the Local Enterprise Financing Scheme.

While the rates are attractive, such loans come with conditions that
can be restrictive if a company proves to grow very fast. What is
needed is a banking community that is as nimble as the fast-footed
entrepreneurs who are creating the economic miracles in the region.

CENTRAL BANKS RELY ON REGIONAL CO-OPERATION

Given that the world's three largest economies, the US, Japan and
Germany, have never been completely successful at thwarting speculative
assault against their currencies, what chance do five of the region's
central banks stand of doing so?

RECENTLY, five members of the 11-member Executive Meeting of East Asian
and Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), namely Australia, Hong Kong,
Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia, took the unprecedented step of
signing a series of bilateral "repo" agreements. The Monetary Authority
of Singapore, while deciding not to join its members, also set up
similar arrangements on a bilateral basis with the central banks of
Thailand and Indonesia to ameliorate the volatile influence of global
capital flows on exchange-rates.

The bilateral pacts, although not a carte blanc for central banks to
tap into the reserves of their neighbours, nevertheless allow signatory
countries to borrow from one another to boost their reserves in times
of crisis. This was in reflection of the Mexican peso crisis that led
to speculative assaults on a number of regional currencies.
Technically, it formally contracts the parties to raise US dollars from
one another against US Treasury securities.

Market watchers, however, are not convinced that these agreements will
result in central banks pooling their foreign exchange reserves.
Analysts highlighted the fact that the effectiveness of such measures
against potentially disruptive market speculation has never been put to
the test. It would certainly be sensible to think that no currency
would ever be immune to"attacks".

Economists say that the soundness of macroeconomic fundamentals and
policy prudence remain the ultimate guarantors of exchange system
stability. In its weekly economic update, the Union Bank of Switzerland
noted that even G3 (Japan, Germany and the US) co-ordinated
intervention works best when it aims to support market moves.

In a recent speech calling for greater co-operation between Asia's
central banks, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority, said the Mexican episode was a wakening bell to Asian
central bankers. This, he said, has made central bankers wonder: what
has changed for Asian monetary stability? What has remained the same?
What needs to change?

Yam believes that with open capital accounts, and significant foreign
direct and portfolio investments pouring into Asia, Asian currencies
have become susceptible to the global ebb and flow of financial
resources.

Players have also changed. The commercial bankers, who have always had
branches and offices in Asia, understand the region well. On the other
hand, new actors have appeared on centre stage in the last five years.
Securities houses, pension and mutual funds, investment banks and also
hedge funds have appeared in Asian markets.

In the face of these developments, central bankers believe that the
ability of central banks to stabilise exchange rates seems to have
slipped from their grasp. However, Yam noted that the sound
fundamentals in the Asian markets still hold.

What has also remained the same is that, as lenders of last resort,
central banks are in a position to dictate terms when eventually they
are asked to lend domestic currencies directly or indirectly to
speculators shorting their currencies.

In the aftermath of the Mexico crisis, an informal meeting of some of
the region's central banks concluded that it would be useful to
exchange information on market activities, to monitor the markets more
closely, to share knowledge and techniques on overall financial market
supervision, and to immunise the pain tolerance levels of the economy
in case it becomes necessary to inflict pain on the speculators.

At present, most Asian economies are keeping their exchange rates at a
low level in order to ensure export competitiveness. The most obvious
manifestation of this is reflected in the increase in the reserves of
some economies as a result of direct central bank intervention to hold
down their currencies.

Economists point to the fact that in terms of purchasing-power
parities, most Asian currencies, including those of China, India and
Thailand, are still grossly undervalued.

Another factor which impinges on the stability of some of the region's
exchange rates is the fact that most economies in the region are
growing huge current account deficits. However, current account
deficits in Asia mostly reflect foreign capital inflows which fuel
development.

The argument is that if these are mainly short-term portfolio capital,
then it is better to allow reserves to grow, as opposed to allowing an
increase in the exchange rate which may later fall when these
short-term capital flow elsewhere.

In the case of more long-term capital inflow, then a stronger exchange
rate is not such a bad proposition at all. However, the problem of
losing export competition due to a stronger currency will come back to
haunt the governments.

In the aftermath of the peso crisis last year, Indonesian stocks fell
to six-month lows amid concern that speculators were going to target
the rupiah. In the Philippines, the central bank raised rates to defend
the peso.

However, some feel that the move suggests inherent weaknesses in their
currencies. Some say that it only serves to raise more concerns in the
minds of investors, making matters worse not better.

HONG KONG FIRST TO GO RTGS

Nearly 30 years after banks in the US have been processing payments on
a real time basis, banks in Asia have finally taken the same route

THE HONG Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is confident that the colony's
high value transaction payment system will be able to go real time by
the end of this year. Almost all banks in Asia still settle their
interbank cheques and other payments mostly on a net overnight basis.
The system to be used by the HKMA will be similar to that used by the
Federal Reserves Board in the US, called FedWire.

While the US FedWire System has been settling payments on an Real Time
Gross Settlements (RTGS) system since 1968 and the Swiss have been
doing it since 1987, the HKMA began looking into this faster and safer
system to deal with rising interbank exposures only in 1993.

"The adoption of RTGS will immediately eliminate most of the legal
risks associated with bilateral or multi-lateral netting," Joseph Yam,
chief executive of HKMA, said at a payments system seminar organised by
the agency in Hong Kong late last year. "Settlement across the books of
the Hong Kong Monetary Authority will eliminate any doubt over credit
risks associated with commercial banks acting as settlement
institutions, however prudently these commercial banks are run."

RTGS enables settlements to be made on a payment-versus-payment basis
(see definitions box), so that there is virtually no exposure between
institutions at any point in the day. Experts believe that this in turn
eliminates what is known in large payment systems circles as "Herstatt
Risk". Coined in reference to the situation that arose from a major
settlement failure in the past, Herstatt Risk arises in foreign
exchange transactions when one counterparty delivers currency in one
time zone and receives value in the other currency in another time
zone. The risk arises out of the possibility that the counterparty who
delivers later may fail to settle.

According to Yam, Hong Kong adopted a "single tier architecture,
instead of the present three tier one, with every bank settling
directly across the books". The HKMA also plans to integrate its
Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMU) service, which is its book entry
securities system, directly with the RTGS system. So daylight
overdrafts incurred by the banks at the clearing account with the HKMA
will be fully collateralised with the Exchange Fund paper on a repo
(sell and buy-back) basis.

Yam believes that Hong Kong will be the first to settle its moneymarket
deals on this basis. "As far as I know, our RTGS system is one of the
first to be engineered with a seamless integration between the
settlement function and the government securities book entry function.
We will be happy to share our technical specifications on this and
other features with other central banks."

In December, it introduced the first of a series of enhancements for
its CMU by making it possible for end-of-day delivery versus payment
(DvP) facility for private sector debt securities lodged and cleared
with the CMU.

In January this year, the CMU announced it is also able to clear
foreign currency debt securities. "So far, the CMU only accepts Hong
Kong dollar debt securities because the CMU service is designed and set
up to promote the Hong Kong dollar debt market," Yam said. "However,
there is no reason why the CMU, which is already linked up with
EuroClear and Cedel, cannot widen its coverage to debt securities
denominated in foreign currency."

The DvP function will be made available to all CMU instruments,
including exchange fund bills and notes, private sector debt
securities, on a real time and end-of-day settlement basis when the
entire RTGS system goes live at the end of 1996.

Hong Kong chose to build its RTGS settlement system on top of its
existing large value fund transfer system called CHATS. The decision to
build on CHATS was taken because it would have taken a long time to
build a new system from scratch and also because it was possible to
build on a system that banks in Hong Kong were already familiar with.
The new RTGS system would have clocked a mere 24 months in installation
time.

Small banks are able to access the HKMA's RTGS using a simple personal
computer. It is also possible for the larger banks to interface their
own complex systems with RTGS through existing AS400 computer systems.

Introducing RTGS was especially tricky in Hong Kong as the colony's 180
licensed banks operate on a three tier clearing structure. The top
layer comprises Hong Kong Bank, which plays the role of the management
bank of the clearing house. Hong Kong Bank also owns and runs the
current CHATS system. The second layer comprises a number of settlement
banks and the third layer comprises the sub-settlement banks. The RTGS
system was implemented by a joint venture company called the Hong Kong
Inter-bank Clearing Limited, which is 50:50 owned by the HKMA and the
Hong Kong Association of Banks.

Hong Kong set the end of 1996 as the target to complete its RTGS system
for two reasons. The first reason being that the Federal Reserve Board
of the United States had already announced that the operating hours of
its own FedWire system was to be extended to 18 hours. As this would
extend the time into Asian trading hours, the HKMA wanted to have a
system that could complete cross-currency transactions on a
payment-versus-payment (PvP) basis.

The second reason was to tie in with the targeted completion of the
China National Automated Payment Systems for the renminbi in 1997. Both
the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi are important currencies, as the
Hong Kong dollar is linked to the US dollar based on a monetary policy
objective and to the renminbi through extensive trade.

RTGS on a global basis?

While daily inter-bank Hong Kong dollar transactions constitute $15
billion, foreign exchange transactions are in the order of $91 billion
a day. Although most Asian transactions are currently with US and
European counter-parties, the growth in intra-Asian trade is expected
to increase regional transactions tremendously.

Between 1990 and 1994, the number of SWIFT messages recording financial
flows around the world increased by 9.1 percent, but total messages for
the Asia Pacific region alone grew more than twice that rate at nearly
14.6 percent.

The question naturally arises if a global RTGS payment system will
arise any time soon. "A robust network of global cross-border payments
can only be built on robust domestic payment systems," Yam said. He
also thinks that some countries are ahead of others in this respect.

Yam believes that RTGS linkages between countries should be developed
on a bilateral, instead of a multi-lateral, basis. It is not possible
to internationalise or harmonise payment systems even among G10
countries because of different agendas in each of them. The legal and
structural constraints will be too many to handle all at once. "It is
in the two economies own direct interests to build a bilateral linkage
with each other, and this could be achieved with much greater ease."

Furthermore, PvP linkages are better achieved either indirectly via
private sector banks or directly with linkages of two RTGS systems
together. A US payment systems expert, Bruce Summers, recently proposed
that central banks can act as"matching agencies" by examining the
payments originated by users of the service and releasing such payments
only when a well-defined set of conditions are met. This method is one
way of reducing Herstatt risks without involving central banks in new
types of credit risks.

How the HKMA's RTGS System will work

HONG KONG'S new RTGS system will adopt a Y-shaped flow as indicated in
the diagram above. All banks will have direct access to the system. The
advantage of this flow method is to keep the system simple and direct.
There is no routing of information or value via any other intermediary.

A bank will send in its full payment instruction (including the value
and information on the customer) to a Central Transaction Processor.
The processor will"strip" the details of the customer. Only the
settlement instruction (i.e the information on the amount, the payee
and recipient banks) on the Settlement Account Processor will be passed
on to the Settlement Account Processor and known by the HKMA.

All payments will have to be settled on an individual and gross basis.
As the system will have no provisions for daylight overdraft, banks
without sufficient clearing balance (or securities for repos) will be
queued in the system until the bank meets the liquidity requirement.
All payments cleared by the HKMA will then be final and irrevocable.

Intra-day liquidity is created by the seamless integration with the
Central MoneyMarket Unit book entry securities clearing and settlement
system. This interface enables banks to develop same day repos.

INDONESIAN BANKS STILL VULNERABLE

Even as the government works at introducing prudential measures to
strengthen the country's banking industry, Indonesian banks still have
a long way to go, according to a recent report by Standard & Poor's

HIGH NON-PERFORMING assets continue to hang over Indonesia's banking
system. Rating agencies have flagged caution in dealing with the banks
in this country for at least five to seven years. Standard & Poor's
(S&P) notes that Indonesia's banking industry is underpinned by a
potentially more volatile, albeit developing, economy and should
attract more caution than the banking system of other countries.

At this stage of its economic development, Indonesia is overbanked,
said S&P in an assessment report. The industry has 240 commercial banks
with average assets per bank of $500 million. On an international
comparison, this implies an excess number of banks and a lack of
operating efficiency among small to mid-sized banks.

Recent data collated by Asian Banker suggest that in spite of the large
number of banks in Indonesia, the penetration level is still very low.
When viewed in the perspective of the archipelago's 17,000 islands and
190 million population, there are only 1.3 banks per million people and
24.3 branches per million.

This branch penetration level compares very poorly even with its
nearest comparison. The Philippines has a penetration of 41.8 branches
per million population. At the other end of the scale, Hong Kong has
the highest penetration with 261.4 branches per million.

The low branch penetration is matched by the extremely low average
asset size for Indonesian banks, which is a mere $0.66 billion per bank
branch as compared to $54.6 billion in Japan and $10.44 billion for
Thailand. The impression created by this data is that the basis for
concern should not be based on the asset quality of any one small
Indonesian bank but on the knock-on effect that any lack of confidence
would have.

It is exactly this concern that the rating agencies talk about.
Standard & Poor's believes that undercapitalisation of small banks may
have a knock-on effect on mid-sized banks. This is because the smaller
banks in Indonesia are in the practice of obtaining funds from the
larger banks on the inter-bank money markets. This gives the larger
banks an arbitrage in the market because of their stronger financial
position.

Under a World Bank-assisted "Action Plan", the Indonesian Government
helped the state-owned banks to increase their paid-up capitalisation
to Rp1 trillion ($455 million). Private sector banks are also in the
process of building their capital base to meet the new capital adequacy
ratio (CAR) of 8 percent. In addition, private banks with foreign
exchange licences will have to increase their capital to Rp150 billion
and CAR of 12 percent by the year 2001.

Banks in Indonesia, however, play a greater role in the country's
economic development as compared to other countries. Viewed from a
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) perspective, there are 3.6 banks to every
$10 billion GDP. Japanese banks account for only 0.56 banks to every
$10 billion GDP in that country.

While this does imply that Indonesian banks are in a better position to
benefit from the 8 percent-10 percent growth in the GDP in recent
years, the converse is also true. If there is any let up in the growth
of the country's economy, the banking industry will suffer more than
the Japanese banks are experiencing currently.

Bank Indonesia issued a directive in September 1995 that commercial
banks holding foreign-exchange licences have to increase their paid up
capital to Rp150 billion by September 2001. This is expected to cause
smaller banks to merge in order to meet the higher capitalisation
requirements.

Standard & Poor's is also concerned about the banking community's
exposure to finance companies. The number of finance companies has
proliferated in recent years. Finance companies in Indonesia operate
outside the ambit of the central bank and are disallowed from accepting
public deposits. They are funded primarily through bank borrowings. S&P
is concerned that banks lending to finance companies are indirectly
taking on finance companies loan portfolio, which is inherently much
weaker than that of the banking industry.

But Bank Indonesia has been introducing tighter supervision and a
clearer accounting framework to improve the transparency in the
industry. The only concern is that banks generally delay the release of
audited statements.

"Many commercial banks still do not disclose non-performing loans,"
said S&P in an evaluation of the Indonesian banking industry. The
agency is concerned that loans are concentrated towards affiliates and
large borrowers. There is also high exposure to office and condominium
projects. Lippo Bank experienced a crisis situation in late 1995 when
it was unable to manage its own fundings of the large property
development projects undertaken by its own affiliate property
companies.

Equities analysts, however, feel that if the government's strengthening
efforts pay off, several Indonesian banks will ride the strong economic
growth predicted for the country. Analysts predict that loans would
grow by 30 percent-40 percent last year, and that average earnings
would have grown by about 25 percent. Bank Dagang Nasional Indonesia,
Panin Bank and Bank Bali have been identified as being fundamentally
strong.

However, the lack of depth in the capital market makes it difficult for
banks to meet their obligations in a timely and cost efficient manner.
S&P's assessment is that"banks bearing the brunt of problem loans are
not likely to recover, unaided, to full fiscal health for at least five
to seven years".

DBS BANK STREAMLINES FOR THE FUTURE

The Development Bank of Singapore recently restructured its top
management in a move that is expected to generate greater
accountability for product lines

THE KEY feature of the recent reorganisation move by the Development
Bank of Singapore (DBS Bank) is the stronger vertical reporting lines.

The two top positions will be taken by Ng Kee Choe and Lau Chan Sin. Ng
will be responsible for the entire institutional banking side of the
business while Lau will be in charge of individual banking, which will
include the retail and private banking businesses.

The heads of the bank's retail and private banking divisions,
respectively Elsie Foh and Tan Mong Tong, will report directly to Lau.
This is expected to give them greater leverage at the top level of the
bank's management to respond to changes more quickly.

Similarly, Ng Kee Choe will have Tan Soo Nan reporting to him on
treasury and investment management activities, and Soh Kim Soon
reporting on international and corporate banking. Oliver Tan, another
senior executive vice president, will take over special projects from
January 1, reporting directly to the chairman, Ngiam Tong Dow.

DBS Bank has been introducing new initiatives in rapid succession
lately. On the retail front, it recently extended opening hours to 5pm
from the traditional 3pm for other banks, as a result of greater
efficiencies in the branch network. This is in addition to the
authorised trading centres and investment centres it set up last year.
In investment banking, the bank achieved distinction in becoming the
region's leader in advisory and underwriting portfolios.

The bank is also already working out an expansion plan across the
region. It has obtained banking licences in Shanghai (China), Sri
Lanka, Thailand (provincial licence in Rayong) and the Philippines. The
notable exception is Malaysia, where DBS Bank is the only Big Four
Singapore bank without a full banking licence in the neighbouring
country. However, it has set up representative offices in Bombay,
Rangoon, and Labuan (an offshore centre in Malaysia).

DBS Bank is particularly active in the securities industries in most of
the regional markets, particularly Hong Kong, Indonesia and Thailand.
DBS has a strong custodian business in its home market as well as in
Malaysia. In December, it set up a custodian joint venture in Thailand
with the Thai Danu Bank. Ng announced the bank's plan to expand its
share custodian services network to South Korea, Indonesia, the
Philippines and India.

Singapore banks have had a strong reputation of being adequately
capitalised. Although profitability has not been one of their strong
points, things have been improving in the last two years.

According to analyst reports, the combined return on equity of the Big
Four banks for the year ended 1994 was 13.3 percent, up from 9.9
percent the previous year.

As the Singapore economy matures and competition for funds becomes more
intense, banks are becoming more cognisant about shareholder value. The
capital surplus position of Singapore banks and the returns from
non-bank activities, such as investment and property holdings, also
puts them in a good position to acquire new businesses.

A DBS Bank spokesperson told Asian Banker that there is no overriding
motive in the restructuring exercise. In typical public relations
parlance, she said the move "is part of our ongoing renewal process".
The bank did not hire any consultants to advise it on the changes in
the top management line up.

This is in contrast with at least two of the other Big Four banks,
which have been using consultants quite extensively. The leading edge
retail banking initiatives in UOB Bank, such as its InvestShops, were
treated as special projects, with consultants from Andersen Consulting
reporting directly to the president.

OCBC Bank, on the other hand, appointed McKinsey & Co as consultants to
develop a new strategic focus for the organisation. One observer told
Asian Banker that as McKinsey specialises in high level strategy
issues, OCBC Bank is being forced to speak to other consultancy
companies to propose new implementation initiatives.

The overall business and organisational direction, strategies and
policies of DBS Bank will now be driven by a"Bank Business Committee".
It will be chaired by chairman Ngiam Tong Dow, with the deputy
presidents and senior executive vice presidents as members. This small
task force approach is expected to help the management to take decisive
and timely measures to respond to new challenges in the market. It will
also keep management meetings short and sweet.

BANKS PUSH ON WITH DIRECT TRADING

Malaysia's stockbroking community did not take too long to realise that
new delivery channels through PALDirect and Southern Bank Link may
threaten their very existence

TONG KOOI Ong, the 35-year-old chief executive officer of Malaysia's
Phileo Allied Group, has much in common with PALDirect, the genius
product of the group's subsidiary, AlliedBank. Both are essentially
brash, new innovations into a market that has yet to wake up to the
realisation that the brave new world has already arrived.

PALDirect was designed primarily to give stock market players direct
control over their trade. Through a dedicated terminal, the bank's
customers are able to place their trades on-line to Phileo Allied, the
bank's broking subsidiary, which then executes it.

As the entire transaction is carried out within the group, PhileoAllied
is able to give AlliedBank a rebate of 25 percent of the 1 percent
brokerage commission that was due to it under securities regulations.
The bank in turn passes on 20 percent to the customer and keeps 5
percent for itself.

Any banker looking at the arrangement would recognise the genius
involved in running a transaction through several organisations, using
technology that enables all parties to be winners - the bank adds value
to its customer services, the stockbroking company gets trade orders,
and the customer benefits from lower overall costs and greater
convenience.

But the Malaysian stockbroking community panicked. The immediate fear
was that if the system was perpetuated, brokers would lose their market
share and remisiers would have become essentially redundant. The Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), possibly acting on pressure from the
stockbroking community, issued a directive to PhileoAllied Securities
to stop passing down the commission to AlliedBank.

The KLSE based its directive on the exchange's Rule 6(7) that specifies
that rebates can be only given to approved financial institutions. The
KLSE further interpreted the rule as saying that this rebate can only
be enjoyed by the financial institution and not passed down further to
its customers.

Tong, true to form, went on the offensive. He applied for a court
ruling on the interpretation of the rule against devolving commission
to customers. The financial community was, at best, amused as nobody
had ever taken the stock exchange to court before.

The upshot of the offensive was that Tong was able to call the KLSE's
bluff. The court application was subsequently dropped after an
undisclosed out-of-court agreement and PALDirect continued unaffected.

The issue that arose out of this skirmish is of a more fundamental
interest to the financial community and deserves some thinking through.
Firstly, does PALDirect enable banks to enter the stockbrokers' trade
without a licence? Secondly, do these computers in remote locations
become de facto "branches" of stockbroking houses? This is significant
because of the restriction in many countries against stockbrokers
expanding their branch networks, particularly into remote areas.

Malaysia does have many remisiers - 5,000 licensed remisiers at the
last count a few months ago. This is almost half the number of people
working in the entire banking industry in the labour scarce country.
Remisiers come from a variety of backgrounds - from housewives to
highly-qualified professionals. All are lured by the opportunity to
make much more money in passing share certificates around than through
pursuits that could build much needed skills in other areas of the
country's development.

At the height of the stock market's bull run in the early 1990s, the
lack of Remisiers called for urgent technological innovations, although
none was forthcoming at the time. Small retail customers had to beg
remisiers to take on their trade. All this turned with the market. The
market itself became more sophisticated with unit trusts and other
long-term investment products becoming available and affordable.

Remisiers generally fear that PALDirect is setting a precedent. Already
two other Malaysian banks are said to be interested in developing
similar products. Although the stockbrokers that Asian Banker spoke to
are generally dismissive about PALDirect, there is no reason why they
too cannot go on the offensive.

Southern Bank Securities, a small stockbroking company located in the
unlikely town of Ipoh 200 kilometres north of the capital city of Kuala
Lumpur, has also recently introduced a system similar to PALDirect.
Called Southern Bank Link (SBL), the system sits on any personal
computer running the Windows operating system (as compared to
PALDirect's "dedicated" terminals).

Brokers are far from losing their jobs too soon. Both SBL and PALDirect
still require brokers as, in effect, customers actually place their
orders with them to be executed on-line to the stock exchange.
Remisiers also remain useful where contra trade is involved. In
Singapore, where retail investors can trade using automated teller
machines, transactions have to be settled immediately. This is
unfavourable as compared to trading through a broker where customers
have a settlement period of T+7 days, during which time they can deal
in contra trades.

In the case of PALDirect, the entry level for direct trade is set very
high. Customers are expected to maintain an interest-earning fixed
deposit of RM198,000 ($79,200) to have the PALDirect link-up for free.
Alternatively, they will have to pay RM6138 ($2,455) over 31 months for
the terminal and RM98 every month after that as maintenance fee. SBL
customers on the other hand pay only RM250 per month, although this
broking house does not pass on savings to the customer. These
arrangements could only interest the most liquid and active of retail
investors.

The managers of both products say they hope to attract the"middle to
high level players" on the stock market. This includes fund managers
and sophisticated investors who want greater control over their trade
positions. Although neither was willing to disclose the number of
customers they have signed up, it is believed they are each aiming at
approximately 1,000 customers within a year from their respective
launch dates.

While not all brokers and remisiers are about to lose their jobs, those
who will survive will be the ones that prove that they add greater
value than the machines that threaten their relevance.

INTERNATIONAL DEBIT MAKES ITS DEBUT

An international consumer debit payment industry is about to take off
in Asia, now that the major card organisations and terminal
manufacturers are introducing major initiatives in the region

UNTIL RECENTLY, when bank customers travelled abroad, the only
effective card-based payment channel had been the use of a credit card
- either at the ATM for cash advances or at point of sale for credit
card sales.

The two card organisations, MasterCard International and VISA
International, are currently at the forefront of major initiatives that
can see the use of international debit cards (the international version
of the domestic ATM card or the electronic funds transfer at point of
sale) take off in Asia, and around the world.

Debit cards provide consumers with an alternative to cash, cheques,
travellers cheques or even converting currencies when they travel.
Officials from both MasterCard and VISA told Asian Banker they are
convinced that international debit cards are not alternatives to credit
cards and will not cannibalise this market.

Andre Sekulic, the senior vice president of MasterCard's debit card
programme in the region, told Asian Banker that studies in the US show
that well over 60 percent of all payments made in the US are still
based on cash.

The banks benefit by being able to add value to their depositors'
lifestyle in a tangible way while earning fees on transactions. The
merchants benefit from the incremental sales generated by impulse
buying. Experts also believe that merchant receipts are higher as a
result.

John Hinds, the executive vice president of Verifone, a transaction
automation company, said the debit system is safer, and transactions
are completed on-line, which is faster than cheque and even cash
transactions where money has to be moved around.

The safety of a debit card transaction is based on the PIN-based
technology introduced by transaction automation companies such as
Verifone. Card users are required to key in their personal
identification numbers (PIN) into a "PIN-pad" before a transaction is
authorised. In most instances, the same PIN is used for ATM-related
transactions.

Market growth

It is likely that the international debit programmes of both card
organisations will depend largely on the link-ups they make with the
major domestic networks services in the region. This is also because
the major networks already have in place, or are building, domestic
debit programmes that would be severely disrupted if international
debit is introduced alongside them.

For example, the Network for Electronic Transfer (NETS) in Singapore
was concerned that non-participating banks would be able to effectively
access these networks if card holders were able to use their
international debit cards within the same country. Because of this, the
banking authorities in Singapore disallowed domestic card holders from
using their international debit cards within the country.

Henry Mundt, MasterCard's director for Global Debit Services, estimates
that by the end of 1995, there would be 750,000 terminals accepting
Maestro cards globally. Out of this number, he expects that 250,000
terminals would be operational in co-operation with networks such as
NETS.

In Taiwan, the Financial Information System Centre (FISC), which
provided the national domestic debit card network, is still
contemplating its involvement in international debit. Silvia Lee,
FISC's executive vice president, said Maestro is obviously something
which it has a keen interest in, except that right now the organisation
is concentrating on its own IC Card-based EFTPOS system.

The IC Card is a smart card-based ATM-cum-debit card which FISC
introduced in 1993. Currently, more than 400,000 of the cards have been
issued by its 19 member banks. The system has a merchant base of some
4,000.

FISC is now in direct competition with the National Credit Card Centre
(NCCC) which previously processed only credit card transactions. The
NCCC has announced that it expects to start international debit
acquiring activities in early 1996 by signing on with Maestro. NCCC
expects to build its debit programme on its existing credit card
merchant base exceeding 60,000 organisations.

The NCCC has applied to be the switching and settlement centre for all
domestic Maestro transactions. At present, Chinatrust Commercial Bank
is the only Maestro acquirer in the country. Sources said that because
of unresolved issues pertaining to interchange and switching functions,
the Ministry of Finance has restricted the other banks from acquiring
merchants. However, the NCCC and FISC have been instructed by the
Ministry of Finance to co-operate on a programme that will allow all
card transactions to be settled domestically.

The other Maestro issuing banks have understandably pushed for the
lifting of the restriction. Observers see the assignment of the
transaction processing function to NCCC as a possible solution to the
question of who should be responsible for the domestic processing of
Maestro transactions.

This will then pave the way for the other institutions to be involved
in merchant acquisition. So far there are an estimated 1,000 merchant
locations that accept the Maestro debit facility in the country. An
estimated 400,000 Maestro cards have been issued.

In China, what have been dubbed as MasterCard and VISA credit cards,
are actually at best deferred debit transactions - that is, customers
pay for their transactions from their salary accounts held with the
bank.

The controversy over the definition is not as significant as the fact
that it means China is potentially the largest debit card market in the
world. The Chinese Government, responding to a World Bank study on the
development of payment systems in the country, has been committed to
developing a nationwide cashless payment system. This commitment is
expressed in the development of the Golden Card project.

In Malaysia, MasterCard launched its Maestro/Cirrus programme through
two organisations in 1993. It hopes to issue 500,000 international
debit cards in the country by the end of 1995. MasterCard's Mundt told
Asian Banker that there are already 5,000 Maestro acceptance locations,
mostly at petrol kiosks, in Malaysia.

The banks currently issuing the Maestro/Cirrus cards are MBf Cards
Services, a non-bank issuer which pegged the card on its existing
Vision bank card, and Standard Chartered Bank.

Maestro went on-line in the Philippines as an extension of the BPI
Express Payment System debit programme. Link-ups are expected with
Jetco, the domestic point of sale debit switch provider in Hong Kong.

Cost issues

Tim Molly, a director with VISA International, said that merchants
accepting Maestro transactions will have to pay acquirers transaction
fees that are similar to fees for credit card transactions.

Mei-may Lek Bors, a debit programme director with MasterCard, told
Asian Banker that debit programmes offer profit opportunities to
acquiring institutions in the form of higher interchange fees, a new
source of merchant revenue, and the overall lower implementation cost.
For issuing members, the profit opportunities arise from interchange
fees, transaction fees and annual membership fees.

In Australia, where direct debit initiatives were driven by the
merchants in the past, it was the banks that paid the merchants to
acquire their transactions. This was called the "negative interchange
fees" and was thought to be the trend that would develop.

However, Jim Culbertson, the VISA country manager for Australia, told
Asian Banker that this situation was unique to Australia and only in
the past when the merchants originally invested in the technology. This
trend is being reversed in Australia as smaller merchants sign up with
banks that have already got the infrastructure in place. As such, it is
the merchants that now have to pay transaction fees to the acquiring
banks.

There are cost benefits also for the customer. MasterCard's Mundt told
Asian Banker in an interview that in 1995 alone, there were 330 million
credit and debit cross-border transactions around the world. Seventy
percent, or 210 million, of those transactions were for cash withdrawal
on ATMs.

Mundt also pointed out that customers would benefit from the lower
exchange rates used for debit products and save between $5 to $10 per
transaction. He is convinced that the market would welcome a cheaper
debit-based service that would enable them to access cash from their
own home accounts.

Transaction equipment manufacturers

Hypercom, which accounts for 90 percent of the credit card verification
devices market, and its competitor VeriFone, which accounted for 60
percent of all new installations exported from the US in 1994, are both
believed to be making major advances in the area of developing common
terminal acceptance for debit as well as credit and smart cards.

Other competitors in the market are Taiwanese-based ADI, France-based
Ingenico and the Australian company KeyCorp. Domestic competitors  such
as Fuzhou's Star Group are also coming on-stream.

Connecting to smart cards

All debit card players in the market have an eye towards building a
smart card capability in their overall cards strategy. Adding a chip on
a debit card is beneficial as it enhances the security of transactions,
whether they are credit or debit and can be loaded with value. These
are also called electronic purses.

There are other benefits of smart cards, such as the ability to store
relationship data with merchants and the bank. This has been
successfully exploited by major retail organisations such as
Takashimaya in Singapore which has issued up to 200,000 cards to date.

This is why transaction automation players such as Verifone are keen to
push terminals in the market that can process smart card as well as
cards with the traditional magnetic strip on them. Verifone has also
set up a joint venture marketing company with the smart card
manufacturer GemPlus, called VeriGem, to promote the move towards a
smart card-based payments system.

Which way now?

MasterCard's Mundt told Asian Banker that MasterCard will not allow
Maestro to be resident on the same card as the MasterCard credit card,
at least not in the foreseeable future. He also said that MasterCard
would not allow duality to participating institutions. This means that
issuers would not be allowed to put MasterCard's Maestro and VISA's
Interlink on the same debit card.

He is convinced that having a credit and a direct debit facility on one
card will cause confusion to users and merchants, particularly in
markets where direct debit facilities are not yet available. Mundt told
Asian Banker that MasterCard may reverse this policy if there is
worldwide availability of account select between credit and debit
transactions at merchant's EFTPOS terminals. This policy is significant
as it is different from the relationship card strategy taken by VISA,
which allows all facilities to be resident on one card.

So which way will the banks and financial institutions go in Asia?
Francois Dutray, the group executive vice president of VISA
International responsible for product development, told Asian Banker
that "we can't make the members do what they don't want to do".

Both organisations will obviously push their international debit cards
as one of the products to member associations. The cards market may
well have enough space for credit and debit products to co-exist side
by side successfully in the near future.

MASTERCARD INTERNATIONAL

MEI-MAY LEK Bors, director of MasterCard's Debit Card Programme in
Southeast Asia, revealed at a Verifone seminar late last year that
1,444 institutions in 58 countries worldwide have signed up to
participate in the Maestro programme. The programme has gone live in 28
countries and 168 million cards have been issued for use on 536,271
point of sale terminals.

In the Asia Pacific region alone, 80 member institutions have signed up
for Maestro involving 29,392 million committed cards and 8,375 million
live cards. Out of 96,197 point of sale terminals which have been
committed, 25,920 have gone live. Around the region, 51,778 merchants
have committed to the programme out of which 15,552 have gone live.

According to MasterCard, there are 9 million active Maestro cards in
the Asia Pacific region and another 43.5 million cards committed. This
is supported by more than 24,000 terminals in the region and 505,000
terminals worldwide.

According to Henry Mundt, MasterCard's director for Global Debit
Services, in total there are 110 million debit cards in MasterCard's
Maestro and Cirrus programmes around the world. He expects the Asia
Pacific region to be the fastest growing for the organisation
worldwide. The region will commit approximately 16 million live cards
by the end of 1995.

VISA INTERNATIONAL

ACCORDING TO Eric Trotter a director with VISA International is a
relatively new player in the region's international debit market. VISA
Plus is its ATM access card and VISA Interlink is its debit card for
use at EFTPOS terminals.

The Interlink programme is better developed in Australia than other
countries in the region. Fifty-eight banks have signed up to the
programme in that country. In Asia itself, Singapore is the first
country in the region to introduce the VISA Interlink card.

Elsewhere, Interlink will be introduced in Korea (going live in
November), Malaysia (five members issuing), Thailand (working with Thai
Farmers' Bank and Thai Military Bank to acquire Interlink transactions,
while four out of the top six banks already issue such cards), Hong
Kong (three projects), Singapore (first full issuing and acquiring
project with UOB Bank) and Taiwan (four banks have signed up). He also
mentioned initiatives in New Zealand, Indonesia and the Philippines.

THE MASTERCARD-VERIFONE ALLIANCE PROGRAMME

IN AUGUST this year, MasterCard and Verifone announced a joint
marketing alliance to promote the acquisition of on-line debit
transaction equipment by banks for use at merchant points of sale.
Under the scheme, discounts and bonuses are given for selected Verifone
systems for deployment in targeted merchants such as fast food
restaurants, supermarkets, pharmacies, petrol kiosks and other retail
outlets. The Verifone terminals being promoted are the Omni 395
Transaction Automation System, a printer roll, and/or Printer 950 and
the PINpad 1000 entry device.

The combination supports credit, debit and smart card transactions, all
on the same system. The Printer 950 also supports Japanese, Chinese and
Korean languages as well as supporting customised printing.

Verifone is also committed to provide training and support services to
support the successful take up of the new technology.

CLIENT/SERVER - THE NEW COMPUTING PARADIGM?

Asian Banker investigates the impact of client/server technology, and
highlights some of the key issues that banks should be looking at

EVERY ORGANISATION, including banks, wants to know, in measurable
terms, that the benefits derived from their investments in information
technology should exceed, if not at least equal, the costs involved.
With new technology the task of justifying such investment becomes even
harder. The task becomes even more tedious when one considers
client/server technology.

Although significant cost savings may be available in automating an
application on a client/server rather than a mainframe system, the cost
savings may not be as pronounced when comparing mid-range systems to
client/servers. Many mid-range systems are priced to compete with
larger multi-workstation LANs (local area networks), and the
development tools and the on-line security features available on
mid-range systems may be more advanced than the client/servers.
Similarly, fully-featured turnkey application software may be generally
available on a mid-range system, while client/server-based application
software may lack the functionality desired by larger financial
institutions.

Organisation-wide application systems are generally less attractive
candidates for downsizing to client/servers than department
applications. Departmental applications tend to have a limited number
of users and less sophisticated database and integration requirements
than organisation-wide systems. Consequently, these systems can be
moved to client/server architecture with less risk and less potential
negative impact on the organisation as a whole.

Moving to a client/server architecture may not be a difficult process.
Data extraction tools, file transfer tools, query languages,
downloading and uploading tools, and PC interface products all
contribute to the cultural change necessary to implement client/server
technology. The next step is providing graphical user interfaces to end
users so data can be represented in a more "user friendly" format -
with charts, graphs and other pictorial representations.

Some productivity gains may be found with client/server technology.
Mainframe development time has long been the Achilles' heel of
mainframe computing - and the most significant reason for considering
platform changes. Lengthy development time equates to high costs, unmet
expectations and dissatisfied end users. Client/server architecture
offers the advantage of quickly addressing minimum systems requirement
and providing tools that can be implemented by the end user with
limited technical support involvement.

Ideally, the use of client/server technology will help an organisation
better utilise the equipment already in place. Most organisations have
significant investments in personal computer-based systems, which are
often used for"resource sharing" - that is, local area networks set up
to share hardware resources, which may be under-utilised in the
client/server context.

Client/server architecture provides the capability for the front-end
portion of major application to be processed on a LAN, while the
back-end portion of the application can reside on the mainframe system.
Each system should be dependent on the other for the transfer and
communication of timely information, and together they should form the
entire application system.

US-based IT magazine Computerworld recently cited a survey by Sentry
Market Research, which found 70 percent of IT shops predicting that
client/server will ultimately be their primary computing model. In
Asia, although no similar survey has been carried out, industry
watchers believe that within the next two to five years, large Asian
banks will start to deploy client/servers in the more mission critical
and higher volume back-office applications.

While most client/server implementations have occurred in selected
applications, organisations are now focused on moving mission critical,
strategic applications towards client/server technology.

As the market moves towards the new paradigm, there are many lessons to
be learned from earlier experiences with the technology. Earlier
implementators of client/server technology found that the costs
involved far exceeded what was budgeted, especially labour, networking
and training bills. Worse, the expected benefits were hard to measure
and quantify. Productivity and improved customer service were
attributes which were simply impossible to be put on the balance sheet
and analyse.

One of the prime movers behind client/servers technology has been the
business unit managers who have profit and loss responsibilities.
Tasked and under pressure to realise ever increasing revenues and
income targets, these managers see client/server as the technological
enabler that will bring about faster and more prolific product
development, improved customer service and decreased costs.

Client/server may or may not provide the tool that is needed to achieve
these goals. However, the question can only be ultimately answered when
systems are fully deployed.

The implementation of client/server systems may improve productivity of
the organisation's non-technical resources as well as technical
resources. Client/server systems should provide tools for the end user
for data extraction, reporting and graphical interfaces. In some cases,
both technical and non-technical personnel will have access to CASE
(computer-aided software engineering) tools for developing and
enhancing client/server applications.

Although mainframe processing work load can be reduced through
client/server technology, this is not the area of greatest benefit to
the organisation. Data integrity may be improved by providing an
environment where information is created and maintained closer to the
user department responsible for information ownership. Through good
application controls, this information in detailed form can be
available to many user departments, but controlled through security
practices and procedures. Duplicate information and dispersed
information, which may lack consistency and accuracy, could be
minimised with proper design of the application.

While client/server architecture offers some significant benefits to
the organisation, it also can have disadvantages. Application
maintenance when dealing with several platforms, data structure and
programming languages could increase the complexity of the change.
Consequently, CASE tools that embrace departmental and host processing
requirements are important to minimise ongoing support and maintenance
of client/server systems. In addition, the lack of standards for
client/server technology may reduce the consistency of applications.

Ultimately, the lack of standards impacts the speed of modification and
implementation when application requirements need to change. Some de
facto standards already exist in the industry, such as the UNIX or
Novell operating systems for server operating software and SQL
(structured query language) for interfacing and accessing various
database systems. However, more specific standards may be needed for
the organisation to ensure proper control over the development and
implementation process. This can be achieved through a standards
committee, which would be responsible for identifying standards for the
organisation.

SOVEREIGN RISK: BANK DEPOSITS V. BONDS

Moody's explains why it maintains foreign currency bank deposit
ceilings that are distinct from foreign currency sovereign ceilings

IN OUR view, the two ratings (a foreign currency bank deposit rating
and a foreign currency sovereignity rating) are needed to reflect
inherent differences in the credit risks of bank deposits versus bonds.

As sovereign ceilings, both types of ratings are intended to account
for foreign currency transfer risk - the risk that no matter how
creditworthy a given borrower domiciled in the nation may be, that
borrower always remains subject to transfer risks.

On the basis of both empirical evidence and analytical considerations,
we believe that foreign currency transfer risk applies somewhat
differently to bonds and notes than it does to foreign currency bank
deposits, especially as we move down the ratings scale.

Specifically, a review of worldwide sovereign default experience since
World War II shows that when sovereign nations have defaulted on any of
their foreign currency obligations (in our concept of default we
include missed or delayed disbursement of interest and/or principal,
and/or obligatory credit maintenance arrangements), they have been more
likely to default on bank deposits and commercial loans than on
sovereign bonds or notes.

Put differently, when sovereigns have come under sufficient financial
stress to default on foreign commercial loans, if they have had any
significant amount of foreign currency bank deposits, they have usually
also defaulted on these deposits -but not necessarily on their
sovereign bonds.

In fact, we have concluded that the overall risk that a particular
country will "reschedule" foreign currency deposits comes very close to
equalling the overall risk that country will becoming involved in any
type of foreign currency debt rescheduling. The risk of a bond default
has been significantly lower.

There are several key reasons for this. For one, the consequences of
defaulting on (ie. rescheduling) bank deposits or loans has been more
predictable and potentially far less detrimental to a nation's
interests than defaulting on bonds and notes. In addition, it is clear
in international law that a foreign currency bank deposit is generally
within the purview of the country where it is located. Thus, a
government that forces a rescheduling of foreign currency bank deposits
through changes in its foreign exchange policy is unlikely to face a
successful legal challenge to its action from depositors.

By contrast, given the erosion of the older concept of sovereign
immunity since World War II, the legal immunity of sovereign who
defaults on foreign currency bonds has become considerably more
problematical than it once was.

Increasingly, defaulting sovereigns will face determined legal
challenges from bond-holders armed and encouraged by such developments
as the 1992 US Supreme Court case of Argentina v. Weltover, which
sanctioned an action brought against a sovereign borrower in a US
Court, Great Britain's State Immunity Act of 1978, which limited claims
of sovereign immunity, and the European Convention on Sovereign
Immunity which has also codified limits to claims of sovereign
immunity.

Given this risk differential, we are likely to maintain foreign
currency bank deposit ceilings that are in some cases lower than our
ratings for sovereign bonds and notes, While these ratings will tend in
practice to be identical in the case of countries characterised by high
credit quality - due to small differences in the two risks for
countries at the higher end of the ratings scale - they may diverge in
the case of countries in the lower investment grade or below investment
grade range.

The conceptual framework

In order to establish foreign currency bank deposit ceilings that are
distinct from currency sovereign ceilings, several preliminary tasks
are required, including: 1) an examination of what distinguishes
sovereign borrowers from other borrowers; 2) an empirical analysis of
sovereign default experience; and 3) an examination of implications of
the changing legal and economic framework for sovereign borrowing.

As indicated in this report, the legal framework surrounding sovereign
default has evolved considerably since 1945.

In the prewar period, countries enjoyed near-total immunity from
lawsuits. That is no longer true in the US, the UK, or throughout most
of Europe.

A good way to start a technical discussion is to lay out first
principles. By now, although most investors have become comfortable
with the concept of foreign currency sovereign ceiling, it is still
always worth defining our terms to avoid any misunderstanding.

What is sovereignty?

The first thing we should ask ourselves here is what is meant by
"sovereign"? According to Webster's dictionary, the possession of
sovereignty means having "supreme power, especially over a body politic
what distinguishes sovereign borrowers from all other creditors.

The self-image of sovereign states, and the way that sovereign states
view each other, have changed in many important ways over the
centuries. During various periods in history, sovereignty has lain with
villages, towns, cities and tribes. At some points sovereignty became
associated with entire empires. In the modern period, sovereignty has
become a property almost exclusively of the nation state, a relatively
recent political development. Since nation states did not appear
spontaneously, but rather emerged over time, it should not be
surprising that the nature of nation-state sovereignty has evolved and
mutated as circumstances have changed.

Freedom from a higher authority is clearly an important characteristic
of sovereignty. However, as we know from history, powerful states have
often influenced events in weaker ones through military, economic,
and/or diplomatic means.

What appears to be relevant since 1945 is that military intervention by
one state against another is no longer considered to be an acceptable
modus operandi, except for the gravest of reasons. Prior to 1945,
nations often used military force for all sorts of reasons: colonial
ambitions, ideology, territorial expansion, etc. In some cases,
countries resorted to military intervention to insure repayment of
foreign debts.

To realise how international convention has changed, one need only
consider that in today's world no one would ever propose military
intervention to deal with a sovereign state that was unable to meet its
foreign currency obligations on a timely basis, in contrast to the 19th
and early 20th centuries, when such measures were resorted to on
several occasions.

In recent decades we have seen the development of a greater respect for
national sovereignty. For instance, international boundaries are now
generally considered inviolate, as is a government's right to
non-interference in its domestic political affairs - except perhaps
when basic human rights are grossly threatened. Ironically, at the same
time, increased international co-operation has in practice tended to
reduce actual expressions of sovereignty.

Economic co-operation, economic integration, economic interdependence
all are creating a situation in which new limitations upon sovereignty
are evolving. A perfect example of this development is the development
is the changing relationship between commercial law and sovereign
states.

Any credit analysis must take into account not only a debtor's ability
- but also its willingness - to repay. Determining a country's ability
to repay is in the end not very difficult task. In all but the most
extreme cases, countries have the ability to repay their debts.

This may appear surprising to anyone who lived through the debit crisis
of the 1980s, let alone the economic devastation of 1930s. But in fact,
no matter what their economic status, countries usually have the
resources needed to repay their debts. However, as John Moody pointed
in 1933, when discussing depression-era sovereign defaults, "Many
[sovereigns] were confronted with the choice between suspension of debt
services or almost complete elimination of imports." As he noted,
import reduction could only be taken so far. If imports declined beyond
a certain point, governments faced the possibility of political
unrest.[1] The real question is - what level of resource mobilisation
are governments willing to undertake in order to repay their debts? In
the end, willingness to repay is the key to sovereign credit analysis.
And here we do not mean merely the desire to repay, but rather the
desire coupled with willingness to bear the consequences of repayment.

Governments may not like the economic and/or political consequences of
policies which would enable them to meet payments on their debts. There
is often a kind of conventional wisdom regarding the degree of
sacrifice which should be required in order for a sovereign to remain
current. In the final analysis, the nature of the "willingness issue"
is what distinguishes commercial from sovereign borrowers.

If a commercial borrower lacks willingness, legal sanctions up to and
including asset seizure and liquidation are available to creditors.
However, in cases where sovereign borrowers refused to pay - or as is
more likely the case, refuse to repay according to original terms -
they are immune from most of the legal sanctions available to creditors
vis-a-vis non-sovereign borrowers. Obviously, sovereign borrowers
cannot be forced into bankruptcy.

Until recently, foreign sovereign borrowers could not even be brought
into court in the world's major financial centres. Even now, attaching
sovereign assets is seldom seen as a viable option. Fortunately for
creditors, however, other less drastic sanctions, which will be
discussed below, appear to preclude frivolous sovereign defaults.

More importantly, there are many incentives for sovereigns to maintain
their creditworthiness. For instance, a creditworthy sovereign borrower
has much lower borrowing costs than one which has a poor credit
history. Economic conditions which contribute to sovereign
creditworthiness are also often associated with more rapid economic
growth. The more rapid the rise in income, generally the happier is a
national body politic. Unless subject to considerable stress, sovereign
borrowers clearly would prefer to meet their financial obligations on a
timely basis.

Sovereign ceilings

Sovereign ceilings for bonds and notes represent the highest foreign
currency rating an issuer might have where the obligor is subject to
the sovereignty of a particular government. Such ratings are based upon
the default risk for medium and/or long-term debt obligations issued by
a national government (denominated in a foreign currency), either in
its own name or with a guarantee. Put differently, it represents the
"foreign currency transfer risk" associated with investing in a
particular country.

In cases where there is no particular debt obligation outstanding, a
sovereign ceiling rating could still be issued based on an assessment
of risk posed by a national government if it were to issue a foreign
currency obligation.

We consider such obligations to represent the lowest foreign currency
default risk within a country. The reason: a national government,
through its ability to mobilise foreign currency assets within its own
domain, has almost by definition the best ability to obtain foreign
exchange of any issuer within the country. For instance, governments
may, and often have, imposed foreign exchange controls. Governments
may, and often have, instituted foreign currency deposit regulations
aimed at capturing foreign exchange within the country. The tools
available to a government to gain access to foreign exchange are well
established and clearly recognised under international law.

Private issuers often have argued that their obligations posed a lower
risk than those of their own government in this regard because of their
special circumstances. Although we always explore each case on an
individual basis, in the end, if the issuer is subject to the law of
its home government, even if its activities are mainly undertaken
outside the home country, we have found that the issuer is in fact
still subject to the foreign currency sovereign ceiling. The foreign
currency sovereign ceiling does not necessarily represent the risk of
the establishment of exchange controls.

Nor does it necessarily represent the risk of rescheduling bank loans.
Rather, it represents simply the assessment of default risk on medium
and long-term debt foreign currency marketable debt obligations of
national governments, which in our view carry, in almost all
circumstances, the lowest foreign currency default risk in that
particular country.

Sovereign ceilings for foreign currency bank deposits represent the
default risk of: 1) foreign currency- denominated bank deposits held
within a country; 2) deposits with a branch of a foreign bank located
in the particular country; 3) deposits with a foreign branch of a bank
domiciled in that country. A foreign currency bank deposit in any
foreign-currency-denominated deposit (eg. in Mexico, any deposit
denominated in any currency except the peso) in any domestic bank or
foreign bank branch located in the country. (A foreign currency deposit
held with Citibank's Mexico City branch office would be subject to the
Mexican foreign currency bank deposit ceiling.)

It also includes any foreign-currency denominated deposits in foreign
branches of the country's banks. A Japanese yen deposit in the New York
branch of a Mexican bank would be subject to default risk posed either
by US or Mexican government.

But since the bank is subject to the laws of its home country, in this
case Mexican, any legal actions taken by the Mexican government may
have an impact upon the bank's ability to meet its foreign currency
obligations anywhere in the world, despite the deposit being located in
the US. Therefore, the Mexico foreign currency bank deposit ceiling
would apply, despite the deposit's US location.

Looked at from a different angle, since the Mexican bank's foreign
currency deposit rating is limited by the Mexican sovereign ceiling for
the bank deposits, the ratings on deposits by Mexican financial
institutions anywhere in the world are limited by the rating of foreign
currency deposits of the bank in its home country.

A default on a foreign currency bank deposit would be judged to occur
if the government mandated credit maintenance facilities, which means
that if any depositor withdraws a deposit, the depositor must
immediately redeposit/relend the same amount as was withdrawn (eg. a
requirement whereby a maturing certificate or CD must be replaced by
the purchase of new CD or provide other credit equal to the amount of
maturing CD).

What do we mean by "default"?

Moody's defines default as any missed or delayed disbursement of
interest and/or principal. We include as defaults distressed exchanges
where: (1) the issuer offers bondholders of depositors a new security
of package of securities the amount to a diminished financial
obligation (such as preferred or common stock, debt with a lower coupon
or par amount, or less liquid deposit either because of a change in
maturity or currency of denomination, or required credit maintenance
facilities) and (2) the exchange has the apparent purpose of helping
the borrower avoid default.

Moody's also classifies as a default when an issuer delays payment even
when payment is ultimately made within the grace period provided for in
an indenture or deposit agreement. Our rationale for including grace
period defaults is simply that a contractual payment was not made when
due.

It is important to keep this definition in mind, because many
commentators use"default" in a much narrower sense, that is, in the
legal context of creditor actually declaring a debtor in default on a
particular obligation, resulting in a judgment by a court in favour of
the creditor.

Anyone who examines the post-World War II period will quickly recognise
the significant practical difference between what we mean by default
and what a judge might determine to be a default in a legal proceeding.
This analysis will provide some explanations of why creditors, in
recent year, have not declared sovereign debtors in default, even when
these same sovereigns would have been considered in default using our
criteria.

Empirical evidence

Since the debt crisis of the 1980s, there has been a tremendous
resurgence of interest in pre-World War II sovereign defaults. This is
certainly understandable, for analysing the past is always useful in
providing insights into possible future developments. Now that we have
once again entered a period where sovereign borrowers - in particular
most of the world's significant developing countries - have returned to
international bond markets in a big way, many observers see the threat
of a repeat of the sovereign defaults of the 1930s as an object lesson
for what might lie ahead for creditors.

Others see the experience of the 1980s, where sovereign defaults on
bonds or other publicly traded securities were relatively rare, as a
clear indication that such sovereign securities are now substantially
immune from default risk. When we examine the history of both the
prewar period and the debt crisis of the 1980s in the light of the
structural changes which have occurred in the financial and legal
framework of international capital markets since 1945, a much more
complex picture emerges. (Editor's Note: Due to space constraint, we
are unable to publish the full and interesting examination of the
history of defaults, but subscribers may request for a full version of
this comment.)

Although in 1980 official creditors still supplied a greater amount of
credit than commercial banks or bond markets did, the marginal increase
in lending in the decade was dramatically higher for commercial banks -
from about 10 percent of the total in 1970 to 40 percent in 1980 - than
for official creditors. The increase in the relative importance of
bonds as a source of funds for the LDC's was modest.

The Debt Crisis

Mexico's debt moratorium began a period where defaulting on sovereign
debt to commercial creditors became a rather commonplace occurrence
both in the developing world and among the socialist or former
socialist countries, with over the years, several hundred billion
dollars worth of credits falling into default.

This was due to a combination of economic pressures, including a
disinflationary commodity price environment, credit quality problems
emerging in the domestic markets of the major creditor nations (eg. the
savings and load industry's restructuring due to a changing interest
rate and regulatory environment in the US), and the emergence of
economic bottlenecks in the more advanced socialist economies. All
told, approximately 50 countries have defaulted on their sovereign and
commercial obligations since August 1982 (vs. 27 countries from 1960 to
1982). Many of these countries have had to reschedule more than once.
During this time period, we have also seen reschedulings of previously
rescheduled debt. A number of countries have had a portion of their
debt forgiven by commercial creditors in recent year. A similar pattern
emerges when examining official credits.

One category of debt which seemed, according to many, to have escaped
default during the crisis of the 1980s was bonds or other marketable
security debt. Unfortunately, on closer examination, this does not
prove to be the case - at least not to the degree generally believed.
Beyond the Costa Rican, Polish, and Rhodesian (Zimbabwe) defaults,
which predate August 1982, after a careful search into the records, we
have found that six additional countries defaulted on foreign currency,
marketable securities debt.

Changes in the Legal Framework since WWII

While changes have been occurring in the structure of world financial
markets, other important changes have also been taking place which
impact the whole question of sovereign risk. One of the most important
changes has been the growth of restrictions on appeals to sovereign
immunity.

This development, on the surface, seems counterintuitive, especially
during a period when nation-states have increasingly tried to respect
the right of other nation-states. The reasons are quite
straightforward.

If sovereign immunity were absolute, then any contract with a company
wholly-owned by a foreign government would be unenforceable in a court.
This was not only the disadvantage of the non-sovereign participant to
a contract, but also would put publicly-owned companies at a
disadvantage in international trade. The risk of entering into
contracts with them would be too great in many instances.

Therefore, it was to the advantage of both sovereign-owned firms and
non-sovereign firms for sovereign-owned companies not to be considered
fully protected by appeals to sovereign immunity So for the first time,
sovereign states had a vested interest in seeing their own sovereign
immunity curtailed in order that their newly acquired
commercial/industrial activities might prosper.

As time passed, more and more activities were felt to be outside the
traditional sovereign immunity sphere. Although these developments
began to emerge gradually through individual legal decisions, some of
these changes became codified in the US in the Sovereign Immunities Act
of 1976, and in the UK in the State Immunity Act of 1978, and by
international agreement in the European Convention on State Immunity.

Despite these relatively recent attempts to codify sovereign immunity
questions, major points of contention still remain, resulting, as one
would expect in this increasingly litigious world, in various lawsuits,
some of which helped illuminate certain aspects of the remaining
problems.

Default Experience, 1960-1982

Although most observers would not characterise this period as
particularly turbulent in terms of sovereign defaults, on careful
examination one finds more defaults than conventional wisdom would
seem to indicate.

Debt to official creditors:  During this period, at least 22
countries defaulted on debt to official creditors. (As pointed out
earlier our definition of default includes reschedulings.)

Countries Which Defaulted On Official Creditor Debt,
1960-August 1982

Argentina
Pakistan
Brazil
Peru
Central African Republic
Poland
Chile
Romania
Gabon
Senegal
Ghana
Sierra Leone
India
Sudan
Indonesia
Togo
Liberia
Turkey
Madagascar
Uganda
Nicaragua
Zaire

Commercial Bank Debt: During this same time period, at least 17
countries defaulted on debt owed to commercial banks. There is no
evidence that any of these other countries were ever legally
declared "in default" by a court of law, with one exception. In 1979
a major New York bank declared Iran in default and succeeded in
setting off deposits against the unpaid loan.[13] This default
occurred as a result of sanctions being placed against Iran. The
issue was later settled by negotiation.

Countries Which Defaulted On Foreign Currency Marketable Securities
1970-1990

Argentina
Costa Rica
Guatemala
Nigeria
Panama
Poland
Rhodesia (Zimbabwe)
Uruguay
Yugoslavia

Argentina defaulted on bonds (bonods). Guatemala restructured its
stabilisation bond debt. Nigeria defaulted on government-guaranteed
promissory notes. Panama defaulted on both bonds and floating rate
notes. Uruguay defaulted on bearer treasury bonds. Yugoslavia
defaulted on short-term bonds. Therefore, although it is clear that
since the 1970s, at least, marketable security debt has defaulted
less the risk of default of sovereign marketable security debt is
negligible.

Countries Which Defaulted On Commercial Bank Debt 1960-August 1982

Argentina
Poland*
Bolivia
Rhodesia*
Costa Rica*
Romania
Iran
Senegal
Liberia
Sudan
Madagascar
Togo
Nicaragua
Turkey
Peru
Zaire
Philippines

* Also defaulted on bonds or notes.

Bonds and Notes: It was much rarer for governments to default on
foreign-currency-denominated bonds or notes between 1960 and August
1982. But it did happen. Specifically, Costa Rica, Poland and
Rhodesia (present-day Zimbabwe) all defaulted on international bonds
and/or notes. We have found no evidence that either Costa Rica or
Poland were legally declared in default on marketable securities
although it has been reported that creditors did go to court in
Switzerland to try to remedy a default by Bank Handlowy (Poland's
official foreign trade bank).[14] It is not clear from our search of
the published records whether there was ever a formal default
judgment made against Rhodesia. Rhodesia's default is easily
explained by the civil war and the burden of international
sanctions. Costa Rica and Poland's defaults were related to economic
/political developments within both countries. Altogether, then,
from 1960 to 1982, at least 22 countries defaulted/rescheduled
against official creditors, 17 countries against commercial banks,
with just three defaulting on marketable securities. However, the
aggregate amount of credit involved, however, although difficult to
measure from public sources, was nonetheless small enough so that
the international financial system was in no way threatened by any
of these defaults/reschedulings. But once Mexico announced its
payments moratorium in August 1982, sovereign credits entered a new
phase.

HANA BANK COMPLETES ISSUE OF FLOATING RATE NOTES

Hana Bank completed an issue of $50 million floating rate notes (FRNs).
The interest margin of Hana Bank's borrowing dropped from a 46 basis
point in 1994 to a 42 basis point in 1995 over the six-month London
interbank offered rate. The cost of funding for some Korean banks
soared from 39 to 45 basis points, resulting in some banks scrapping
their fund raising plans. The rise of the loan rates was due to
the"Japanese premium". Hana Bank will use $30 million for domestic
lending and the rest for offshore offices in Southeast Asia.

CITYTRUST SHARE OFFER

Ayala Corp, including the bank of the Philippine Islands, will join
Madrigal Group for the exercise of the latter's rights over Citytrust
Banking shares. Citytrust shares held by Citibank Overseas Investment
and Philex Mining have been offered for sale. The exact number of
shares up for sale had not been disclosed by the time Asian Banker went
to press. Citibank currently has a 47 percent stake in Citytrust and
Philex holds 17 percent. Only partial sales will be up for sale as both
parties will keep enough shares to maintain at least one board seat
each in the ten-person Citytrust board. Madrigal Group has the upper
edge because it already has a 16 percent stake in Citytrust, making it
the third-largest shareholder after Citibank and Philex. Ayala wants to
have an equal footing eventually with Madrigal in Citytrust.

TAIWAN'S BIG THREE GOVERNMENT BANKS ANNOUNCE LOWER PROFITS

Taiwan's Big Three government banks announced lower July-November
pre-tax profits for 1995 amid an overall slowdown in Taiwan's financial
industry. First Commercial Bank's pre-tax profit declined by 14 percent
to T$2.80 billion ($102.6 million) from T$3.24 billion a year earlier.
Hua Nan Commercial Bank's pre-tax profit sagged 22 percent to T$2.65
billion from T$3.4 billion. Chang Commercial Bank reported a 4.7
percent decline to T$2.42 billion from T$2.54 billion. The Taiwan
Provincial Government plans to privatise the Big Three banks by early
1997. Currently, the government owns 71.35 percent of First Bank
shares, 57.83 percent of Hua Nan Bank and 53.01 percent of Chang
Commercial Bank. Taiwan's 59 offshore banking units, or OBUs, jumped
20.2 percent to a record $34.599 billion at the end of October 1995
from a year earlier.

NEW YORK CITY PLANS TO SECURITIZE TAX LIENS

The nascent movement among municipalities to securitize delinquent
property taxes took a major step forward last week when New York City
stepped into the fray, requesting proposals from investment banks on how
best to securitize $200 million to $250 million of tax liens; it would be
the biggest such securitization ever.
        The city has approximately 250,000 properties with tax arrears
totaling over $2 billion, according to a request-for-proposal document; and
it is looking for a team of two to four bankers to underwrite the senior
notes, expected to receive an investment grade rating.
        Although the document states that an objective is to complete the
transaction by April 15 -- a timetable one source described as "pretty
tight" -- the letter also cautions that the implementation and completion
of any transaction is subject to the New York City Council's enactment of
pending legislation to permit bulk lien sales. WR Lazard & Co. is the
city's advisor.
        A source at City Hall said one of the main goals of the pending
legislation and securitization is to "enforce taxes" and remove the city as
the lender of last resort, which is what it essentially becomes when
someone falls behind on his property taxes.
        The proposed issue will be backed by the higher quality tax liens,
mostly commercial real estate with a high likelihood of repayment.
        According to the city, the proposed and subsequent securitizations
will accomplish four things: to increase the cash flow from delinquent tax
liens; provide an efficient real property tax enforcement mechanism;
increase the current property tax collection rate; and reduce the need for
the city to assume ownership of properties in tax arrears.
        "The sale of liens represents a faster, cheaper, and more efficient
method to enforce property tax collection than the ... foreclosure process
the City currently uses. Tax lien sales will enable the City to restore
fairness to the property tax collection system, maintain and improve
collection rates, generate additional cash for operations, and relieve
upward pressure on property taxes. Key to the success of a long-term sale
program will be the initial securitization," the request for proposals
states.
Choosing Bankers
        The issue will be sold to institutional investors, but unlike a
traditional private placement, it will be fully underwritten by the
investment banks, which will assume some risk. It will not be a best-
efforts transaction, the source at City Hall said. The raised capital will
be funneled into the city's operations fund.
The deadline for bankers to submit proposals to the city was last Friday,
and a team of underwriters is expected to be chosen in about two weeks.
        The document asks bankers to describe their experience implementing
new products such as tax lien securitizations. And the list of those with
specific tax lien securitization experience is quite short.
        Most recently, Smith Barney priced a $19 million issue for the City
of New Haven, Conn., in the fall. Chemical Securities worked on New York
City's securitization of cash flows from delinquent tax liens a couple of
years ago and CS First Boston has structured deals for Jersey City.

LATIN AMERICAN ABS SEEN STABILIZING AFTER SURGE IN '95

Securitization of future cash flows in Latin America hit an all-
time high last year of  almost $3 billion. Although securitization of
future receivables may post a moderate gain in 1996, the market is unlikely
to see the same level of expansion, industry sources said last week.
        Duff & Phelps estimates that around $2.8 billion in new future flow
transactions were issued last year, up from around $1.5 billion the
previous year.
        "1995 was an extraordinary year," said Michael Moran, assistant
vice president. "It won't be that good this year, but we're projecting
moderate growth," he added. New issuers will learn about securitization
thanks to high profile deals from companies like YPF, Moran said. And
investment bankers searching for new business in Latin America will
cultivate securitized transactions, resulting in slightly greater volume
this year.
        Investment bankers note, however, that securitized volume is always
dependent on the Eurobond market. If Latin American issuers have access to
that market, many find it more economical.
        Following the Mexican peso crisis at the end of 1994, Latin
American issuers were essentially shut out of the Euromarket and
securitized volume grew dramatically as a result in 1995.
        This year, the door to the Euromarket may open a crack, noted one
banker active in securitization. Indeed, Mexico already tapped that sector
with a DM 1 billion bond two weeks ago which was reportedly well-received.
        "As conditions improve in the Eurobond market, future receivable
securitization will inevitably decline," the banker said. But Mexico is
still perceived as risky overall, with BB ratings from Duff & Phelps and
Standard & Poor's. "Mexican issuers will still use securitization," he
predicted.
        Ultimately, as countries in Latin America reach investment grade,
they will switch altogether to Eurobonds from future cash flow deals. At
that time, these countries will probably be ready to develop their own
domestic asset-backed markets.
        However, "this could be a ten-year process," one banker said, and
there may be several more cycles for future flow securitizations in the
coming years as a result.

INVESTORS BULLISH ON ABS PROSPECTS IN '96

Despite the general tightening of spreads in 1995, fixed-income
investors are inclined to increase their allocations to asset-backed
securities in the year ahead, according to preliminary results from a
survey conducted by Asset Sales Report and MBIA Insurance Corp.  Final
tallies will be presented next week at the American Banker/Asset Sales
Report 11th Annual Asset Securitization Conference in Naples, Fla.
        Of the 13 institutional investors responding, 11 said they are
ready to put still more money into ABS even though 10 of the 13 believe
that spreads will at best remain near current levels and could widen out in
1996. Only one institution expected to cut its allocation to ABS and one
said that it was unsure at this point whether it would increase or decrease
its commitment to the area.
        Despite near unanimity about their commitment to ABS, investors
were clearly more ambivalent about the prospects for interest rates and the
economy. Of the 13 respondents, seven predicted higher long-term Treasury
rates and six projected a drop.
        An averaged forecast from the group would put the long Treasury
rate at about 6.18% at year-end 1996, or almost exactly where it was at
last Wednesday's close. At the time the first surveys were distributed in
late November, the long Treasury yield was at 6.30%.
        Similarly,  seven expected that GDP will rise in 1996 while six
foresaw a decline. An averaged growth forecast from the 13  put GDP at a
gain of just under 1% in 1996. There were no projections at either the high
growth (above 4%) or sharp decline (-4%) ends of the spectrum.
        Among the new asset classes that investors showed some interest in
were home improvement loans and subprime auto loan-backed securities. In
each case, more investors indicated that they would buy the securities in
1996 than actually did participate in 1995.
        Other areas mentioned were securities backed by 12b-1 fees
generated by mutual funds and franchise-backed securities. Asset classes
that elicited caution from the investor group included timeshares, future
receivables, subprime auto loans (appearing on both lists) and Latin
American securitizations. In each case, more than three investors said that
they would not consider participating in these kinds of deals.
        Although not listed as a choice in the survey, three investors
wrote in to say they would not consider healthcare receivable-backed issues
in the year ahead, possibly owing to the well-publicized fraud in Towers'
deals two years ago as well as the complexity of the asset itself.
        Overall, however, investors expect to see even more asset-backed
supply in the year ahead. All 13 respondents said they expect at least $100
billion in new issuance this year, while 10 said that volume should exceed
$110 billion. Two even projected that issuance would top the $130 billion
mark. Interestingly, the investors as a group were more bullish on this
year's issuance level than investment bankers.
        Final details on investors' and others' forecasts for 1996 market
will appear in next week's issue of ASR.

FIRST CREDIT CARD ISSUES ENJOY SMOOTH RECEPTION

Three credit card issuers broke the ice in 1996, issuing around
$2.5 billion in new securities last week. All of the deals benefited from
pent-up investor demand including the first zero coupon asset-backed bond
from Citibank.
        Advanta's $466 million deal was fully sold just after pricing,
reportedly purchased with new cash, while Discover's transaction was
upsized by 100% to $1 billion.
        In each case, the deals were structured to appeal to more than one
sector of the asset-backed market or to bring in new investors entirely.
        Citibank's novel transaction was priced late Thursday through lead
manager Goldman Sachs at 37 bps over Treasury strip of February 2001 and
was quoted at around 37-38 bps over the five-year Treasury bond--on top of
five-year credit card securities. Priced at a discount of 74.817237, the
bonds yield 5.861%.
        The offering attracted around a dozen new investors to the asset-
backed market, mainly zero coupon buyers, traders said. "The interesting
thing is that this is probably the most liquid zero coupon paper in that
market," one syndicate official noted. The 6% subordinate tranche, also a
zero, was priced 15 bps behind the senior securities by lead manager
Merrill Lynch. (Full structure and pricing details will follow next week.)
        On Wednesday, Discover basked in the limelight with a five-year
floater; the issuer tapped into two investor bases, according to an
official at lead manager Dean Witter. Five-years is short enough for U.S.
buyers and although European buyers tend to buy longer-term securities, the
Discover bonds appealed to this sector as well, he noted.
        "We put in a $500 million deal and went to $1 billion without
giving up anything on the pricing," the official said. It was priced at par
with a coupon of 17 basis points over Libor, and once freed to trade, was
bid there.
        At the same time, Salomon Brothers sold two seven-year senior
classes for Advanta, one fixed and one floating-rate, using a structure
almost identical to the issuer's five-year Series 1995-F in November,
except for the maturity and the higher credit enhancement level.
        The combined fixed and floating-rate structure "allows us to tap
into two different investor bases," explained Mike Coco, director of credit
card securitization at Advanta. Issuing a fixed-rate bond was especially
attractive with interest rates so low, he added.
        The enhancement level was 100 bps higher than Series 1995-F because
of the longer maturity. Standard & Poor's "raises the enhancement level for
credit card securities with terms longer than five years," explained Ray
Galkowski, head of the credit card ratings group at S&P. Although he did
not comment on the Advanta deal specifically, Galkowski said the rating
agency holds that there is an increase in risk the longer the maturity, and
that the five-year term marks a natural dividing point.
        The additional support was all within the collateral interest which
was rated BBB by Fitch Investors Service. Because Fitch did not require
more enhancement for the longer maturity on the deal, it assigned a higher
rating of A+ to the subordinate tranche, according to analyst Mike Dean.
        Coco anticipated that Advanta's volume for 1996 would be close to
last year's level of $3 billion.

FASIT CAUGHT IN BUDGET QUAGMIRE

As the U.S. budget talks continue, the fate of the Financial Asset
Securitization Investment Trust (FASIT) is hanging in the balance. While
proponents are optimistic, inclusion of the FASIT in the final legislation
is not ensured.
        "We're caught in the political crossfire," said Donald B. Susswein,
partner at Thacher, Profitt & Wood, who worked on the proposal. The FASIT
would extend many of the benefits of the REMIC to non-mortgage assets and
was first proposed as legislation two years ago.
        Dampening its chances for passage with the budget package, the
FASIT proposal was placed on the Clinton administration's list of
"objectionable special interest" provisions in the Budget late last month.
However, nine Democratic members of the House Ways and Means Committee
responded quickly with a letter to White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta,
arguing the merits of the FASIT proposal.
        "In testimony before the Committee on Ways and Means, Treasury
stated that it did not oppose the FASIT legislation," the letter states.
"Treasury and the Administration have also consistently supported asset
securitization, included in the context of the Community Development Bank
bill." In addition, it concludes, "FASIT is also a revenue raiser."

COMMENTS TO FASB FOCUS ON REPOS

As the deadline to comment on FASB's exposure draft on
securitization draws near, the Board has received about 25 comments, mostly
pertaining to repurchase agreements and requesting to testify at a public
hearing in February.
        Comments on the proposal, "Accounting for Transfers of Financial
Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," are due January 22.
        According to the commments received, the new rule would
dramatically limit banks' use of repurchase agreements, a major source of
funding, especially in light of the Board's recent tightening of financial
accounting standard 115.
        The exposure draft was issued around the same time that FASB
provided banks a window to transfer securities currently classified as held
to maturity into the available-for-sale category without a penalty. The
window of opportunity in FAS 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in
Debt and Equity Securities," closed at the end of 1995, after which such
transfers are prohibited.
        As a result, a number of banking institutions put longer-term repos
into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealized gains and losses
needn't be marked to market. However, the proposed statement would require
any repos with a maturity of three months or more to recorded as a sale,
and hence marked to market. Banks would thereby be limited to using repos
with maturities of less than three months to avoid increasing volatility in
their capital bases, and any longer transactions existing when the rule
comes into effect would suddenly have to appear in the income statement.
FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit on repos is a period
that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because the Board believed that
the vast majority of repo transactions held far shorter maturities. "We've
since learned that there are more transactions with durations around three
months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, the project manager at FASB.
The Board will likely reconsider the three-month limit as it continues its
deliberations.

CITIBANK'S MASTER TRUST RENAMED

Citibank changed the name of its master trust last week to Citibank
Credit Card Master Trust I as part of an effort at the bank to increase
name recognition
        Since 1991, the trust was known as Standard Credit Card Master
Trust I. All deals issued from the trust will now carry the name Citibank,
including its first deal of the year, a $1 billion zero coupon bond last
week.
        With an estimated $44 billion in credit card receivables, Citibank
is the largest issuer of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in the world.

FLOATING-RATE SECURITIES WELL-BID AS NEW ISSUANCE BEGINS

After a two-day hiatus due to snowstorms on the East Coast, new
issuance got off to a strong start last week and players were bracing for a
blizzard of another sort: another year of credit card issuance.
         Despite expectations for increased supply, spreads in the
secondary market held ground, with floating-rate securities enjoying
renewed demand.
        "Once the trigger is pulled on the first deal, others will follow
quickly," said one rating agency analyst. Indeed, three credit card deals
were priced last week in quick succession: Discover, Advanta, and Citibank.
        Despite the addition of $1 billion in new five-year floaters from
Discover, floaters remained well-bid. The deal was priced "aggressively" at
17 basis points over Libor and held at that level once it was free to trade
last week, one investment banker noted.
        In general, floaters looked inexpensive compared with fixed-rate
bonds on a swap basis, and as a result, dealers and investors were taking
advantage of the opportunity last week, traders said.
        Fixed-rate securities suffered neglect as a result of that
opportunity. In addition, one trader said that "investors are apathetic to
Treasuries right now and the market in general is backing off."
        The five-year, fixed-rate sector, which suffered from oversupply in
the fourth quarter and widened a few basis points as a result, was holding
at around 37 bps to 38 bps over Treasuries.
        Advanta's seven-year fixed-rate deal, totaling $220 million, was
priced at 46 bps over Treasury, but was softer when freed to trade, sources
said. With interest rates so low, investors were apparently not overly
enthused with longer-term, fixed-rate securities; the floating-rate portion
of the Advanta deal went very well, traders agreed.
        Home equity loan securities, which had also widened significantly
during the fourth quarter, tightened at the end of the year and have held,
said one trader. Three-year pass-through securities were quoted at between
105 bps and 115 bps over Treasury depending on the specific issuer. Three-
year tranched paper was quoted at around 85-90 bps.

CREDIT CARD ABS WEAKER: MOODY'S

Delinquencies on securitized credit card portfolios rose in October
to 4.23% from 4.17% in September. Overall, "performance continued to
decline," said Moody's analyst Ed Bankole, who prepared the credit card
index (see page 5).
        Charge-offs were slightly lower in October but still represent the
highest levels of the year with the exception of September. Thanks to
higher portfolio yield of 18.07%, excess spread moved up to 5.42% from
4.80%.

CHARMING ABS STEADIER IF UNCERTAIN

Although the retailer faced fears of impending bankruptcy just
months ago, Charming Shoppes securities could rebound significantly, with
Salomon Brothers analyst Paul Jablansky now categorizing the issues as
"likely to generate among the best returns in the three-year sector of the
credit card ABS market."
        The Bensalem, Penn. based outfit reached a definitive agreement
last month with Congress Financial Corp.  whereby  Congress will provide
Charming with a $157 million asset-based working capital facility for a
term of 2.5 years.
        Under this arrangement, Charming has successfully restructured $83
million of bank debt with existing lenders and substantially extended the
typical 90-day letter of credit.
        Recently estimated with a spread over 80bp for a 3-year term,
Jablansky says the ABS is now "priced at a level that still heavily weights
the likelihood of a bankruptcy--and a subsequent early amortization event--
during the next 18 months."
        Other analysts are not so sure. "It may be compelling, but I'd have
to see a lot of evidence to be convinced," said one source.
        "At this point I'd say it continues to be an outlier, pretty hairy
and likely to underperform."
        In the first nine months of 1995, Charming experienced a comparable
sales decline of 22% in its nationwide chain of Fashion Bug and Fashion Bug
Plus women's clothing stores as rumors of its fiscal troubles drove spreads
40-50 bp wide on its single public credit card securitization.
        With the new financing agreement, the retailer is "virtually
assured" of remaining solvent through the offering's maturity, optimistic
sources said.
        Jablansky adds: "The likelihood (of insolvency) is arguably no
greater than that of other retailers, whose credit card ABS trade at
significantly tighter spreads...the actual probabilities of any of these
early amortization scenarios are well below our arbitrary assumption of
50%."
        Any potential divergence from this forecast, Jablansky argues,
would stem from the fact that "the holiday season was not good for
retailers overall.
        The performance of the retail sector as it influences the bond
market is something Charming Shoppes will have to face as would any other
retailer."

NOMURA'S TRAIN DEAL CLOSELY WATCHED AS EURO PIPELINE BUILDS

Overseas securitization engines were sputtering back to life last week
after the traditional new year's lull.  While the flow of deals is expected
to be thin this early in the new quarter and year, a number of deals are
heard to be in the pipeline for later months.
        The deal garnering the most interest from securitization desks has
been Nomura's zero coupon train lease deal. Expected to receive triple-A
ratings from Duff & Phelps, the deal totals about $726 million (ASR
12/4/96). The transaction is expected to price this week, but participants
were reluctant to discuss details since it carries a private Rule 144a
tranche for sale in the United States.
        The structure of the deal creates securities from a series of small
government payments of about $9 million each over 98 months. Those
payments, essentially a series of bullets, are to be bought by investors
who will then typically find their own swap counterparties to gain floating
funding. Securitization experts expressed concern that the deal's failure
to include an internal swap counterparty would lead to illiquidity.
        Syndicate desks will be eyeing the 144a structure of the deal in
the coming months with a view toward the larger potential rail lease
markets in Britain and elsewhere.
Goldman Loses Three ABS Pros
        The struggle for mandates this early in the season has led to some
key horseraces between premier U.K. desks. The Bank of Kuwait was set to
award its mandate late last week for a second deal. The first from Kuwait
occurred last year, as Goldman Sachs led a deal which was relatively well
received. This time around, Goldman appears to have had some competitors.
Chief among them was Lehman Brothers, whose proposal appeared to be in the
running.
        The chief reasons for Goldman's failure to win the mandate outright
appeared to be its slew of departures in recent weeks, capped by this
week's news that the head of securitization John Van Deventer had left. Van
Deventer's destination is not known, though it appears he will not be
joining another big firm. Van Deventer's departure, coupled with those of
two junior analysts last week, added to the perception that Goldman's
resources have been depleted. Executive director Roger Barris will assume
Van Deventer's responsibilities.
        The UBK deal itself will be sized at about $100 million pounds
sterling. It will be a floater, with collateral similar to the last deal.
The deal will securitize over 35 commercial mortgages on investment
properties.
Scandinavia Active
        Elsewhere, Lehman has won the mandate for another securitization
from Sweden.  A consortium representing a large group of Swedish municipal
housing firms has been working with Lehman to establish a conduit-like
structure for future deals. Lehman's Jim Clark, who heads up the asset
securitization group, was in Sweden last week to discuss the plans. A deal
for a municipal housing firm outside Stockholm is slated for this summer.
        A second St. Eric transaction is also heard to be on the horizon.
This time around, only one of the three housing firms which participated in
the first transaction will be involved.  Collateral for the deal will be
limited to the one loan for the housing firm Svenska Bostader on a number
of housing projects. ABN Amro will return to lead the transaction.

RETAIL DELIVERY WILL COST YOU IN 1996 

     Expect to experience growing pains this year as technology
platforms inside your bank change to facilitate offering new retail
delivery channels to your customers.  But don't expect these channels
to produce profits any time soon.
     Almost half of the largest U.S. banks and one-third of the
country's mid-size banks are operating electronic banking programs at
a loss.  The majority cannot determine profitability, the American
Bankers Association (ABA) said in its "1995 Retail Banking Survey
Report."
     The losses were attributed to up-front development costs, which
likely will continue throughout 1996 as new retail delivery channels
gain consumer acceptance, the report said.
     Also in 1996, consultants predict:

     *   continued slow adoption of client-server
        applications;
     *   the call center will become a focal
        point of the customer relationship and a
        major sales and marketing tool; and 
     *   continued merging in the bank and vendor markets.

Drawbacks of the RDS Boom

     Development costs likely will put banks in the red as they try to
offer alternative delivery channels to their customers, consultants
say.  Developing online banking and in-bank connection software is
expensive.  It can cost $300,000 just to get into the newest retail
delivery systems, such as personal computer (PC) home banking and
Internet transactions.
     In most cases, banks can use some of their existing hardware to
offer new retail delivery channels.  But most of the new applications
are client-server-based, and the legacy systems cannot provide access
to information in an interactive environment, said David Taylor,
executive vice president at the Bank Administration Institute (BAI) in
Chicago.
     These programs must interface with existing business systems,
mainframes and each other, said Bob Landry, technology analyst with
the Tower Group in Wellesley, Mass.
     Building these platforms so that they can talk to each other
might be expensive but this should be a priority so that banks can
move forward with seamless marketing and accounting efforts, Landry
said.

Security Issues

     You need to pay attention to three key security issues as your
bank implements new technology to compete in the retail delivery
systems market, says BAI's 1995 study:  "The Information Superhighway
and Retail Banking:"

    *   Authentication.  Can you identify the party requesting a
    transaction?
    *   Authorization.  If the party is identified, how will the size
    and nature of the requested transaction be approved?
    *   Security and encryption.  Can you prevent third parties from
    improperly accessing private transaction data, such as credit
    card numbers? 

The Client-Server Dilemma

    Unexpected implementation and activation problems with client-
server technology is adding development and networking problems,
analysts told BAN.  It was touted as the technology that could save
banks up to 15 percent in systems development and management costs. 
But implementation problems have delayed activation and created the
need for extra personnel.
    At many banks, expenses related to implementation issues ate up
anticipated savings quickly, said David Koto, principal with Brintech
in New Smyrna Beach, Fla.  "No savings have been realized yet," he
said.
    But vendors are plugging away with client-server introductions
(BAN, Oct. 18, p. 1).  Five companies showed new client-server-based
core accounting systems at the MicroBanker Expo last year.
    An informal BAN poll of about a dozen users and consultants at
the expo revealed that Eastpoint Technologies of Bedford, N.H., and
Perot Systems of Dallas are the companies to watch in 1996.
    Phoenix International of Maitland, Fla., also is considered one
of the most innovative client-server vendors (BAN, Aug. 9, p. 1), but
it has not sold its Retail Banking System outside of the circle of
institutions that initially invested in the company.

The Growing Importance of Call Centers

    Call centers are becoming critical to banks, financial
institutions and other service-oriented businesses as they work to
keep existing customers, expand their business and save money,
consultants said (BAN, Sept. 20, p. 4).  You would be well-advised to
upgrade your own call center this year to keep pace with your
competitors, consultants said.
    Banks selling mature products, such as credit card services, are
finding that keeping existing customers is as important as gaining new
ones and that having a sophisticated call center is one way of
ensuring this happens.  Plus, the call center provides an opportunity
to offer both customer service and telemarketing in one swoop.  Savvy
banks are using well-trained employees to turn customer service
requests into opportunities to sell additional products.  
    Consultants predict the telephone will emerge as a major selling
tool this year.  Merrill Lynch & Co. has 400 branches, $500 billion in
assets and a national telephone support system.  "There's a tremendous
focus on call centers" to reduce staff and create better selling
environments, Landry added.
    Additionally, telephones likely will emerge as the method for
account creation and verification, says Richard Crone, senior vice
president at the $50 billion-asset Home Savings of America of
Irwindale, Calif.  Customers may not be going into the branch as much
but they still need their questions answered.
     The emerging importance of having a well-rounded call center
spells growing opportunity for vendors.  For example, Customer Access
of Raleigh, N.C., claims it can manage a bank's call center at a
savings of about 20 percent.  The outsourcer was founded in July 1993
by four former Citibank managers.  It has two large bank customers in
North Carolina and plans to open additional offices in other areas of
the country this year (BAN, Oct. 4, p. 6).
    Outsourcing call center management will be attractive to smaller
banks.  But banks also run the risk of losing the bank's customer
service "personality," said Jeff DiFrancesco, with New York-based
Price Waterhouse.

Outsourcing Takes Off

    Expect outsourcing to continue its growth in popularity as banks
realize they can't absorb expenses associated with operating
processing centers or developing technology, consultants also tell BAN
(see related story, p. 4).  Some of the largest outsourcing contracts
were signed last year.  Chase Manhattan Bank signed Milwaukee-based
FIserv to a 12-year contract for check processing and check-imaging
worth $480 million.  That contract is guaranteed until 1997, but may
be in jeopardy as Chase merges with Chemical Bank, also of New York.
    Bank managers are beginning to trust outsourcing more as they
watch these large successful contracts fulfilled, said Arthur Gillis
of Computer Based Solutions in New Orleans.  Expect this trend to
continue in 1996, he said.
    It would be surprising if more outsourcing companies merge or go
out of business because the most profitable outsourcers are the
largest, Gillis said.
    Bank and vendor mergers also are expected to continue in 1996. 
Columbus, Ohio-based Checkfree, a check processor, already has started
off the year's mergers with its acquisition of software vendor
Servantis of Norcross, Ga., to improve its retail delivery service.

TIPS FOR CONTRACTING TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE

    Many banks are hiring vendors to develop bank-branded software
because developing in-house is expensive.
    Bank-branded software differentiates products from your
competitors' but developing software in conjunction with a vendor has
several hidden problems that seem to originate before actual source
code-writing even begins.  One- quarter of all major software projects
are terminated before completion, experts estimate.  Studies indicate
that 75 percent of completed software projects are "operating
failures" and a disappointment to users.
    The type of contract you want is the first thing to consider when
outsourcing software development, said Joseph Auer, president of
International Computer Negotiations Inc. (ICN) in Winter Park, Fla. 
Banks basically have two choices -- resources- or results-oriented
contracts.  The key difference between contracting methods lies in who
assumes responsibility for meeting business objectives, he said.
    A resources contract entails hiring staff to work inside the bank
to develop the software.  In this scenario, the development is managed
entirely by the bank and the bank is responsible if the project fails,
Auer said.
    The software is developed off-site in a results-oriented
contract.  This type of project is managed by the vendor with the bank
contributing a small amount of resources, such as machine time, data,
floor space and access to management.  The vendor retains
responsibility for the end-product, Auer said.
    Savvy vendors create results and resources contracts that
stipulate joint responsibility and accountability, which may sound
good to bank managers who are unable to give up control or who think
it is a cop-out to outsource development.  But demanding control in a
development relationship is asking for trouble because vendors are
more than willing to take the bank's money and give it all the
responsibility for failed programs and bugs, Auer said.  "[Banks] are
saying `please can we be a big target.'"
    Negotiate provisions that make the vendor responsible for bugs
and performance failure.  This likely will produce a need for a
results-oriented contract, which places the project in the vendor's
court, he said.

Drafting the Right Agreement

    "A well-constructed contract should give the system buyer some
assurance that desired business results will be achieved within a
reasonable time frame," Auer said.  "One of the most effective
techniques for providing this type of assurance is to develop a
detailed project timetable based on identified tasks, task
interdependencies and deliverables to be included in the contract."
    A carefully drafted software development agreement will prompt
the vendor and the bank to consider issues upfront and prevent
disaster later.  This type of agreement also will give the bank legal
recourse against the vendor if something goes awry, says technology
legal expert Dan C. Aardal, partner at Brown Raymans & Millstein in
Los Angeles.
    Success seems to hinge on thoroughly evaluating bank needs prior
to jumping into the development phase.  Include user, performance and
maintenance requirements emanating from this evaluation in attachments
to the development contract, he said.
    Aardal's checklist for development agreements includes:

    *  user involvement;
    *  bimonthly progress reports; 
    *  request for proposals guidelines; 
    *  acceptance testing criteria; and more.

    Almost any of these elements can be critical, but several
commonly neglected provisions are often pitfalls for the bank, Aardal
said.  For example, ownership of the software should be stipulated in
the agreement so that no dispute arises after the fact, Aardal said.
    Make sure your bank owns the source code and has licensing rights
to the software in return for the high price you pay to develop it, he
said.  These terms should be negotiated into the contract because you
won't own the software automatically just because you paid to have it
developed.
    The developer may charge a higher price for ownership rights than
for licensing because it will be the developer's only opportunity to
make money on the software, he added.
    Pay the higher price: it will give you peace of mind.  No other
bank will be using the same program or, in the case of home banking
software, offering it to customers in competition with the bank that
paid for its development, Aardal explained.
    One of the most useful provisions you can negotiate is a most-
favored customer clause.  Such a bank customer is guaranteed to
receive prices and services that are better or equivalent to those
being offered to the vendor's other customers.  Additionally, it
guarantees that the most-favored bank's contract will be amended to
include the same services, refunds or credits granted to new customers
that were given a better deal, Aardal said. 

Bargain for Warranties

    Banks can bargain for a multitude of warranties, too, in these
contracts.  Standard warranties, protecting the bank against copyright
infringement and defects in the material and workmanship, should not
be controversial during negotiations, Aardal said.  But other types of
warranties seem more burdensome to the vendor, although they can
protect your bank better.
    One such warranty would guarantee that the licensor is aware of
the user's business requirements and the intended uses for the
software, and that the software will satisfy such requirements and is
fit for the intended uses.
    This warranty works best if the user has made the initial
investment of time and effort to describe its business requirements
and intended uses in the contract.  Attach that description as a
schedule or exhibit to the software license agreement, Aardal said.
    Additionally, a bank with the resources will have prepared a
request for proposals describing those requirements and that the user
can give to competing vendors, he said.
    Aardal advises bargaining for these additional warranties:

*   Acceptance testing.  Ensure that your bank has the right to
thoroughly test the software in-house before making final payment on
its development. Include testing procedures in the initial development
agreement. Tests should include a request that the software system run
successfully for about 30 days in a live operating environment.
*   Performance.  Specify transaction response time, transaction
capacity, and reliability requirements.  Software should perform in
accordance with description, specifications and documentation of the
software set forth in exhibits and schedules in the license agreement. 
It will be difficult to contend later that the software did not
perform a particular function unless the license and related
specifications indicated the software was supposed to perform that
function.
*   Maintenance.  Negotiate maintenance provisions at the same time as
the development agreement.  If you wait until after a development and
licensing agreement is signed, your bank will have little leverage. 
State in the agreement that the vendor must respond immediately to
service calls or you will be entitled to a free one-month extension of
the warranty period, or credit against future maintenance costs.  (Dan
Aardal, Brown Raymans & Millstein, 310/789-2100; Joseph Auer, ICN,
407/740-0700.)

SYNC LINKING LEGACY NETWORKS TO CLIENT-SERVER

     Sync Research Inc. wants to capitalize on the financial-
institution migration from IBM legacy systems to faster client-server
networks. (see related story, p. 1).  
     The Irvine, Calif.-based company believes it can profit from
these conversions.  Although Sync is not directly targeting banks,
company officials said it is aiming to "focus on the IBM-centric
customer that is looking to migrate to client-server."
     Historically, financial institutions have built large IBM
networks to support their branches.  These networks communicated
through numerous leased lines, which are both expensive and limited. 
With client-server and wide-area-network (WAN) enhancement, such as
frame relay; banks can send data at higher speeds.  Data transfer
between legacy systems and client-server networks now can be supported
on one line.
    Sync's FrameNode product line is the "translator" that makes
various communications protocols compatible, including asynchronous
transfer mode (ATM) and ISDN technology.  Depending on the services
needed, Sync's FrameNode units can cost from $995 to $5,200 apiece.
    FrameNode manages the data that transfers between the old branch
terminal equipment and the newer personal computers.
    "We provide the glue, so to speak, between the legacy application
device -- the [IBM] 4700 controller or the [automated teller
machine] -- and this new WAN service," said Todd Krautkremer, a vice-
president at Sync.  "We connect the old device at the old speed and
the new devices as fast as you want."
    Sync, which began as a consulting firm in 1981 and started to
build products in 1986, began trading on the NASDAQ last fall.  It
will be releasing its fourth quarter earnings for the first time at
the end of January.
    The company's customers include New-York based Chemical Bank and
Citicorp., Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank and San Francisco-based Wells
Fargo Bank.  However, Krautkremer admits "the smaller banks can
benefit more greatly."  One of Sync's newest customers has only 50
branches.

Market Strategy

    Sync is positioning itself to be profitable even when the legacy
systems are dead -- although for many smaller institutions that may
take a very long time, according to industry analysts.
    Krautkremer said ATM, frame-relay and ISDN essentially run at the
same speed and the only thing that separates the three services are
prices, which depend upon the rates charged by the local telephone
companies.
    For example, frame relay may be more expensive than ISDN in
California but ISDN is more expensive than frame-relay in New York. 
So, as interstate banking takes effect, branches of a national bank in
California may be using different protocols than branches of the same
bank in New York.
    "[Telecommunications] carriers are stepping up with intelligent
networks and providing numerous migration paths," said Krautkremer. 
"We will be developing technologies that will allow frame relay to be
translated to ATM ... The device on the edge of the network needs to
be able to deal with multiple types of services."

HUMAN RESOURCES SOFTWARE AIMS TO CUT EMPLOYEE COSTS

     Human resources (HR) management costs can be held in-check with
new software from Englewood, Colo.-based Jam.LOGIC Designs.
     The start-up software company recently released a product to help
large banks manage their human resources tasks and small banks to
create a human resources department.
     The Windows-based HR Task Counselor is designed specifically for
banks, with features including 107 financial job descriptions, release
agreements, on-line databases and on-line regulatory assistance.
     Since its release in November, at least five institutions,
ranging in size from 30 employees to 150 employees, have purchased the
software.
     BAN has learned one large banking organization will consider
endorsing and distributing the product at its next meeting within the
next two months.

Pricing

     "For small organizations, [HR Task Counselor] is an affordable
alternative to hiring an HR manager.  They can't afford to pay $40,000
to $50,000 for someone to manage 50 employees," said Jeff Schmitz
president of Jam.LOGIC.  "For larger organizations, it is an
alternative to hiring an HR assistant."
     One software license for a bank with less than 50 employees will
cost $600 to cover first-year maintenance and regulatory updates.  The
average sale in the banking arena has been $3,000, according to
Schmitz.
     Large organizations will input job descriptions and place them on
the network so the entire institution has one set standard.  
     In addition, each module is user-defined with passwords.  For
example, marketing managers only can look at the performance reviews
of their employees, not of the entire company.  (Jeff Schmitz,
Jam.LOGIC Designs, 800/750-8113.)

7TH CIRCUIT REVERSES
DISMISSAL OF LOAN
FLIPPING CLAIMS

The Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 14, by a 2-1
margin, overturned a Chicago federal judge's order dismissing a
putative RICO class action brought against a finance company for
alleged loan flipping practices.  Emery v. American General
Finance
Inc., No. 95-1037 (7th Cir.).

The majority found that the plaintiff had sufficiently alleged
her
predicate claims of mail fraud so as to survive a motion to
dismiss.

Verna Emery first approached American General Finance for a loan
in
July 1992.  The lender issued her a three-year loan for $1,983;
the
finance charges over the term of the loan amounted to $1,327.
American General sent Emery a letter the following January,
stating
that she was entitled to borrow an additional $750.

Seeking an additional $200, Emery responded to the offer;
American
General's branch manager gave her forms for the refinancing of
her
original loan with additional funds advanced.  Emery signed a new
note for $2,399 with a finance charge of $1,641.  Emery's monthly
payments increased by roughly $20, effectively costing her $1,200
for the right to get $200 immediately.  (Such disclosure was not
required by the Truth in Lending Act, the Seventh Circuit noted,
as
the statute regards such transactions as a reborrowing of the
original loan amount.)

Emery filed her action in the Northern District of Illinois,
alleging that the lender engaged in a pattern of soliciting its
customers by mail for the loan of additional funds, without
informing them that the costs of refinancing are far greater than
those connected with taking out a separate loan.
The trial court granted the defense's dismissal motion in
December
1994, concluding that the plaintiff failed to identify any
specific
false statement of material fact allegedly made by the defendant.

The lower court also found that the plaintiff failed to cite to
any
case holding a failure to disclose actionable under the federal
mail fraud statute.

In a review authored by Chief U.S. Circuit Judge Richard A.
Posner,
the Seventh Circuit stated that "all the [mail fraud] statute
punishes is deliberate fraud."  While having no quibble with the
proposition that mere failure to disclose does not constitute
mail
fraud, the panel stated that "[w]hether a failure to disclose is
fraudulent depends on context."

Judge Posner wrote that the panel does "not of course know the
state of mind of the employees of American General Finance who
drafted the letter to Emery and its other customers; nor can the
plaintiff have more than an inkling until she has an opportunity
to
conduct pretrial discovery."  In viewing the letter in the
context
of the complaint's allegations, the court continued, "the letter
is
seen to be replete with falsehoods and half truths."

With respect to the lower court's finding that Emery failed to
allege a violation of the Truth in Lending Act, the panel stated,
"Suppose Emery were blind.  Or retarded.  Would anyone argue that
shoving a Truth in Lending Act disclosure form in front ofher
face
would be a defense to fraud?  The allegation is that she belongs
to
a class of borrowers who are not competent interpreters of such
forms and that the defendant knows this and sought to take
advantage of it," Judge Posner wrote.

As to the lower court's finding that Emery failed to plead a
fiduciary relationship between herself and the defendant, the
panel
wrote that "it is not true that if you are not a fiduciary
anything
goes, short of false statements.  A half truth, or what is
usually
the same thing a misleading omission, is actionable as fraud,
including mail fraud if the mails are used to further it, if it
is
intended to induce a false belief and resulting action to the
advantage of the misleader and the disadvantage of the misled."
The panel stated that it was not deeming loan flipping to be
fraud
or that the defendant engaged in fraud.  "All we know is that the
allegations of fraud are sufficient to withstand a motion to
dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.  There is a
state of facts consistent with the complaint that if proved would
establish a violation of the mail fraud statute, and no more is
required at this stage for the suit to continue."

Judge Posner did find meritorious the defendant's alternative
arguments that Emery failed to plead mail fraud with FRCP 9(b)
particularity.  The panel found Emery's allegations of the fraud
perpetrated upon her sufficient, but that she only generally
averred that American General did the same to other customers.

The panel wrote that a Rule 9(b) dismissal would have been
proper,
but that Emery should have been given the opportunity to amend
her
complaint.  The appellate panel then reversed and remanded.

Judge William J. Bauer concurred in the judgment.

Dissenting, Judge John L. Coffey stated that "[t]he cases in
which
this court has held that  non-disclosure' may be deemed
fraudulent
all involved a special circumstance of some kind....  There were
no
such special circumstances in this case.  AGF, as Emery's
creditor,
was not a fiduciary....  AGF did not engage in a  wide variety of
deceptive actions,' nor can its conduct vis-a-vis Emery be fairly
described as an  elaborate attempt at concealment.'"

9TH CIR.: NO CLAIM BY
SHAREHOLDERS TO RECOVER
RECEIVERSHIP LOSSES

A group of bank shareholders, charging the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. with fraud on the court, will not be able to
recover funds they lost when the agency took over receivership
from
a failed bank, a panel of the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals
held Dec. 26.  Herring et al. v. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
No. CV-93-00127-EHC (9th Cir.).

The circuit court affirmed a decision of the U.S. District Court
for the District of Arizona, stating that a party with no
interest
in the litigation generally has no standing.

In September 1981, the Arizona Superintendent of Banks placed
Southwestern Bank in receivership.  On May 1, 1990, the FDIC, as
court-appointed receiver, petitioned the Arizona Superior Court
to
enter an order approving payment of a final liquidating dividend,
payment of interest on claims, sale of any newly discovered
assets,
disposal of Southwestern's books and records and termination of
the
receivership.

The shareholders, Morris Herring, Raymond Herring, James N.
Corbett, Luis Valenzuela, Armando Alfaro and Sherman Montgomery,
who had invested in the Southwestern Bank, filed objections,
complaining of faulty accounting and insufficient information
regarding the receivership and alleged $530,124 loss.  The
shareholders requested the court to order a more specific
accounting or allow shareholders leave to examine the
receivership.

After hearings and the filing of post-petition briefs, the
Superior
Cour overruled the shareholders' objections.  The court held that
the disputed item of $530,124 consisted of losses sustained on
the
liquidation of assets and that the FDIC was not subject to
surcharge for this amount.  The court further held that the FDIC
was entitled to interest on its own claim, but that the
receivership funds were insufficient to cover the FDIC's claim
even
if the $530,124 was disallowed.  On Aug. 14, 1991, the court
terminated the receivership.

After being turned down by the state Supreme Court to review
their
petition that the FDIC perpetrated a fraud on the court, the
shareholders filed with the Arizona Superior Court an independent
action pursuant to Rule 60(b) to set aside the judgment for fraud
on the court.  The FDIC removed the case to federal district
court.
The shareholders alleged that the FDIC knowingly submitted false
accounting figures when it petitioned the court to terminate
receivership and presented perjured testimony to the court
concerning a bank receivership asset account labeled "other
assets/judgments."

The FDIC moved for summary judgment.  Following briefing and oral
argument, the district court granted summary judgment on two
grounds: (1) that res judicata and collateral estoppel barred the
shareholders' action, and (2) that the FDIC committed no fraud on
the court.

The circuit court found that, because the shareholders cannot
recover their funds, they have no standing.  The panel affirmed
the
district court's finding of summary judgment on their fraud on
the
court claim.

The shareholders were represented by Conrad Herring of San Diego.

The FDIC was represented by Lawrence G.D. Scarborough of Brown &
Bain in Phoenix.

CONVICTION IN ELABORATE
REAL ESTATE SCHEME IS
UPHELD IN 10TH CIRCUIT

Over the pleas of the defendants, the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Jan. 5 upheld their multicount convictions in district
court arising from a complex real estate fraud, including mail
fraud, wire fraud and making false statements in connection with
the scheme.  United States v. Austin et al., No. 91-CR-147
(10th Cir.).

Defendants Donald Austin and James Grandgeorge claimed that the
U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado-imposed
restitution of $12,618,772 was too high.  Based upon defaulted
loans, the district court determined the victims of the scheme
lost
more than $20 million.  The district court also sentenced Austin
to
a term of 27 years and Grandgeorge to a term of 23 years.  Each
was
given a sentence of five years' probation following release.

The essence of the scheme was to purchase properties from
legitimate sellers.  The defendants recruited numerous people to
act as "strawmen buyers," who secured mortgages from U.S.
Mortgage
Co. which were, in turn, insured by the U.S. Department of
Housing
and Urban Development (HUD).  Despite HUD's requirement that each
purchase be funded with a minimum of 15% downpayment by the
purchasers, no such investment was made by the strawmen.

Closing documents were drawn, however, which falsely stated the
downpayments were made.  The defendants paid the strawmen $1,000
for each of the transactions in which they participated.
Although
the defendants assured the strawmen the defendants would be
responsible for the payment of loans to the properties, no such
payments were made, and the properties went into foreclosure.

The defendants incorporated Fidelity Escrow Services, which they
used as an independent entity in connection with the sales
transaction to give the transactions the appearance of
legitimacy.
The use of Fidelity convinced the loan closer on the strawmen
purchases to believe the downpayments were paid by the purchasers
in cash or certified funds.

The defendantsalso arranged for all loans to be handled through
U.S. Mortgage, which was able to charge high interest rates
because
the purchasers had no real interest in the properties.  The high
interest rate and the prospect of HUD insurance made the loans
attractive to secondary lenders.  The processing of the loans
granted by U.S. Mortgage to the strawmen was done by three people
who were paid kickbacks by the defendants.  Although the
defendants' scheme involved hundreds of properties, 157 were
identified in the indictment.

Austin contended that the district court erred in imposing
restitution upon him because there was no proof of his ability to
pay.  However, the 10th Circuit concluded that Austin did little
to
prove this claim.

ORAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN
LANDOWNER AND BANK NOT
AS BINDING AS WRITTEN

Since the alleged oral agreement between a landowner and her bank
to prevent foreclosure on her properties contradicts the terms of
the written agreement between the two parties, a California
appeals
court on Dec. 22 affirmed a trial court's grant of summary
judgment
to the bank to foreclose on the property.  Howard v. First
Nationwide Bank, No. A067566 (CA Ct. App., 1st Dist.).

The California Court of Appeal, First District, concluded that
since an alleged oral agreement between Ruth Fairley Howard and
Keith G. Becher, a First Nationwide Bank (FNB) liquidation
supervisor, directly contradicted the terms of the written
agreement between the two parties, Howard's appeal to seek a
reversal of the summary judgment by the Alameda County Superior
Court is without merit.

In 1986, Howard and her husband, Mark Howard, a commercial real
estate broker who was then in the business of buying and selling
properties for his own account, borrowed $210,000 from FNB to
purchase commercial property in Richmond.  The Howards executed a
standard promissory note and deed of trust on the property,
agreeing to pay off the loan in monthly installments and giving
FNB
the usual right to foreclose on the property if they failed to do
so.

In 1989, Mark Howard died of cancer.  The plaintiff spent two
years
caring for him and her mother, who was also terminally ill.
Howard
also struggled with her own condition, lupus.  During this
period,
the Howards' financial properties fell into disarray.  Payments
were not made to lenders, including FNB.  In June 1988, Howard
filed for bankruptcy.

Despite filing for bankruptcy, Howard continued to make payments
on
the loan to FNB for the next five months.  When the payments
stopped in November 1988, the bank moved for an order lifting the
automatic stay in the bankruptcy action so that it could begin
foreclosure on the loan's collateral.  Howard agreed to the
dissolution of the stay in exchange for FNB's agreement to defer
foreclosure for two and one-half months.

Howard resumed making payments on the loan for almost a year, but
again fell into default.  In November 1989, FNB sent her a
standard
late notice, giving her 30 days to bring the loan current.  When
Howard did not respond, FNB waited more than two months before
issuing a notice of default and electing to sell the property.
The
notice gave her three months to avoid foreclosure.

After the plaintiff did not bring the loan current, FNB scheduled
the trustee's sale for Aug. 8, 1990.  Howard asked for another
postponement and brought Fred Mangrum, a real estate broker and
friend, with her to meet with Becher.  They asked him to postpone
for sale for one month.

Howard said Mangrum would buy the Richmond property, with the
proceeds to pay off the loan and put the remainder of her
financial
affairs in order.  Although Mangrum had expressed an interest in
buying the property since the preceding January, a definitive
sale
price had not been set nor any written sales agreement executed.

 FNB, through Becher, and Howard agreed that if she paid the
escrow
arrears by Aug. 7, 1990, FNB would postpone the scheduled sale
for
two weeks until Aug. 22.  Also, if Howard would then pay one-half
the loan arrears by Aug. 22, FNB would postpone the sale an
additional 30 days, until Sept. 21.

Howard paid the first installment.  The day before the second
installment was due, Mangrum informed FNB that she could not pay
even one-half the next installment and needed another
postponement.
FNB agreed to postpone the trustee's sale if  Howard adhered to a
payment schedule.

Although the prior extensions had not been memorialized in a
writing signed by Howard, Becher at this point insisted that the
revised payment schedule must be written and signed by the
plaintiff.

Contrary to Becher's testimony, Howard testified that, sometime
prior to execution of the written agreement, Becher told her
that,
in return for three payments totaling approximately $14,000, FNB
would "cancel" the foreclosure and await the sale of the property
to Mangrum.

On Nov. 19, 1992, Howard filed her complaint against FNB and
Becher.  The complaint alleged claims for fraud, breach of oral
contract, intentional interference with contract, unfair business
practices and intentional infliction of emotional distress.

The pivotal allegation of the complaint was the existence and
breach of the oral agreement to "halt the foreclosure" in return
for partial repayment of the loan balance.

The defendants filed an answer on April 6, 1003, denying all of
the
plaintiff's allegations and raising numerous affirmative
defenses,
including various statutes of limitations.

On June 24, 1994, after conducting discovery, defendants moved
for
summary judgment on numerous grounds, including the contention
that
plaintiff's claims were barred by the parol evidence rule and
applicable statutes of limitation and were substantively without
merit.

The court affirmed the judgment.

FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF
BOSTON PETITIONS 11TH CIR.
FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

The 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Nov. 30 granted the
First
National Bank of Boston's petition for a writ of mandamus,
instructing the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
Florida to recall the remand and reinstate its case against a
Florida man in a dispute over a consumer loan.  In re First
National Bank of Boston, No. 95-5008 (11th Cir.).

The petition for the writ required the circuit court to decide
whether a district court can remand a case sua sponte within the
30-day period following removal notice provided in 28 U.S.C.
Section  1447(c) for motions to remand.

The district court remanded the case to state court during this
time period.  Because the circuit court concluded that the 1988
amendments to Section 1447(c) precluded the district court from
sua
sponte remand, the court granted the petition.

The origin of the present petition is the related federal case
filed in 1989 by Society for Savings in the U.S. District Court
for
the Southern District of Florida, concerning a consumer loan
secured by a motor yacht extended to Jerome H. Rogers (Society
for
Savings v. M/Y "CONJA", No. 89-6167-CIV-PAINE [SD FL]).

That case was settled by surrender of the vessel to Society for
Savings and the agreed payment of $13,000, representing the
difference in the value of the vessel and the outstanding debt.
Thereafter, various credit reporting agencies showed this loan as
a bad debt.

In 1995, Rogers sued petitioner First National Bank of Boston in
the 15th Judicial Circuit for Palm Beach County, which he alleged
is the successor to Society for Savings with offices in Palm
Beach
County, FL, and claimed damages exceeding $15,000 for Bank of
Boston's failure to correct credt information relating to Rogers
(Rogers v. Bank of Boston, No. CL 95 347AB [FL Cir. Ct., Palm
Beach
Cty., filed Jan. 17, 1995]).

Subsequently, Rogers filed a settlement demand, requesting
compensatory and punitive damages of $650,000.  Bank of Boston
filed an amended answer and affirmative defenses that denied the
material allegations of the complaint, including the allegation
that Bank of Boston maintained an office in Palm Beach County.

On June 13, 1995, Bank of Boston removed the case to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of Florida pursuant to
28
U.S.C. Section Section 1441 and 1446, and asserted complete
diversity (Rogers v. Bank of Boston, No. 95--8366--CIV--NESBITT
[SD FL, filed June 13, 1995]).

Bank of Boston represented that it is a national banking
association with its principal place of business in
Massachusetts,
making it a Massachusetts citizen, and that the amount in
controversy exceeded $50,000 in compliance with 28 U.S.C. Section
1332(a).

On June 19, 1995, the district court sua sponte remanded the case
to the 11th Judicial Circuit for Dade County.  The district court
determined that Bank of Boston's failure to reveal the state in
which it is incorporated constituted an inadequate showing of its
citizenship for diversity jurisdiction.  The court's order was
filed on June 22, 1995, and the case was closed.

On June 28, 1995, Bank of Boston moved for reconsideration and
vacation of the district court's remand order and for leave to
amend its notice of removal.  The bank explained that, as a
national banking association, it is not incorporated under any
state's law and that its citizenship is determined by its
principal
place of business.

The bank also filed an amended notice of removal, stating this
explanation of its citizenship and clarifying that it maintains
no
branch offices in Florida, although its independent subsidiary
mortgage corporation maintains at least one branch office in
Florida.

On July 21, 1995, the district court entered an order striking
Bank
of Boston's motion for reconsideration and leave to file an
amended
notice of removal because it no longer had jurisdiction over the
case.

The bank then petitioned the court for a writ of mandamus
directing
the district court to recall its remand and to reinstate the case
on its docket.

Pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 21(b), the
circuit
court directed the district judge to respond to Bank of Boston's
argument that the district court's remand was unauthorized under
28
U.S.C. Section 1447(c).

INVESTMENT COMPANY MUST
PAY RENT FROM COMMERCIAL
PROPERTY TO LENDER

In a diversity suit appeal, the Seventh Circuit U.S. Court of
Appeals on Dec. 12 reversed a decision by the U.S. District Court
for the Northern District of Illinois, ruling that an investment
company must pay Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. rent money on
a commercial property.  Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.
Harris Trust and Savings Bank et al., No. 95-1884 (7th Cir.).

The district court ruled that defendant Kaiser Investments could
refuse to pay on the grounds that a provision in a "Borrower's
Affidavit" requiring the indemnification of rents before the
appointment of a receiver when the trust defaulted was made
unenforceable by the "rents and profits rule."

The case was remanded to the district court for further
proceedings
consistent with this opinion.

In 1986, Fidelity made a $3.6 million loan to an Illinois land
trust that held title to a commercial property.  The trustee was
an
Illinois bank and the beneficiary of the partnership, Kaiser
Investments.

The loan was secured by a mortgage on the property, but i
addition,
Kaiser Investments executed a "Borrower's Affidavit" that
contained
a number of warranties and representations designed to induce
Fidelity to make a loan.

One of the paragraphs of the affidavit states that
"notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Loan Papers...Borrower
(Kaiser) shall be and remain personally obligated and liable for,
and shall indemnify Lender against the Property for any period
subsequent to an event of default, and shall pay over the same to
the Lender upon receipt, except to the extent that the same have
been applied in payments of any amounts due Lender under the Note
or other Loan Papers."

The trust defaulted on the loan in February 1993, and in July of
that year, having sent a notice of default the preceding month,
Fidelity brought this suit against the bank and Kaiser
Investments.

The suit asked for foreclosure and other relief, including the
appointment of a receiver and indemnification for any rents
collected after the default.  The district court appointed a
receiver in September 1993, and the receiver began collecting the
rents.  Later, the court decreed foreclosure, and the property
was
sold at a price that left Fidelity with a loss of more than $1.3
million on its loan.

U.S. District Judge James B. Moran held the refusal proper on the
grounds that the provision in the affidavit required
indemnification by the "rents and profits rule."

According to Illinois common law, this rule forbids a mortgagee
to
enforce a provision of a mortgage assigning rents or other income
of the mortgaged property to him until the mortgagee takes
possession of the property.  The judge, therefore, dismissed the
claim and, since other claims in the case had already been
resolved, the dismissal was the final order in the case and was
appealable.

However, Chief Circuit Court Judge Richard A. Posner ruled on
appeal that the indemnity agreement in the Borrower's Affidavit
was
"separate" from the loan papers, and that the borrower, Kaiser,
was
not technically the mortgagor, affects the applicability of the
rents and profits rule.

Judge Posner stated that the rule would be a joke if it could be
avoided by designating certain papers involved in the loan "the
loan papers" and reciting that the assignment of rents was not
among them.  He said it would also be a joke if, as in this case,
that of an Illinois land trust, only the trustee was forbidden to
make an enforceable assignment of rents.

In an Illinois land trust, which is becoming a common mode of
ownership in Illinois and other states, property that is subject
to
a mortgage is "owned" by a trustee whose only function is to hold
title, leaving management and control of the property entirely in
the hands of the beneficiary of the trust.

The agreement between the two parties was that Kaiser was to pay
over the rents to Fidelity upon receipt of the rents by Kaiser.

10TH CIRCUIT AFFIRMS
CREDITOR CANNOT
EXECUTE UPON MORTGAGES

A ruling that a default judgment creditor is not entitled to
execute upon mortgages in Texas owned by the Government National
Mortgage Association (GNMA) as a matter of law was affirmed Dec.
18
by the 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  Pipkin v. Mortgage
Creditcorp, Inc. et al., No. 94-6443 (WD OK).

The opinion involves the question of whether a default judgment
creditor may divest the interest of GNMA in certain Texas real
estate mortgages solely because GNMA failed to record its
interest
in the mortgages in adherence to the law.

Plaintiff Roger W. Pipkin III appealed the district court's grant
of summary judgment in favor of GNMA and its mortgage services,
Midland Mortgage, Co., MidFirst Bank and Northwest Bank
(collectvely, the Midland Group).  The district court held that
Texas law was superseded by GNMA's enabling stature and that
Pipkin
was not entitled to execute upon Texas mortgages because GNMA
owned
the mortgages as a matter of law.

Pipkin is the judgment creditor of defendants Mortgage
Creditcorp,
Inc. and Westmark Mortgage Corp. (the Westmark Parties), two
defunct mortgage serving companies.  In 1994, Pipkin obtained a
$4.8 million default judgment against the Westmark Parties in
Texas
state court.  That court then entered the post-judgment order
instructing the Midland Group, the defendants-in-intervention and
third-party plaintiffs, to turn over to Pipkin several Texas real
estate mortgages the court deemed "nonexempt assets of the
Westmark
Parties.

To execute his judgment on the Oklahoma-based Midland Group,
Pipkin
filed the post-judgment order in Oklahoma City.  Subsequently,
the
Midland Group obtained a stay of execution from the state court
and
filed a petition in intervention naming GNMA as third-party
defendant.  GNMA removed the case to the U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Oklahoma.

GNMA and the Midland Group then moved for summary judgment,
arguing
that the mortgages sought by Pipkin were owned by GNMA, not the
Westmark Parties.  Pipkin countered that, under Texas law, the
Westmark Parties continued to own the mortgages because GNMA
failed
to record its interest in the mortgages.

The district court granted GNMA's and the Midland Group's motions
on the ground that GNMA's enabling statute, 12 U.S.C. Section
1721(g), expressly preempts any Texas law limiting GNMA's
ownership
rights in the mortgages.

Under Section 1721(g), Congress vested GNMA with broad powers to
carry out the congressional objective of establishing and
encouraging a secondary market for home mortgages, the district
court said.

Pipkin contended, however, by virtue of the Texas recording
statute
and GNMA's failure to record its interest in the pooled
mortgages,
the Westmark Parties own those mortgages under Texas law.  As a
judgment creditor of the Westmark Parties, Pipkin argued, he is
entitled to execute on those mortgages.

The circuit court was not persuaded by Pipkin's argument and
affirmed the district court's decision.

DC COURT SUPPORTS BANK'S
MOTION TO STRIKE CLASS
ACTION ALLEGATIONS

In a memorandum filed Dec. 26, the U.S. District Court for the
District of Columbia decided in favor of NationsBank Corp. and
denied class action status to a pending fair lending lawsuit
against the bank.  Lathern et al. v. NationsBank Corp. et al.,
No. 95-CV-1805 (NHJ) (D DC).

The judge had harsh words for the plaintiffs' counsel, the
Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs
(WLC) for failing to timely move for class certification in a
prior
action.

The bank asked the court that the class allegations be stricken
entirely.

This action began Sept. 21, 1995, when plaintiffs filed a
complaint
containing class action allegations under the Fair Housing Act,
the
Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Civil Rights Act of 1866.

However, by failing to move for class certification by Dec. 20,
1995, which was 90 days from the date on which the class
complaint
was filed, the plaintiffs violated Local Rule 203(b).

Accordingly, the court decided, the plaintiffs' class action
allegations should be stricken in their entirety.

John Relman, director of the fair housing project at the WLC,
said
his organization had not missed the deadline, but refused to
elaborate.  He did say WLC's position will be explained in a
future
court filing.

Class action status is important to the WLC's case against the
bank, which alleges that NationsBank discriminated against
borrowers.  At the heart of theissue is money.  If the class
action
is fought in court, NationsBank would have more to lose.  Without
class action status, the case involves 13 plaintiffs and nine
loan
applications, and the awards would be less.  As a class, the WLC
would ask NationsBank to compensate all affected consumers, which
would increase the bank's costs.

In its memorandum, the court stated that WLC had since Dec. 13,
1994, the date of its initial press conference announcing its
campaign to solicit plaintiffs for its class action against the
bank, to construct its legal argument.

To achieve this goal, the WLC used a variety of methods to
attract
plaintiffs, including an "800" hotline number, press statements
and
conferences, and print and radio interviews.

Despite this effort, the court stated that WLC was only able to
attract an additional 11 plaintiffs since the suit was filed
Sept. 21.

The court said that if the plaintiffs feel they have individual
claims, they should litigate them as such.  Also, the court held
that NationsBank should not be subjected to any further
prejudicial
adverse publicity tied to promises of class action litigation.

NationsBank is represented by Robert S. Bennett, Richard L.
Brusca,
Andrew L. Sandler and Heidi L. Mason of Skadden, Arps, Slate,
Meagher & Flom of Washington, DC.

SECOND CIRCUIT SUPPORTS
RECOMMENDATION TO KEEP
BANKER OUT OF BANKS

The Second Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals ruled Jan. 2 that it
supports a prohibition order by an Acting Director (AD) for the
Office of Thrift Supervision against a former bank executive as
proper and a matter of law.  Cousin v. Office of Thrift
Supervision, Nos. 94-4206 and 94,6070 (2nd Cir.).

Also, Michael Cousin's petition for review of the final decision
and order of Jonathan L. Fiechter, AD for the OTS, prohibiting
Cousin from further participating in any manner in the conduct of
the affairs of any banking institution regulated by the OTS.

Since the petition for review of the final decision and order is
denied, the circuit court dismissed as moot the appeal of the
denial of declaratory judgment.

In August 1990, Cousin, then chairman of the board and chief
executive officer of Cross County Federal Savings Bank, was
charged
in federal court with several counts of bribery.  The OTS was
informed of the charges and, two days later, issued a temporary
suspension and prohibition from participation in the affairs of
County Federal.

Cousin then sought to have the criminal indictment against him
dropped in federal court, asserting that he was neither
physically
nor mentally fit to stand trial.

The district court agreed to dismiss the indictment against
Cousin
because he was not physically capable of standing trial; however,
included in the order dismissing the charges against Cousin,
dated
May 25, 1992, was language -- agreed to by Cousin's attorney --
to
the effect that the dismissal of the indictment did not amount to
a dismissal on the merits (Cousin v. Office of Thrift
Supervision,
840 F.Supp. 8,9-10 [ED NY 1993]).

The language was specifically included in the order to ensure
that
the dismissal was not construed as requiring the discontinuation
of
the OTS's temporary suspension and prohibition  against Cousin.

After his physical recovery, Cousin informed the OTS that he was
fit to reenter the banking world.  Despite the explicit language
in
the order dismissing his indictment, Cousin thereafter sought a
declaratory judgment in the district court that his indictment
had
been dismissed on its merits and that, as a matter of law, the
OTS
temporary suspension was required to be lifted.

In light of the language in the order dismissing his indictment,
the district court dismissed Cousin's suit on waiver grounds.
Cousin then appealed the district court's dismissal f his action.

On May 13, 1993, the OTS instituted a proceeding to permanently
prohibit Cousin from further participating in any manner in the
conduct of the affairs of any banking institution regulated by
the
OTS.  In support of the permanent prohibition, Cousin was charged
with bribery and aiding and abetting bribery.

He responded to the OTS claims, asserting a number of affirmative
defenses that focused primarily on entrapment.

A hearing of the claims was held before Administrative Law Judge
Walter J. Alprin in September 1993.  On March 31, 1994, the ALJ
issued his recommendation, disqualifying Cousin from further
participation in the banking
industry.

OTS was represented by Geraldine R. Gennet, Office of the Chief
Counsel, OTS, Washington, DC.  Cousin was represented by Ramsey
Clark, New York City.

10TH CIRCUIT UPHOLDS
RETIREMENT FUND'S RIGHT
TO KEEP CONTRIBUTIONS

The 10th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals on Dec. 28 reversed a
decision by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of
Oklahoma, ruling that the lower court's decision to award a
multiple-employer pension benefit plan to the plaintiff violated
the exclusive benefit rule of the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).  Resolution Trust Corp. v.
Financial
Institutions Retirement Fund, No. 95-5016 (10th Cir.).

The issue presented by this case is whether the Resolution Trust
Corp., as successor to a failed thrift institution, can recover
an
actuarial determined sum known as Future Employer Contributions
Offsets (FECO) attributable to the failed thrift as an employer
in
a multiple-employer pension benefit plan under ERISA.

The district court treated the FECO as discrete funds and awarded
them to RTC under a common law unjust enrichment theory.

Financial Institutions Retirement Fund (FIRF) is a
multiple-employer pension benefit plan under ERISA.  The fund is
a
single plan, meaning all of its 360 participating employers pay
into, and all of its approximately 35,000 employees benefit from,
a single fund.

Because of favorable market conditions in 1987, FIRF declared the
plan had reached "full funding," suspended further employer
contributions and advised its overfunded employers, including
Sooner Federal Savings and Loan Association, that the FECO would
be
used to offset the employers' future funding obligations to the
plan.

When Sooner became insolvent in 1989, the RTC, Sooner's receiver,
sold some of its assets to a successor savings association,
excepting any interest in, or claims against, FIRF.   Because of
its liquidation, Sooner was deemed to have withdrawn from FIRF.
At
the time of its insolvency, the value of Sooner's FECO credit was
approximately $4.1 million.

RTC brought the instant action against FIRF in 1989 to obtain
payment of the FECO credits, asserting a common law unjust
enrichment claim.  In response, FIRF claimed it was prohibited by
ERISA from distributing the FECO credits to RTC or to any
employer
for nonpension-related purposes.  Judgment in the amount of $4.6
million was entered in favor of RTC, and this appeal ensued.

On appeal, FIRF contended ERISA's "exclusive benefit" rule
prohibits the use of FECO balances for nonpension purposes.

The 10th Circuit agreed, citing Patterson v. Shumate, 504 U.S.
753
(1992), which denied the inclusion of pension benefits in a
bankruptcy estate.  The court also agreed with FIRF, citing to
Guidry v. Sheet Metal Workers National Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365
(1990), which reversed the imposition of a constructive trust on
a
convicted union official's pension benefits.

The circuit court found it evident that the exact amount of the
FECO constantly varies in concert with he values of the
investments comprising the body of the fund.  Yet, the district
court found the FECO are neither hypothetical nor theoretical
because FIRF itself has stated that FECO assets are fund assets.

For this reason, RTC contended, the FECO are tangible assets of
the
fund.  The court ruled that RTC's argument missed the mark.  The
question of whether the FECO credits are needed for the payment
of
benefits can only be determined once the plan as a whole has been
terminated.

Until then, FIRF must anticipate that there could be dramatic
changes on either side, the court held.

The court concluded that RTC's removal of the FECO credits could
potentially destabilize FIRF.  Furthermore, the district court's
decision leads to the prospect of further diminution of the body
of
the plan because other employers may be encouraged to leave the
plan and remove their FECO credits, the court said.

RTC was represented by Thomas C. Morrison of Patterson, Belknap,
Webb & Tyler LLP in New York City.  FIRF was represented by
Richard
B. Noulles of Gables, & Gotwals in Tulsa.

UK:  DIRECT LINE'S FAMOUS LITTLE RED TELEPHONE KEEPS ON RINGING

DIRECT LINE, the direct insurer founded in 1985, is back in the
headlines again. The latest official statistics show it has grown to
become the leading comprehensive motor insurer in the UK - and by a
long way!

The insurer, whose distinctive red telephone logo has become a
household name in just ten years thanks to inspired brand management,
has seen its market share grow from 4.8 percent four years ago to 11.2
percent, according to the latest figures from Datamonitor.

"This phenomenal growth has been due to the development of a strong
brand image and a policy of undercutting the prices of most of its
closest rivals by leaving out the middleman - the broker," states the
report from the London-based research and management consultancy.

Datamonitor based its research on end-1994 returns filed by insurance
companies with the DTI (Department of Trade and Industry) and,
according to Direct Line's Adrian Webb, the gap between it and its
competitors has further widened since then.

"We have now attained a figure of 2.2 million motor policies - nearly
twice as many as our nearest rival," Webb told BMI.

This rapid rise in market share can be attributed in part to the highly
competitive rates offered by Direct Line - it claims to have expenses
of 11 percent, compared to an industry average of 25 percent, and it
passes much of its economies onto the customer.

However, insurers like Eagle Star and Norwich Union have launched their
own direct insurance operations with competitive rates, and Direct Line
now finds itself competing directly with these as well as Churchill
Insurance and others. So, how does it continue to gain ground so
rapidly, at the expense of its rivals? Many have attributed its success
story to the memorable brand image, described by one corporate image
consultant as "a marketing director's dream".

"A strong brand is one of the most important elements we have going for
us," Webb said. "There is a huge awareness of the Direct Line brand in
the market. I think that when people are thinking of phoning around for
a quote, ours is one of the first names that springs to mind."

Webb attributes this success to a strong branding strategy, and ongoing
brand advertising on radio, TV, and in the national press. "We have
ongoing campaigns to build brand awareness, or rather to build on the
brand awareness that already exists," he said. "Direct Line has been on
either TV or radio almost every day since 1990." The overall marketing
budget for 1995 was #25 million ($38.64 million).

Direct Line's foray into the home and contents insurance market has
also been, to say the least, a great success. It had been offering such
policies since 1988, but in quite a"subdued" way until 1992 or 1993
when Direct Line put its weight behind the marketing of this section of
the business. The company is now the largest household insurer in the
UK.

ITALY:  ROYAL REVOLUTION IN LOMBARDY

ROYAL INSURANCE of the UK launched its direct selling operation in
Lombardy on January 15, in a bid to provide direct motor insurance to
car owners in the Greater Milan area. The launch was preceded and
accompanied by a major marketing campaign, using the slogan
"Rivoluzione Inglese" (English Revolution), a play on the initials of
the UK insurer.

Royal declined to disclose the campaign budget "for reasons of
competition", but the first phase of the campaign began after Christmas
and ran until the launch date, with teaser posters appearing in the
Milan Metro, in bus shelters, on buses, and in other outdoor sites
around the region.

The second phase got under way on the launch day, when new posters
giving a direct response number were accompanied by radio spots and
adverts in the national dailies.

"In Italy, it is illegal to refuse motorists insurance," a spokesman
told BMI. "So, basically, we are targeting the 25-60 age group, with
better risk profiles. The 1.5 million drivers who fit that profile in
the Greater Milan area - that's the pool we will be fishing in."

According to Royal, market research undertaken after the liberalisation
of the Italian insurance market last year showed that while customers
were generally content to deal with agents, a growing number wanted the
option to deal direct with their insurer.

The new operation is closely modelled on Royal's other direct writing
operations in the UK and Spain, and fits into the insurer's strategy of
developing multi-channel distribution of personal lines business.

Customers will have a choice between receiving a quote by phone or, for
a more personal service, going along to Royal's drive-in basement at
its headquarters where they can deal directly with sales people,
inspectors and claims assessors.

Royal's strategy is to use this initiative as a testing ground, the
spokesman said, at least for the short term."When we see how this goes,
we may in the future consider further expansion in Italy."

US CARD ISSUERS SPONSOR SPORTS

CREDIT CARD issuers and organisations are spending millions on
sponsorship, particularly of sporting events, in order to enhance their
brand image.

The latest industry deal saw MasterCard sign a $2 million exclusive
deal with the National Hockey League last month, while it continues to
promote its gold cards at high profile golf tournaments like the PGA
Grand Slam and the Colonial. Three more important golf sponsorship
deals are on the cards, according to a MasterCard spokeswoman.

MasterCard is also heavily involved in soccer events, and is reported
to have already paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 World Cup
championships in France - a four-year package of associated
sponsorships leading up to the championship which is said to be worth
$40 million. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 million in
relation to World Cup 1994 in the US.

Visa too is extremely active in the sponsorship field, and is reported
to have spent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights
on the National Football League, the Elton John tour and some
destination deals.

American Express signed on with the National Basketball League in May,
paying $30 million for three years, as well as signing a sponsorship
deal with the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of
Texas Stadium, despite Visa's sponsorship supremacy over the football
league as a whole.

Cards sponsorship activity dates back to the 1984 Olympics when
American Express was a leading sponsor, but Visa subsequently took over
in 1988, and has had great success exploiting its exclusive Olympics
sponsorship rights. Such high profile sponsorship opportunities don't
come cheap, however. Visa reportedly paid $40 million for the 1992 and
1996 Olympics.

Credit card companies are not alone in their enthusiasm for sponsorship
as a marketing tool. Sponsorship will top $5.4 billion in the US next
year, said Jim Andrews, vice-president of IEG, a consultancy
specialising in sponsorship. That is 15 percent higher than the $4.7
billion forecast for the whole of 1995.

PROFILING TODAY'S INTERNET USER

A JUST-PUBLISHED survey allows us to draw a profile of today's typical
European Internet user, and gives pointers as to what is likely to grab
his or her (although the ladies represent only 12 percent of users for
the present) attention when surfing the Net.

According to the survey by Durlacher Multimedia of London The Internet
in 1996: An investment perspective, the average Internet user is aged
between 22 and 36 with an annual income of between #13,000 ($20,000)
and #20,000. He spends between six and ten hours a week on the
Internet, has probably made one purchase through the World Wide Web,
and would be more likely to do so if happier with the security issue.

Durlacher claims its 190-page report is the "first substantial
European-orientated survey of the Internet", and would like to see it
become a benchmark for subsequent studies. Its findings are numerous
and varied.

"The World Wide Web is doubling in size every three months," said
Geoffrey Chamberlain, chief executive of Durlacher Multimedia.
"Approaching 100,000 Web sites are forecast by early 1996."

The authors concluded from their research that the first wave of
successful Internet-related businesses will include Internet access
service provision, Internet software applications provision and
Internet consultancy. The second wave will be dominated by content
provision, including provision by the financial services institutions.

The study also forecasts that by early 1996, 33.4 million users will be
connected to the Internet, and that by 2002, more than 200 million
people worldwide will be connected to at least part of the Internet,
with 150 million subscriptions to on-line services.

Security comes up again as an issue. Of 250 respondents, 23 percent had
made one or more purchases via the Web, and 87 percent expressed
interest in doing so. Fifty-seven percent stated that improved security
would certainly encourage them to shop via the Web. The authors believe
secure transaction standards will be set before the end of 1996.

According to the report, analysts expect worldwide on-line advertising
to be worth $200 million in 1996, and to top $1 billion by the end of
the next decade.

ADVANCE BANK AHEAD IN AUSTRALIAN INTERNET RACE

ADVANCE BANK, Australia's sixth-largest bank by assets, is living up to
its name with its latest service offering to customers. It has just
become the country's first bank to allow customers access to their
accounts via the Internet. Other banks are offering product information
services on the Net in Australia.

The 300,000 or so customers of Advance's Quickphone service can now
access their accounts with their Advance card number and Quickphone PIN
when they enter the bank's World Wide Web site.

The bank is not only hoping for a large response from existing
customers, but hopes also to catch the eye of potential new customers
who will be able to view a demonstration when they call up the Advance
Web site.

Transfer funds

At first, the service will just allow business and personal customers
to call up account information, but the plan is to enhance the facility
so as to allow customers to transfer funds between accounts, make loan
repayments and see a full month's statement.

Australian banks have been cautious about providing Internet banking
because of the security issue, and have tended to sit back and wait for
the US to lead the way as regards developing security technology. With
reportedly over 900,000 Australians now regularly surfing the Net,
however, many banks have opened sites on the World Wide Web over the
past year.

These pages generally contain advertising-type information as opposed
to any real banking service. In other words, at present, most banks are
using the Internet mainly as an advertising medium.

One of the more high profile initiatives, Priority One, was set up by
AMP in October to offer home loans from the World Wide Web. It
reportedly received 7,000 queries in the first six weeks, but it
admitted that the conversion rate of Internet inquiries is lower than
from traditional inquiries.

Web presence

Back in September, Westpac launched a Web site containing loan
information. National Australia has its presence on the Web, and the
Commonwealth Bank is developing sites both on the Web and on the
Microsoft Network. In December, St George announced its Internet site
which it claims is more "interactive" than other bank pages.

With the assistance of Techway, a leading Australian information
technology company, Advance is confident that security is not a
problem. All customer information is encrypted for transmission in both
directions over the Internet so the information remains secure, it
claims.

"[Techway] has studied worldwide trends in all aspects of security on
the Internet and it can confidently claim to have secure Internet
transaction software that sets world class standards," a spokesman
said.

Although Advance has beaten its rivals to the post as regards providing
an Internet banking service, the initiative will not provide the bank
with an exclusive advantage in the market. Techway is also"talking
informally" with several others, and seems determined to market its
technology to two or three of Advance's rival banks.

NAB OFFERS LOAN APPROVAL OVER PHONE

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA Bank, the country's largest bank by assets, has
launched what it describes as "the first concerted move into telephone
banking in Australia", offering a special telephone loans service for
personal customers.

The bank claims that its customers can now have a home loan approved in
less than 25 minutes. The service also offers approval for credit
cards, personal loans and term deposits over the phone, typically in
around 15 minutes, according to NAB. It is available to customers
anywhere in Australia seven days a week between 8am and 9pm.

Until now, Australian banks have provided customers with inquiry
services and basic transactions over the phone, the bank claims.
Indeed, NAB itself already offers these various possibilities through
its telephone banking service.

"This new service ushers in true telephone banking, whereby customers
can be provided with major services over the phone," said managing
director Don Argus.

National Telephone Bankers - as the service is called - uses a
computer-based credit assessment system, developed by the bank over the
past two years, allowing the "National Telephone Banker to give or
refuse loan approval in a matter of minutes.

"A decision is made during the initial phone call in almost all cases,"
Argus said."The National is the only bank offering this level of
convenience."

If a loan is approved, all that remains is for the customer in question
to call into a branch, have his or her income verified, and sign the
loan documents.

The launch of the service follows a six-month pilot in New South Wales
and South Australia, which exceeded all expectations, with operators
fielding over 1,000 calls a day. NAB expects to approve over 7,000
loans in the first year in service.

CCF LAUNCHES REMOTE `BRANCH' SERVICE

FRANCE'S CCF has launched a new remote banking service, Banco PC. It is
the first European banking management software program developed on a
PC, according to the bank. This interactive banking service goes far
beyond a simple data transfer on personal finance software. CCF defines
it as a real bank branch accessible by PC - a new remote banking format
which gives CCF an even broader range of services.

Banco PC is built around three main services: Banco PC Branch,
("Agence"), Banco PC Self Management, "Libre Gestion") and Banco PC
Budget. A fourth service is still in development - Banco PC Boutiques
(retail shops).

Banco PC Branch is a remote banking service via PC using the concept of
combining a bank branch graphic with a windows environment. It gives
access to basic banking services such as account balances, deposits,
credit lines, and so on, in the visual environment of a bank branch.

Banco PC Self Management can transfer a bank statement directly to a
spread sheet such as Excel or Lotus 1,2,3. This eliminates
time-consuming data entry or downloading from the Minitel. Banco PC
Budget allows the client to follow a budget using a personal financial
management software program. The CCF has signed an initial partnership
agreement with Intuit for its budget management program Quicken. Thanks
to this agreement, CCF clients using Quicken can record their banking
operations onto their respective Quicken documents to facilitate the
supervision and analysis of their spending.

CCF plans to add other partners to its initial software agreement.
Banco PC Boutiques will give CCF clients the possibility of shopping
directly from their PC, much as they are already doing through the
Minitel (Bancoscope).

The range of Banco PC services are accessible through a PC with a
windows environment, equipped with a modem and a telephone connection.
Banco PC services cost Fr29 ($5.89) monthly for the first service (any
of the four mentioned), and Fr10 for each additional service, with a
maximum monthly charge of Fr49 (tax included). The Banco PC software is
free of charge, as is the service help-line.

To aid its clients in equipping themselves, CCF offers an internal
high-speed modem at a cost of Fr1,000 (the average retail price is
Fr1,500). For their clients who don't have a computer, the multimedia
IBM Aptiva can be obtained with direct delivery from IBM.

This evolution of CCF's long-distance banking services demonstrates its
willingness to respond to the changes in consumer demand and,
therefore, its clients' needs. Currently, 10 percent of French
households have computers and by the year 2000, it is expected that 40
percent will be fully equipped.

SOCIETE GENERALE REMOTE SERVICE EXTENDED

SOCIETE GENERALE'S 680,000 clients in Paris and Hauts de Seine (one of
the more affluent regions in the Paris area) have received along with
their December bank statement the announcement of the new telephone
remote banking service, Vocalia Service, complete with phone number and
the necessary code number.

In November, Societe Generale decided to go ahead and launch Vocalia
Service without the agreement of the unions. The 680,000 clients
concerned are able to reach a "teleoperator" from Tuesday to Friday
from 8am to 9pm, and on Mondays and Saturdays from 9am to 5pm. This is
the first service available following a pilot which was carried out
with the 120,000 clients of six branch groups in the Paris area, and
using different operating times (5pm to 9pm from Tuesday to Friday and
9am to 5pm on Saturdays). As of the second quarter of 1996, this
service will be extended to all 3.5 million Societe Generale clients.

The appointed teleoperators belong to the Societe Generale staff.
Previous to the launch of the service, most operators worked in the
bank's network as client managers and were then trained to work on the
phone.

A Societe Generale spokeswoman insisted that this new service is the
result of developments predating Compagnie Bancaire's Banque Directe
entry onto the market.

"We launched the first platform with essentially Parisian groups,
practically at the same time as Banque Directe was launched," she
said."It is therefore a fully-developed project in Societe Generale,
and not just a reaction to Banque Directe." At present, the service
only concerns Paris and the Paris area.

The French unions involved have refused to accept any agreement
concerning working on a rota basis. In order to bypass this obstacle,
SocGen management decided to have Vocalia Service set up two separate
platforms enabling the service to operate on a timetable of more than
eight hours. Each platform is situated in a different location to avoid
having to set up any form of relay or rota teamwork. The 1937 decree on
bank's working hours is thus respected.

Despite this, the CFDT (Confederation Francaise Democratique du
Travail, one of the French unions) tried to stop Vocalia Service from
being launched in this fashion, by going to court.

The court, however, dismissed the case, and there was no appeal. The
service, which had been on hold pending the decision, was launched
immediately afterwards.

BANKS FUEL DIRECT MAIL BOOM

BANKS MADE a considerable contribution to the strong growth in direct
mailings last year, resulting in another record quarter for direct mail
volume. This was one of the findings of recent research from the Direct
Mail Information Service (DMIS) in London.

It was a good year all round for the direct mail industry. Figures from
the DMIS show that between July and September 1995, direct mail volume
hit 700 million items - up 4.2 percent on the same period in 1994.

Second only to the retail sector - which saw an increase in direct mail
volume of 25 percent - the banking sector increased its volume of
direct mailings by 21 percent to 202 million items for the same three
quarters.

Expenditure on direct mail in the July to September 1995 period was up
3.5 percent on the previous year, at #264.2 million ($400 million).
With only the final quarter figures to come, the DMIS expects
expenditure to hit the $1 billion mark for the second year in a row -
total expenditure was 1.05 billion in 1994.

FIRST DIRECT WINS SERVICE AWARD

FIRST DIRECT, the UK's first direct bank, has won the 1995 Customer
Champion Award, as well as the Best Financial Customer Service award,
presented by Unisys and The Sunday Times.

"We were delighted to be recognised for the standard of customer
service we offer," customer services project manager Amanda Stott told
BMI. "From the launch of First Direct, we have always set out to be the
best in the world, and customer service has been a key priority."

Stott outlined various initiatives which are designed to ensure that
customer satisfaction remains high at First Direct. QUEST (Quality
Undertake Every Single Time) is a staff suggestion scheme, which allows
management to get feedback from those working directly with the
customers, and to get ideas from the customers themselves.

"Action Teams" exist too in every department, where members of staff
get together regularly and have "brainstorming" sessions.

Regular customer satisfaction surveys are also an important way of
monitoring consistency, according to Stott. Once new customers have
reached the end of their "welcome period", questionnaires are
automatically sent out, so as to catch any problems early on in the
process. These new arrivals are asked how the account opening process
went; if they had any problems; and, if so, were they dealt with
swiftly and effectively. The responses to these questionnaires are
monitored monthly.

What is more, each quarter, a survey of established customers is
carried out, involving a mailing of 10,000 or so questionnaires. First
Direct itself carries out the survey for the first three quarters, and
has the final quarter executed independently by NOP.

That said, many banks carry out similar initiatives and yet customer
satisfaction is low. Where are they going wrong?

"We had the added benefit of starting from scratch, of starting with a
clean slate," Stott mused."We carried out extensive market research on
the banking industry, and we were very careful when recruiting.
Remember that, as the banks move towards customer service, they are
having to re-educate their people's thinking."

RBOS DEFENDS ITS TESSA

ROYAL BANK of Scotland has defended the performance of its TESSA
following a damning article, headlined Royal rip-off, that appeared in
the latest Which? - the magazine published by the British Consumers
Association.

"Savers who put their money in the Royal Bank of Scotland TESSA may
find they get less than they bargained for - around #250 [$388] less,"
states the article in question. The magazine criticises the Royal Bank
Tessa because interest is not compounded, but rather is credited to the
account at the end of the five-year term.

"What Which? has failed to do is to look at the whole picture," said
Frank Kirwan, UK director of retail banking at the bank. "The
association has only looked at one element of our return, and forgotten
all about the additional bonuses we offer. What matters to the customer
is not the method of calculation, but the total return investors
receive on their savings.

"Independent surveys show that the overall return to savers on the
Royal Bank TESSA is one of the best available from a high street bank,
and ahead of many of the leading building societies. Indeed, research
by Moneyfacts and Blay's place it second to the TSB and ahead of the
`Big Four'."

Kirwan pointed out that the TESSA was designed for those investors who
held them to maturity."It was always meant to be a long-term savings
medium."

He cited the Moneyfacts research, which placed Royal's TESSA second to
TSB as regards return. Assuming that the TESSA was opened at launch
with the maximum investment of #3,000 and that maximum contributions
had been made on the anniversary of each year after that, the projected
maturity value would be #11,870, compared to TSB's figure of #11,904.

SPAIN:  BANKS OPT FOR ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION

AS A RESULT of new banking legislation introduced in July 1995, a
number of Spanish banks have begun to explore the possibility of
developing tied agents networks to supplement their traditional
distribution channels. Bankinter is one of those to pilot such an
initiative.

Although banks have used financial advisers and insurance agents to
market financial products in the past, no legal framework which defined
and regulated the role of financial agents previously existed.

The new law defines financial agents as mediators who, without being
employees of the bank, habitually carry out determined banking
activities on its behalf. The legal text stresses that financial agents
must respect the same standards of transparency as banks, and cannot
represent more than one bank or consolidated financial group, nor
operate through sub-agents. That said, it is the bank or financial
group that will be held responsible for any failure by the agent to
comply to banking standards and regulations.

This introduction of the financial agent is as a result of EC
legislation which allows banks to operate in other member states
without being obliged to have a banking presence there. However, it is
thought that tied agents networks might also prove a popular option for
the smaller domestic banks. Combining an agent network with a telephone
banking service could be an effective way for banks to reach a wider
market, at a relatively low cost.

Bankinter, one of Spain's most dynamic second-tier banks, has already
begun to recruit financial agents on an experimental basis and,
according to a bank spokesman, hopes to have drawn up a definite
network plan within the next two months.

Bankinter, which has a very small network - 253 branches -compared to
its rivals, hopes tied agents will help it to expand rapidly in regions
where it has no branch presence, as well as reinforcing its existing
branch network.

PORTUGAL:  MUNDIAL GETS IMAGE OVERHAUL

CIA SEGUROS Mundial Confianca, one of Portugal's largest insurers, is
currently undergoing a radical image overhaul in a programme that will
have cost the institution an estimated Esc400 million ($2.67 million)
by the end of 1996. Mundial Confianca is the country's third-largest
non-life insurer and its eighth-biggest life insurer.

The basic aim of the company's new image is the portrayal of stability,
and at its core is the slogan "Live safely because life is a roller
coaster". The company has also changed its emblem from red and brown to
blue and yellow.

"The old emblem was 15 years old and no longer reflected our corporate
identity," explained Paolo Bracon, Mundial Confianca's head of
marketing, adding that the new colours are also those used by Banco
Totta e Acores (BTA) and Credito Predial Portugues (CPP), both of which
are controlled by the owner of Mundial Confianca, Antonio Champalimaud.
"We want to show our customers that we are part of a much larger
private financial grouping."

The launch of the new look, at the end of 1995, was accompanied by a
major publicity campaign using all forms of media advertising. The
campaign, which was designed by marketing company Neovox, is to
continue throughout 1996 and, according to Bracon, the company will be
using this opportunity to launch a whole range of new products
throughout the year, aimed principally at the personal lines sector.

"We are not looking to corner any particular segment of the market,
however," he said. "We are a universal insurance company which can
cover the needs of the entire market. So, while this year we will be
concentrating on one particular area, we will not be doing so at the
expense of other areas." Indeed, a whole range of Mundial Confianca
products will soon be available in all BTA and CPP branches. Mundial
Confianca already markets its products through another bank owned by
Champalimaud, Banco Pinto e Sotto Mayor."This will allow us to greatly
increase the number of clients, which currently stands at about
600,000," Bracon said.

VIDEOCONFERENCING AT IMPERIO

PORTUGAL'S LARGEST insurer, Cia seguros Imperio, has launched a
videoconference booth network in 20 of its branches across the country
- a first for Portugal, it claims.

The new interactive system, called "Video Servicio-Imperio 24", allows
a client to communicate at any time of the day or night with a customer
services officer in the specially-designed booth which is equipped with
only a computer screen and a telephone receiver. It also has a backup
system whereby the client can obtain information without having to
speak directly to the officer, simply by touching the screen.

"The system allows a client to get up-to-the-minute information on any
of our products: how much it will cost to insure the contents of his
house or how much his automobile insurance has gone up, etc," said
Imperio's marketing director, Eugenia Coimbra. "The client can also use
it to make an appointment with one of our agents. However, the real
point of the new system is not just to complement our existing
services, but rather to introduce a human factor."

Pilot trials on the booths revealed that many people initially felt
extremely uncomfortable in them, but Imperio said it does not view this
as a real problem, "as the reaction to Multibanco booths was much the
same when they first appeared". Its primary targets are executives and
educated people "who don't like to stand in queues and are not afraid
of new technology".

Financially, the system has a clear advantage for the company, Coimbra
said."It allows us to provide a 24-hour customer service with a minimum
of staff and reduces the work-load of our staff during office hours."

Imperio plans to increase the number of these booths in its branches to
80 by the end of 1996 alone, and the long-term strategy is to have them
fitted in all its branches. Similar booths are also to be fitted into
Banco Mello branches, which controls Imperio.

GERMAN BANKS RULE OK

Recent research commissioned by the German Bankers Association suggests
that customer satisfaction with the banking industry there is high. Ann
O'Dea analyses some of the findings

AROUND 88 percent of customers are satisfied with the service they
receive from the German banking industry. This is one of the findings
of a representative study carried out by IPOS (Institute for
Practically-oriented Social Research) of Manheim, and commissioned by
the German Bankers Association (Bundesverband deutscher Banken).

This represents a rise in satisfaction of 4 percentage points, when
compared to a similar survey carried out by IPOS in the spring of 1995,
and will be a relief to banks at a time when many European banks are
coming in for severe criticism from their retail customers.

The recently-published results are based on 1,303 interviews, made by
telephone from October 30 to November 2 1995. The total of those who
were questioned is "a representative sample of voting citizens in
Germany", the association said.

The respondents were questioned on various points: the level of trust
in their service providers; analysis of competence; location of their
accounts; judgment of performance; standard of personal advice;
confidentiality; influence of banks on the economy, specifically on
politics.

There was little fluctuation in satisfaction levels between different
types of institutions; commercial banks, savings banks and co-operative
banks. According to the association, this general satisfaction suggests
that the financial service providers take justified criticism
seriously, and are making an effort to improve. Those who confirmed in
writing that they are receiving an improved personal service rose from
28 percent in the spring, to 33 percent in November.

Customers were also asked to comment on the perceived competence of the
banks and, in this area, the commercial banks have the edge. While 57
percent were of the opinion that there is no difference between
institutions in this respect, and 19 percent left the question
unanswered, 14 percent believed that commercial banks display the
greatest competence. Only 5.6 percent pointed to savings banks and 4.4
percent co-operative banks.

As regards the standard of personal advice (see table 2), over half the
respondents said the level has "hardly changed", but 32.6 percent
believed it has improved.

The findings on standards of personal advice contrasted significantly
with results of a recent survey by watchdog Finanztest (see BMI 63)
which suggests that most retail banking customers are given scanty and
ill-considered advice.

Researchers posed as would-be customers seeking advice, and visited the
branches of 21 different banks. The result? One-third of the 147 advice
sessions were rated as "unsatisfactory" or"poor". This of course
suggests that customers would be less aware of the shortcomings of one
bank's investment advice than would be the various financial watchdogs.

Customers were also asked if they felt that information on citizens'
financial relationships was kept confidential by the banks and savings
banks in Germany. While 46.5 percent believed it is, a significant 45.8
percent did not.

Respondents also answered questions on how they perceived the influence
of the banks on the economy and on politics. While 4.1 percent said it
is not enough, and 30 percent said it is just right, over 50 percent of
respondents felt that banks have too great an influence on the economy.
Again, a high 44.6 percent of respondents felt their financial
institutions have too great an influence on politics.

BFG BANK STIRS GERMAN MARKET

BfG Bank believes Germany is seeing a trend towards lower bank charges,
and has decided to anticipate that trend with free banking. BMI takes a
look at the bank's marketing strategy

THE FIRST nationwide German bank to introduce free banking hopes to
double its market share within two years and use cross-selling to
compensate for the lost bank charges.

After carrying out extensive market research on a new strategy for its
retail banking business, BfG Bank has come up with a non-traditional
response. Rather than reducing its cost base and establishing a
stand-alone direct bank, the medium-sized institution has decided to
rely on the strengths of its existing branch network and offer free
banking across the board.

Above all, BfG hopes to increase its market share - which is currently
just under 1 percent - to 2 percent in just two years. "The savings
banks [Sparkassen] and co-operative banks have the dominant position
with an 87 percent market share," said Paul Wieandt, chairman of the
board of managing directors. "Therefore, BfG Bank has to offer
something different from its competitors - and where it counts - in
order to have an impact on the market."

Free banking may be old hat in other markets, but BfG's idea has
created a stir in Germany. Although no-fee accounts have been tried
before by small regional banks, BfG is the first nationwide institution
to attempt it. Last year, one of the big banks, Bayerische Hypotheken-
und Wechsel-Bank (Hypo-Bank), offered free banking for an introductory
period of six months but had little success, probably because of a
flawed marketing strategy (see BMI 61). By contrast, BfG intends to
make its free banking service permanent.

Known as BfG plus, the new BfG current account offers an unlimited
number of free transactions, personal advice in BfG branches, use of
ATM machines, Eurocheques, an EC card and a Visa card. Unusually for
the German market, there is no additional charge for telephone banking
services and no extra fees on overdrawn accounts, as long as the
customer adheres to the agreed overdraft limit (except credit
interest).

BfG admits that free banking will be a loss-maker unless the service
attracts a substantial number of new customers (60,000 in the first
year alone) and earns new income from cross-selling. In the past, BfG
current account customers have opted for an average of two further
products from the bank and its allfinanz partners.

Thus, the success of the venture depends crucially on the selling and
advisory skills of branch-based staff, and, consequently, BfG is
planning to improve its expertise. "Our advantage is the bank's size,"
Wieandt said. "As a medium-sized bank . . . we are able to come up with
initiatives and new products which small regional banks could not
afford to offer and which would be too expensive, i.e. unprofitable,
for our large competitors."

BfG has a network of 178 branches, compared with the 1,000 or so
branches run by its largest competitors such as Commerzbank and
Deutsche Bank. That network was slimmed down during a restructuring
several years ago.

Free banking is also BfG's long-term response to a range of strategic
challenges, which Wieandt mapped out:

- Branch-based banks such as BfG are under threat from non and
near-banks, which already control 10 percent of the retail financial
services market, and from direct banks, which Wieandt believes will
grab 15 percent of the market within five years.

- Germany is over-banked and over-branched. It has one branch for every
1,500 people, compared with 2,500 in the UK. By the year 2000, BfG
expects less than half of all transactions to be done in a branch,
compared with around 60 percent at present.

- Customers are increasingly responsive to price and quality. There is
a trend towards lower bank charges, and BfG has decided to anticipate
that trend with free banking. "We aren't reducing bank charges, we're
bringing them down to zero," Wieandt said.

- It is apparently no longer true that Germans are loath to switch
banks. BfG's market research has indicated that 70 percent of retail
customers would consider changing to another bank, and around half of
them would be motivated by lower charges.

- Telecommunications are forcing the face of innovation in the German
banking market. Customers are increasingly receptive to telephone
banking, direct banking, electronic cash and PC banking.

- Many direct banks and credit card issuers now pay interest on credit
balances:

- Customers can reduce bank charges by making voucherless payment
transfers.

"The transformation of the banking market has not left the retail
banking business untouched. It has long since made the transition from
seller's to buyer's market," Wieandt said.

BfG has begun to build an innovative reputation over the past couple of
years. It was one of the first German banks to introduce telephone
banking, and, in 1993, it successfully launched an account combining
branch-based services and telephone banking. This month, the bank has
introduced the mail-order sale and home delivery of traveller's cheques
and cash in foreign currency. Furthermore, there are plans to establish
a direct broker in the spring.

Previously labelled the"trade union" bank and regarded as highly
traditional in strategy and marketing, BfG Bank was owned by a
union-controlled holding before its sale to Credit Lyonnais in 1992.
The CL-BfG deal was the first sale of a large German bank to a foreign
institution.

At the time, market observers suggested that many German banks,
weakened by low profitability, would have to decide whether they want
to make a serious commitment to universal banking or whether to look
for a niche strategy. BfG now seems to have decided to focus on retail
banking, which has always been one of its most important business
areas.

According to Wieandt, more than half of all claims on non-banks are
loans to retail customers. On the liabilities side, 40 percent of
claims from non-banks are deposits by retail customers. Moreover, the
retail banking division contributes more than half of interest and
commission earnings.

TAKING OFF THE FRILLS

Following calls from the Prices Surveillance Authority for the
abolishment of fixed account-keeping fees, the Big Four Australian
banks have announced basic no-frills accounts. BMI reports

THE BIG Four retail banks in Australia have all announced the launch of
new basic "no-frill" accounts in the past few weeks.

Banks had been set a December 31 deadline to respond to the - now
defunct - Prices Surveillance Authority's (PSA) inquiry last summer
into bank fees and charges, which resulted from public disquiet over
their high level.

Among the PSA recommendations resulting from the inquiry is a greater
use of a "user pays principle" rather than fixed account-keeping fees.
The authority also called for a "basic" account with no account-keeping
fee and a number of "free" debit transactions per month before any fees
were applied.

While each of the Big Four abolished the fixed monthly account-keeping
fees from their new offers, the other features differed from one bank
to another, and were greeted with varying reactions among consumer
bodies and the powers that be.

The Australian Consumers Association judged National Australia Bank
(NAB) to be the only one of the Big Four to have introduced an
acceptable basic transaction account. The product efforts from Westpac
Banking Corporation, ANZ Banking Group and the Commonwealth Bank were
all judged as "could do better".

NAB is pleased with the reception its new fees structure obtained, as
it feels that the changes "reflect the views of current customers and
the outcome of government and community consultation".

"We have listened to the concerns expressed about affordability, access
and the need for a more equitable approach," said Allan Diplock, chief
general manager of NAB. "The outcome is a range of options that provide
flexibility for customers and the opportunity to manage accounts in a
way that will ensure no fees are paid." This fits in well with the PSA
wish to apply the "users pay" principle, thus not penalising those who
carry out a small number of transactions per month.

The number of free transactions is one of the major bones of
contention. NAB is offering eight free transactions monthly to
customers with the `basic' account, after monitoring customer research,
while the other three allow only six.

"Our records show that in a typical month less than 10 percent of our
customers with balances below A$500 would have more than eight
withdrawals," Diplock said. "That is why we've set the free withdrawal
level at eight."

A spokeswoman for the association is also critical of the fees of
between 40 cents and 65 cents charged by Westpac, ANZ and CBA for
excess electronic transactions, particularly in view of National
Australia Bank's modest 25 cent fee.

ANZ's basic Access Simplicity account came under pressure from the
federal treasurer who refused to comment on the account the day it was
announced, whereas he had expressed satisfaction when NAB, CBA and
Westpac made their announcements.

ANZ is charging a higher than average fee for excess over-the-counter
transactions - A$1.25 - but, according to a spokesman, this is designed
to encourage customers to use an ATM or other electronic service,
rather than branch transactions which cost the bank much more. CBA's
even higher fee of A$1.50 for the same excess came under fierce
criticism from the Consumers Association.

However, Allan Fels, chairman of the Australian Competition and
Consumer Commission, which took over the functions of both the PSA and
the Trade Practices Commission, recognised that all the Big Four banks
have "made moves in the right direction". The commission must now carry
out an assessment of the fees structure and report back to the
treasurer, probably before March next.

But how are the banks faring with the loss of revenue from cutting
fixed monthly bank charges? "You need to remember that while we lose
the A$2 or so monthly fixed fee, we have also added the 25 cents charge
for excess transactions, which did not previously exist," said a
spokesman for NAB."That will help offset the account-keeping fees, and
overall we believe the process will be revenue neutral."

Another new charge at NAB is the 75 cents fee for withdrawing cash from
an ATM outside the bank's own network. But customers need not fear -
the bank is busy sending out explanatory literature to all 3 million
customers.

Westpac too is going to great lengths to ensure its customers are well
informed as to the new accounts it is offering. A sum of A$3 million
has been spent on direct customer communication involving direct mail
and advertising, in order to convey the changes to its 1.5 million
customers. Westpac had a time limit in that it launched its new range
of accounts on January 15 - the remaining three will all see start-up
in March.

DESIGNING YOUR ON-LINE OFFERING

When it comes to on-line delivery, there is an increasing awareness of
the necessity for the banking industry to act now or be left behind.
BMI examines recent research on the issue

BANKS HAVE seen their market share drop over the past two decades, as
non-bank financial companies, like mortgage providers, brokerage firms
and mutual funds, have poached some of their most profitable customers.
According to the just-published second volume of The Information
Superhighway and Retail Banking, a joint report from the Bank
Administration Institute (BAI) and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG),
banks face the same risks from emerging on-line providers, unless they
can effectively use their key assets - customer relationships and
customer information.

In developing their on-line strategies, banks will have to consider at
least three options: remaining an integrated player, becoming the
customer's agent, or specialising as a product manufacturer. This is
one of the conclusions of the study.

"In all likelihood an individual bank's strategy will be a hybrid of
these three primary options," says Richard Hartnack, vice-chairman of
Union Bank, and chairman of the Centre for Banking Issues and
Strategies at BAI. "In addition, alliances among banks to aggregate
their collective capabilities and scale will play an important role."

When volume I of the report was published in the summer of 1995 (see
BMI 62), many banks still showed little interest or activity in on-line
delivery. However, as predicted by the authors at that time, the use of
on-line services and the Internet has grown significantly.

The following are some of the more significant developments since the
first part of the report was published, according to the authors:

- A marked increase in the number of banks that have signed agreements
with entities focused on on-line delivery, such as Microsoft, Intuit,
Visa Interactive and MasterBanking;

- A significant increase in the number of banks that are staking out
positions as content providers on the major on-line services;

- An explosion in Internet Web sites, by bank and non-bank players
alike;

- The joint purchase of Meca Software by BankAmerica and Nationsbank;
and

- The aggressive development of strategic payments alliances, such as
Visa and Microsoft; and MasterCard, IBM and Netscape.

The report also draws attention to the rapid growth in the number of
users of commercial on-line services and the Internet. At November
1995, there were approximately 8 million subscribers to commercial
on-line services, and about 10 million users of the World Wide Web part
of the Internet.

The result of this has been an increasing awareness of the necessity
for the banking industry to act now or be left behind, as well as a
realisation of the threats and opportunities facing banks over the next
few years.

"The task at hand for banks now shifts from deciding whether to take
action to deciding how, in what form, and at what speed," the report
states.

Two issues dealt with in detail by the study are how electronic banking
will affect customer behaviour and how banks are to determine the
design of the product offering. A segmentation analysis is used to
evaluate which customers are likely to be early adopters of on-line
delivery, and to assess likely future customer behaviour.

The conclusions suggest that the barriers to on-line delivery are lower
than might be anticipated, and that some of the most attractive
customer segments for banks seem likely to be early adopters.

KEY DESIGN ISSUES BY SEGMENT

New enthusiasts

Description:  Upscale, above-average income, secure about financial
              future
              Desire to learn new things
              Usually married
              Higher level of education,

Issues:       Looking for convenience and time savings
              Will use technology when offered

Implications: Attractive segment
              May be retained by electronic banking

Surfers

Description:  Mostly young and single
              Lower income; temporary for some within segment
              Above average ability to use technology

Issues:       Will use technology
              Concerned with security and privacy

Implications: Many transaction accounts; cost-saving opportunities
              May stop often with technology
              May increase income in future

Old liners

Description:  Usually older and less wealthy
              Capital depleting
              Do not use new technology

Issues:       Like current system, comfortable
              Probably will continue to use branch and teller
              Some migration to ATM and phone

Implications: Least likely to move on-line
              Some may move to screenphones, etc.
              Lower priority

Source: BCG/BAI

But how does one forecast how customers will respond to on-line
banking? The study points to research which indicates that almost 70
percent of current financial transactions are conducted using methods
other than branches and ATMs - phones, mail and AVRUs (Automated Voice
Response Units). Almost half the remaining 30 percent are interactions
with ATMs. It concludes that customers who currently bank by phone or
ATM will migrate more rapidly to on-line banking.

"In many ways, the move from a branch to an ATM was a bigger shift for
some customer segments than the move from telephone to PC will be," the
authors say. "The first move required new behaviour; the second shift
requires a more modest change in behaviour and is accompanied by a
significant increase in functionality."

The study also makes an interesting point as regards the
cannibalisation debate. It claims that rather than rendering the branch
network obsolete, as on-line banking takes hold it will cannibalise
existing electronic bank delivery systems - "those used by the affluent
`early adopters' of technology".

There is also a feeling that the millions of dollars invested in
electronic projects, including screen-phones, may have been better
spent elsewhere. "Near term, only the PC is really viable," claims Tom
Wurster, vice-president of the Boston Consulting Group. "The slowdown
in the deployment of broadband services says to us that the PC will
dominate on-line banking for the near to medium term."

The study cites research which supports this thinking. PC with modems
will be in 40 percent of US households by the year 2000, it claims, and
one of the most attractive segments of the banking community (under 30
years, over $50,000 income) already has a PC/modem penetration of 43
percent - four to five times higher than that in households with
incomes below $30,000 (see figure 1).

The principal "roadblocks" for these key customer segments is "the lack
of compelling on-line content, easy ways to gain access to that
content, and a secure on-line payments system", the authors say, adding
rather ominously that non-bank financial services players are currently
focused on providing these latter, particularly for these attractive
customer groups.

Because the different customer segments differ radically in their
openness to on-line delivery, and use of banking products, the design
of the on-line offering necessitates a close analysis of customer
segments and product use. BCG uses a lifestyle segmentation format,
developed by US market research firm Odyssey L.P., to make general
observations on how different offerings will need to be designed to
appeal to different segments, dividing customers into three possible
target segments (see figure 2):

- New enthusiasts: upscale, typically between the ages of 30 and 60,
largely white collar;

- Surfers: a subsegment of younger households, typically more highly
educated with upscale potential; and

- Old liners: retired customers with moderate or fixed incomes,
typically below $50,000.

These three segments, the study says, constitute a significant
percentage of the overall market, and are useful starting points when
looking at the key considerations in the design of the offering by
segment.

Banks have traditionally had a lower share of wallet with the wealthier
customers between the ages of 30 and 60 - similar to the new
enthusiasts. These potentially profitable customers typically have
relationships with several financial institutions, tending to use
specialist providers for some of the larger investments, like mortgages
or mutual funds. What is more, these are likely to constitute a very
attractive on-line segment.

Attitudinal research, according to the study, would suggest that this
segment is often looking for convenience and time saving, and will
often opt for technology when offered.

An on-line offering for these customers will need to address both the
desire for convenience and their specific life cycle product needs, the
BCG concludes. A focus on the role of investment products, financial
planning, mortgages and so on may be necessary, as well as the
interactive on-line environment. The study offers the example of
"integrated information, such as an on-line net worth statement, linked
to both bank holdings and other holdings" as a core information
offering. Above all, it insists on the importance of being early with
an on-line offering to this segment, so as to gain usage and loyalty,
at a time when competing non-bank institutions are targeting this same
segment.

Another key group for which to design an on-line offering may be the
surfer-type subsegment of under-30 households. Unfortunately, this
segment is typically unprofitable for the banks. "They keep small
balances, use only a few products and generate many transactions."
However, many of these households will become attractive customers as
they grow older and more successful.

The authors suggest a streamlined offering, with lower delivery costs
while improving access and convenience, in this way increasing
profitability and retention. The on-line offering should take into
account the attitudinal and behavioural characteristics of this
segment. These customers are generally comfortable using technology and
may value the convenience of on-line delivery of statements and e-mail
inquiries. It is also a segment associated with loans and credit
facilities so an offering which includes on-line credit applications
with quick response could have particular appeal, for example.

Retired customers with fixed incomes, similar to the old liners,
represent one of those segments which are low priority when designing
on-line offerings, in the short or medium term. These latter are often
the most frequent users of the branch, and lowest users of ATMs.
Attitudinal research suggests these may be one of the hardest to switch
to on-line delivery.

In designing their on-line offerings, it is essential that the banks
consider the actions of the non-bank players who are busy designing
their own, the report insists. "Financial services has many attributes
that make it a logical and attractive candidate for on-line delivery,"
it points out. "Recent events have confirmed this view." The following
are laid out as some of the principal considerations in relation to the
design of on-line offerings:

The most innovative non-bank players have a significantly lower
delivery cost structure than banks, in part because they do not have
the investments in brick and mortar that banks do. The possibility of
on-line delivery will probably cause them to see opportunities to
further expand their customer relationships at the expense of banks.

Some of these players have strong brand positions, national presences,
and high shares of the early adopter segments of the market (e.g.
surfers, new enthusiasts).

Some of these players may also take advantage of their current brand
positions by expanding the range of products and information offerings.
These offerings can easily be outsourced.

Only by evaluating the differing motivations of the non-bank players
can the banks come to understand the likely competitive threat from the
different on-line offerings, the report warns.

The authors suggest a return to analysis of customer needs and product
characteristics. Many of the surfers and new enthusiasts, for example,
will prefer to shop for products, as opposed to having products sold to
them, and will thus react positively to an offering that includes
comparison shopping. "If banks are hesitant to promote the products of
others, their offerings will have less appeal to these customers," the
authors claim.

Banks are also reminded of their own competitive advantages -owning
current customer relations with a high level of trust, wide range of
delivery channels for customer convenience, payment systems access and
access to customer data. The report concludes that transforming this
data into customer information is one of the greatest challenges for
banks today, and will be crucial for an effective on-line presence.

The platform options available to banks are numerous and priorities
will have to be established from the start, the report says. Banks need
to decide whether to develop their service on commercial OLS (on-line
services), the Internet or both. Another option would be for banks to
develop a proprietary banking platform.

The choice of a commercial OLS provider, like Microsoft's Microsoft
Network, has advantages like access to new customers and standard
interfaces for customers to use when carrying out their on-line
transactions. The report cites the example of Fidelity Investments in
the US which has a "strategy of ubiquity", aiming to get on the maximum
number of OLS platforms as possible, while others prefer to be more
selective.

Before choosing a platform provider, the report says, it is essential
to consider the following: the on-line service's customer base; on-line
delivery development, including software skills; brand visibility and
positioning; and ownership of customer information. It will also be
necessary to look at the OLS's customer base and how it overlaps with
the bank's existing and target customer segments.

While the Internet has been the subject of much hype, and we have
recently seen the creation of an Internet-based bank, Security First
Network Bank, the report notes that it is far from certain how this
platform will develop. Despite its huge popularity, the report points
out that it is accessed by anyone, but controlled by no one, and
questions whether security on the Internet will ever be sufficient to
transact financial services.

Proprietary platforms, on the other hand, offer three principal
advantages: lack of an intermediary between the bank and the customer;
complete control over content, navigation as well as the "look" and the
"feel" of the service; and the lack of other financial service
providers vying for customers on the same platform. However, many
customers have previously demonstrated their lack of interest in
provider-specific platforms.

"Each institution must map its objectives against the alternatives and
the uncertainties before deciding where and how to participate."

Above all, BCG concludes that the banks must be alert to the
competitive threats closing in on all sides and respond effectively.

"The banking industry stands at the crossroads," says David Taylor,
executive vice-president of the BAI and co-director of the study."The
on-line services, software giants, global entertainment companies,
telcos and utilities have the pipelines and the navigational tools. If
banks don't act with foresight and firm purpose, the prognosis is for a
continuing erosion of their core retail business."

CAPTURING THE CUSTOMERS

Hong Kong is one of Asia's largest financial centres. With 1997 rapidly
approaching, Andrew Moody reports from a market where product
development takes precedence over slick marketing campaigns

FEW WORLD markets are now as attractive for marketing banking services
as Asia, where there have been dramatic increases in personal wealth
for more than a decade. Per capita incomes in many of the so-called
`Tiger' economies now exceed those in Europe and the rest of the
western world.

The region's banks face a tough challenge to develop new products and
offer ever improved services to capture this new wealth against a
background of fierce competition.

Despite the spectre of 1997, nowhere is this more true than in Hong
Kong, one of Asia's largest financial centres with more than 400
domestic and foreign banks, although only 180 of them are licensed.

Over recent months, in particular, all of the leading banks have been
launching products, hoping that a particular extra specification will
be enough to attract elusive customers.

Like western banks, they have been trying to segment the market to make
sure they do not fail to properly target the territory's burgeoning
middle class population, the result of a decade or more of GDP growth
of between 5 percent and 8 percent.

The partial collapse of the so-called Hong Kong interest rate cartel,
which made it difficult for the banks to compete on loan and deposit
rates, has also led recently to very aggressive price-driven marketing
strategies.

Despite the competition, Hong Kong banks, unlike their western
counterparts, meet with very little consumer resistance. The territory
is one of those rare places where banking and bankers are popular. The
average Hong Kong citizen has 2.4 bank accounts in 1.9 banks.

Newspapers, both Chinese and English, are scoured for any
advertisements signalling changes in deposit rates.

Talking about banking and finance over dinner would not necessarily
single you out as a crashing bore but just as someone talking about one
of the most interesting subjects around.

The challenge for the banks is therefore not to come up with slick
subliminal advertising campaigns to make banking seem exciting because,
in the minds of the consumer, it already is. Much of the marketing
literature is, therefore, matter of fact and very much to the point.

Instead, what the banks have to do is not so much to work on the image
but rather on the real products, a much more difficult exercise.

All the banks spend considerable resources on product development so
they might have that added feature which influences a consumer's final
decision.

Peter Wong, banking director of Citibank, one of the leading foreign
banks in the territory, which has just moved to luxurious new offices
near Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Quarry Bay, said the marketing
challenges for the bank are very different from those in the US.

"It is a unique market in many ways. People here are very
entrepreneurial and they have that mentality," he said. "If you go to
the US, nobody in the street is going to know what the dollar exchange
rate is for the German mark but they would here.

"As a result, we have, to some extent, to launch aggressive products
which are ahead of the competition."

The leading product innovators in the market are, by common agreement,
the Hong Kong Bank, the Hang Seng Bank (62 percent owned by the Hong
Kong Bank but autonomous and independently listed), Standard Chartered,
Citibank and Bank of East Asia.

There has been much recent emphasis on packaged products in the market.
Hong Kong Bank has launched Asset Vantage which gives those that have
access to it gold trading and the ability to hold deposits in different
currencies.

And last July, Hang Seng Bank, the second-largest locally-incorporated
bank, launched its Bank-in-One account which consolidates a number of
features including flexible overdraft and 24-hour automated phone
banking to the mass market customer. This was one of 17 new products
launched by the bank last year.

Despite the risks, foreign currency accounts are traditionally very
popular, even among mid-range customers, perhaps largely because of
Hong Kong's trading nature.

Other very popular products are tax loans which people take out because
there is no PAYE or pay-as-you-go tax system in the colony.

The key products, however, are deposit accounts and mortgages. These
and not the cheque account - as in the west - are regarded as the coat
hanger product on which to build a long-term relationship.

Alex Au, managing director of the Hang Seng Bank, said the important
thing is to establish a long-term relationship with a customer.

"This is what you have to do in banking everywhere, and probably the
best way to do it is through the deposit account or mortgage," he said.

"One can read too much into this as a cultural difference between us
and the west since people here often use their deposit accounts the
same as a cheque account.

"Once you have got the customer, you can cross-sell other products,
which enables you to build your competitive strategy and market share."

The growing middle class has encouraged the banks to target their more
affluent customers.

It has even brought banks into the retail sector which weren't
previously there. One of these is ABN-AMRO which, although in the
region for 90 years, only decided to offer retail products three years
ago. These now bring in an incredible 30 percent of its Hong Kong
profits.

"We saw the middle and upper sectors of the market as a real
opportunity and we have come in with a mortgage product which has an
interest rate 0.5 percent cheaper than most of our rivals," said Sergio
Rial, ABN AMRO's general manager in Hong Kong.

"We are still very much building up our retail side but it is certainly
a marketing strategy which has already paid off."

Citibank too makes no bones about targeting the well off.

"The Hong Kong affluent are very much our target market and our minimum
to open an account is $HK50,000 ($6,465)," Citibank's Wong said.

Hong Kong Bank has gone further than most by developing new Select
branches for its upper segment customers, leaving other customers to
slum it in standard and automated branches.

But Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing and planning with
Hong Kong Bank, insisted it is not ignoring other customers.

"Although we segment the market, banking is banking is banking is
banking," he said. "We can't really offer a significantly different
service to one customer compared to another."

Branch design has come to be a key element of any marketing strategy of
Hong Kong banks.

The banks are reluctant to reveal their expenditure on branches, but
with few exceptions they are among the most splendid examples of both
interior and exterior banking architecture anywhere in the world.

Branches are not just about getting customers inside, but about making
use of the time customers spend within them. Customers very often use
their local branches as meeting places for colleagues and friends.

So, after they finish their business they often stand around engaging
in long conversations, perhaps about the day's currency movements or
the latest rate of interest in the bank around the corner.

Creating the right ambience in the banking hall is therefore important.
The Bank of East Asia deploys music, ranging from light tunes in the
morning to heavier up-beat music in the evening.

HONG KONG FACTS

Population                   6.15m
Life expectancy              Males 75.4, Females 81
GDP                          $HK151.0 billion
Per capita income            $HK24,361
Growth rate                  4.5%
Inflation                    9%
Prime interest rate          9%
Money supply (M2) increase   18%
Unemployment rate            3.5%

The branches do, however, represent greater opportunities for marketing
than in Europe. Many of the banks have installed computer displays
which give customers up-to-date information on products and markets.

As Au said: "I think in terms of branches we are very much ahead of
banks in the west. We place great emphasis on giving our customers
first class service within the branches."

Pricing in terms of interest rates on deposits and loans has become a
much more fundamental part of the marketing strategy since the
relaxation of the cartel began in October 1994.

Instead of being fixed by the Hong Kong Association of Banks, interest
rates on deposit accounts held longer than seven days are now freely
floating.

This has led to a lot of market buying with banks trying to gain market
share in new product areas by taking a loss lead position.

Some of the bigger banks are concerned about this added uncertainty in
the market, particularly in the run-up to 1997 which creates more than
a few uncertainties of its own.

The Dah Sing Bank, a new entrant to retail, has been accused of
deliberate market buying.

It launched a credit card 18 months ago with a bonus scheme which gave
it an effective interest rate 25 percent below the competition. Derek
Wong, Dah Sing's head of retail, defended the strategy.

"I think the competition is now open and fair," Wong told BMI. "It is
now a matter of how you operate your business strategy which will
determine how successful you are."

Those marketing banking products in Hong Kong are as preoccupied with
age targeting as their counterparts in the west.

Most of the banks are keen to attract students, not only because they
may prove to be lifelong customers but because they are likely to be
monogamous in their banking habits - a rare quality in Hong Kong.

They do this by offering discount credit cards and air miles, less
gimmicky offers than the record token and free gift offers of some
western banks.

"The competition for students is driven partly because of this," said
David K.P. Li, deputy chairman and chief executive of the Bank of East
Asia. "The student does not have much money so he is unlikely to bank
with anyone else, which makes him or her a better all-round customer.
You do, however, hope to hang on to them for the rest of their lives."

Older people are also becoming increasingly a target market for the
banks. The average life expectancy for males in Hong Kong is 75.4 and
females 81, compared to 73 years for men in the US and 79 for women.
Hong Kong is therefore moving more rapidly to an ageing population than
many countries in the west.

The banks are responding by providing products geared specifically to
older customers.

W.K. Mok, deputy general manager and head of retail in Hang Seng Bank,
said investment and protection products are particularly attractive to
this market.

"We have specifically developed a greater array of insurance products
and wealth accumulation investment products to cater for this very
important market," he said. Citibank's Wong said banks are having to
think more and more of the life cycle in their product offer to
customers.

"I think you have to look at taking the customer over, for example, at
25 years. When he or she is younger, the credit card might be the
driving product, then the mortgage, then the savings account, then
foreign exchange and then insurance products," he said.

Although Asia is becoming an increasingly attractive market for banks,
it remains very difficult for outsiders to penetrate.

Banks such as Standard Chartered and Hong Kong Bank have their roots in
19th century colonisation and to all intents and purposes are local
banks rather than British ones.

Across Asia, the US and European banks which have a presence have a
long association with the region. They also have a regional
infrastructure with a network of branches across the key capitals and
financial centres.

It would, therefore, be difficult for a carpet-bagging bank just to
target, for example, Hong Kong, because it would be at an immediate
competitive disadvantage with other banks which could offer regional
services.

"I think if you were going to set up in Asia it would be very difficult
just to set up in Hong Kong. You really need a presence across the
region. You could get lost," said ABN-AMRO's Rial.

A key element of future marketing strategies will undoubtedly be China.
The branches that banks have there tend to be there to facilitate
business between the mainland and Hong Kong and for the Chinese
businessman. But, as the Chinese market liberalises and a retail
banking demand emerges, the Hong Kong banks will be in a better
position than most to take advantage.

"While Hong Kong is likely to remain a key component of the HSBC
Group's business well into the foreseeable future, our mainland
operations will grow increasingly important," said Hong Kong Bank's
Tai.

"Foreign banks are unable to deal in the renminbi, the local currency,
at present. But this will eventually change and when it does we will be
ready to take the initiative."

THE FUNDAMENTAL FLAWS

The way in which banks market their electronic banking services is
often fundamentally flawed, according to Richard G Lyons of Internet
Inc.

WHILE MOST retail bankers see their electronic banking services as a
priority, they are making some common mistakes in the way they market
them to their customers. This is the claim made by Richard G Lyons Jr,
executive vice-president and chief operating officer of Internet Inc.,
which operates the Most ATM network in the US.

Many retail bankers have not yet made clear the message they wish to
convey to those customers who might be interested in electronic
banking, he said at the BAI (Bank Administration Institute) Retail
Delivery Systems conference last month.

While almost 63 percent of retail bankers believe their electronic
banking services save money, only 17 percent feel their institution is
"where it needs to be in its electronic banking programme". These are
some of the results of recent research that Lyons shared with the
delegates. Only 42 percent believe their institutes "have a clear
strategy for where we're going with EFT [Electronic Funds Transfers]".

Internet's research involved extensive interviews with retail banking
managers, marketing managers and branch managers from 140 different
financial institutions. A large majority agreed that electronic banking
is a priority. Yet, many admitted they are not spending enough time or
money on it, and are not investing enough in training for staff.

Only 18 percent of interviewees agreed that "we spend enough time and
money promoting electronic banking". While 87 percent agreed that
electronic banking transactions at their institutions are increasing
every month, 73 percent admitted "Our branch personnel probably have a
lower understanding of EFT than I."

"Consumers' antennae are up higher when they need what you're selling,"
Lyons stated, insisting that banks would have a far greater degree of
success marketing their electronic services if customers were made
aware that it allows them a hassle-free lifestyle. Yet, he said, 65
percent of bankers agreed that "at account opening, we spend more time
with cheque choices than explaining electronic banking options".
Indeed, the research found that a mere 27 percent of retail bankers
agreed that their customers are "well aware of all our electronic
banking services".

Over half of the bankers interviewed felt customers are not yet ready
for many EFT programmes, but Lyons suggested this might be a false
presumption and pointed to a recent survey in which 64 percent of total
households agreed "using electronic banking services is more convenient
than going to a branch". He claimed that consumers are much more
willing to use alternative delivery channels than banks realise, and
that banks need to communicate the availability of such channels in
order to compete.

There seemed, from the research, to be a realisation among financial
institutions of the threat from non-bank institutions. While only 18
percent agreed that banks are in control of the emerging consumer
electronic delivery channels, 70 percent agreed that"Microsoft and
regional telephone companies could someday [soon] threaten to siphon
deposits away from financial institutions". Indeed, 87 percent of
interviewees felt that non-banks are in a position to compete with the
electronic banking delivery systems owned and operated by banks.

Lyons suggested that many changes in attitude are needed to be made in
order that bankers make a success of their electronic banking
strategies. What are needed are clear marketing objectives, customer
focus, effective brand management and good investment, he said.

RAYMOND JAMES PLANS BIG BOOST FOR BANK SERVICES

In the financial equivalent of "man bites dog," Raymond James
Financial Inc. has underway a major thrust into traditional banking
services via its wholly owned bank, Raymond James Bank. The St. Petersburg-
based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured products
like checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank will
market home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.
     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might become the
nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEO of
Raymond James bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically and
electronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial services
so all their financial services can be received from our firm," she said.
     The bank's initial target market will be the company's hefty customer
base of some 300,000 securities clients. Raymond James actually has
400,000, but some of the accounts are linked and Schefstad preferred the
more conservative estimate of 300,000 to describe her potential customer
base.
     "We'll be able to offer our clients several product choices. We have
the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweep account) option, and
the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstad explained. The Heritage
funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.
     The company will continue its tradition of not incenting brokers to
sell proprietary products. "The compensation for our three options is
consistent for all three product options," Schefstad pointed out. In fact,
this compensation practice has worked to the detriment of the Heritage fund
family. Growth of its individual funds hasn't even come close to other
brokerage houses proprietary funds despite the company's nationwide branch
network.
     Schefstad claims that James is the only broker/dealer to wholly own a
full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, which must resort to
the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the banking business, James
purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of $12 million from
the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the company chartered the Raymond
James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate in all 50 states. The
bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million in assets and $136 million
in deposits.
     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has been wrestling
with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies and integrating
the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.
     "Because of who owns us for everything we have done we obtained
regulatory approval. For example, when we developed our consolidated
statement we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosure policy and
separation of accounts," Schefstad said.
     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near its headquarters
in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank's efforts to take
place electronically, particularly through the nationwide automated teller
machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATM isn't yet possible
but Schefstad said the firm's brokerage clients are sophisticated enough to
understand and use direct-deposit options available through the automated
clearing house system.

OCC READIES INSURANCE EXAM ACTIVITIES

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is preparing for the day
when national banks receive insurance powers. The Washington-based
regulator has created a task force to consider how a national bank's
insurance activities should be supervised. The Comptroller has created the
task force in anticipation of Barnett Banks winning its landmark case
scheduled for this month in the U.S. Supreme Court. A win for Barnett is
generally interpreted as blanket permission for national banks to sell
insurance.
     "They (the OCC) are laying the groundwork for determining quickly how
national bank insurance activities should be supervised," said one banker
familiar with the OCC's secret task-force meetings. He said similar
meetings were held several years ago to discuss how the OCC should regulate
the sale of mutual funds by banks -- well before the OCC published its
guidelines.
     Under examination, sources said, are the issues of licensing for bank
employees and the development of either regulations or guidelines governing
insurance sales but not both. The difference is crucial. Violating
guidelines usually brings little more than a wrist-slapping to the
offending bank. Violating regulations brings down the whole panoply of
fines, dismissals, and bank takeovers.
     For example, violating an OCC cease-and-desist order can bring fines
up to $1 million daily against the banks as well as their officers and
directors.
     The Comptroller's Office decided to go ahead with the insurance
examination task force after meeting with representatives of the American
Bankers Association and the Bankers Roundtable. Attending the task force
sessions, sources said, were Konrad Alt, chief assistant to Comptroller
Eugene A. Ludwig, and General Counsel Julie Williams. The task force
reportedly is expected to decide its next steps -- still unclear -- by
today.
     The OCC task force is apparently a reaction to rumblings on Capitol
Hill where, reportedly, insurance industry lobbyists are telling members of
Congress that the Supreme Court ruling will not address the issues of
supervising and licensing bank insurance activities.
     Banking industry officials charge the insurance lobbyists are
indulging in "scare tactics" to influence Congress to answer the court
ruling with legislation that will brunt the effect of a win for Barnett.
The banking officials characterize the insurance lobbyists' concerns as
unwarranted. They further say the OCC is trying to be proactive to reassure
Congress that the OCC will continue to monitor, examine, and regulate all
national bank activities.
     "Indeed, this oversight would be considered suffocating by regular
insurance agents," a banking industry lobbyist said.
     Among the questions raised during the task force meetings, according
to a banker who attended, was the issue of whom the agency should consult
before putting the final touches on its insurance rules. Among those
suggested were state insurance commissioners and the banking and insurance
industry trade groups.

FED ALLOWS ANNUITY SALES IN SECTION 20 SUBSIDIARIES

The Federal Reserve Board will allow banks to consolidate their
annuity sales and brokerage activities under the terms of a no-action
letter the Fed published last month. The regulatory agency declined to name
the bank holding company receiving the permission.
     The newly permitted activity allows a bank to use its employees of a
nonbank subsidiary of the holding company, i.e., a Section 20 subsidiary,
to also sell annuities. The Fed's general counsel, Virgil Mattingly, signed
the letter which is an indication of the importance the letter had taken in
the eyes of the Fed staff and the Board of Governors.
     The no-action letter, dated December 6, establishes a format that
contemplates two forms of contracts. The first is a contract between a
third-party vendor and the Section 20 subsidiary. The other involves a
contractual lease of space between a vendor and the bank. The assumption of
the no-action letter is that the banking subsidiary of the holding company
can either engage in annuity sales under state law or can sell annuities
because it is a national bank.
     The particular format approved by the Fed works only if the bank
holding company uses a vendor offering brokerage services through the
Section 20, and the employees selling the annuities work for both the
Section 20 subsidiary and the third-party vendor.
     Some critics of the Fed's action charge that the arrangement is
convoluted and not as simple as the authority granted freely by the
Comptroller of the Currency. This is true. And a 14-year-old banking law is
the reason. There is a specific reference in the Garn-St Germain Act of
1982 barring annuity sales by holding companies. So, the Fed created the
convoluted annuity sales structure to accommodate the Garn-St Germain
restrictions.
     The Comptroller has already allowed dual employee relations for
national bank annuity sales. The structure is simpler for two reasons.
First, the Valic decision gives national banks the power to sell annuities
and, second, the incidental powers authority of the Comptroller makes it
easier for the regulator to authorize annuity sales.

KEYCORP PURSUES SMALL BUSINESS 401(K) PLANS

Add Cleveland's KeyCorp to the list of banks eyeing the hotly
contested small-business market for defined contribution plans. It appears
the entire banking industry has carved out this niche as a way to make
money and to further boost sales of bank proprietary mutual funds.
     In KeyCorp's case, the program consists of five Victory proprietary
mutual funds.
     KeyCorp will eventually market the product, dubbed PRISM Small
Business, nationwide to businesses with fewer than 100 employees. It will
start offering the system to businesses in Albany, Buffalo, Cincinnati,
Northern Indiana, and Syracuse. The heavy concentration of New York state
markets reflects the former headquarters of Key Bank before it merged with
Society Bank to form KeyCorp. The banking company markets its PRISM product
to large company 401(k) plans. KeyCorp developed PRISM in 1991 and claims
to serve more than 750 plans in 14 states with assets under management
totaling $4 billion.
     The market for small business 401(k) plans is expected to swell to
$199 billion by the end of the decade. In 1994 the market stood at $70
billion in plan assets, according to widely published research numbers.

TORONTO-DOMINION BREAKS NEW GROUND

In the U.S., the average bank mutual fund customer faces the quandary
of which funds to select in addition to the bank's proprietary fund. Not so
in Canada where, until recently, banks were allowed to sell only their own
proprietary funds clearly marked with the bank name. Now, Toronto- Dominion
Bank has received approval from several provincial securities commissioners
to sell other brand-name mutual funds in its 900-branch network throughout
Canada. Toronto-Dominion is the first Canadian bank to receive this power.
     Mark Wettlaufer, president of TD Asset Management (TDAM), also
announced that the bank was creating an asset-allocation account in which a
customer may accumulate not only the bank's Green Line No-Load mutual funds
but also the other funds the bank has received the power to sell.
     Investment advice will come from TDAM's portfolio managers; the bank's
discount brokerage company, Green Line Investor Services, will provide the
back-office execution.
     Last year, Toronto-Dominion announced the first of its expansion plans
in the U.S. with the opening of several Green Line investment centers
anchored by the company's office in New York. While the company would
specialize in servicing the Canadian investments of U.S. and Canadian
investors, it also aims to break into the competitive discount brokerage
market in the U.S.
     Wettlaufer said Green Line operates a sales force of 5,000 throughout
its branch network and has C$10 billion (roughly US$7.3 billion) in assets
under management

FIDELITY ADDS UNIT TRUSTS TO BANK OFFERINGS

Fidelity Investments has decided it's time the investing public at
banks had a shot at unit investment trusts. The Boston-based financial
behemoth has added a series of Fidelity-sponsored unit investment trusts to
its well-known line of Fidelity Advisor funds, the principal Fidelity funds
sold through banks.
     The funds come through Fidelity Capital Markets. The Fidelity unit
calls them Fidelity Defined Trusts. Fidelity Rolling Government Series
(FRoGS), will feature one short-term Treasury portfolio product and
Fidelity Laddered Government Series (FLaGS), will feature a short-term
Treasury portfolio product and a short/intermediate-term Treasury
portfolio.
     Fidelity Investments Institutional Services Company will offer all
three UITs as part of its Fidelity Advisor family of mutual funds sold
through investment professionals at brokerage firms, banks, and insurance
companies. Fidelity also will continue to make third-party UIT products
available to its retail and institutional customers.
     "UITs are a viable alternative for investors who want a fixed maturity
date and a maturity value in their fixed-income investments," said Tim
McKenna, executive vice president of Fidelity Capital Markets fixed-income
division.

Fixed, Unmanaged Treasury Portfolio
     While Fidelity mutual funds are managed by Fidelity Management &
Research Company, Defined Trusts are selected by Fidelity Capital Markets.
Fidelity's new FRoGS are designed to provide monthly income and
preservation of principal through a fixed and unmanaged portfolio of U.S.
Treasury securities.
     Maturities on FRoGS will be distributed in 25% increments every three
months over a one-year period beginning in March 1996.  Spreading the
return of principal over a period of time allows investors to increase
flexibility and minimize risk.
     Proceeds from maturing U.S. Treasury notes on FRoGS will be used to
repurchase an additional one year U.S. Treasury note.  Fidelity will "roll"
these distributions four times a year beginning in 1996 and ending in 1997.
The Trust will distribute principal in 25% increments in 1998.
     Treasury securities maturing every six months beginning in November
1996 and ending in November 1998.  The average maturity is about two years.
Series 2 consists of five short- and short-intermediate U.S Treasury
securities maturing every 12 months beginning in May 1996 and ending in May
2001.  The average maturity of the Series 2  FLaGS is approximately 3.5
years.

STEIN ROE PICKS NEW FUND NAME

Stein Roe Mutual Funds has renamed the Stein Roe Prime Equities Fund
the Stein Roe Growth & Income Fund effective the beginning of next month.
      "We believe the new name more accurately reflects the Fund's
investment philosophy by recognizing both its growth and income
components," said Tim Armour, president of Stein Roe Mutual Funds. The
fund's investment objective also will be revised to better reflect the
income mission of the fund.
     The revised objective will be to pursue both growth of capital and
current income. It is  designed for investors seeking a diversified
portfolio of securities that offers the opportunity for long-term growth of
capital while also pursuing a steady stream of income.
     The fund's investment strategy will remain the same, which is to
invest in well-established companies whose common stocks are believed to
have both the potential to appreciate in value and to pay dividends to
shareholders.
     The fund will continue to emphasize investments in equity securities
of companies having market capitalizations in excess of $1 billion.
Securities of these well-established companies are believed to be generally
less volatile than smaller companies.
     Founded in 1932, Stein Roe & Farnham is a Chicago-based investment
management firm. It provides professional investment management for
individuals and institutions and serves as investment adviser to the Stein
Roe family of 18 no-load mutual funds.

CALENDAR

With the winter storm still a very fresh memory in the minds of many
on the East Coast, two investment product groups have wisely opted to hold
their meetings in Palm Springs, CA. And it appears the popularity of the
site has caused at least one group to run out of rooms for the time being.
The Bank Securities Association's Tom Cote said the group is negotiating
with hotels in Palm Desert to cough up more rooms for the February 24-27
annual convention of the BSA.
     The meeting starts Saturday, February 24, with an address by Phil
Feigin, the securities commissioner for Colorado. Other featured speakers
are Robert Novak, a syndicated columnist and (invited) Rep. Sonny Bono, a
member of the House Banking Committee, and the former mayor of Palm
Springs. For the latest update on the meeting call the BSA at (415) 924-
8010.
     Starting six days before the BSA's meeting is the popular marketing
conference of the National Association for Variable Annuities. It'll be
held in a "suburb" of Palm Springs in La Quinta, CA. The exhibit area opens
on Sunday, February 18, but the real meeting starts the next day. The
conference runs through February 24, with concurrent sessions running each
morning. The keynote address comes from Robert Palmer, the California
insurance commissioner. So far, the lone banking representative speaking at
the meeting is Philip Corwin, the American Bankers Association's director
of operations and retail banking. For more information contact NAVA at
(703) 620-0674.

SUPERMARKET MUTUAL FUND SALES EXPECTED TO INCREASE

The supermarket banking trend appears to be maturing beyond plain
vanilla banking, according to a survey conducted by supermarket banking
consultants, National Commerce Bank Services in Memphis.
     The consulting company, a subsidiary of National Commerce Bancorp.,
also in Memphis, surveyed 800 shoppers in 20 states.
     "We've said for years that in-store banking was the wave of the
future. Well, the future has arrived," said Douglas W. Ferris, the
consulting company's president. What's more, he said, the number of
services shoppers want from their supermarket bank branches has increased.
"In the early days of in-store banking, customers used the branches for
withdrawals and deposits," Ferris said. This has clearly changed.
     For example, 40% of the survey's respondents said that sale of mutual
funds in the supermarket branches was important. Only a few banks operating
in-store branches offer investment products but this is likely to change as
the number of in-store branches continues to grow.
     Ferris' group estimates the number of in-store bank branches will grow
by 150% in four years. These branches, the consulting company said, will
play an increasingly import role in bank delivery systems.

ANGLIM JOINS FLAGSHIP AS NATIONAL SALES MANAGER

Phil Anglim has become the national sales manager of Flagship Funds,
effective immediately. Anglim had been a regional sales manager for the
company before this most recent promotion. He will administer the company's
15 regional sales vice presidents.
     This is almost a new position for Flagship, since Richard P. Davis,
the Flagship president, served as national sales manager since the
company's inception in 1984.
     The fund company, located in Dayton, OH, specializes in fixed-income
municipal securities. It has $4.5 billion in assets under management. It
previously had been the money management arm of Mead Corp. before Davis and
the current chairman, Bruce Bedford, led a management buyout.

EBT Ground Rules Elicit Some Boos From The Bleachers


The electronic benefits council agreed to a number of rules in principle at
its December meeting.  The rules are circulating among the council's 38
members and will be released to the public by March.  Recommended rules
include:

* Printing balances on receipts.  Terminal drivers must print a recipient's
account balance on the transaction receipt for approved food stamp purchases,
food stamp refunds and when a food stamp purchase is denied due to
insufficient funds.  Printing a balance is optional for cash benefits at the
point-of-sale.  Terminal drivers aren't required to print balances under
commercial rules.

* Record retention.  Operating rules should reflect commercial standards and
require issuing or acquiring financial institutions to keep transaction
records for at least two years.  Food stamp records must be kept three years
by issuing institutions.

* ATM transactions.  Recipients should be able to download at least $20 and a
maximum of no less than $200 from ATMs.  Most EFT networks currently provide
minimum and maximum withdrawal requirements.

* Technical specifications.  Participating cards must comply with Independent
Sales Organization and American National Standard Institute operating
standards.  Primary account numbers must be displayed on the face of the
cards, and a signature panel or signature image is required.

* Settlement procedures.  Settlement procedures will mirror commercial
standards where settlement takes place on a daily basis.

* Scrip machines (under review).  Scrip machines can be used for dispensing
benefits as long as they're treated as point-of-sale terminals and not ATMs.
With scrip machines, recipients get vouchers that can be redeemed for cash
from a store clerk.

Tom McLaughlin, vice president with Milwaukee-based Deluxe Data, takes issue
with several rules, including the option of printing account balances on
receipts for cash benefits at the point-of-sale.  "If recipients don't have
balances on receipts, we could see more denials and help desk calls," he says.
"Making it optional could run up the cost of EBT."


Kansas And Illinois Announce EBT Deals

The Midwest is the latest hotbed for electronic benefits transfer programs.
Late last year, the Kansas Department of Social Services awarded a seven-year,
$11.6 million EBT contract to Milwaukee-based Deluxe Data Systems.  The
program will begin in Wichita in July, with a statewide rollout to be
completed by July 1997.

In other EBT developments, the Illinois Department of Public Aid has selected
Texas-based Transactive Corp.  to negotiate a five-year EBT contract.  The
program will initially serve 65,000 households and expand to 500,000
households statewide.

Another Internet Company Goes Public


CyberCash Inc.  is going public.  The Reston, Va.-based developer of
encryption software for financial transactions over the Internet filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission late last year for an initial public
offering of two million shares of common stock.  Underwriters will have the
option to purchase an additional 300,000 shares.  The estimated price of the
stock will be $15 to $17 per share.

CyberCash plans to spend the estimated $34 million in proceeds on new product
development and on marketing two new services, Secure Check and Coin Check.
Secure Check will be the equivalent of an electronic certified check, while
Coin Check will encrypt small denomination payments over the Internet.

A New Year's Revolution In ATM Pricing


There's no question how much a can of soup is worth on the free market.  The
price is clearly marked, and if it's too high the grocer will soon know
because his shelves will remain full.

That's not been the case for the price of using an ATM in most areas, as
networks rules have prevented ATM owners from charging the consumer directly
for getting cash.  But the industry appears poised on the brink of a
fundamental shift in the pricing of ATMs as major networks relax their
surcharging bans and allow market forces to determine the price of a service
many consumers have come to view as a necessity.

And early returns from markets that allow surcharging suggest consumers may
value the convenience of ATMs more than many in the industry believed.

The momentum toward surcharging has grown in recent years as 14 states passed
laws that allowed surcharging, overriding the restrictions of both the
Visa/Plus and MasterCard/Cirrus national ATM networks.  While surcharging
spread rapidly in those states, many of them heavily touristed areas in the
South and West, the Plus and Cirrus rules effectively prevented the practice
from spreading to the major population centers of the Northeast, Midwest and
West Coast.

The big breakthrough came last fall when Plus announced it would allow
surcharging at ATMs bearing its logo beginning April 1.  Last month, the
largest of the regional networks that still banned surcharging, Delaware-based
MAC, announced it, too, would allow the practice on April 1.

Industry participants now expect Cirrus and other major regional networks to
fall into line.  "I would imagine it would be a foregone conclusion," says
Charles Raphael, first vice president of electronic banking at First Chicago
NBD.  "In order to hold their members, and obviously the big deployers of
ATMs, I don't think they would have a choice."  A Cirrus spokesperson says,
"It is very likely the Cirrus board will take up this issue at its next
meeting, which probably will be in March."

With Plus and many of the larger regionals allowing surcharging, the holdouts
are left in a position many view as untenable.  If Cirrus were to maintain its
ban, an ATM deployer in California, for instance, could place a machine with
the logos of Star System, which allows surcharging, and Plus, and serve the
big majority of consumers.

Regionals Feel the Heat

And if Cirrus does allow surcharging, the pressure will shift to regional
networks like Virginia-based Most that maintain the ban.  Because a Most
member must put its ATMs into the network, it would not be able to surcharge,
while a competitor that did not belong to the network could surcharge on a
machine bearing the Plus and Cirrus logos and accept most ATM cards.

Rather than put its members at a disadvantage, the Most board will reconsider
its policy at a meeting later this month, says David A.  O'Connor, president
of the network.  "We see the pattern," he says.  "The forces of the
marketplace seem to be driving the industry towards surcharges.  I think
that's a fairly strong movement that we probably won't resist."  Executives at
Michigan-based Magic Line, the seventh-largest network, and Missouri-based
BankMate, the ninth-largest, say they, too, may have to reconsider their
surcharging bans.

New Rules

Some networks whose owners oppose surcharging, such as Chicago-based Cash
Station, may hold the line for a while, says George Albright, president of the
Atlanta-based Speer & Associates consulting firm.  "But, over time, as the
ownership changes as a result of mergers, and banks come in that are
surcharging in other regions, you're not going to just be able to say, 'Our
rules don't allow it.' They'll say, 'Let's change the rules,'" Albright says.

Why are more banks anxious to surcharge now?  Industry participants offer many
explanations, but among the most common is the growing pressure on banks to
generate increased non-interest income.  "People see a lot of untapped
potential in ATMs," says Raphael.  "The hardware and the switching system are
there, so the additional revenue you can produce off that network is almost
pure profit."  Another banker who requested anonymity observes, "For ATM
deployers, this is a Christmas present of enormous potential."

Off-Premise Rivalry

At the same time, non-banking companies, such as Texas-based Electronic Data
Systems, and Affiliated Computer Services, have been moving aggressively into
off-premise locations.  Banks, which enjoy low maintenance costs and no rental
fees when placing ATMs in their own lobbies, have moved more slowly because
they were not certain they could generate enough revenue from off-premise
locations to justify the investment, observes David Baker, director of
marketing at Fujitsu-ICL Systems Inc., an ATM manufacturer.

"But," Baker adds, "they don't want to see all the locations snapped up by
nonbank deployers.  Bigger banks are saying, 'Give us the opportunity to
surcharge, lower the transaction volume needed for profitability, and we're
going to go head-to-head with ACS and EDS.'" As an example of that approach,
Baker points to NationsBank's outbidding EDS and ACS in August for the
contract to place ATMs in 661 Stop-N-Go convenience stores owned by National
Convenience Stores in Texas, a state that allows surcharging.

The successful implementation of surcharging by some major banks also has
influenced their peers, says Albright.  Among large banks, he says, the
pioneer was Bank One of Texas, which began the practice in 1993, and led the
way in raising the typical surcharge in the state from 25 cents to 50 cents.
"They showed they could do it and not get hurt in the marketplace," he says.
"All of a sudden the whole state of Texas was charging and the price went up
to 50 cents."

Many Will Pay

Albright says developments in Texas and other states suggest consumers are
willing to pay more for ATM convenience than they were being charged.  He
points out that at the same time as surcharges were being imposed in Texas,
issuing banks raised the foreign fees they charge their customers who use ATMs
not owned by the bank.  "The typical foreign fee went from 50 cents to $1.25,
and some banks are charging $1.50," Albright says.  With Bank One and other
Texas institutions raising their surcharges to $1 in recent months, many
consumers now are paying more than $2 to use an ATM, counting both foreign
fees and surcharges.  "And exactly the same thing has happened in the state of
Georgia just from March 1995 to the end of the year," says Albright.

Is the price too high?  Apparently not for many consumers, based on network
reports of only temporary declines in transaction volumes.  Network officials
in Alabama reported an initial drop in volume of 8% and in Texas of 15%,
Albright says, "but everyone tells me after six to nine months it comes back."

And that occurs despite the spread of surcharging in most cases to include
many machines on bank premises as well as off.  Network executives say 75% of
ATMs surcharge in Alabama, 60% in Texas and more than half in Utah.

Ultimate Test

Nonetheless, some believe surcharging will spread more slowly in the major
Northern cities.  Lynch says some NYCE members may not surcharge at all in
hopes of pressuring competitors to refrain from the practice.  "There are many
large organizations that have the point of view the revenue isn't worth the
risk to the customer relationship," he says.

Albright and Lynch both warn that consumer advocates and regulators are more
likely to raise objections in the Northeast than elsewhere.  And, Albright
adds, "the New York press will jump on it, whether the rest of the country is
doing it or not."

With all those factors, he says, the Big Apple may be the ultimate test for
surcharging.  "If the same thing happens in New York that has happened in
Georgia and Texas," he says, "then surcharging will have become the norm."

Deluxe Corp.  Sneezes, Deluxe Data Catches Cold


When a company's board of directors holds a special meeting just before
Christmas to implement a major restructuring, subsidiaries can expect big
changes early in the New Year.

And that's what's happened at Milwaukee-based Deluxe Data Systems, whose
president, James E.  McGowan, was relieved of his duties last week and placed
on special assignment, reporting to J.  A.  "Gus" Blanchard, president and CEO
of Deluxe Corp., the Minneapolis-based corporate parent.  John B.  Benton,
chairman and CEO of the Benton International consulting firm which has been
involved in the Deluxe Corp.  restructuring, was named interim CEO, an
assignment he says will last two to three months.

The moves follow Deluxe Corp.'s announcement of the closing of several
check-printing plants and unveiling of a plan for growth that highlighted new
products from Deluxe Data.  "I felt this major expansion required new
leadership to move us to this higher plane," Blanchard said in a statement.

Industry sources say Deluxe Data is at a crossroads, having lost major
processing contracts in recent years at the NYCE and Yankee 24 regional EFT
networks, which took their processing in-house, and facing aggressive
competition from Electronic Data Systems, which now processes for two of the
10 largest regional networks, Cash Station and The Exchange.  They add the
company's major investments in electronic benefits transfer have yet to pay
off.

Deluxe Data also has lagged in offering newer technology, such as home
banking, Internet access and prepaid phone cards.  While Deluxe Data is
expected to unveil a home banking and bill payment product soon, they trail
competitors like EDS, Servantis and FIserv, says Richard Yanak, president of
the New Jersey-based NYCE network.

McGowan, who came to Deluxe Data 28 months ago, after many years at IBM, may
lack the EFT experience needed to chart a new course for the company, says
Donald Mauer, senior vice president of Gensar, a Pennsylvania-based processor.
"What's required here is not just broad management skills," he says.  "You
need someone who can define what this company's going to be."  Adds Yanak,
Benton's interim role "may signal there isn't anyone inside the company that's
likely to get the job."

The Quest Begins For A National EBT Network


In the early days of ATMs, customers could only use their cards in machines
owned by their own bank.  To give the ATMs more value, financial institutions
formed shared EFT networks so that customers could use their cards in machines
owned by other banks, including those in different parts of the country.  The
networks then teamed up with retailers to let customers use their cards to
make purchases at the point-of-sale.

Now a second electronic payment evolution is underway.  But rather than create
more national ATM and POS networks, coalitions are forming for interstate EBT.

State governments involved in electronic benefits transfer programs are
teaming up with other industry participants to let welfare recipients receive
benefits at ATMs and POS terminals across state lines.  While some states have
already rolled out EBT programs, recipients from one state usually can't
receive benefits in other states because the programs don't have common
operating rules.  The National Automated Clearing House Association's
electronic benefits council is trying to change that by developing common
rules.

The electronic benefits council, a multi-industry trade group that includes
state governments, retailers, third-party processors and EFT networks, adopted
a set of standards in principle late last year (see sidebar).  The rules
represent the first major action of the council created in September in
collaboration with the U.S.  Department of Treasury and the Federal EBT Task
Force, a federal agency that oversees EBT implementation.  The council also is
negotiating with the board of directors of the Quest shared EFT network to use
the Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards.

Common Rules

"Rather than have 50 states develop their own systems individually, we're
trying to lay the framework in advance so everyone knows what to expect," says
Helena Sims, senior director of the council.  While states with current EBT
projects can negotiate with EBT contractors in other states to let recipients
receive benefits across state lines, the process is often burdensome and
time-consuming, she says.  And because most EBT contracts have a five-year
limit, the agreements have to be constantly renegotiated with new contractors.

Some industry participants, however, believe the council faces a tough task in
creating national operating rules that all EBT participants can agree on.
"The effort is noble, but it's as unattainable as worldwide peace," says
Stephen Cole, president of the Chicago-based Cash Station EFT network.  "Every
ATM network has different rules depending on state and local laws, and coming
up with one set is very difficult.  They said they're going to have the rules
ready by March, but I'd be surprised if they have them out by December."

Skeptics say rules developed by shared EFT networks and state and federal
governments already do the job.  The contradiction of existing rules is one
area of concern.  If an ATM overdispenses $10, for example, a network and bank
are permitted under network rules to reconcile the transaction without the
consumer's knowledge.  With food stamps, however, it is considered an adverse
action under federal law to debit a recipient's account without notice.

"The council is addressing issues that are covered by network, state and
federal regulations, and we're concerned about duplication and conflict," says
Thomas McLaughlin, vice president of Milwaukee-based Deluxe Data Systems.  "If
there are EBT policies that are contrary, who will arbitrate the disputes?"

James McCarthy, executive vice president with the San Diego-based Star System
EFT network and chairman of the electronic benefits council, says the issue of
account adjustments can be resolved.  "As a network, I operate a lot of
gateways with people who have different rules than me.  They're not
conflicting, just different.  We're working with state and federal personnel,
as well as networks and financial institutions, to come up with procedures."

Advantage To Retailers

Retailers stand to gain from the electronic benefits council's efforts.
"Retailers who participate in EBT programs should benefit from the efforts of
the EBT council," says David Bragin, treasurer of Florida-based Winn Dixie
supermarkets.  "If the states adopt these national operating rules, any EBT
cardholder or authorized retailer will be able to conduct EBT transactions no
matter which government entity issued the benefits or in which state the
retailer operates."  Winn Dixie has approximately 1,175 stores in 14 states.

While each state has the option to follow the operating rules, the eight-state
Southern Alliance of States and seven-state Northeast Coalition are
incorporating the rules into their contracts.  The two programs comprise
nearly 50% of all welfare recipients in the U.S.  The rules must comply with
federal requirements that EBT programs not be more expensive to run than
current paper-based systems, says Dan Berry, program manager with New York
State.  "The bottom line is these systems have to be cost-effective," he says.

Although welfare benefits-such as food stamps and Aid to Families with
Dependent Children-are usually redeemed in the state where the recipient
lives, the U.S.  government also plans to use EBT programs to distribute
benefits to a population that is more likely to travel, such as Social
Security recipients.  "These programs will eventually deliver much more than
just welfare benefits," Berry says.  Additional benefits may include military
and railroad pensions and unemployment insurance.

To let consumers know where they can receive their benefits, the council is
negotiating with the owners of the Kentucky-based Quest shared EFT network to
use the Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards.  The mark would be
displayed on cards, ATM and POS terminals and at merchant locations.  The
Quest network dissolved in July, 1995, after its members migrated to the
Delaware-based MAC regional EFT network.

Buying A Logo

Using an existing logo is cheaper than developing a new logo, Sims says.  "If
you start from scratch, there's a lot of paperwork and forms you must fill out
in developing a logo," she says.  The council hopes to complete the
negotiations by the end of January, she adds.  The logo would be purchased
with funds collected from member dues.  Terms of the deal, including what the
council will pay to use the logo, were not revealed.

In the event the deal does go through, the Quest EBT network would be similar
to the Plus and Cirrus national ATM networks, McCarthy says.  If a recipient
from New York uses his card at a Quest ATM in Florida, for example, the
transaction would be sent to the government-designated issuer in the Southern
Alliance of States who would route the transaction to the Northeast Coalition
for authorization.  The transaction would then be switched by a regional
network or other entity designated by the prime contractor in the Southern
Alliance of States.  Supermarket chains with a presence in both EBT programs
may opt to switch transactions themselves, McCarthy adds.  "We're trying to
allow as much flexibility as possible," he says.

And the state coalitions should bring sizeable volume to regional EFT
networks.  That's particularly true with the Northeast Coalition.  "By
bringing welfare recipients into the EFT networks, we're bringing a huge
volume to the market that was never there before," says William Kilmartin,
Massachusetts comptroller and vice chairman of the electronic benefits
council.  The Northeast coalition, for example, will bring approximately two
million new cardholders into the New Jersey-based NYCE shared EFT network, he
says.  By providing each cardholder with four transactions per month, the
coalition could bring NYCE at least 96 million new transactions each year.
"If [NYCE] is paid per transaction, and we double their volume, it's extremely
significant for them," he says.  The Northeast Coalition plans to announce the
winning bidder later this month.

Some industry participants are concerned the council could impose a licensing
fee on financial institutions and merchants who use the logo.  Elliot McEntee,
NACHA president, says some form of fee may be imposed, but it won't be large
enough to inhibit participation.  "There may be a charge to cover the costs of
distributing the logo, but it's not a money-making venture," he says.

While the electronic benefits council faces a tough task developing rules that
everyone can agree on, most industry participants believe there should be a
national set of operating rules as EBT takes on a national flavor.  "If we
take on a national approach, instead of each state building its own EBT
system, it'll be much easier to bring on additional benefits," Kilmartin says.
"Once we figure out a common ground, it'll be cheaper and better for
everyone."

Visa Aims For Debit Summit From Plus' Denver Base


His first priority after taking the helm of the Plus System, says David A.
Brooks, was to calm fears of wholesale changes at Visa's national ATM network.
But the rest of his to-do list includes plenty of change, including a broader
role for Visa in debit processing and more prominent use of the Visa name at
ATMs.

Much will stay the same, however, says Brooks, 55, who was named acting
president and CEO last month.  He replaces Denny D.  Dumler who resigned to
head up TransAlliance, a new joint venture between Electronic Data Systems and
the owners of the Washington-based Exchange regional ATM network.  The Plus
board is expected to ratify Brooks' appointment later this month.

For one thing, he has assured Plus members, the team running the network will
remain in place.  "They were concerned Visa not do anything that would give
people concern for their futures and disrupt operations by having defections,"
says Brooks.  Nor are there plans to move the network out of Denver, Brooks
says.

Remote Control

Brooks' own home base and responsibilities also change little.  He remains at
Visa headquarters in San Francisco and retains the title of executive vice
president of market development at Visa U.S.A., a job he took two years ago
after holding retail banking and administrative posts at First National Bank
of Chicago, Crocker Bank and Citicorp.

Some observers wonder how effectively Brooks can guide Plus from afar, as well
as about his limited EFT experience.  "He's a very capable man, but he's not
an EFT guy," says one regional network executive.  "And Brooks remaining in
San Francisco doesn't sound like a strong management move for Plus."

Brooks emphasizes the experience of the Plus team resident in Denver, led by
Ron Reed, senior vice president, as well as the benefit of his remaining in
San Francisco.  "My value is integrating Plus into the mainstream of Visa," he
says.  And, he adds, a major focus of Plus will remain a project that is well
underway:  the deployment of a new debit processing platform of Tandem
Himalaya computers and Deluxe Data Systems software that Visa has installed in
Denver at a cost of "multiple millions of dollars."

The new platform will ultimately support all of Visa's debit products,
including Plus, the Interlink point-of-sale network and the Visa check
off-line debit card.  While Plus is not scheduled to move to the new platform
until 1997, the first Visa check customer will go live by February, according
to Reed.

That will put the Visa/Plus data center into competition with third parties
that handle the bulk of processing for Visa check, as well as for MasterCard's
MasterMoney off-line debit card.  And that's just the beginning of the
competition they'll be getting from Visa, as Brooks says the new platform has
the capacity to offer processing services to regional networks, which would
pit Visa against major processors such as Deluxe Data and EDS, as well as some
of the regional networks themselves.

Brooks calls this a step towards greater EFT efficiency.  "As an industry," he
says, "we have to get rid of redundancies in systems and networks.  Our
strategy will be to offer this functionality to our customers at the lowest
possible cost."

Some network executives applaud the effort.  "The financial industry needs to
respond with processing capability that's superior to what nonbanks can
offer," says Richard Lyons, chief operating officer of Virginia-based Most.

Others point out competition is keen in EFT processing.  "How successful
they'll be depends a great deal on what they offer and at what price," says
Richard P.  Yanak, president of New Jersey-based NYCE.  "That's become a very
low-margin business because competition has driven down the price."

While Visa tried unsuccessfully to enter the processing arena in the early
'90s, several observers say they're not surprised by Visa's new foray into EFT
processing or MasterCard's decision last year to acquire the BankMate regional
network and bring in-house processing for its Cirrus national ATM network

"MasterCard and Visa have got a lock on the credit card side of electronic
payments, but not on debit," says a regional network executive.  "If they can
get a lot of transactions running through their computers they'll have a
toehold that would be difficult to pry loose."

While the battle for transaction volume rages behind the scenes, Brooks says
there may be more visible changes in the Plus logo at the ATM.  He says Visa
is "about 75% of the way through a major brand study" that indicates Plus is
increasingly known by its target audience of people who travel, but still has
nowhere near the recognition of Visa.  While he does not anticipate dropping
the Plus logo, he says he could envision a brand name such as "Plus by Visa"
that would emphasize the connection.

A final change Brooks foresees is the completion in November of Visa's
acquisition of Plus, a deal announced in 1993.  The price was not disclosed.

While some insiders have wondered whether Visa, with its credit card emphasis,
would make the final payment, Brooks says the sale will go through.  "We've
got a total debit strategy, and I don't know why we would want to back away
from that," he says.

When It Comes To ATM Deposits, Money Talks


For many consumers, withdrawing cash from an ATM is as commonplace as buying a
pack of gum from a convenience store.  By swiping a debit card and entering a
personal identification number, consumers can access funds and be on their
way.

But while financial institutions have succeeded in getting people to use ATMs
to make withdrawals, convincing them to make deposits is another story.
According to a national survey in late 1994 by Atlanta-based Synergistics
Research Corp., 92% of 613 ATM users made cash withdrawals at ATMs, while only
32% of the consumers used ATMs to make deposits.

Industry insiders point to several factors discouraging consumers from making
ATM deposits, ranging from fears a check will collect dust in the bottom of a
terminal to safety concerns about filling out a deposit envelope at a poorly
lit machine.  Worries that a deposit won't be promptly credited-or credited at
all-also contributes to consumer unease.  The ATM deposit slip does little to
calm those fears, they say.

"Many consumers have a fear of the unknown-depositing checks at ATMs is
something they haven't done," says Anne Morgan Moore, Synergistics Research
Corp.  president.

Financial institutions have used a number of strategies to overcome those
fears, ranging from financial incentives that reward ATM deposits to $3 fees
for each teller transaction.  Other institutions have deployed
advanced-function terminals that lift an image of a deposited check onto the
ATM screen to let consumers know their check isn't falling into a bottomless
pit.

Financial Incentives

Cleveland-based KeyCorp is using both financial incentives and penalties to
encourage ATM deposits.  KeyCorp introduced a checking account late last year
that pays consumers 25 cents for each ATM deposit.  The KeyMoney Access
account pays consumers up to $1 a month, requires no minimum balance and
carries no fees.  Consumers are charged $1.50 for in-branch deposits.  The
account is available in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana and will be rolled out to
all KeyCorp branches by March.

Larry Peterson, KeyCorp senior vice president, says the bank saves
approximately 50 cents on each ATM deposit, excluding the price of the
machines.  Consumers that make four ATM deposits per month are paid a maximum
of $1, netting the bank around $1 in profit.  "This is not a tremendous money
maker," he says.  "We're paying customers to learn about the functionality of
ATMs and get comfortable with the machines."

The KeyMoney Access account isn't the first time KeyCorp has used incentives
to change consumer behavior.  The bank launched three 60-day marketing
campaigns in the fall of 1994 that rewarded a consumer with $5 if three out of
five monthly ATM transactions were deposits.  The bank also enrolled consumers
in a $10,000 sweepstakes for every ATM transaction and gave consumers $10 to
sign up for various direct-deposit accounts.  The promotions took place in
Syracuse, N.Y; Columbus, Ohio; and Seattle, Wash.

Easy To Use

Although Peterson was unable to reveal how many deposits were migrated from
tellers to ATMs, the bank issued eight times more ATM cards during the market
launch in Columbus than the comparable 60 days in 1994, he says.  KeyCorp also
opened eight times more new direct-deposit accounts, he adds.

But while KeyCorp was successful with its campaigns, other banks haven't been
so lucky.  First Chicago ran a two-month promotion in late 1994 where
consumers were given $2 tokens they could redeem by making ATM deposits.
While the bank saw a modest increase in ATM deposits during the promotion,
those deposits gradually subsided during the following four months.  "People
eventually went back to the old way of doing things," says Tom Tremain, First
Chicago vice president.

First Chicago has since introduced a plan in which consumers with accounts
requiring no minimum balance are charged $3 for each teller visit.  Customers
with a $250 minimum balance or more have one free teller visit per week, and
customers with a $250 minimum balance and direct deposit have six free teller
visits per month.

Positive Results

And the results have been impressive.  First Chicago witnessed a 125% increase
in ATM deposits during the first four months after the changes were made.  "We
saw a huge increase in deposits, and a corresponding decrease in teller
transactions," Tremain says.  The bank saw a net loss of customers for a few
months, but now is signing up more new customers than it is losing, he says.

But some banks, including Florida-based Barnett Banks, prefer education and
incentives to penalties.  The bank is considering several strategies at its
Tampa and Ft.  Lauderdale branches over the next few months, including
in-branch demonstrations on how to make ATM deposits and $1 coupons that
customers can redeem by making ATM deposits.

"I don't like First Chicago's and KeyCorp's negative approach-you don't take a
customer and slap them on the hand," says Len Ferman, Barnett Banks' director
of self-service banking.  Such pricing structures can give the impression a
bank is only concerned about its bottom line, he adds.  "No one knows what the
long-term ramifications are for charging customers for things they expect to
be free," he says.

Other institutions have opted for high-technology hardware to encourage ATM
deposits.  InterBold and AT&T Global Information Solutions both offer
check-imaging ATMs that display checks on the ATM screen.  InterBold also
offers an ATM that images a copy of the check onto the ATM receipt to give
consumers an extra layer of comfort.

"The ATMs have eliminated the black-hole syndrome," says Robert Morris, vice
president of electronic banking with Bank of America Arizona, which is
piloting six check-imaging machines in Phoenix.  The terminals have made a
modest impact on increasing ATM deposits, he says.  The machines have one
drawback, however.  Because the ATMs can accept checks without envelopes,
checks that are wrinkled are sometimes rejected.  "In some situations, the
teller will have to cash the check," he says.

Some bankers, however, say check-imaging ATMs are too costly.  The ATMs cost
up to $50,000, well above the $25,000 price tag on standard deposit-accepting
ATMs.  "With the results we've seen [from price incentives], the imaging
technology is way too expensive for the added value you get," Tremain says.

Other bankers believe direct deposit is the way to go.  Joseph Pendleton,
senior vice president with Reading, Pa.-based Meridian Bank, says processing
direct-deposit checks via the automated clearing house is less expensive than
processing deposits through ATMs and tellers.  It costs around two cents to
process direct-deposit checks versus 85 cents for an ATM deposit and $1 for a
branch deposit, Pendleton says.

"People are resistant to making deposits at ATMs, and you can spend a lot of
money trying to change their ways," Pendleton says.  "The returns aren't as
great as spending money to convince people to use direct deposit."

First Fidelity Gets A Charge Out Of Balance Inquiries


While financial institutions are trying to get consumers to make deposits at
ATMs, one bank is focusing on moving balance inquiries to machines.

Beginning Feb.  1, New Jersey-based First Fidelity Bancorp will charge
customers whose deposits fall below minimum balance requirements 75 cents for
balance inquiries from tellers and 50 cents for balance inquiries on a
toll-free number.  Customers receive two free inquiries per month from tellers
and two from the voice response number.  Senior citizen accounts and accounts
with high minimum balances will not be affected.

The aim is to migrate branch inquiries to ATMs and get customers to maintain
larger balances, a First Fidelity spokesman says.  First Fidelity has 715 ATMs
in New Jersey and surrounding states.  The fees are not related to the bank's
merger with First Union Corp.  earlier this year, he adds.

While several banks offer checking accounts that encourage ATM usage by
charging low monthly fees-and for teller transactions-First Fidelity appears
to be a pioneer in imposing fees solely on balance inquiries.  And industry
observers expect other institutions to follow suit.  "There's certainly a
trend in channeling consumers to lower cost services," says Anne Morgan Moore,
president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based banking
consultancy.  "Customers who want face-to-face contact should be willing to
pay more," she says.

Some industry participants, however, are surprised the bank plans to charge
customers for balance inquiries using its voice response system.  Such systems
are usually less expensive than ATMs, they say.  The First Fidelity
spokesperson says a small number of customers were calling the bank up to four
times a day to check balances.  "The fees are focused on a very small number
of people who are making excessive calls," he says.  He predicts less than 10
percent of the bank's 2.5 million customers will be affected by the change.

What's An ATM?  'Just A Vending Machine That Dispenses Cash'


Many expect the spread of surcharging to attract new nonbank ATM deployers.
They may look a lot like Nationwide Money Services.

Based in Calabasas, Calif., Nationwide has 1,100 orders to place ATMs and cash
dispensers that do not accept deposits, including a contract for 400 Pantry
convenience stores in the Southeast.  Robert Peisner, the company's chief
operating officer, says most of those machines will be deployed by June, which
would make it one of the 20 largest ATM owners in the U.S.

That's fast work for a company that was founded in 1993 by card-processing
veterans Peisner and Jack O'Toole and only owned about 20 ATMs a year ago,
when it got an infusion of capital from California-based Cardservice
International, an independent sales organization that processes credit and
debit transactions.  CSI subsequently acquired a controlling interest in
Nationwide.

Surcharging is central to the company's business plan, and its deployments are
concentrated in surcharging states.  Nationwide charges up to $1 for a
withdrawal, Peisner says.

But the real secret to its fast growth, says Peisner, is low
overhead-processing and other services are outsourced-combined with using the
cash-dispensing terminals to generate revenue in as many ways as possible.

"In essence these are just vending machines," he says.  "One of the products
they dispense happens to be cash."  Nationwide machines also offer postage
stamps, prepaid telephone cards and coupons.  The company charges $50 a month
to issue coupons for up to 12 vendors per machine.

Promotion also is key, Peisner says.  As part of the seven-year contract with
Nationwide, merchants agree to place signs announcing the terminals and to
include in their advertising that the store has an ATM that dispenses coupons
as well as cash.  Peisner says consumers walk away with coupons that, if used,
more than repay them for both the surcharge and the foreign fee charged by the
consumer's bank.

And while the company's original five-year plan called for the deployment of
1,500 machines, Peisner says that's been revised to between 5,000 and 7,000 by
the year 2000.

Such high hopes on the part of new ATM deployers may be dashed by the reality
that the best ATM locations are taken and retailers are expecting a larger
share of revenues, says Tommy Rouse, senior vice president of Dallas-based
Affiliated Computer Services, a leading third-party deployer.  "Over the next
year, we expect 50% of the new players installing ATMs will file for
bankruptcy," Rouse says.

EFTA Tries Again To Accelerate Into The Fast Lane


As the EFT industry has matured, competition has grown sharper, profit margins
have grown smaller and the responsibilities of executives have grown heavier.
That makes it harder to lure busy executives away from their desks to
participate in trade associations.

At the same time, the issues have grown more complex, creating a greater need
for trade groups that can help sort them out.  If the agenda is compelling
enough, people will come, as evidenced by the record turnout at last month's
Bank Administration Institute Retail Delivery Conference in Atlanta.

By the admission of its own leadership, the Electronic Funds Transfer
Association hasn't done a good enough job in recent years of convincing EFT
participants that they can't afford to miss an EFTA meeting.  But it's going
to give it another try.

The association has announced its second management shakeup in just over a
year, this one featuring a multi-year agreement with the Benton International
consulting firm, which will provide consultants to help plan meetings and
write reports about them for the association's membership of bankers,
processors, hardware and software vendors and government officials.

Help Wanted

The other major move is the promotion of H.  Kurt Helwig, the association's
director of government relations, to the post of executive director.  He
replaces Wayne Boucher, who resigned in September, less than a year after
taking the post as part of a new management team that included Robert P.
Barone, the retired president of Diebold Inc.  Barone remains at EFTA as
chairman and chief executive officer.

Barone admits to disappointing results in his first year on the job.  "We've
had some success in terms of new membership, but frankly weren't as successful
as I would have liked in terms of increasing the importance of the association
to the industry," he says.  "We couldn't get our hands around good,
content-oriented material, and we weren't following up very well on our
special interest groups and councils and reporting their activities.  We
decided we had to get some people involved who can help us do this."

That's where the Benton firm comes in.  A Benton consultant will be assigned
to each of the EFTA's committees to help chairmen develop strategy, plan
meeting agendas and prepare reports.

Free Advice

John B.  Benton, the CEO of Benton International and a long-time EFTA board
member, says his staff will work for free until the association's revenues
cover budgeted EFTA expenses for the year.  If revenues exceed that budget,
his staff will bill at cost; in future years, he says, any dramatic growth in
revenues would be shared with the Benton firm.  Benton says he does not see
the deal as an income generator as much as an opportunity to revitalize the
association while offering his staff a chance to network with industry
leaders.  "If our people build some new relationships, we'll get out of it
what I want to get," he says.

Helwig says EFTA considered other consulting firms, but "Jack's been on our
board and been very active and that tipped the balance toward Benton
International."  Several EFT insiders applauded the choice.  "Benton's
extremely well-regarded and he's done a lot of high-level work in the EFT
business, so that should help," says Charles Raphael, first vice president of
First Chicago NBD.

Benton's staff will be working with the EFTA's councils and special interest
groups.  There are two councils, which are empowered to take positions without
getting approval of the EFTA board, whose diverse composition makes it
difficult to reach a common stance.  One council focuses on electronic
benefits transfer; the other is a council of regional EFT network executives
formed last year after the Shared Network Executives Association merged with
the EFTA.

Revitalized Board Meetings

The three special interest groups are designed to be educational, and don't
adopt positions.  One focuses on electronic commerce and home banking, another
on point-of-sale and a third on EBT.  The association plans to form a fourth
dealing with regulatory and legislative issues this year, Helwig says.

In addition to upgrading the meetings of these committees, Barone says the
association will change the character of board meetings.  "They've been
basically business meetings, taking up such things as finances," he says.  "We
really need to focus on industry issues and that's what we'll do from this
point forward."  And, in an effort to broaden participation, the size of the
board has been increased from 33 to 50.

The association, which has a membership of nearly 1,300 individuals from 175
companies, also plans a recruitment drive.  As part of that effort, a new
individual category of membership has been created, costing $1,000 a year.
Corporate memberships range from $6,000 to $15,000 annually.

Bankers Wanted

Helwig says there will be an emphasis on increasing participation from
financial institutions, which observers say has been a weakness of the
organization.  In particular, he says, it is hoped the work of Benton and his
staff will help attract more senior bankers.  But Richard Speer, an
Atlanta-based consultant, says that, as a result of bank mergers and the
growth of the EFT business, many high-level managers just don't have the time
for industry meetings.  "It's very difficult right now to get senior bankers
involved in any of these industry forums, it's not just the EFTA," he says.

And it's not just bankers who are busy, says Donald Mauer, senior vice
president of the Pennsylvania-based Gensar processing company, and someone who
has skipped recent EFTA meetings.  Speaking of Benton, Mauer says, "Jack has
to make it more striking and relevant.  I have to believe I'll learn more in
three days at a meeting than I could learn in three months, and that it will
move my business."

Check Fraud: A Problem That Just Won't Go Away


Check fraud is a multi-billion dollar problem destined only to intensify.
Depending on who you talk to, bad checks are siphoning as much as $11 billion
a year from the U.S.  economy.  That's more than the combined yearly totals
for automated teller machine, credit card and wire transfer fraud, according
to industry sources.

Indeed, while the headlines of the business press for years have heralded the
threat of computer hackers accessing and pillaging the bank accounts of
corporate America, a small army of criminals has been amassing wealth by
forging and doctoring corporate America's old standby payment method:  the
check.  Anyone with a few thousand dollars to invest in desktop publishing
software, some scanning equipment and a laser printer, and who has the desire
to commit check fraud can print bogus checks that fool even the most astute
bankers.  (Color copiers are another option, although the bogus checks they
produce typically are not as sophisticated as the desktop variety.)

"The amount of money involved in computer fraud is minimal compared to check
fraud," says Dan McGurl, president, Bottomline Technologies, Inc., a
Portsmouth, NH, company that markets automated disbursement systems to
corporations and banks.  "The ease with which an individual inclined to do
this kind of thing can now rip off corporate checking accounts is astounding."

In a backhanded way, that's good news for McGurl.  His firm is part of an
offensive that has emerged to counter check fraud using a concept known as
positive pay.  A company using positive pay provides its bank each day with an
electronic list of checks issued that day.  The bank then uses the list to
verify the authenticity of checks presented against the company's account.
Bottomline sells software, dubbed Positive PayLink, that lets companies create
these files and transmit the information to banks.  At a cost of about
$10,000, just under 100 companies have purchased the system since its
introduction in mid-1995, according to McGurl.

Tough sell

McGurl sees great promise in Positive PayLink, and in the general trend toward
positive pay services.  "Every check-issuing organization is going to want to
get into positive pay as long as the check system is the way it is today," he
insists.

But it isn't that easy to sell corporations on positive pay.  Most bankers are
doing well if they can convince 10 to 20 percent of their corporate customers
to use positive pay, says Bruce Brett, senior vice president, Signet Bank,
Richmond, VA.  "I guess check fraud just isn't bad enough yet," gripes Brett,
who chairs the American Bankers Association's check fraud task force.

Or, suggests Richard Poje, partner, Treasury Strategies Inc., a Chicago-based
cash management consulting firm, check fraud losses just haven't hit enough
corporate issuers of checks.  "The best time to be selling a positive pay
product is the morning after a fraud has occurred," Poje suggests.

In the meantime, bankers are beginning to shop around for other check fraud
weapons, like online verification services.  Dan Fisher, senior vice
president, Victoria Bank and Trust, Victoria, TX, says a case can be made for
creating an electronic positive file of checks that operates akin to credit
card authorization systems.  "If you can set up a negative file for bad
checks, why can't you set up a positive file of good checks?"  he asks.

Some banks are doing that now through a company known as Primary Payment
Systems Inc., which was founded by Star System Inc., a bank-owned EFT network
based in California.  The company maintains a database of information on
checking accounts at participating financial institutions.  Banks, or check
verification companies, use the information to decide whether checks should be
honored.  As of last fall, the Primary Payment database contained information
on 22 million checking accounts at 20 financial institutions in California and
surrounding states.  Participation is poised to expand, however, as Primary
Payment goes national.  "By the end of 1996, we'll definitely have
participation beyond the western states," says Nikki Waters, Star senior vice
president.

The daily process of uploading account updates and verifying check deposits
against the Primary Payment database takes about five hours for a bank to
complete, start to finish, according to Waters.

Waters says Primary Payment participation makes good sense for banks.  "For
every $1 spent participating in deposit check [the Primary Payment service
that banks use to check on deposited checks], they can realize $9 to $10 in
savings," she relates.  The savings figures, Waters says, are based upon data
provided by some of the larger banks participating in Primary Payment.  These
participants include Bank of America, Wells Fargo Bank and First Interstate
Bank.

Fee opportunity

Bankers and others involved with Primary Payment say it, or similar services,
can help retailers, too, and create new revenue opportunities for banks by
providing a venue for the sale of checking account information to firms that
sell check verification services to the merchant community.  Electronic
Transaction Corp., the Deluxe Corp.  unit that runs the Shared Check
Authorization Network (SCAN), and Telecheck, Houston, have already begun
testing the idea.

Representatives of the merchant community say they like the idea of bolstering
the data available on checking accounts and potential bad checks at the point
of sale.  But they say banks also need to do more to thwart consumers who pass
bad checks at the point of sale.  "These are shared problems," says Judy Cook,
president, Minnesota Retail Merchants Association.  "Trying to identify these
individuals at the outset and not letting them open checking accounts is where
the banks should be focusing their attention."

Cook says the merchant community in Minnesota has been successful in forcing
banks to more closely scrutinize individuals opening checking accounts.  But
the battle against check fraud is far from over, she concedes.

"No matter what you do, it seems the crooks always find another way to get
you," laments Cook.  "Cooperation is the real key."

IBOS Expands Its Ranks


Chase Manhattan Corp.  has tipped the scales of IBOS (Inter-Bank Online
System), the technology-savvy international payments network, toward the U.S.
Chase's recent purchase of a 24.05 percent stake in IBOS ratchets U.S.
ownership to a majority, rounding out the 24.05 percent held by Electronic
Data Systems, Plano, TX, and the 3.8 percent held by Goldman Sachs.  The
founding institutions, Banco Santander of Spain and The Royal Bank of
Scotland, both also own 24.05 percent of the company.

IBOS is an electronic network that links accounts within all participating
banks, allowing end-to-end international payments at both the retail and
wholesale level.  The network was created about four years ago, in
anticipation of increased cross-border transactions with the formation of the
European Community.  Indeed, increased global commerce has caused IBOS'
volumes to "more than double in the last 12 months," according to Thomas Metz,
director of global business development at IBOS and divisional vice president
of EDS in Dallas, although he would not reveal IBOS' exact volumes.

IBOS basically simplifies international banking for commercial and retail
customers.  Commercial customers who use IBOS-participating banks benefit by
not having to go through agent banks in foreign countries in order to get
certain cash management, securities and corporate banking services.  And
individuals benefit by being able to use foreign branches as if they were
branches in their own country.  For example, Chase customers vacationing in
Scotland could stop in at The Royal Bank of Scotland, identify themselves as
customers of an IBOS-participating bank and conduct their banking as if they
were at their home branch in the U.S.

Seal of approval

"Because Chase is the largest correspondent bank in the world and one of the
leading banks in international payments, they bring a tremendous amount of
credibility to IBOS," notes Metz.  "It's kind of like the Good Housekeeping
Seal of Approval.  Chase has indicated that it wants to create other virtual
banking alliances using its correspondent banks and add the IBOS payment
capability to Chase's broad range of corporate cash management products."

The global virtual bank of IBOS is racking up a bevy of new participants,
including Denmark's Unibank; ING Bank and Instituto Bancario San Paolo du
Torino-the largest banks in the Netherlands and Italy, respectively.  Other
non-equity members are Banco Comercio e Industria of Portugal, Credit
Commercial de France and Belgium's Kredietbank and Credit General de Banque.
Other banks are likely to sign on soon.  The EC Investment Services Directive
requires that all member countries' financial institutions and markets be open
to all EC participants.  When that law goes into effect, there could be a
landslide of banks joining IBOS, says Metz.

And, now that the largest U.S.  bank is in on the deal, others will likely
want to keep up with the Joneses.  "We hope other banks in the U.S.  will
follow suit," says Chuck Mallis, global marketing and strategic positioning
executive at Chase in New York City, who also sits on the Board of Directors
of the Society for Worldwide Financial Interbank Telecommunications
(S.W.I.F.T.).  "We do not believe in exclusivity.  Open access networks are
the way to go."

For 30 years, S.W.I.F.T.  has been smoothing out the cross-cultural kinks and
language barriers that would otherwise impede international transactions
amongst its member banks, which now total 3,000.  "There's been a lot of
confusion over what S.W.I.F.T.  and IBOS are," notes Barry Morse, vice
president of marketing at S.W.I.F.T.  in Lahoulpe, Belgium.  "The two services
are very complementary," he explains.  "When two banks send payments to each
other there's a lot of communications required as intermediate steps.  That is
the S.W.I.F.T component-standardized communications using correspondent
banks."

However, S.W.I.F.T.  is closing in on some of the services offered by IBOS.
S.W.I.F.T.  has arranged to offer foreign institutions access to the U.S.
Depository Trust Company's services, which include securities transfers;
kicked off an end-to-end cross-border account payment service called
S.W.I.F.T.Pay, and launched a service called Accord, which performs
cross-border matching and bilateral netting.

If banks want to conduct multilateral international netting, they can use
S.W.I.F.T.  to access the foreign exchange clearing houses that have been
sprouting up this summer.  "We do communications for Eccho [the London Stock
Exchange's foreign exchange clearinghouse]," Morse says.  "We do not have a
relationship with the U.S.'s [foreign exchange clearinghouses] F/XNet and
Multinet.  But we're all trying to solve the same problems in the industry:
the costs and risks associated with cross border payments and foreign
exchange.  Eventually, we will all be doing much of the same things and
potentially working together."

On a similar note, if S.W.I.F.T.  and IBOS were to pool their resources, "it
would open up opportunities in things like imaging and smart card
technologies," says Mallis.  "IBOS ultimately provides a virtual bank network
capability through multiple associations."  IBOS is currently talking with
officials in Russia and other eastern European countries about helping them
set up payment vehicles for their national clearing systems.  The group is
also discussing setting up a Web service, although that is not considered an
immediate concern.  "There is also potential for industries and their banks to
develop information networks on IBOS because of its broad bandwidth
capabilities," says Mallis.

Both IBOS and S.W.I.F.T.  have seen increasing activity.  "With these new
banks coming online, our volume is going to increase significantly," from the
doubling that just occurred over the past year, says Metz of IBOS.  "That is
allowing us to lower our prices to make it more proportionate to S.W.I.F.T.
pricing."

S.W.I.F.T.  volumes, meanwhile, have risen only 17 percent over last year, but
that represents a larger base number.  Notes Morse of S.W.I.F.T., "The value
of payments that go through the network is about [U.S.] $2.5 trillion every
day, half the annual GNP of America."

When Servicing Customers, Every Minute Counts


Cost-justifying a call center is getting easier by the minute, according to
Sprint Business.  By mimicking the pay system of an 800 number service, the
Dallas-based corporation has created a call center solution that offers a
creative way to finance customer service requirements-it's a price-per-minute
call center.

With this call center solution, there are no added costs or unexpected fees,
says Kay Jain, Sprint's manager of customer programs.  The package is designed
to ensure operating costs get offset by new revenue.  Total cost to the
financial institutions are a direct result of the activity in its call center.

Sprint's Call Center Connection includes all the equipment needed to outfit a
call center, from the automated call distributor, to the phones, along with
the network services needed to connect it to customers and prospects.  Sprint
teamed up with suppliers Rockwell Telecommunications, Downers Grove, IL, and
Northern Telecom, Chapel Hill, NC, to make the offering.

Each customized per-minute deal includes turnkey installation, on-going
maintenance and full warranty service, plus specialized training and system
upgrades.  Once installed on the bank's premises, bank management takes over
full control of the center to run its day-to-day operations.  If operations
warrant expansion, banks may add agents, equipment or services as needed.

The price-per-minute cost for the call center service is determined by how the
system is configured, the minimal annual usage commitment and the length of
the contract.  The customer's anticipated call volumes provide the basis for a
minimum annual usage commitment, which equals the minimum number of minutes
that agents will be handling calls in the course of a year.

According to Jain, after the number of minutes-per-year is established and the
customer decides on the equipment, the price can be determined for the
duration of a contract.  "We recommend a two to five year contract but there
is no set limit."

To help make it easier to track automated call distributor performance per
month, Sprint sends out two monthly billing statements, indicating long
distance usage and call center costs separately.

Microsoft Shifts Gears


Bill Gates quickly made amends for calling banks dinosaurs back in 1994,
during his keynote address at Bank Administration Institution's Retail
Delivery Systems conference.  Without skipping a beat, he then launched into a
sales pitch for Microsoft's latest offering to facilitate interactive banking.
This time around, bankers were more impressed than threatened.

"I never said banks are dinosaurs," he clarified during his speech, referring
to a quote that appeared in Newsweek.  "I actually said many banking systems
are dinosaurs."

The original dinosaur comment surfaced before Microsoft signed on about a
dozen banks to offer to their customers Microsoft's personal financial
management software, Money.  To many observers, distributing the powerful
Microsoft brand in such a way obscures and undermines the relationships banks
have with their customers.  Others also fear the set-up allows Microsoft to
somehow skim a small percent of fee revenue off transactions that occur
through Money.

Gates's latest interactive banking appeal, unveiled during his speech, is more
in keeping with the type of relationships banks are accustomed to having with
their vendors.  With high-tech fanfare, including a tongue-in-cheek video that
poked fun at the Internet as a "Web of Wealth," Gates introduced a suite of
tools and technologies for building profitable bank applications on Internet
and e-mail platforms.  "The Internet will be the primary connection between
banks and their customers," predicted Gates.

The December 5 speech actually was a preview to an announcement made two days
later in Seattle of a wide-ranging Microsoft commitment to the Internet.  At
that briefing, Microsoft introduced more than 20 products and tools to create
applications that encompass both Windows technology and the Internet.  "I
think most people are going to be surprised at the depth and breadth of our
commitment to integrate the Internet into our products," said Gates at that
briefing.

Just like old times

In exploiting this new delivery channel, Microsoft will follow a business
model of partnering with others, a practice it has taken since its origins,
when it relied on Intel to provide the microprocessors for its systems, Gates
said.  "Over the next five years, we will partner with more companies than we
have in the last 20.  And Microsoft will continue to do exactly what it does
today, which is write software."

Like any off-the-shelf software package, the new Internet tools are
licensable.  Banks will be able to use them to create what Gates terms
"virtual branches," which will be bank-branded and customizable.

Chief among the new tools will be Internet Studio (code-named Blackbird), an
authoring tool for developing Internet interfaces that incorporate multimedia,
such as sound and video.  Also available will be an Internet Information
Server, based on Windows NT.  These products will be available over the course
of 1996, and will join Microsoft's Internet browser, Explorer.  The
combination will support authentication and also embed secure protocols for
payments over the Internet.

Microsoft also has plans to jazz up e-mail.  New tools will make it possible
to transfer more than just text over e-mail connections.  For example, banks
could transmit formatted statements-complete with logos-via e-mail.  "This
will be a key element of what we provide," noted Gates.

During the presentation, Linda Parker, vice president, US Bancorp, was invited
to demonstrate how the bank built a direct link between e-mail and a loan
approval center it created on its Internet site.  US Bank is an early adopter
of Microsoft Money, as well as the new Internet tools.  The bank is well into
the process of using Microsoft's Internet Studio tools to build a
bank-branded, sales and service delivery channel over the Internet that links
to back-office data.

With Microsoft's new Internet-centric approach, the role of Money changes.
According to Gates, Money will become a "core database" or "file cabinet" that
banks will be able to customize and extend by adding, say, a third-party
retirement planning software package to it.  In the near term, Money will
receive various upgrades, including additional back-end processing options
beyond the current one from Intuit Processing Services, and the ability to
connect users to banks' Internet sites via hot links.

Kudos

For the most part, banks put aside their typical skepticism of Microsoft's
intentions and applauded the company's efforts.  "He [Gates] has done a great
job," says Tom Kitrick, vice president, First Union National Bank.  "He's
added more value to the customer interface, and that's the most important
thing."

Robert Hedges, executive vice president, Shawmut National Corp., brought up
the same two words:  customer interface.  "The future world is going to
revolve around the quality of the customer interface," he says.  "We have to
be in the business of knowing how to create a good one."

Shawmut will soon be folded into Fleet Financial Group, which is a part-owner
of Meca Software, Inc., a Fairfield, CT-based outfit that prides itself on its
bank-focused approach to distributing its Managing Your Money personal
financial software.  Hedges says that although the bank is now a part-owner of
Meca, it would be open to working with Microsoft on other projects.  "But only
on an open-systems basis, and only if we retain the customer interface."

In adopting an approach more amenable to banks, Microsoft has, at the same
time, shifted its position relative to its own competition.  Prior to
Microsoft's announcement of its Internet intentions, Intuit Inc.  and its
Quicken program occupied the same competitive terrain as Microsoft and Money.
Now that Microsoft has broadened its approach, it faces a new set of
competitors, namely Sun Microsystems.

Sun's Java, a tool that adds dynamics-such as multimedia-to Web browsers,
squares off against Microsoft's new Internet Studio.  Introduced in August,
Java allows small applications (called applets) to be transported from servers
over the Internet.  These applets latch on to client computers and liven up,
say with animation, Internet interactions of that client computer.  For
example, a client computer viewing the Web server of a bank that uses such
applets might let users to perform dynamic what-if analyses on loan options,
not just apply for a loan.

How the competition will pan out in this next stage of the interactive world
remains to be seen.  "Everything's changing," notes Kitrick of First Union,
who says he wants to see what happens with Java before he decides about
Internet Studio.  "Nothing is staying the same."

Answering The High-Tech Call


There's no doubt call centers are emerging as a popular way to reduce
operating costs while improving service to customers.  To wit, this technology
entrant placed first out of 12 in BTN's annual survey of the Best Of The
Newest banking technologies (see BTN, December 1995).  Today, the question for
many banks-especially medium- to small-sized ones-is deciding at what point,
if ever, they should move from standard voice response systems to full fledged
state-of-the-art call centers.

Most banks already have some type of voice response system in place to allow
for automated responses to routine customer service inquiries.  These
systems-once known for handling only simple inquiries such as savings or
checking account balances-are now equipped with a variety of increased
capabilities.  Integrated voice response applications can now process
virtually any information exchange including account balances, portfolio
information, bill payment, interest rates and mortgage pre-qualifications.

A fully customized, turnkey voice response solution can start at $30,000, and
quickly increases with advanced programming applications.  But despite all the
enhancements with voice response technology, it still has many limitations
compared to a full-blown call center solution.  Most notably missing is the
human interaction with customers.

Making the move

Advanced call centers employ customer service workstations backed by
computer-telephone integration.  Using computer-telephone integration to make
information that's locked away in computer databases available to telephone
systems is an act that's easier said than done.

The basic hardware for incoming call management is a standard set-up comprised
of private branch exchanges, automated call distributors and voice response
units.  The real feature that differentiates one bank's call center from
another's is in its use of middleware.  The middleware provides the connective
data integration link between a customer service representative's workstation
and an incoming call.

"The key to implementing a state-of-the-art call center is integration," says
Julie Fitzpatrick, product marketing manager at Early, Cloud & Co., Newport,
RI.  "Integrating customer information files allows a customer service
representative to access a wealth of information that assists in a variety of
capabilities and increases cross-selling opportunities."

Middleware is actually the doorway to accessing information, managing call and
data information, routing the information, managing workflow and monitoring
the system.  In addition to basic call management and data management
capabilities, more advanced services such as identifying numbers dialed by
callers, a process known as Designated Number Identification Service, as well
as identifying callers' telephone numbers, known as Automated Number
Identification, are available.

The more integration there is between computer and telephone systems, the
longer the list of services that a bank can offer through the phone.  Beyond
retrieving account balances, customers can authorize funds transfers, open
checking and savings accounts, apply for loans, pay off credit card balances
and the list goes on-directly over the phone.

Sky's the limit

Experts say the absolute minimum investment for a fully integrated call center
is $10,000 per seat, with $20,000 per seat not an unreasonable price for
higher configurations.  Basically, there is no definite price cap on the
investment because of all the different options and equipment available.  In
essence, stepping up from standard voice response to call-center
computer-telephone integration requires a significant investment, but it can
also be one with limitless possibilities.

A number of packaged call center automation software applications are
available.  One such package, scheduled for general release next quarter, is
Early Cloud's Call Flow Client.  The new desktop software environment lets
institutions automate telephone-based customer service operations with
computer-telephone integration, message-based data access and enterprise-wide
business workflow within a distributed client/server environment.

Call Flow Client helps retail banks tackle the project of building
comprehensive, completely integrated call centers, all the way from back-end
systems to customer service desktops, and eliminates the need to build every
call center application from scratch.  With its graphical interface
environment, developers can graphically define workflow processing and
individually design their call center environments.  The software package
offers a number of options ranging from historical transaction information;
new account openings for savings, checking, loans, CDs and IRAs; bill
payments, to an ATM locator feature with scanned map retrieval.

Although the costs associated with a full-blown call center versus a standard
voice response system vary, experts say cost is only one of many issues
relevant to the decision to plunge into call-center technology.  "Ultimately,
the decision is one that should be based on your marketing strategy and what
message your bank is trying to convey," says Lisa Stockburger, vice president
at Vanguard Communications Corp., Morris Plains, NJ.  "You have to determine,
'Do I want to be like the big boys or do I want to maintain my face-to-face
image associated with smaller banks?'"

Meeting challenges

For Bank United of Texas, $12 billion in assets, the decision to create an
advanced call center was strategic-the result of a long string of
acquisitions.  In 1990, Houston-based Bank United acquired six financial
institutions that had retail, mortgage and wholesale banking divisions.
Consolidating the different banks into one entity resulted in multiple
operating systems and a very confused customer base.  In addition, the bank
was further challenged by inadequate marketing of its telephone-based
services.

At the time, Bank United had only two small customer service centers located
in Houston and Dallas.  The centers operated during normal business hours and
offered very limited services.  And since they were scarcely promoted, many
customers were unaware of their existence at all.

The need for an improved customer service system was apparent.  According to
Pat Moretti, assistant vice president, the bank redefined is strategy and its
customer service mission statement to its current definition:  to enhance
value by providing an efficient, cost effective sales and service alternative
for existing and prospective Bank United customers on a national level.

Through its acquisitions, the bank had inherited a Syntellect voice response
system, which it is now considering upgrading, and it purchased an Aspect
switch from Aspect Telecommunications, San Jose, CA, for about $225,000 for
the new call center.  In addition, it is working on cost-justifying future
purchases of a TCS Forecaster Scheduler from TCS Management Group, Inc.,
Nashville, TN, which will run about $38,000, as well as an Alltel Customer
Service Platform Workstation from Alltel Information Services, Inc.  Little
Rock, AR, which will cost around $500,000.

Bank United's technology allows calls to be routed among five units within the
call center, including:  loan-by-phone; customer service; deposit sales;
support functions, and a systems administrator.  The bank is also introducing
a financial markets unit as an alternative service for annuities and
securities customers.  The bank maximizes the capability of its voice response
unit whenever applicable but always has a customer service representative
ready to respond.

Before implementing its full-blown call center, the bank's customer service
centers averaged about 126,000 calls received per month, of which 32,000 were
answered by live representatives.  With the telephone banking center, the
number of calls answered has increased to an average of 210,000 calls per
month with about 47,000 answered by representatives.

The call center also has had success with new-account openings, which were not
possible through the original customer service centers.  The current call
center averages about 400 new-account openings per month.  That rate is on par
with the number of accounts opened monthly at the largest of the 67 branches
Bank United operates throughout Texas, according to Moretti.

"We went from nothing to something," says Moretti, describing the call center,
which grew from eight to 41 employees.  At the same time, "we broadened our
customer base by catering to all types of customers."

For some banks, investing in a call center is tantamount to using technology
as a weapon to remain independent.  "Call centers are a major investment for
smaller banks, but one that is necessary if you wish to remain independent,"
says Pat Mackesey, vice president of telephone banking at Dauphin Deposit
Bank.  "And, it can be easily cost-justified if done correctly."

Mackesey was instrumental in the creation of Dauphin Deposit's telephone
banking center, introduced in November.  The Hanover, PA-based bank, with $5.5
billion in assets, owns and operates Farmers Bank, ValleysBank and Bank of
Pennsylvania, and now handles customer service for all those banks through a
single call center.  Dauphin Deposit's telephone banking center, which
currently employs a staff of 17, is projected to employ 50 people by April.
The bank also plans to offer underwriting services through the call center.

According to Mackesey, performance is the turning point in making a call
center a profit center.  He points out that the center creates a myriad of
opportunities for pro-active cross selling.  "There is a major positive
contribution in covering bank expense in a call center," he says.  "You are
able to take advantage of a customer service situation and turn it into a
sales opportunity."

Local flavor

"We took a basic customer service center and turned it into a multi-faceted
service and sales center with an expanded level of service," he says.  "It has
become an alternate delivery channel opportunity to service customers more
efficiently with more cost-effective means of banking."

With the installation of an Argo Platform system developed by Dallas-based
Argo Data Resource Corp., Dauphin Deposit succeeded in centralizing the call
center function, while still retaining the local flavor of each of the three
banks that comprise the institution.  The telephone number listed for all of
the banks is one centralized number.  When calls are received by the front-end
network, they are recognized and routed to the customer service representative
who will then answer with the appropriate branch name.

Mackesey said that the new call center is viewed as a "superbranch" and is
expected to enhance traditional branch production, not replace it.  Before
implementing the new call center, Dauphin Deposit had only one customer
service unit, which was not able to open any type of account.  The new call
center, which he says is already experiencing "encouraging" responses prior to
any advertising efforts has already proven to be effective in cross-selling
new accounts for the bank.

The right number

Similar telephone banking success was found at Oakland, MD-based First United
National Bank & Trust, $500 million in assets.  Its implementation of a new
call center increased efficiencies while offering cross-selling and outbound
telemarketing opportunities.  The bank's call center, which runs the Customer
Service and Correspondence system (CSCS) from Milwaukee-based Fiserv, handles
all transactions, customer needs and inquiries, and allows the bank to
automatically track calls, trends and sales.  Outbound telemarketing calls are
also documented on the system to record the number of sales produced.

Fiserv's CSCS system, with a starting cost of about $10,000 (and up, depending
upon the number of users and feature applications), provides a complete case
history of calls by automatically time- and date-stamping every comment
entered by customer service representatives.  It tracks the effectiveness of
individuals and departments in responding to customer requests.  The system
also provides online instructions and prompts to help solve problems, aid
cross-selling efforts and ensure consistent responses are communicated on
specific inquiries.

First United's call center, now staffed by four people, is expected to triple
by the end of this year.  Introduced last August, the number of calls actually
serviced increased immediately.  Prior to the new call center, calls were
distributed among various departments, which inevitably led to lost or missed
calls.  With the new call center, all calls are centralized and handled in a
standardized manner, increasing the number of calls serviced.

Robin Murray, customer service manager, adds that the telephone banking center
is viewed as a high growth area for the bank because it lets the bank expand
its customer base without having to expand its brick and mortar.

"The telephone banking center allows our in-branch sales force to do more
prospecting and less service-oriented transactions," says Murray.  "Our long
term strategy places a strong focus on our telephone center because of the
flexibility and convenience it provides combined with the personal touch that
satisfies customers."

Customizing your call center will essentially determine its cost.  According
to Jeanne Michelson, marketing representative at Telcom Technologies, Pomona
CA, the size of a call center is one important criteria in pricing it.  But
other variables weigh just as heavily.  These factors include the expected
value of your incoming calls, the general level of competition your business
faces and the experience level of your call center supervisors and managers.

Start-up and small call centers often opt for a private branch exchange, which
is a basic telephone switching system, because it can be inexpensive and is
usually already in place within the company.  Many of the more popular private
branch exchange systems can be purchased for less than $600 per station or
$1,200 to $2,800, along with an automated call distributor hardware/software
package.

A stand-alone automated call distributor, according to Telcom, typically costs
$2,200 to $3,000 per position, depending on the particular application and
configuration requirements.  Therefore, for a cost effective automated call
distributor, expect to see the following price ranges:  $35,000 to $45,000 for
a 15-agent system; $120,000 to $150,000 for a 50-agent system; $170,000 to
$225,000 for a 75-agent system.

Cost justifying a standalone automated call distributor comes down to a
variety of factors.  By determining caller demand, identifying sales
opportunities, calculating revenue losses (i.e., missed calls) and total
operational cost savings-personnel and telephone service usage-a bank can cost
justify its system on paper.  By adding revenue savings, personnel savings and
phone usage savings, a bank can determine eventual paybank in years by
dividing the total system cost by the total savings.

Solving Chicken-And-Egg Dilemmas In Electronic Bill Pay


Trying to get more consumers and merchants interested in electronic bill
payments is like trying to answer the question, "Which came first, the chicken
or the egg?"

The chicken:  many consumers are balking when asked to sign up for electronic
bill payment services because, to a large extent, associated fees still are
greater than or equal to the cost of mailing checks through the tried and true
U.S.  Postal Service.

The egg:  banks won't be able to drop fees any further until more merchants
are able to receive such bill payments electronically.  The irony of most
banks' electronic bill payment programs is that the bulk of payments made to
merchants are actually in the form of paper checks.  The only thing electronic
about them is that they were initiated electronically by consumers using
screenphones, PCs or telephones.

The vast majority of merchants lack the computer capabilities to handle
electronic payments.  Visa International estimates that nearly 60 percent of
"electronic" bill payments actually are converted to paper before they are
passed to merchants.  Bill Burchfield, CEO of Intuit Services Corp., which
handles bill payments for users of Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money home
banking products, similarly estimates that 70 percent of the payments it makes
to merchants are in paper form.

Yet another egg (or would that be a chicken?):  Merchants as a whole are
unenthusiastic about electronic bill payment services.  Those not able to
accept electronic payments get a raw deal, because they end up receiving from
banks cumbersome lists of names and account numbers, accompanied by a single
check that represents many payors.  Generally known as a check-and-list, the
payment represents an exception item for the biller.

Merchants also are dragging their feet because they don't see enough consumers
using bill payment services.  Larger volumes, among other factors, would make
it worth their while to go electronic.  "Every merchant is interested in
moving to electronic payments, but most need to make [systems] changes to do
that," says Mark Johnson, executive vice president of Columbus, OH-based
Checkfree Corp., a leading electronic bill payment processor.  "We need to get
as much [consumer] volume as possible, so that the merchants see it's
worthwhile" to invest in the necessary systems upgrades.

Here's the good news:  Leading payment processors are aggressively pursuing
various strategies that should make electronic bill payments more palatable to
both billers and consumers.  Visa, for example, is tackling the back-end with
its introduction last month of an end-to-end electronic payment and remittance
system.  The Visa system will let billers easily accept more types of
electronic payments, without having to make large investments in new systems.
The bi-directional system even will make it possible for billers to deliver
bills electronically to consumers who want them.

Checkfree is also making major moves to increase the electronic element of
bill payments.  Checkfree's efforts focus on volume-specifically, boosting the
volume of consumers and small businesses using electronic bill payment
services.  With increased customer volumes, large billers should deem it all
the more worthwhile to invest in automated payment receptors.

Even smaller outfits are getting into the act.  An outsourcing service that
specializes in delivering bills electronically to biller endpoints is getting
a higher profile than ever these days.  Princeton TeleCom Corp., Princeton,
NJ, just signed on to provide $68-billion, Cleveland-based KeyCorp with bill
settlement and disbursement services for KeyCorp's newly introduced home
banking services.

Visa adds missing link

Visa collaborated with Dallas-based Sterling Software, a leading vendor of
electronic commerce and electronic data interchage software, in its attempt to
get more merchants into the electronic arena.  Sterling's financial EDI
product, Vector:Connexion, is a key element of Visa's ability to create a
fully electronic, paperless pathway from consumers, through their banks and on
to billing companies via billers' banks.

Sterling's Vector product has been available independent of Visa for a good
eight years, and is now installed at 41 banks.  To accommodate the increasing
flow of electronic consumer-to-biller payments, Sterling simply built a new
module to its Vector:Connexion product, which adds Visa's EDI format, TC09, to
the list of electronic payments it can make, such as ANSI X.12, 820, BAI
lockbox, flat file or customized formats.  The Vector:Connexion for Visa
module communicates payment information from billers' banks to billers via
direct connections, value-added networks, or the Internet.

"Now the huge Visa network, which so many banks are connected to, can feed
transactions to merchant banks," says M.A.  Hancook, manager, marketing
communications at Sterling.  "Merchant banks know that their paper-based
lockbox operations are going to go electronic someday.  What they're doing is
protecting their lockbox businesses, plus saving a lot of money because
they're not processing paper."

Visa also is striving to fill in yet another missing electronic link of the
electronic bill payment process.  Through Visa Interactive, a company formed
by Visa last year to offer PC- and screenphone-based banking, Visa will
provide electronic bill presentment.  In other words, no more envelopes.
Consumers will be able to receive their bills electronically via Visa's home
banking software.  Merchants will be able to transmit bills in a customized
format, complete with logos and marketing information, and also send returns
and corrections electronically to consumers.

Visa already is working with a number of banks, including Banc One, Barnett
Banks and Chase Manhattan, to take advantage of the commercial relationships
these banks have with billers, and get the electronic remittance product,
dubbed ePay, out in the market.  Financial institutions will do the honor of
distributing the application to their biller customers, giving them the
opportunity to add value-and sales revenue-to biller relationships.

NationsBank, for example, is using ePay to add to the cash management service
it already offers its biller customers.  "The biggest benefit is in the way we
can meet our customers' needs," says Ken Wood, vice president of emerging
technologies, NationsBank.  "Our biller customers are seeing an onslaught of
electronic payments coming [from front-end electronic connections to
customers], and they are fearing more paper payments coming through the back
end.  We expect this service to eliminate the chore of having to go through
the long lists of netted payments."

The $170 billion NationsBank signed up for the entire Visa package, including
Vector:Connexion.  Banks are not required to have Vector:Connexion to run
Visa's ePay; however, the set-up makes for more seamless interactions.  Wood
did not disclose how much the bank paid for the package, but said the price of
ePay is "competitive" with the automated clearinghouse and other back-end
systems.  "We have to be under the ball, ready to catch it for our clients,"
Wood says.  "By joining Visa, we're covering more of the outfield.  There are
other parts of the outfield, like ACH or [MasterCard's] Remittance Processing
Service, with whom we'll retain our relationships."

Bills, bills, bills

Checkfree is hoping to sweet talk more merchants into electronic commerce by
focusing on increasing volumes.  In one effort, Checkfree, like Visa, is
striving to electronically present bills to consumers.  In this respect, the
bill payment processor is potentially one step ahead of Visa, since it already
is involved in piloting electronic bill delivery to 500 consumers across the
country.  Participating billers include various telephone and utility
companies.  All of the participating billers are already equipped to receive
electronic payments from Checkfree.  Eventually, Checkfree will diversify its
trial to include credit card, insurance, newspaper and cellular phone
companies.  The goal is a controlled test of some 2,800 households, a fraction
of the customer bases of the participating companies.  When the service goes
live in the third quarter, it could extend to the companies' millions of
customers.

Checkfree sees electronic bill presentment as an important first ingredient
for more electronic bill payments.  "A lot of consumers aren't interested in
paying bills electronically until they can receive them electronically," says
Bill Kitchen, director of product development at Checkfree.  And for
merchants, electronic bill presentment cuts costs, and is more accurate and
timely.

Once the service goes full tilt, Kitchen expects the rest of Checkfree's
electronic merchants will want to get in on the action.  While the service is
de gratis during the trial, Checkfree might impose a per item charge to
merchants when it goes live.

Checkfree is just as busily mounting other efforts to build up the volume of
users of electronic bill pay services.  Recently, it teamed up with Automatic
Data Processing, Inc., Roseland, NJ, to launch a joint marketing program that
will target to small businesses PC banking and bill payment, payroll
processing, direct deposit and other services.  With only one percent of the
12 billion checks cut every year by U.S.  corporations processed
electronically, the potential to spur new waves of electronic bill payments is
huge.  "Small business owners use personal financial management packages at
home, and they want them for their businesses," notes Pete Kight, president
and CEO of Checkfree.  "It's almost criminal that we haven't delivered such
solutions to small businesses."

All in one

The emergence of companies like Princeton TeleCom is yet another hopeful
signal that electronic bill payment volumes are well on their way.  The
privately held company was founded in 1983 by a group of Princeton University
professors.  Originally organized to introduce a PC banking product, the firm
changed its direction in 1987 to focus on bill payments only.

The company specializes in addressing the needs of billers that receive
electronic bill payments.  A number of banks, the latest being KeyCorp, hire
Princeton TeleCom as an outsourcing service for settling and disbursing
electronic bill payments to billers.

"Princeton TeleCom is the only outsource that specifically concentrates on
electronic delivery to the biller endpoints," says Paul Ayres, Key Corp's vice
president for consumer electronic payments.  "We were searching for a partner
who fully understood the need for timely and accurate postings," to biller
remittance centers.

Princton TeleCom accomplishes this task through its flagship els Electronic
Lockbox Service.  With full electronic links to more than 450 billers,
Princeton TeleCom captures the overwhelming majority of payment items banks
now mail out to biller endpoints in the form of nettlesome "check-and-list"
disbursements.

At a set time each day, a file of all the day's transactions is sent into
Princeton TeleCom's main system.  "We go through that file and edit it based
on each biller's specifications about which account numbers are acceptable.
Once files have been cleaned, we sort them into files for each payee.  At that
point, each file is reformatted according to each payee's file specs," says
Martha Davis, marketing manager of Princeton TeleCom.  This process "gives
banks the ability to do customer service, to show their customers that they
are on the ball."

If a payee is not equipped to receive electronic payments, Princeton's Remote
Disbursement Facility prints out individual checks for each consumer payment,
rather than sending out net payments accompanied with a list of payers.  Net
payments "are very labor intensive.  If one of the payments on a bulk list is
wrong, they'll hold the whole list.  It's one payment per check with us.  This
way the quality of the check meets or exceeds the standards of the remittance
stub," says Davis.

The company encourages merchants to go electronic once payments reach a
critical mass, she notes.  Otherwise, the vendor can meet some non-electronic
merchants halfway if they have MICR scanners in their remittance centers.  In
that case, Princeton TeleCom can send payments to a scanning workstation at
the remittance center.  From there, payments are uploaded to accounts
receivable systems, processed and posted.  This is also the option for
electronic merchants not comfortable with the idea of an outsider sending
items directly into their accounts receivable systems, the method Princeton
TeleCom uses for merchants so equipped.

The whole electronic process takes place in a maximum of 48 hours:  two hours
for editing and sorting, and then it's just a matter of catching the billers'
15-minute "payment acceptance window."

Princeton's 2,000 bill payment originators include KeyCorp, Bank of America,
Wells Fargo, Boatmen's Bancshares, Fleet Financial Group, CoreStates, Premier
Bancorp Inc., Washington Mutual, Barnett Banks Inc.  and Union Bank.
Princeton charges billers 10 cents per transaction, while originators, such as
banks, pay 15 cents or less per transaction, based on volume.

The more that ideas to increase electronic bill payments get hatched, the more
that chicken-and-egg problems associated with the task will get smashed.

Electronic Money:  A Legislative Can Of Worms


A vast, unregulated terrain looms ahead as new payment methods-from smart
cards to stored-value cards to electronic cash-hit the marketplace.
Unfortunately, the current laws that monitor these fledgling products are not
new themselves.  Minute amendments aside, the most recent round of electronic
funds transfer rules were written at least ten years ago.  Today, new payment
technologies are stirring up a whole new set of regulatory dilemmas to be
dealt with, not to mention potential fraud pitfalls.

Industry experts and regulators are examining whether existing rules fit the
new environment, whether amendments must be written or altogether new
regulations drafted, and even more fundamentally, which entities have the
jurisdiction to regulate each of the new payment vehicles and write the laws
in the first place.

Fast action needed

Government higher-ups concede that swift action is necessary.  Recently,
Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Alan Blinder told the House Subcommittee on
Domestic and International Monetary Policy, "Clarifying the legal and
regulatory structure that will govern electronic money products is one area
that may need prompt attention from both policymakers and the industry.  In
this case, failure of the government to act may, ironically, impede rather
than facilitate private-sector developments."

In the mind of at least one banker, one aspect of the coming regulatory
playing field is clear.  "Regulation should take place at the national level,"
says Robert Egan, vice president in Chemical Bank's legal department and a key
player in the Financial Services Technology Consortium, a national squadron of
banks, technology firms, consultants and universities working on various
technology projects.  "If you have to deal with local state laws on cards, it
becomes impossible to market a product that can go across state lines."  That
dynamic is especially important for Internet transactions, where buyer,
seller, bank, issuer and online server could all be in different states or
countries.

Egan raises another issue.  Cards jointly issued by groups of companies and
that carry multiple functions "result in an overlap of regulators."  Should
stored-value calling cards, for example, be regulated by the Federal Reserve
or the Federal Communications Commission?  "There needs to be some effort to
coordinate [who governs what]."

Few wheels in motion

So far, the only concrete action taken in this rocky regulatory arena is a
Senate proposal in October to exempt smart cards from Regulation E of the
Electronic Funds Transfer Act.  Led by Senators Robert Bennet (R., Utah) and
Richard Shelby (R., Alabama), the exemption would free card issuers from
having to replace funds on lost or stolen cards and from having to print
receipts for transactions, as stipulated by Reg E.

"With the new technologies, paper receipt generation is not always feasible,"
says Mike Shade, vice president of smart cards at VeriFone, Redwood City, CA.
The company is a key player in the SmartCash venture, a group of 11 banks and
various card technology providers creating the first stored-value card
business that will extend nationwide.  "Electronic receipts may be possible,
but certainly not in the form Reg E asks for.  One of the niches smart cards
are supposed to fill is the vending machine, and purchases of that nature.  It
would be difficult to generate receipts [for purchases of such small amounts]
in a manner that complies with Reg E."

One alternative to producing paper receipts for small-dollar, stored-value
transactions is to generate receipts only when loading value onto a card.
Ending the paper trail at that point would avoid the burdensome expense of
constantly generating paper for small-value purchases.

What about lost or stolen funds on smart cards?  "If I were to go to my bank
and withdraw $100 in $20 bills and then lose one of the bills, I can't go back
to the bank for a refund," notes Paul Seader, an attorney affiliated with the
law firm of Hughes, Hubbard & Reed, and who advises the electronic-cash vendor
DigiCash in New York City.  "But what's the status of an electronic cash
withdrawal in this regard, either via a smart card or the Internet?  These
issues need to be addressed in the contractual arrangements that underlie the
issuance of smart cards or electronic cash."

You say tomato, I say tomahtoe

Much of the regulatory discourse revolves around whether the new technologies
will be seen as resembling their physical world look-alikes, or as entirely
different from their predecessors.  Do Internet credit-card payments, for
example, fit into the current mold of rules for card transactions over the
phone and in retail outlets?  "I think regulators are beginning to change
their approach, to form new categories instead of forcing new technologies
into old categories," says Magdalena Yesil, director of marketing at Reston,
VA-based CyberCash, which is already shooting out encrypted credit-card
payments on the Internet.  "The Internet itself is going to be a whole new
category."

One innovation that appears to diverge sharply from its real-world counterpart
is ecash, Amsterdam-based DigiCash's Internet currency, which made its U.S.
debut on the Internet in October (see December BTN).

Dan Schutzer, vice president and director of advanced technology at Citibank
and director of the Financial Services Technology Consortium, throws out some
interesting questions:  "Will banks exchange ecash for currency, or will it be
the equivalent of currency?  If not, the value of ecash could fluctuate
relative to other companies' electronic money, to the dollar itself and to
other currencies."  And then Wall Streeters would start placing bets on ecash
exchange rates!

An oft-cited concern about ecash is whether a consumer has recourse if a hard
drive crashes, the ecash disappears, and it just so happens the owner did not
make a backup copy on disk.  Would Digicash or the issuing bank be held liable
to replace the ecash, or is the consumer out of luck?  In this case, if ecash
is equated with regular cash, the consumer is out of luck.  But if an
amendment declares ecash to be electronic funds, reimbursement would be in
order.

Digicash currently doesn't have a policy providing for reimbursement, although
it's working on one.  On its Web site (http://www.digicash.com), Digicash
provides this nebulous assurance:  "In case your computer were ever to break
down, if you had written down the secret random seed number you chose
initially when opening your account, future versions would let you use it to
recreate the coins and thereby obtain a free re-issue of the signed coins that
were lost."  St.  Louis-based Mark Twain Bank, the first U.S.  insitution to
issue ecash, notes on its Web site that losing ecash is like losing cash out
of a real-world wallet.  The bank advises consumers to only stash as much
money in the hard drive as one would in the wallet.

Square peg in a round hole?

Unspent funds on smart cards are the subject of numerous regulatory questions.
The funds could be subject to Federal Reserve requirements that 10 percent of
the floating amount be maintained in a non-interest bearing account against
the unspent funds, says Bob Ballen, partner at the law firm of Schwartz &
Ballen in Washington D.C.

For banks involved in smart-card initiatives, such a ruling "would certainly
have an impact on the earning power of those dollars," says W.  Doug King,
executive vice president of consumer credit services at Wachovia Corp., which
is participating in both the Visa stored-value pilot and the SmartCash pilot.
"But we have been faced with Reserve requirements on deposits forever."

In addition, floating funds on smart cards could affect the Fed's ability to
monitor monetary supply by distorting the perception of the amount in
circulation.  This could spur a call for disclosure regulation in the future.
"Having to disclose [floating funds on smart cards] would hinder our desire to
go into smart cards," King says.  In his view, however, disclosure is
unnecessary.  The Visa system, for example "is fully auditable," he says.
"All transactions are routed through a single settlement unit."

Unspent funds on stored-value cards could also fit into current laws governing
escheatment, or abandoned property, although these vary from state to state.
William Keenan, senior vice president of marketing and business development at
NatWest Bank in Delaware and chair of the legal and public policy subcommittee
of the Smart Card Forum, suggests that cards be confiscated if their value is
not used up after two years.  "But who would regulate that?"  Keenan asks.
"The Fed would argue that it should be the one.  Stolen cards, on the other
hand, can be deactivated through card readers."

The Mondex mystique

Once the industry settles all the regulatory issues related to unspent funds
on stored-value cards, it still will have to grapple with Mondex.  This
stored-value card, the brainchild of London-based National Westminster Bank,
is currently being piloted in Swindon, U.K.  If all goes well, the cards will
hit the U.S., Canada and Hong Kong next year.

Mondex cards work just like cash.  Card owners-be they two friends or a
customer and merchant-can transfer funds to one another without going through
a middleman.  Because Mondex does not have a central settlement mechanism,
many argue that it would be difficult to track how much money is changing
hands.

But Mondex's chief executive officer, Tim Jones, asserts, "Point-of-sale
terminals can remember everything they do, making Mondex more auditable than
cash.  It's not a fully accountable system [like some stored-value programs],
but still more so than [cash].  We are in discussions with U.S.  regulators.
They are doing a good job so far."

However, unspent Mondex funds may pose other problems.  "Somewhere, Mondex
dollars, either in a reserve amount or actual dollars representing it, is on
deposit and a bank is making lots of money on the float.  From the Federal
Reserve's standpoint, how do you keep an eye on the currency flow?"  asks
Henry Polmer, a partner at Bell, Boyd & Lloyd in Washington D.C., and legal
counsel to Electronic Funds Transfer Association.

Auditability is a key component of levying taxes, as well as curbing criminal
activity.  "Taxation is not at all difficult with stored-value transactions at
the point of sale," says Bernard David, director of marketing and planning for
the Smart Card Enterprise at DE-based Electronic Payment Services, a
participant in the Smart Cash enterprise.  "But with the anonymity of
transactions on the Internet, will taxable transactions be able to be traced,
as well as enforced by taxing authorities?"

A price for privacy

At the same time that banks face auditability issues with electronic money,
they also must deal with requirements of protecting customer information under
the Bank Secrecy Act.  The Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to
report cash transactions of more than $10,000, as well as "suspicious
transactions," to federal law enforcement agencies.  "The cost of auditability
is a loss of privacy," notes William Binzel, vice president of government
relations at MasterCard in Washington D.C.  "Conversely, the cost of
protecting privacy is not being able to catch people who are doing laundering
or other illegal activities."

When larger chunks of money start changing hands on the Internet, rules and
systems may have to be set up to act as financial police.  For example,
digital signatures and other technologies could authenticate the parties to a
transaction.  Currently, Internet transactions veer toward the $10 to $100
range, which makes money laundering over the Internet as yet inconvenient.

That doesn't mean money-laundering Internet schemes and other crimes won't
crop up.  Stanley Morris, director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network
(FinCEN) of the Treasury, described the maladies that could plague the
Internet, in a recent hearing of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and
International Monetary Policy:

"Suppose my Internet user is a narcotics trafficker.  Consider the invoices
the trafficker might pay, the supplies he might order and the transactions he
might accomplish if, for instance, he could download an unlimited amount of
cash from a smart card to a computer, and then transmit those funds to other
smart cards in locations around the world-all anonymously, all without an
audit trail, and all without the need to resort to a traditional financial
insitution."

A scary proposition, indeed.  But unlike the woeful circumstances that
ultimately resulted in the formation of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and other regulatory agencies, industry experts say a Depression-like crisis
will not be a necessary impetus to establish electronic-money laws.  Says Egan
of Chemical Bank, "You hope the regulators will be sufficiently on top of
things so that when something [bad] happens they can have the tools to deal
with it."

Find The Bank:


Wachovia Bank recently unveiled the handsome design of the stored-value Visa
cards it will issue during the 1996 Atlanta Olympic games.  Most prominent is
the athelete at the top of the card, in dramatic motion.  Next, one notices
the Atlanta skyline.  Emblazoned at the bottom of the card is the Visa Cash
logo and the chip emblem.  Want to know which bank issued this bank card?
You'll have to turn the card over to find, finally, Wachovia's name at the
bottom.

A Card By Any Other Name...


It's all in the cards, or is it the name?  Major players in the bank-card
arena are realizing that the skillful naming of new card products has a hand
in their success.  The barrage of new bank-card options-from stored-value
cards, to debit cards, to multi-function smart cards-is increasing the
importance of effective naming.

Hence, Visa U.S.A.  has officially adopted the name "Visa Cash" for its
stored-value cards issued in the U.S., which are currently serving as cash
substitutes for purchases under $10.  The Visa Cash name and logo were
introduced last November in Atlanta, prior to its usage at this year's Summer
Olympic Games.  The prepaid bank cards operate with embedded computer chips
that store money as electronic data.

Visa's competitors have also opted for simplicity in naming their stored-value
cards.  MasterCard International has chosen "MastercardCash," while SmartCash,
the stored value card venture spearheaded by Electronic Payment Services Inc.,
will offer SmartCash cards.

While the naming of these "cash" cards is straightforward, consumers still
have to be sure not to confuse them with MasterMoney or VisaCheck cards.
Known by bankers as debit cards-since transaction amounts are automatically
withdrawn from accounts rather than prepaid-both companies nixed using "debit"
to describe such cards, due to its negative connotation with consumers.
MasterCard surveyed more than 5,000 customers before deciding on the
MasterMoney moniker for debit cards, further proof that the name can say it
all.

The Changing Physics Of Checking


Quiz those individuals with a stake in the business on their attitudes toward
checking and you're apt to receive a nearly universal response:  Checking is a
business undergoing colossal change.

"It's the new physics of banking," observes Dan Fisher, senior vice president
and cashier, Victoria Bank and Trust, Victoria, TX.  Industry consolidation is
the leading cause of change for the checking business today.  Fisher must
understand this fact first hand:  Victoria Bank, a $2 billion-asset bank,
situated in southeast Texas, about midway between Houston and Corpus Christi,
will soon become part of the Norwest Corp.  family of banks.  Norwest, a
multi-bank holding company headquartered in Minneapolis, tendered a bid for
Victoria Bank in November; the acquisition is expected to be finalized early
this year.

What is to become of Fisher's check processing shop once the acquisition by
Norwest is completed epitomizes the $64,000 question confronting bankers of
every ilk involved in the current consolidation frenzy.  No matter how
efficient a bank's check operation, experts note, it's difficult for an
acquiring bank to justify redundant check processing facilities because they
detract too much from the economies bank consolidations offer.  It's only a
matter of time before merged banks begin consolidating check shops.  "With all
of the merger activity we saw in 1995, we can expect to see consolidation of
greater check volumes into single check shops in 1996," predicts Stanley (Ned)
Miltko, senior vice president, Littlewood, Shain and Co., Exton, PA.

Miltko speculates that, at merging institutions, consolidation will throttle
the processes that support widescale implementation of new technologies, like
electronic check presentment (ECP) and image check processing.  "Technology
initiatives are going to have to wait to some degree for the consolidation
process to shake out," he says.

ECP, the equalizer

Clearly, there is a case to be made for ECP.  In the vernacular of many bank
operations executives, ECP is the great equalizer.  "ECP puts everyone on an
equal footing," explains Fisher.  "Distances don't matter anymore when you're
clearing checks electronically."  Nor does size; a small bank can present
checks with the same ease as its big bank competitor, provided each bank in
the exchange process is ECP-compatible.  "It levels the playing field," says
Fisher.

But there are many issues that must be resolved before ECP can begin to
fulfill its promise of widescale improvements in the efficiency of the check
clearing process.  For example, notes Miltko, in moving away from paper
presentment to a check clearing system that relies more on the exchange of
electronic files, banks will need to develop techniques for the integration of
back office systems, like accounting and statement rendering, with this new
check clearing model.  "It's not as simple as installing ECP receive software;
it's a whole reengineering of the back office that's required," says Miltko.
"That's really a tall order."

Today, ECP is almost always the electronic transmission of check payment
information in advance of the physical exchange of checks.  The idea is to get
a jump start on the processing of paper in hopes of identifying early in the
processing cycle items to be returned.  Clearly, if the paper check never had
to move-if it were truncated at the point of purchase or the bank of first
deposit-the hassles of reconciling paper and electronic presentments would
disappear.

Truncation woes

But check truncation brings with it an assortment of other problems.  Many of
the legal assurances that make the check a preferred method of payment in
America today simply don't translate into the world of the electronic check.
Banks need timely access to truncated checks, or at least to the images of
those items, to mitigate risks such as return item risk.

And then there is the matter of storage-where do banks stow all the checks, or
images of checks, that are truncated and converted to electronic items?  These
important questions must be answered before electronic check processes can
displace a significant share of paper check exchanges.

The Federal Reserve organized a panel of bankers and Fed officials late last
year in an effort to try and address these and related issues.  But before the
Fed's Advisory Group on ECP can begin to make headway, members will need to
agree upon a "common vision" for ECP, notes Paul Connolly, first vice
president, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and director of retail payment
products for the Federal Reserve Bank System.  "I think all of us would
benefit from developing a common vision for ECP:  ideally, a vision of
paperless collection of checks, and certainly of reduced reliance on paper; a
vision in which checks could be written by businesses and consumers, and then
collected electronically instead of by processing and delivering the paper
checks themselves," Connolly said in a speech to bankers last fall.

Not everyone is optimistic about ECP and truncation, however, even with the
Fed leading the charge.  One of the real sticking points, says Richard Ercole,
Huntington Treasury Management Co., Columbus, OH, is how you support
truncation at the point of sale.  The model most industry executives point to
relies upon the automated clearing house (ACH) to clear the electronic items
created from truncated checks.  And the National Automated Clearing House
Association (NACHA) has gone so far as to create a multi-industry panel, the
Electronic Check Council, to promote this approach to truncation.

But Ercole, who participates on the NACHA panel, says there are many legal and
regulatory issues that get in the way of truncation.  For example, once a
check is converted to an ACH debit, in today's world at least, it becomes
subject to Regulation E, the Fed's consumer electronic funds transfer
regulation.  Reg E, among other things, provides consumers with a 60-day
opportunity to rescind contested EFT transactions.

There also have been questions raised about whether or not consumers should be
required to authorize the truncation of checks tendered at the point of sale.
An initial test plan for POS truncation, involving only return checks, already
has been placed on the back burner because of questions such as these, Ercole
notes.  Any widespread implementation of check truncation at the point of sale
is probably a long way off, he suggests.

Trading in efficiency?

"Quite frankly, I'm not sure we can truncate checks at the point of receipt
without making the payment system less efficient," says Ercole.  "I think
either legislation or regulations are going to have to be changed, at least as
far as forward presentment is concerned."

Another contentious issue raised by truncation is storage.  Truncation of
lockbox items illustrates the situation aptly.  As image technology makes
inroads in lockbox operations, experts say the case for truncating checks
collected through lockboxes becomes even more compelling.  "What do you need
the check copy for if you can have the image of the check?"  asks Richard
Poje, a partner at Treasury Strategies Inc., a Chicago cash management
consulting firm.  But, then, who is to retain the images of those checks for
those situations when a payor or payee needs a copy of an item?

"The absence of an accessible, economic archive is a major impediment to
truncation on a broad-scale basis," says Poje.  To overcome this impediment,
Poje suggests bankers turn to the Fed.  "I think the Fed is the natural
provider" of check image archive services.  "They are the honest broker in the
business; the one party everybody trusts."

But how will the Fed get the images?  Today, only about one-third of the
estimated 63 billion checks written that are tendered for payment each year
clear though the Fed.  "The concept of a repository needs to be developed
around the whole clearing structure," says Jay Simmons, vice president,
Citibank.  "The Fed should be doing it for the items that clear through them."
But to forward to the Fed for storage those check images that are not cleared
through the Fed, would diminish many of the economies promised by truncation,
Simmons suggests.

The more appropriate role for the Fed in the evolution of electronic check
processes, Simmons says, is in rule writing.  As a regulator, the Fed can
implement rules that provide the assurances banks need to overcome the
shortcomings of ECP and truncation.  "I think that's their role in life," he
says.

Putting imaging in its place

And, what about imaging?  After years of promise, imaging has yet to make
major inroads into the labor-intensive proof-of-deposit function.  But imaging
is gaining favor for specialized applications, such as lockbox and return item
processing.  "To me, an imaging system focused on returns makes a great deal
of sense," says Simmons.  "It takes a lot of the risk out of the process."

During the course of a typical month, Simmons notes, a major cash management
bank might return between 4,000 and 5,000 checks that have been presented
against controlled disbursement accounts.  Sending those checks back through
the paper return cycle can take upwards of five days; transmitting images of
the items is a far quicker alternative.

One potential obstacle, Simmons concedes, is the current lack of imaging
standards.  Differences in the way the two major brands of check imaging
equipment-Unisys Corp.  and IBM Corp.-convert paper checks to electronic
images makes broad-scale image interchange an iffy proposition.

At least two groups-the New York Clearing House (NYCH) and the Financial
Services Technology Consortium (FSTC)-are working on projects to perfect the
use of images to support the check return process and check image interchange,
Simmons notes.  (Citibank is a member of both groups.)  If the FSTC and NYCH
projects prove successful, imaging could help the private sector chip away at
the Fed's return item processing business.

Today, the vast majority of check returns are routed through the Fed.  It's
largely a matter of convenience, explains Huntington's Ercole.  The Fed's
prices are such that it is often cheaper to send the Fed a mixed cashletter
than it is for a bank to sort the items itself.  Imaging, Ercole suggests,
makes it worthwhile for a third party, like a clearing house, to fine sort and
capture the images of checks for its members (or clients), thereby enabling it
to compete head-to-head with the Fed.

Online access to check images, he believes, could expedite the return process
by at least a day.  Ercole's parent bank, Huntington, is a founding member of
the National Clearing House Association (NCHA), which competes with the Fed
for nationwide check clearing business.  It's all in keeping with what bankers
like Victoria Bank's Fisher like to refer to as the "changing physics" of
banking, where the evolution of check products and services draws upon the
unlimited power of electronics rather than the physical limitations of paper.
"We have a system that is designed to deal with exceptions," explains Fisher.
"So why not create an image-based infrastructure for return items?"

The conversion of other paper-based check processes to electronics, suggest
Fisher and others, will just follow naturally.

INTERACTIVE BEAT


Will New Service Send Customers Out The Door?  Whether the newest feature to
be added to the interactive banking package from Online Resources &
Communications, Inc., McLean, VA, will be a boom or bust to banks is entirely
debatable.

Online's Interbank Transfer Service gives consumers an easy way to shop around
for the most competitive banking rates and electronically transfer money into
banks that offer the most attractive options.  At the same time, however,
consumers also have the ability to take money out of their banks more quickly
and easily than ever.  Whether a bank is on the winning or losing end of that
equation will determine just how much value they find in Online's new
offering.

"It seems absurd that banks would want to offer this service," says David
Stewart, consultant at Global Concepts, Inc., Atlanta.  "Obviously, it is
potentially damaging for banks that are looking to maintain and strengthen a
relationship with the customer."  In essence, banks are encouraging a "shop
around" attitude, Stewart says.  The only benefit may be if banks believe it
advantageous to offer as many options as possible, even at the risk of losing
business, he adds.

To use the interbank transfer feature, a consumer need only sign up (at no
added cost) for the service through an Online Resources client financial
institution that is marketing the feature.  Consumers can then access funds in
virtually any U.S.  institution from their home- or office-based PCs or
screenphones.  Three banks that are currently using the service include
Nationsbank, Comstar Federal Credit Union, Gaithersburg, MD, and Richmond,
CA-based Mechanics Bank.

"I'm not sure there's any way to ensure that funds won't leave your bank,"
says Alex Hart, vice president of customer access at NationsBank.  "But, the
best way to keep funds in your bank is to offer customers the services they
want."  As a service provider, Hart concludes that a bank needs to be focused
on offering the type of functionality and services desired by customers.  "You
should not be so proprietary to deny customers the conveniences they want
purely for defensive reasons," he says.

Online Resources contends that its new service feature is as beneficial for
banks as it is for consumers.  Says Lori Stewart, Online Resource's senior
vice president of marketing, the service is a "big benefit" for banks because
it is the first interactive way to transfer new funds into the bank.

12 Merchants Get Smart With First Union

First Union Corp.  is the first to announce merchant commitments to
participate in a smart-card trial during this year's Summer Olympics in
Atlanta.  The First Union Visa Cash card will be accepted by most of the
merchants as early as first quarter of the year.  Two other banks scheduled to
issue Visa Cash cards-NationsBank and Wachovia-had not announced any merchant
agreements as of November.

The 12 merchants signed up with First Union for the test launch include
Baskin-Robbins, BellSouth, Blimpie, Chick-fil-A, Communications Central, Crown
Central Petroleum, Domino's Pizza, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit
Authority, Pollo Tropical, Star Enterprise, Taco Bell and United Artist
Theaters.  According to First Union officials, several other merchants have
already signed letters of intent for participation.

The prepaid stored-value cards are available in $10, $20, $50 and eventually
$100 values, and may be obtained by anyone regardless of their bank
affiliation or credit history.  There is no fee to buy or use the cards, which
can be purchased with cash, credit or debit cards.  Omaha, NE-based Applied
Communications, Inc.  is providing the BASE24 software needed to load cash
value onto the First Union cards, which can be used wherever the Visa Cash
logo appears.

Visa is officially leading the smart card race in North America, with
London-based Mondex running close behind.  Mondex just announced a 12-month
pilot in the city of Guelph, Ontario scheduled for the latter half of this
year.  Mondex began piloting the system last July in Swindon, England and
reports usage by more than 8,000 consumers.  Plans are also underway for
additional pilots in the U.S., Asia and Europe.

Other competitors include Electronic Payment System's SmartCash (11
participants in this), which is expected to hit the U.S.  market sometime
later this year along with Mastercard International's MastercardCash, already
in circulation in Australia.  Even American Express is making sure it is not
left behind in the dust.  Teaming up with MCI, American Express Special Teams
is planning to market "integrated service" cards for stored-value applications
to college campuses in the U.S.  and abroad for a 1996 release.

All-in-one cards coming

By mid 1996, First Union will introduce reloadable stored-value cards.
Customers will be able to add cash value to the cards by using a First Union
ATM machine to access their checking or savings accounts.  The eventual goal
is an all-in-one card that will function as stored-value, debit and/or credit
card.

Next year, First Union plans to expand Visa Cash cards to other cities,
including the greater Washington, D.C.  area, Richmond, VA, and major Florida
metropolitan areas.  Major cities in North Carolina, South Carolina and
Tennessee are planned for 1998.

MasterCard Bounces Checkfree For Servantis

MasterCard International announced an alliance with Norcross, GA-based
Servantis Systems, Inc.  as part of several enhancements being made to its
MasterBanking program.  The Servantis alliance will eventually override the
existing agreement between Checkfree Corp., the Columbus, OH-based bill
payment processor, and MasterCard that began three years ago with the launch
of the MasterBanking program.  The enhanced MasterBanking program will be
available during the first quarter of this year.  MasterCard contends that
under a mutually modified agreement, the 50,000 MasterBanking customers whose
transactions are currently passed on to Checkfree will be converted over to
the Servantis system.  Full conversion is expected by mid 1996.

Dual role

"There is no problem with Checkfree, it's just a different choice of a
technology partner," says A.  Christian Frederick, MasterCard senior vice
president of remote banking and strategic planning.  "We wanted the dual
functionality offered by Servantis rather than just the bill payment option
offered by Checkfree."

The dual functionality Frederick refers to is Servantis' ability to offer both
home banking and bill payment capabilities.  The Servantis software allows
customers looking for simple, quick access to their finances to check
balances, transfer funds, pay bills and send and receive email messages to and
from their financial institution through Windows- and Macintosh-based
computers.  Servantis will market these products and services as Bank Street
Platinum.

US Order Delivers Smarter Phones At Lower Cost

Available at a cost of about $200 (down from $250), U.S.  Order's smart phones
not only got cheaper, they got smarter.  The Herndon, VA-based company
announced three new interactive features for its PhonePlus line of smart
telephones.

With the introduction of three features-EZPage text paging, EZPost email
service and FastFind visual directory assistance-PhonePlus smart phones now
have the capability to type and send full text messages directly to pagers,
send email messages via the Internet and receive nationwide directory
assistance information visually on the phone's display screen.  These three
applications add to its established functionality, which includes an interface
with Visa's electronic banking and bill payment service.  The screenphones
also provide a personal phone directory, visual caller ID and visual message
retrieval features.

Banc One, headquartered in Columbus, OH, and Memphis-based First Tennessee
Bank have both begun deployment of the Phone Plus Smart Phone while 18 other
financial institutions are planning to deploy the phones for technical
evaluation and trials.  Current PhonePlus customers will be able to download
the new applications directly from the US Order host computer.  New customers
can purchase the new smart phones through GTE and Sprint.

IRE Helps Secure Quicken Online

Baltimore-based Information Engineering Resources is providing Intuit Service
Corp.  with secure remote access products to protect electronic commerce
transactions.  The encryption equipment, now available through Intuit's
Quicken software, is packaged in a small, portable case designed for
convenient use in home banking.

Banks have been up and running with Quicken since Oct.  26, 1995.  The online
Quicken service enables consumers to bank, pay bills and perform other
financial tasks by dialing up their bank and downloading data directly into
the software, which then organizes consumers' records.

Founded in the early 1980's, Information Engineering Resources is a public
company that designs, manufactures and markets secure, encryption-based
communications systems.  The company reported revenues in excess of $4 million
last year, up 60 percent from the previous year, according to company
spokesperson Jill Leukhardt.

PRODUCT OF THE MONTH:  Shaping A Competitive Image


Shortly after First Commerce Bank of Georgia, $120 million in assets,
installed the PrimeImage Check Imaging System, bank officials had proof they
made the right decision.  With PrimeImage, the bank was able to detect a
fraudulent-check situation that would have resulted in a loss of $160,000.

"Since the system allows instant retrieval of the previous day's deposits, we
were able to substantiate a suspected kite, therefore saving us from a
substantial loss," says Randy Whitehead, group vice president.  "With
microfilm, there is no way we would have been able access our records as fast
to move on the situation."

The PrimeImage Check Imaging System from Carrollton, GA-based Greenway Corp.
is a Windows-NT based check and document imaging software system.  One unique
aspect of PrimeImage is that it utilizes a Redundant Array of Independent Disk
(RAID) system for online, magnetic storage of images.  The online RAID system
reduces statement preparation time by 90 percent over optical storage systems.

With PrimeImage, the front and back of each check and deposit slip is captured
by electronic cameras mounted on an image-enabled check reader/sorter and
transferred to a RAID system for high capacity, online magnetic storage with
fault tolerant safety.  The software system has the capability to assemble the
images and print up to 33 double-sided check-statement pages per minute in
check-number order.  Thus, it streamlines operations by simplifying the
check-sorting process and reducing the number of employees involved.

First Commerce Bank served as the beta site for PrimeImage.  Fully implemented
in June 1995, the system processes all checks for more than 10,000 First
Commerce accounts.  Whitehead points out that the bank has also prevented four
or five other potential losses since installing the complete system in August.
He concludes, "It really has been an excellent overall move for the bank in
terms of time, accuracy, staff productivity and customer service."

Banks using the PrimeImage software report that customers find the new
technology improves the way they balance their checkbooks.  First Commerce's
Whitehead says "customers love it" and reports a 99.5 percent satisfaction
rate with the new laser printed statements.

First National Bank of Griffin, $150 million in assets, installed the
PrimeImage system in November.  Prior to the system's implementation, the
Georgia-based bank conducted focus groups comprised of a variety of
professional and lay people to determine consumer opinion on the new
technology.  The overwhelming majority agreed the system was a quicker and
easier alternative to the "old" checking system.

Elderly customers, in particular, were especially appreciative of the easy to
understand statements, says Bill Homes, senior vice president at First
National Bank of Griffin.  With PrimeImage, checks are reduced to print-outs
that can be stored in a three-ring notebook provided by the bank.  "Our
customers are very comfortable and extremely pleased with our new system," he
says.

Other banks using the PrimeImage software include Moultre, GA-based ABC
Bancorp ($314 million in assets), which installed the system in December, and
Northwest Georgia Bank in Ringgould, GA ($180 million in assets), which will
be up and running with the system in February.

An Unbalanced Budget Burden


It's not easy being a medium-sized institution these days.  That's at least
one of the findings of an annual survey of bank and thrift
information-technology expenditures from Mentis Corp., Durham, NC.

The amount of money banks and thrifts of all sizes spent to purchase new
information systems, hardware and software reached $4.3 billion in 1995, up
from $3.7 billion in 1994, a 17-percent increase.  In addition to the $4.3
billion of capital invested in new technology, the industry spent more than
$20 billion on personnel, facilities, external services and other expense
categories associated with running existing systems and equipment.

Interestingly, the extent to which banks increased their capital investment in
technology differed greatly depending on the deposit size of the bank, the
survey found.  With consolidations roiling and churning the industry
practically weekly, such size-based spending suggests banks are using
technology as a tool to either defend, expand or control their turf.

Medium-sized institutions were the most aggressive investors in new technology
in 1995.  For many of them, potent technology-based strategies were the key to
maintaining their independence against ever-bigger banks encroaching on their
territory.  Mentis found that the segment with between $1 billion and $4
billion in deposits experienced an increase in capital IT spending of 41
percent, from $413 million to $582 million.  That hefty increase occurred even
as the number of branches these institutions own and operate went down (from
11,278 in 1994 to 10,765 in 1995).  By the same token, the segment of
institutions with between $500 million and $1 billion in deposits boosted IT
capital spending by 29 percent, from $184 million to $238 million, even though
they too, had fewer branches to maintain (5,765 in 1994 versus 5,107 in 1995).

When examined by branch, average technology spending for institutions with
between $1 billion and $4 billion in deposits increased by 48 percent per
branch between 1994 and 1995 (from $36,620 to $54,064 per branch).  For the
segment with between $500 million and $1 billion, such spending per branch
increased a 46 percent (from $31,917 to $46,603).  These stats lead to the
summary that medium-sized institutions may well be feeling the heat to compete
more effectively-either to keep up with large banks, or at least avoid being
taken over by them.  Clearly, banks and thrifts of this size are using
technology to pursue aggressive business strategies toward those ends.

Aggressive goals

One case in point, among many, is Centura Bank, Rocky Mount, NC.  The $5
billion institution is surrounded on all sides by some formidable big-bank
competition, including NationsBank, First Union and Wachovia.  Over the past
year, Centura has geared the bulk of its bank technology spending toward a
very specific, aggressive goal:  toward becoming the "money manager" of its
customers, says Tom Rogers, executive vice president.  Investing in technology
was virtually the only way to ensure the success of that strategy.

A month or two from now, Centura will wrap up a branch automation project that
should facilitate the bank's goal of better understanding customers' financial
situations, their needs and their profitability profiles.  Centura's
installation of Windows-based SellStation software from Ampersand Corp.  (now
owned by EDS Corp.)  at the teller and platform lines hooks into a customer
information system, from Customer Insight Co., Denver.  Customer Insight's
Analytix Software delivers customer information, including profitability,
directly to salespeople at the platform, helping them to gear product pitches
to the appropriate customers.

All of these systems and features at the platform are helping to build
business in the bank's new brokerage unit, which offers insurance and
investment accounts.  Rogers was not specific about revenues or new accounts
generated in this area, but relates that "from a business plan standpoint, the
new units are making very good progress."

For Centura, technology was the "tool chest" that helped make it possible.
Quite simply, Rogers says, "we need those [technology] tools to compete, and
to achieve our objective of being money managers."

Big banks reign in

Compared to medium-sized banks and thrifts, the biggest institutions spent far
less on acquiring new technology in 1995.  Banks and thrifts with more than $4
billion in deposits increased capital IT investments by only 17 percent, from
$2.3 billion to $2.6 billion.  The increase is even more modest in light of
the fact that the number of branches these institutions own and operate also
increased, from 33,942 to 35,222.

Many large banks and thrifts, having merged recently, are being sidetracked
from new-investment initiatives as they grapple with the huge jobs of
eliminating multiple information systems and paring overlapped branch
networks.  Of course, there's light at the end of the tunnel for these banks
and thrifts.  As these large institutions succeed in eliminating redundancies,
they should be able to redirect future IT expenditures toward capital
investments in new strategic initiatives.

Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank, to be officially combined as the largest
bank in the land come March, are in that limbo stage right now.  But with the
expectation of eliminating 12,000 positions, consolidating back-office systems
within three years, and saving $1.5 billion in expenses, the combined bank
should be in a position to invest in new technology before long.  The new
Chase is predicting a revenue fall within the first year of merged operation,
a year of break-even growth after that, and finally, revenue gains by 1998.

The objectives and experiences of small banks and thrifts turned out to be
altogether different from those of larger institutions in 1995, when it came
to investments in technology.  According to the Mentis survey, banks and
thrifts with less than $500 million showed a much lower growth rate in their
acquisition of new technology.  Those with between $250 million and $500
million in deposits spent 15 percent less investing in new technology (from
$229 million to $195 million) while those under $250 million increased their
technology expenditures by only 10 percent (from $598 million to $657
million).

These lagging trends in technology budgets make sense in light of the decrease
in the number of branches owned and operated by this segment of the bank and
thrift population.  Institutions with between $250 million and $500 million in
deposits now operate 728 fewer branches (6,767 in 1994 versus 6,039 in 1995),
while those with less than $250 million are dealing with 2,834 fewer branches
(28,425 in 1994 versus 25,591 in 1995).

Despite the overall decrease in technology investment for small banks and
thrifts, the Mentis study shows small institutions are nonetheless beginning
to invest in technology at a level that's on par with their larger brethren.
Mentis examined how capital technology expenditures compare to institutions'
non-interest expenditures-all those expenditures that support a bank's
operations and facilities, such as personnel and technology.

For banks and thrifts with deposits of more than $1 billion in deposits, 1995
capital technology expenditures amounted to 2.5 percent of total non-interest
expenditures.  For those institutions between $250 million and $1 billion,
capital technology spending was 1.9 percent of non-interest expenditures, and
for those with less than $250 million in deposits, it was 2.0 percent.

According to Dr.  James Moore, president and CEO of Mentis, the slightly
higher technology investments of larger banks as a percent of non-interest
expenditures is not a surprise.  "Economies of scale and consolidation in the
large bank segment allow a greater proportion of total dollars to go toward
acquiring new technology," he says, as opposed to managing the current
infrastructure.

The good news is that small banks and thrifts seem to be taking the challenge
of a lack of scale economies in stride, especially as advanced technology
becomes more affordable to them.  If small institutions can't spend as
aggressively as large ones, they at least seem to be spending wisely.  Take
tiny State National Bank of Big Spring, TX.  With $130 million in assets, the
bank has not let its small size get in the way of innovative ideas and astute
technology investments.

Busy, busy, busy

Its list of technology credits include just completing installation of a check
imaging system, developing a debit-card program through MasterCard's
MasterMoney offering, launching an electronic data interchange (EDI)
translation service and offering voice-response access to account balances.
Prior to these projects-most of which occurred in 1995-the bank was busy
installing a fully loaded local area network that runs Windows-based
applications for lending, account openings and other platform functions.  On
the agenda for 1996 is home banking.

Decisive moves

Robert Buckner, first vice president, can't yet quantify the payback the bank
has received, since most of the projects are just starting to have an effect
on customers now.  But State National is moving decisively to ensure its
investments pay off.

In just one example of moving swiftly to offer a service most large banks are
only now just dreaming of, State National will be delivering check images to
its fleet of networked PCs to aid customer service efforts.  Bankers will be
able to print out the front and back of checks in response to customer
requests.  And in a move that some institutions might think radical, State
National will charge a fee to customers who want paper checks returned, but
will offer imaged checking-account statements for free.

State National is not only thinking big, but is thinking creatively about how
to get good returns on technology investments.  Recently, it instituted what
could be a first:  a wake-up service brought to you by a bank.  Through its
voice response system, supplied by Regency Voice Systems, Inc., Dallas, State
National has rigged a wake-up service that sends out ring-a-lings to about 100
people every morning.  The message offers the time, the temperature and a
friendly "Good morning from State National Bank!"

The bank does not feel a need to charge a fee for such calls.  "We figure that
if the first thing you hear every morning is the name of our bank, then pretty
soon that's the only name that comes to mind when banking comes up," notes
Brunckner.

Flexible, free-form thinking like that, in addition to the ever-declining cost
of PC-based banking applications, will help small banks bring much-needed
efficiency gains to technology expenditures.

And once a much-needed calm to the industry's current consolidation frenzy
settles in, perhaps operating budgets will begin following a more steady,
consistent pattern across banks of all sizes

PRODUCT INTROS


For An Encore, Culverin Promotes Self-Service

Imagine customers who act as tellers for themselves.  Dayton, OH-based
Culverin Corp.  is doing just that, as it positions the self-service package
for its Encore!  for Windows application system as a labor-saving tool.
Recently, Culverin was acquired by CFI ProServices, Portland, OR.

The self-service package runs on a touchscreen-equipped PC.  With a card
reader and laser printer, customers can get account and product information,
print instant statements and run simple, non-cash transactions.  PINs maintain
customer security.

Although the self-service package can run independently of the Encore!
system, Culverin doesn't plan to market it as such, says Robert Feaganes,
marketing director.  The software package will probably cost $5,000 to $7,000
per workstation, he says.  Add the hardware required to run it, and the system
comes in priced at less than $10,000.  Culverin Corp., (513) 435-2335.


Signatures Go Digital

From time immemorial, signatures have been used to positively identify bank
customers.  With the ID-007, Atlanta-based Cadix International, Inc., brings
signature verification into the electronic age.  A pressure sensitive writing
tablet and Windows-based driver software make up the ID-007 system.

The ID-007 documents not only the shape of a signature, but also the pressure
and speed with which a person signs.  When first registering with the system,
a customer signs three to five times to give a large enough sample.  The
ID-007 software normalizes the signature and creates a 1.5 KB template.
Future signatures are compared to the template.  The system continues to
update the template with each genuine signature, as the template, like a
person's signature, changes gradually over time.

The system operates on either a local computer or over a network.  It costs
$250 to $1000 per unit, depending on desired features.  Cadix International,
Inc., (404) 804-9951.


Identix ID Points A Finger At Impostors

Identix, Inc., of Sunnyvale, CA, began shipping its TouchSafe II Fingerprint
Identification Terminal, which provides a physical method of verifying
personal identities of customers and computer users.

The TouchSafe II consists of two elements.  The first is a fingerprint scanner
"about the size of four average mice," says Anna Stockel, Identix's director
of fingerprint identification products.  The scanner connects to a standard
PC-mounted card.

The company using the system creates a database by scanning the fingerprints
of people it will wish to later identify.  The Identix system creates and
stores digital templates for these fingerprints.  To positively identify a
person, the system creates a second template from a new scan and compares it
with the old template.

Stockel emphasizes that unless the system is specially ordered, fingerprint
images cannot be generated from templates.  This lack, she says, helps calm
customers or users who fear their fingerprints, after they are scanned, will
be compared to law agency records.

Stockel declined to give price information on the Touchsafe II system.
Identix, Inc., (408) 739-2000.


Budgeting Service For Check Customers

For businesses and families on a budget, every check written is important.
Banks using Budget Master software, a product of Wausau Financial Systems,
Inc., can deliver to their budget-conscious customers statements that
categorize cashed checks into various budget areas.

Banks with Budget Master software issue special budget checking accounts.
Checks for these accounts are imprinted with 21 to 35 special symbols, created
by OnTRACK Management Systems, Inc., Downey, CA.  When writing a check, a
customer marks one or more symbols for budget categories into which the
payment falls.  At the bank, these check categories are keyed in along with
the other check information required to process a check.

Wausau, based in Mosinee, WI, also plans to release an image capture version
of the software, says Joe Gregory, product development manager.  The software
price varies depending on a bank's assets, from a minimum of $20,000 to
$125,000 for a $2 billion bank.  Wausau Financial Systems, Inc., (715)
693-5560


UCC Software Prevents Costly Filing Mistakes

A program from Librasoft, Inc., significantly reduces the risk of clerical
errors that might endanger a banks' legal protection under the Universal
Commercial Code (UCC).  UCC Control, a Windows-based program, automates the
completion of the more than 177 varieties of UCC forms.

Santa Fe, NM-based Librasoft developed UCC Control to automate data entry and
track compliance with UCC filing regulations.  UCC Control recognizes
incongruities in data and notifies users of impending filing lapses.

Form update disks for the program are provided quarterly under an arrangement
with UCC Filing Guide.  A single-user package costs $2,495.  Novell network
versions are available.  Librasoft, Inc., (800) 922-4988.


Toolkit Eases Transition To Mortgage EDI

Lenders using FiTECH Lending's Mortgage Lending system will be able to create
Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) interfaces on demand using the Greensboro,
NC, company's EDI Tool Kit.

The kit, priced under $10,000, gives lenders the ability to communicate with
multiple vendors that support the EDI standard.  Lenders using EDI improve the
timeliness of business transactions, eliminate redundancy, reduce paperwork,
improve business workflow, reduce processing errors, streamline operational
costs and provide access to additional services.  FiTECH Lending, (800)

Visa Pushes Non-Duality For Internet Purchases


The World Wide Web of the Internet is a whole new world, right?  Visa U.S.A.
sure seems to think so.  Recently, the bank card association staked out a
strikingly bold claim in the still-developing world of Web commerce.

Visa announced it will collaborate with Sony Corp.  of America to build a
slick entertainment- and information-rich Web site-one that will take
advantage of Sony's multiple strengths in filmmaking, music, television,
radio, consumer electronics and video games, among others.  The site, dubbed
Sony Station, will be available for access in spring 1996.  Web surfers will
be able to access loads of new content that Sony is developing for this
medium, such as interactive tours with bands, live dating games and
information sessions with audio experts.

Visa's role in this venture is to act as the exclusive processor of secure
payments and micropayments for those who purchase entertainment or other
products from the Web site.  Visa's bold move excludes other brands of debit,
credit and chip cards for use on the Web site.  In other words, consumers will
not be able to use MasterCard or other card brands to make Sony Station
purchases.  In essence, Visa is attempting to create a new model for Internet
payments where duality-the accepted practice of having issuers and merchants
offer and accept multiple brands of bank cards-is a no go.

"Visa's going in the wrong direction," says David Weisman, analyst at
Forrester Research, Cambridge, MA.  "It's an attempt to say Visa has the only
secure payment system for the Internet, which it doesn't.  Now is not the time
to be staking territory."

Visa's attempt to create a non-dual world on the Internet harks back to its
announcement last September that it had established a secure transaction
protocol for Internet payments.  The announcement caught the industry by
surprise because Microsoft, not MasterCard, shared the podium with Visa.
Prior to the unexpected revelation, Visa and MasterCard had said publicly that
they were collaborating on a single standard for secure Internet transactions.

During the press conference announcing Sony Station, Carl Pascarella, Visa's
president and CEO, said that the differences between the Visa- and
MasterCard-led secure Internet protocols were "minimal."  He added, "We're
working on fast convergence of the standard."

However, resolution of the standard will not change the way transactions occur
on Sony Station.  "Resolving the standard will accelerate acceptance of
commerce on the Internet," said Pascarella.  "But it won't change Visa's
position on Sony Station.  Visa will be the only accepted card."

Microsoft Makes Big-Bank Inroads With NT Servers


A number of financial big leaguers recently pledged their allegiance to
Microsoft's Windows NT as their server operating-system of choice for some of
their more mission-critical applications.  The list of high-profile
institutions to sign up with Microsoft toward the end of 1995 includes
Citicorp, Merrill Lynch & Co.  Inc., Charles Schwab & Co., KeyCorp, Crestar
Bank and Sanford C.  Bernstein & Co.  Inc.

Most of these firms are employing Microsoft Back Office, a set of
next-generation business applications for NT servers.  According to Microsoft,
shipments of the Windows NT Server increased 70 percent between the first and
second quarters of 1995.  Even so, Windows NT, which hit the market in 1993,
still has a long way to go to catch up to the financial-services market share
of server operating-systems currently owned by Novell's NetWare network
operating system, according to a 1995 survey by The Tower Group, Wellesley,
MA.  Windows NT represented only 18 percent of new server operating-system
purchases by banks in 1995, compared to the whopping 52 percent represented by
Novell NetWare.

However, that 52 percent represents a harsh loss of share for Novell, because
it is down significantly from 1994's 72 percent, according to Tower.  NT's
18-percent share, meanwhile, represents dramatic momentum, up from only two
percent in 1994.  Through all this, IBM Corp.'s OS/2 LAN Server maintained an
even 20-percent market share in 1994 and 1995, according to Tower.

Many of the applications being put on Windows NT these days are considered
mission-critical.  New York-based Citibank, with more than $250 billion in
assets, will be rolling out more than 10,000 machines grounded in NT over the
next three years.  The bank will develop its future line of ATMs, in-branch
kiosks and staff workstations on Windows NT.

The $14 billion Crestar Bank, Richmond, VA, also is putting NT to work in
branch automation.  Crestar had been using Bankpro branch automation software
from Dallas-based Argo Data on OS/2 operating systems at all of its branches.
When Argo announced that it would make Bankpro available on Windows NT,
Crestar agreed to be one of the beta test sites for the NT version.

"Many of the other local area networks operating within the organization are
predominantly Microsoft and Novell-based solutions," explains David Holman,
senior vice president and manager of branch operations at Crestar.  "If we are
able to run the mission-critical branch automation on Microsoft, we will have
made a significant step forward in achieving increased compatibility between
operating systems across corporate LANs."

Cleveland-based KeyCorp, with $68 billion in assets, began piloting Windows NT
for branch automation at four branches in Columbus, OH, last September.  By
the end of October, the Columbus branches had a total of about 18 workstations
equipped with NT running Olivetti Corp.'s Mosaic OA branch management
software.

By the end of 1996, full functionality will be realized in 200 KeyCorp
branches.  Ultimately, the NT system will run database marketing programs,
interactive video banking kiosks, telephone banking services, enhanced ATM
functionality and smart card services.  Says Janet Malecki, vice president of
Key Services Corp., the move is part of the institution's "First Choice 2000
Strategic Initiative," a set of goals for the turn of the century.

Merrill Lynch, meanwhile, will implement Windows NT on all its 700 branch
servers and 25,000 desktops.  Sanford Bernstein & Co.  already has migrated 25
servers and 400 workstations to Microsoft Back Office and plans to migrate its
remaining mainframe-based applications, such as portfolio accounting and
analytical modeling, to the Windows NT Server.

HP Dresses Up Teller Windows At Wachovia


Microsoft's Windows NT is not the only high-powered operating system making
its way into bank branches.  At Wachovia Bank, Winston-Salem, NC, Hewlett
Packard computers will automate teller windows at some 500 branches in North
and South Carolina and Georgia.  Wachovia plunked down $30 million on the
intelligent HP workstations and the AT&T GIS servers that will feed them.  On
the platform side of branch operations, Wachovia uses IBM workstations running
OS/2.  Previously, the bank used an IBM 4700 configuration in its branches and
in other areas.

William Scales, Wachovia's manager of computing and network services justifies
the huge investment as part of a long-term strategy.  "We've put in a base
platform that will give us a lot of flexibility in the future," he says.  The
terminals could soup up customer service and rev up cross selling at the
teller location, for example.

The HP implementation is also an extension of an ongoing relationship with the
Palo Alto, CA-based computer vendor.  HP workstations and servers automate
Wachovia's bond trading, investment operations, auto finance and
asset-liability management departments.  HP Openview, a network management
software, coordinates systems across the bank.

What Do The Meca Banks Know That You Don't?


Fleet Financial Group, First Bank Systems, Inc.  and Royal Bank of Canada may
know something the rest of the banking industry doesn't.  At a time when
Intuit's Quicken and Microsoft's Money are the bulls in the PC home banking
market, these three banks have bought ownership stakes in Meca Software, whose
Managing Your Money application holds, at best, about 10 percent of the
market.

"The banks that invested in Meca want to be able to offer a full-feature
personal financial management package that's bank-branded, so the relationship
is with the bank rather than with the software package itself," says David
Weisman, analyst at the Forrester Group, Cambridge, MA.  "With Quicken or
Money, the customer relationship is with the package, not the bank."

Besides displaying only bank logos, the Meca software allows banks to
determine which financial services to offer.  Banks also can choose from
various back-end payment systems processors.  "The cornerstone of the bank's
relationship with its customers has been the payment system.  And if you
believe that there's an opportunity to merge the payment system with Internet
commerce, then you would want to make sure that you were in control of that
payment system," says Paul Harrison, president and CEO of Meca.

"Canadianizing" home banking

Meca's flexibility has special appeal for Toronto-based Royal Bank, because
with Meca, it can easily "Canadianize" PC home banking.  Canada's currency and
financial regulations are not fully accommodated by US-oriented packages like
Quicken and Money, points out Dan Maceluch, a spokesman for the bank.  For
example, Canadian retirement plans are called Registered Retirement Savings
Plans, rather than 401(K)s, as denoted on US-made software, and are controlled
by a different set of laws.  Similarly, tax filings are conducted differently
and need to be molded within the software accordingly.

"We would also like to offer the software to the different subsidiaries of
Royal Bank, like Royal Trust, Royal Mutual Funds, RBCDS Dominion Securities
and Action Direct, our discount brokerage," notes Maceluch.  "You have to
create all of those interfaces.  It's not a matter of handing out boxes of
software to customers."  Royal plans on distributing the package for free, and
charging an as-yet undetermined monthly fee.

The three new Meca banks join San Francisco-based Bank of America, with more
than $215 billion in assets, and Charlotte-based NationsBank, with $169
billion in assets, which collaborated to buy the Fairfield, CT-based Meca last
spring.  Each of the five banks now owns 20 percent of Meca.  The ownership
ring is potentially open to a few more bidders-although Harrison asserts he
doesn't want too many owners.

Others cluing in

Ultimately, Meca will offer and tailor the product for non-owner banks.  Other
plans include rolling a wider range of services onto the application, such as
brokerage, loan origination, insurance, and even travel tickets and catalogs.
The three banks' versions of the application will begin appearing on the
market the first half of this year.

These banks are "not the only ones" cluing in to the importance of branding
financial software, says William Randle, director of marketing and strategic
planning at Huntingon Bancshares, Columbus, OH.  "Our view of the future is an
electronic gateway that says 'Huntington.' Microsoft and Intuit have different
views," he asserts.  Randle has faith that "most banks will take action to
protect their customer relationships, so the brand in front of the customer is
their own.  The advantage banks have is they currently own the customer
relationships."

AOL, Intuit Pave Yet Another Electronic Path


Now that Intuit, Inc.  and America Online, Inc.  have joined forces to provide
online electronic banking services, consumers have one more entry into the
evolving world of home banking.  The strategic alliance between the two
industry leaders opens the door to electronic banking for the millions of
America Online members.  At the same time, it creates yet another product
detour for consumers en route to banks.

AOL subscribers will have point-and-click access to financial services
including checking, savings, money market and credit card accounts-as long as
these accounts are located at banks participating in the new AOL service.
These banks will charge fees independent of the AOL subscriber fee.

Providing AOL access will be easiest for banks already offering electronic
banking services via Intuit's Quicken.  For these banks, no additional
equipment or programming will be necessary-a single connection to Intuit
Services Corp.  will give these banks the ability to communicate
electronically with the eight million Quicken users and the four million AOL
members alike.

However, experts caution the potential hazards of banks engaging in such an
offering.  "It's a double-edged sword," points out David Weisman, an analyst
at Forrester Research, Cambridge, MA.  "It's a tempting place to be because
Intuit and AOL have such great target customer bases."  But, as more banks
sign on to offer their products through AOL, "you run the risk of becoming
just another computer icon within someone else's financial powerhouse."

Will banks go for it?  "We won't be jumping on this," says Doug Haynes, senior
vice president at $5.1 billion Centura Bank, Rocky Mount, NC, which offers
both Quicken and Microsoft Money to its customers.  "Obviously AOL is one of
the more popular online service providers.  So it's certainly something we'll
be looking into down the road."  Haynes adds that the bank is too busy right
now focusing efforts on its recent rollouts of Quicken and Money.

One more option

First National Bank of Chicago, another adopter of both Quicken and Money, is
investigating the AOL/Intuit service.  "Right now, we can say to our
customers, 'If you don't like Quicken, you can use Microsoft Money' or vice
versa," says Tom Kelly, spokesperson.  "If we were to sign on with AOL, we
would then be able to provide one more option to our customers."

According to Linda Parker, senior vice president at US Bancorp, Portland, OR,
the AOL/Intuit product description is "very attractive."  The real advantage
for banks, she says, is the potential to tap into a customer segment
unreachable through personal finance software.

The collaborative electronic banking service is expected to be launched during
the first half of this year for Windows users and by the end of the year for
Macintosh users.  Nevertheless, no financial institutions had committed
themselves as of press time.

Prior to the alliance, the Vienna, VA-based online service provider had only
one other online banking service agreement, with Bank of America, which had
established a site on AOL's Personal Finance channel last year.

New Directions EDS, The Exchange Create New Network


EDS and The Exchange regional network are splitting ownership of a new
enterprise, TransAlliance, that will offer electronic funds transfer services
to institutions in the western U.S.  and western Canada.  The alliance
combines The Exchange's more than 300 members with EDS' two EFT network
operations for a total initial customer base of about 700 financial
institutions spanning 13 states and four provinces, with 9,000 ATMs, and
annual revenues of about $50 million.

The bill of fare will include ATM, point-of-sale and interbank transaction
processing, and eventually home banking and electronic bill pay transactions.
Multimedia-based ATM transactions are a possibility as well.

Transactions will be processed on a new platform, called EON, just introduced
by EDS to satisfy requirements for greater uptime and availability.  Denny
Dumler, president and CEO of Visa International's Plus national ATM network,
was named president and CEO of the new enterprise.

Mellon Offers Corporate Cards With A Twist


Company handouts to employees are taking on a new twist with a corporate ATM
card being offered by $38-billion asset Mellon Bank.  The card lets employees
access compensation and incentive funds from special accounts whenever they
feel like it.  And, it reduces costs for employers, as it replaces paper
checks or certificates, and leaves the processing of ATM and debit
transactions to Mellon.  The Pittsburgh-based bank will custom design the
cards according to firms' specifications.

Going Where No Card Reader Has Gone Before


Gamblers beware.  Off-track betting could end up in consumers' living rooms
through a pilot combining at-home point-of-sale terminals and interactive
television simulcasts of horse races.  This project is one of many that Morris
Plains, NJ-based ISED (International Secure Encryption Devices) is pursuing,
as it attempts to establish applications for a new low-cost point-of-sale
terminal that secures debit and credit card transactions initiated in the home
or small office.

ISED's horse-betting venture with Tulsa, OK-based On Demand Services, a
partner of Churchill Downs, organizer of the Kentucky Derby, typifies the sort
of in-home POS service that ISED is hoping to make mainstream.  Gamblers will
be able to place bets on interactive-TV race simulcasts by swiping cards
through ISED's Secure Encryption Devices and making online or offline debits.
Other ultimate uses for the devices will be to facilitate the $40 billion
worth of home-shopping purchases currently made by consumers via telephone
each year.  Using the secure terminals to transmit home-shopping orders offers
far more privacy and security than reciting one's credit card number over the
phone to a customer sales representative.

$75 a pop

"The little box replicates an ATM in every sense of the word except that it
doesn't dispense cash," says Joseph Favole, vice president of ISED.  At $75 a
pop, ISED is hoping to become the first company to make secure card payments
via telephones and PCs a reality for consumers at home.  The terminals use
regular phone jacks to plug into telephones and modems.  Another version of
the gizmo fits into the keyboard port on a PC.  From these easy access points,
ISED taps into the might of the ATM and credit card networks, allowing secure
online and offline debit and credit transactions to occur from home.

Before reaching the mass consumer market, however, ISED is first targeting the
small merchant market.  ISED estimates six to seven million small merchants
still accept only cash or checks because they deem the POS terminals available
today as expensive barriers to electronic transactions.  Not only are the less
expensive Secure Encryption Devices an inducement for such merchants, but by
getting rid of paper, the typical 2.18 percent interchange rate and $.10
per-transaction fee drop to an interchange rate of 1.3 percent and no fee.  At
least 800 Secure Encryption Devices are already in action at merchant sites,
and there's a huge back order on the little machines, according to Hilary
Thomas, president of ISED.  Thomas hails from a prior post as president of
Minitel USA, a subsidiary of France Telecom, which distributed screenphones
throughout France a few years ago.

Rutland, VT-based Chittenden Bank, $1.2 billion in assets, is the first bank
to test the Secure Encryption Devices.  Daniel Alcorn, senior vice president
of Chittenden's retail credit division, expects the terminal "will enable us
to get more merchants, independent sales organizations and agent banks as
customers.  It's a low-cost solution to paper processing, and a low-cost
entrance into electronic processing, including debit."

Alcorn predicts a surge in merchant processing revenues, thanks to the
low-cost competitive edge the Secure Encryption Devices provide.  "If we
brought in merchants each with an average transaction rate of $10,000 a month,
and we signed on a thousand merchants, that's $10 million a month.  The margin
on that business is usually .0025.  You make $25,000 a month in net pretax
margin, which is $300,000 a year before taxes.  We think we'll be able to
attract at least that many new customers in one year," Alcorn says.

Merchant to supplier

Once the Secure Encryption Devices make headway in the small-merchant market
as low-cost POS terminals, ISED plans to market them as devices merchants can
use to facilitate purchases from their suppliers.  "These first two phases are
happening now," notes Favole.  Finally, the devices will enter into consumer
homes, supplied by merchants through customer loyalty programs, and ultimately
sold to consumers by software companies.

ISED is adopting a different terminal deployment strategy from that of
VeriFone, which recently announced a plan to enable consumers to make payments
from home using PC-based software called Pay Window.  Under VeriFone's scheme,
a device will marry point-of-sale terminals, called Payports, to consumers' PC
terminals.  The solution will let consumers use credit and debit cards,
electronic cash and electronic checks to make Internet purchases.  The plan
includes payment software for merchants and acquirers, and Gateway software to
tap into existing payment and clearing infrastructures.

To pull this off, the Redwood City, CA-based vendor is tapping the resources
of its recent acquisition, Enterprise Integration Technologies of Menlo Park,
CA, which specializes in software and consulting to get companies rolling with
electronic commerce, and Cybercash, Reston, VA, a key player in payment
systems on the Internet.  VeriFone's Internet payment architecture is
scheduled to hit the market in six to nine months.

Flawed strategy?

In the view of VeriFone, ISED's strategy of reaching out to small merchants
may well be flawed.  "Eighty percent of merchants who can afford debit
transactions are well equipped at this point," says Mohammad Khan, director of
marketing at VeriFone's Internet Commerce Division.  "There are only a few
merchants left who don't have electronic card readers, and that merchant
segment is not interested in debit cards at this point."

ISED, nonetheless, is forging right ahead.  "Right now, we're encrypting the
PIN" for ATM and debit card activity, says Favole.  "We can also encrypt the
magnetic stripe information, but we're not doing it yet.  Regulations don't
require encryption for credit card transactions yet.  But in the event that
Visa and Mastercard start offering banks lower rates for encrypted
transactions, we are ready."

A further security measure waiting in ISED's wings is the creation of
one-of-a-kind public and private keys for every missive.  Processors of the
Secure Encryption Devices will be called upon to create and maintain master
keys for security purposes.  Processors of the banks and merchants that deploy
devices to the consumer will have the ability to recognize transactions from
"foreign" Secure Encryption Devices, much like bank ATM processors today
recognize and route foreign ATM transactions between banks.  For example, a
merchant or bank's Secure Encryption Device processor will request a working
key from the processor of the consumer's deployer.  A single-use-only working
key, encrypted under the master key, will be sent back directly to the
consumer's Secure Encryption Device within seconds.

Backed by Electronic Data Systems, ISED congealed some three years ago with
the goal of bringing the Secure Encryption Device to market.  EDS' involvement
in the privately held ISED is strictly financial, and the monetary stake has
not resulted in the Dallas-based company becoming the sole processor for the
ISED terminals.

NOTES: FIRST INTERSTATE GIVES IN TO WELLS FARGO

First Interstate Bancorp finally gave in last month to the unwelcome
approaches of its Californian neighbour Wells Fargo. The resulting
merger, valued at dollars 11.6 billion, is the biggest in US bank
history and a rare example of a successful hostile bid.

After several months of fighting, when the end came for First
Interstate it came quickly. On Monday 22 January the bank announced
that it had started talking to Wells. By Wednesday, the deal was
agreed.

The agreement left First Interstate's rival suitor, First Bank System
(FBS) of Minneapolis, on the shelf.

FBS had come in as a white knight to rescue First Interstate. As
compensation, the Minneapolis bank receives a dollars 200 million
termination fee.

Two developments appeared to have prompted First Interstate's volte
face.

The potential benefits of the FBS merger had been undermined by a
Securities and Exchange Commission ruling that, because the deal was
structured as a 'pooling of interests' the group would not be able to
undertake any substantial stock repurchases for two years afterwards.

Meanwhile, the strength of the Wells stock price had boosted the value
of its bid and the gap over the alternative. The terms of the offer -
two-thirds of a Wells share for each First Interstate - have not
changed since Wells upped its first bid (The Banker, 12/95, p4), but
its worth has.

At the time of the announcement, in contrast, the FBS offer was worth
some dollars 10.1 billion.

The get-together is expected to lead to some substantial cuts in
staffing and branch networks as Wells gets to grips with the
considerable overlaps between the two groups and creates a new major to
challenge the strengths of BankAmerica in California.

Wells, based in San Francisco, has 983 banking locations in the state,
increasingly focused on supermarket outlets rather than traditional
branches. First Interstate, Los Angeles-based, has a total of 1,140
offices in 13 western states; 406 are in California. The network will
be reduced. So will staff levels; Wells has indicated that around 7,500
jobs would go as part of an dollars 800 million cost cutting programme.

NOTES: NEW LOOK FOR FIRST UNION

First Union Corporation of North Carolina has acquired a new dimension
as a result of its merger with New Jersey's First Fidelity. As well as
creating the sixth largest US bank holding company, with assets of some
dollars 126 billion and covering 12 eastern states plus Washington DC,
the deal has brought a substantial addition to First Union's
international armoury.

First Fidelity has had a significant presence in London since 1973. The
branch, where Richard Morley remains as general manager, has now been
re-labelled with the First Union logo.

Until recently, the North Carolina bank's international involvement had
been minimal. Andrew Oleksiw, US-based managing director, international
division, explains that the group has focused over the last 10 years on
growing internally and being 'a high performance bank in the US'.

Until the latest merger, First Union's growth to its present position
had been in a rather lower key than that of its immediate neighbour in
Charlotte, NationsBank.

Daniel Mathis, US-based managing director of First Union's capital
markets group, says that over a period of 10 years the group has made
some 60 acquisitions, many of them small and designed to fill in the
coverage. They often produced significant cost savings.

With the First Fidelity deal, he says, there is no overlap and
therefore no great economies. But with the extended branch network in
the US, he sees opportunities to sell existing products to new
customers.

Oleksiw explains that in the home market the group had focused on four
main areas. First, international corporate banking, particularly for US
subsidiaries of foreign companies in its region. Second, trade finance,
where he argues that with its technology the group can offer lower
processing costs on letters of credit, for example, than the money
centre banks.

Third, correspondent banking. And fourth, something of a speciality
because of its acquired presence in Washington, banking for embassies,
which often have procurement and economic development agencies there.

Now the group is looking at a new horizon, supporting US corporations
abroad. Oleksiw says Latin America, which is in the same time zone and
easily accessible, does not require a physical presence; not having one
can boost correspondent banking business.

In the far East, the group established a joint venture company in
Hongkong with the Hong Kong Chinese Bank to support US companies with
trade in Asia.

The company, First Union HKCB Asia, 'is expected to process over
dollars 1 billion annually in trade transactions by the end of the
decade'. First Union has also opened a representative office in South
Africa.

Says Oleksiw: 'That left us with Europe. We were looking here before
the acquisition. The preference would have been to buy a small bank and
tweak it to fit; we weren't able to find the right opportunities. It is
fortuitous that we bought First Fidelity which had an operation with a
London focus.' First Union has identified more than 2,500 companies
based in its home market area with UK subsidiaries. Morley could have
his work cut out.

NOTES: GANGLAND GAMBLE

Big names on a little list? So it would appear from the furore that has
erupted in Japan with the revelation that a relative few big borrowers
account for over 40% of total loans from the country's seven bankrupt
housing loan corporations (Jusen). The sixty four thousand dollar (or
rather Yen 628 billion) question is, who are these people? It has been
widely believed that the Jusen collapsed because they got in way over
their heads during the orgy of real-estate lending that occured during
Japan's bubble economy. Once asset values collapsed their loans went
bad and that was that.

A more sinister interpretation is emerging, however, that seems certain
to show up prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party
in an unfavourable light - assuming that the full details ever come
out.

The picture that is coming slowly into focus is one of a corrupt
alliance among Japanese bankers, bureaucrats and organised crime
(Yakuza) syndicates to exploit the profits of the bubble economy.

The government has released lists of the leading 50 borrowers at each
Jusen, though no names as yet. There is strong public interest in
knowing who they are because of the growing realisation that in the
case of many big borrowers from the Jusen they are simply refusing to
repay debts rather than being unable to do so. And yet taxpayers are
being asked to cough up Yen 628 billion (dollars 598 million) toward
the clean-up of the Jusen mess.

It has been assumed, too, that the Jusen's Yakuza debtors, nasty enough
as they are to have shot dead one bank manager who tried to collect
debts and to have stabbed another, were on the fringe of the Jusen
problem.

However, the figures show that debts held by major borrowers at the
Jusen amounted in total to Yen 4.4 trillion or 41% of the total loans
outstanding.

In the case of four of the Jusen, the top 50 borrowers include
(anonymous) individuals.

'Public servants are bound by law not to disclose secrets,' declared
prime minister Hashimoto, although the finance ministry said it would
consider releasing names to a closed session of Japan's national Diet
(parliament) upon request.

What makes the affair even more intriguing is that no fewer than 473 of
the total 532 senior executives of the Jusen were supposedly
respectable Japanese bankers.

Banks founded and funded the Jusen, along with hundreds of Japanese
agricultural co-operatives, but they also played a large part in
managing them. A dozen of their executives were also former senior
officials of the Ministry of Finance.

The Jusen affair has an almost uncanny resonance with the great
'compensation' deal scandal that embroiled most of Japan's leading
securities houses in 1991.

At that time, news leaked out that the big brokerages had paid some of
their biggest clients huge sums to compensate them for losses they
suffered when the great Tokyo bull market of the late 1980s collapsed.

The legions of small investors who had to take their knocks in the
market were not delighted to learn of this, though it was assumed that
the favoured few were so big that the brokers wanted to stay on the
right side of them at any cost.

The question now is - were they also gangsters whom the brokers were
terrified of confronting?

NOTES: FLAK-FIGHTER STEPS DOWN

Brian Quinn, who is stepping down at the end of this month as Bank of
England executive director responsible for banking supervision, has
lived in interesting times.

During his tenure, two dramatic bank crashes have brought the Bank's
role under the spotlight and created a good deal of flak aimed at the
supervisors, including suggestions that the supervisory role should be
removed from the central bank.

The 1991 closure of the fraud-ridden Bank of Credit & Commerce
International (BCCI), where the Bank played a leading role, led to the
Bingham report and in turn to significant developments in the Bank's
operations. Last year's collapse of Barings brought further criticism
and more reports to be followed up.

That task falls to Michael Foot, deputy in the supervisory department,
who will take Quinn's place.

NOTES: NCB TAKES ITS PARTNERS

Partnerships may still be in fashion at Goldman Sachs but elsewhere,
from accountancy firms to banks, incorporation is preferred. In Saudi
Arabia, the largest bank in the Arab world, National Commercial Bank
(NCB), has been a partnership since it was established in 1951. But
times may be changing.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s NCB went through a difficult period
where it was forced for various reasons, including involvements with
Bank of Credit & Commerce International (BCCI), to withdraw from many
of its international operations. In recent years, however, the bank has
undergone a reorganisation and last month chairman Mohammed bin Mahfouz
announced another year of record profits with NCB's net income in 1995
up 20% over the SR579 million(dollars 154 million) achieved in 1994 and
an improvement in the net return on partners' equity from 8.3% to 9.9%.

The improved performance is not all that has changed. Early last year
the bank's founder Salim bin Mahfouz died, which focused attention on
the ownership of the bank which was known to be spread among the
Mahfouz and Kaki families.

While the partnership form has been maintained it is understood that
the entire ownership of the bank is now in the hands of former chief
executive Khalid bin Mahfouz, who is no longer involved in the bank's
management.

With Khalid bin Mahfouz now owning 100%, the bank's ownership structure
has been streamlined. But NCB remains unincorporated and not listed on
the local stock exchange like other banks.

Bankers suggest that if NCB wants to expand abroad again and utilise
the growing domestic capital markets then it would need to be
incorporated.

The question now is whether Khalid bin Mahfouz's sole partnership will
go the way of Goldman Sachs or seek incorporation.

NOTES: A TRULY BRITISH IDENTITY

UBAF Bank, the majority Arab-owned institution founded in London in
1972, is to change its name in early March to British Arab Commercial
Bank (BACB).

The purpose of the change, according to chief executive Peter Taplin,
is to reinforce the bank's identity as a British-based institution
licensed and supervised by the Bank of England.

The bank has six Arab shareholders, including Libyan Arab Foreign Bank
(36.5%), Central Bank of Egypt (7.9%) and Rafidain Bank (4.9%) as well
as a major British shareholder, Midland Bank (24.8%).

The new name will reflect the bank's prime role of conducting business
with banks and other customers in the Arab world.

NOTES: PRIVATE CASH HEADS EAST

Total capital flows to leading emerging markets in 1995 were around
record levels of about dollars 216 billion despite the Mexican peso
crisis. Total private capital flows to these markets in 1996 are
projected to be robust, demonstrating the substantial continuing
investor interest in emerging economies, says the Washington-based
Institute of International Finance (IIF).

In its 1996 capital flows forecasts the IIF says that private financial
flows to the leading 30 emerging economies may total around dollars 175
billion, much the same as the totals in 1994 and 1995 and comparable to
the 1993 record flow of dollars 192 billion.

Official flows, which increased substantially in 1995 after the Mexican
crisis and reached dollars 41 billion, are expected to decline to
around dollars 11 billion in 1996.

Developments in markets in leading industrial countries are expected to
have a profound impact on flows to emerging economies.

'The continuation of relatively low world interest rates during 1996,
and improving economic fundamentals in many developing countries,
suggest that there will be strong investor interest in emerging markets
this year,' says Charles Dallara, IIF managing director. 'We anticipate
a substantial rebound in bond financing and increased direct
investment, offset by a reduction in short-term lending by banks from
the high levels seen last year.'

Latin America and Asia-Pacific have been the prime areas of capital
flows to emerging markets. The IIF predicts that private flows to Latin
America will reach about dollars 52 billion in 1996 after dropping to
dollars 37 billion in 1995, while private flows to Asia-Pacific will
amount to dollars 87 billion in 1996 compared to dollars 94 billion in
1995. The IIF also forecasts that real GDP growth will average 2.7 % in
Latin America in 1996 after 0.4% growth in 1995 while Asia-Pacific will
again be the powerhouse with expected growth this year of 8.4% after
reaching 9.0% in 1995.

NOTES: EMERGING MARKETS

It was a year to forget for emerging markets investors and fund
managers. Many are choosing to bury memories by focusing on a brighter
1996. The markets suffered from foreign investors' confidence crisis
following the Mexican devaluation in late 1994 and early 1995. US fund
managers, in particular, found little incentive to venture beyond the
comforts of home into riskier markets, thanks to the strong performance
of the US equity market, which rose 34.7% in dollars, according to the
Morgan Stanley Capital International US Index.

In 1995, the IFC Investable Composite Index fell 10.3% in dollar terms,
after a 13.8% fall in the index in 1994, in contrast with the MSCI
World Index, which rose 18.7% in dollar terms. Among regional IFC
indices, Latin America dropped 18.7% and Asia 6.9%.

Europe/Mideast/Africa provided a ray of light, with its 19.5% increase,
although the region ex-South Africa registered a fall of 6.9%.

The best performers among the IFC Investable Indices in 1995 were
headed by Jordan, which rose 23.1% in dollar terms, followed by South
Africa with a 14.8% increase and Zimbabwe with 12.3%. The runners-up
were Peru, up 10.6% and Indonesia, which climbed 9.9%.

Jordan was seen as a play on the Middle East peace process by foreign
investors. It also received a boost from a 1995 investment law, which
lifted restrictions on the entry of foreign capital.

South Africa enjoyed an inflow of around dollars 1.4 billion of foreign
money into equities in 1995, says Vikas Nath, emerging market
strategist of UBS, after entrance into several indices, including the
IFC Investable Indices, and return to the international investment
scene.

Macro-economic fundamentals improved and falling inflation, among other
factors, spurred a huge bond rally in the last four months of the year.

South Africa's good performance also boosted Zimbabwe, explains Nath.

Zimbabwe's rise also reflects a slight recovery from the impact of a
drought in late 1994 and 1995, says Nigel Rendell, emerging markets
strategist at James Capel.

Worst performers were Sri Lanka, with a fall of 39.5% in 1995; Hungary
with 35.1%; and India with 34.9%. Pakistan, with a fall of 33.7%, was
close behind.

Foreigners were scared off from Sri Lanka by the civil war and
terrorism; Pakistan was also hit by political turmoil. India came off
the boil after the 1994 euphoria. 'A lot of people are tipping India as
a key market for 1996 after such a disastrous 1995,' says Rendell.

Hungary was tarnished in the eyes of foreign investors by big budget
and current account deficits at the start of 1995, but a stabilisation
plan announced in March 1995 has been quite successful in reducing
them.

Michael Howell, head strategist at ING Barings, projects about dollars
50 billion of cross-border equity flows to emerging markets in 1996
(including Hongkong, China and Singapore), from dollars 15 billion in
1995.

He expects foreign buying in 1996 will be felt strongly by two regions:
Asia-Pacific, specifically Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and
Indonesia; and the 'embryo' emerging markets, notably Eastern Europe
and Russia.

He forecasts these regions, which comprise around 25% of the emerging
stock market capitalisation, will receive around dollars 20 billion. He
adds that more cash will also go into sub-Saharan Africa: 'This indeed
could be the region to surprise investors in 1996'.

Jane Hakham, investment director of Beta Funds, picks Argentina and
Poland as her favourites for 1996. She believes Argentina did not
deserve the pasting it received in the wake of the Mexican crisis and
is 'definitely due for a recovery'. With 1996 price/earnings ratios of
about 10 times or less for some stocks, the market is 'really very
cheap', she says. She also finds Poland, on a P/E of about 7 for 1996,
good value.

Of new markets, Hakham likes Egypt, which has 1995 P/Es of about 8-8.5.
The market is a 'turnaround story', which will benefit indirectly from
the Middle East peace process. China, Pakistan and Turkey could also be
turnaround stories for 1996, she thinks.

Nath of UBS, for the first half of 1996, recommends overweighting
Turkey, South Korea, Chile, Israel and Thailand; and 'neutral plus'
positions for Brazil and South Africa.

Rendell also favours Poland for 1996 and Brazil, if it can engineer
crucial reforms of the tax system and public sector pensions.

FOREIGN BANKS IN LONDON: THE SECRET COST OF TAX

Foreign banks with branches in the UK face complex tax legislation and
a wide variety of taxes. A branch bank operating in the UK has its own
UK corporation tax liability as well as responsibilities for the
collection of tax from its employees and the people with whom it does
business. The Inland Revenue has taken an increasing interest in banks'
proper application of the rules for deduction of tax at source in
recent years, and this has been expensive for banks which were not
aware of their obligations.

Few banks in London have not had to face detailed questioning by the
Inland Revenue before their accounts are agreed. This is due to the
complexity of banking business and the fact that banking business is
often carried out by a branch; branch accounts seldom carry a statutory
audit opinion.

A bank operating in the UK through a branch must pay corporation tax on
the profits attributable to the business carried out in the UK. The
Inland Revenue is concerned that the UK branch accounts accurately
reflect those profits. Recently it has looked in great depth at the
extent to which loans booked in the UK branch are genuinely London
business.

It was initially concerned that loans were being booked in London to
take advantage of the UK's generous tax credit rules. However, in 1987
these were changed and its concern in recent years has been that loans
on which large losses have been made do not belong in London. Loan
losses have wiped out many branch bank profits over the last few years
so it is clearly beneficial for the Inland Revenue to be able to argue
that these losses do not belong in the UK branch accounts.

In deciding where a loan belongs the Inland Revenue uses Organisation
for Economic Co-operation & Development criteria, which look at where
the following took place:

* the offer of the new business;

* establishing the borrower's credit rating and the risk involved in
the loan;

* negotiation of the terms;

* the decision to make the loan;

* conclusion of the contract and disbursement of the funds; and

* administration of the loan.

Of these the first four are the most important. Where a bank makes
large provisions it is likely to face questions from the Inland Revenue
about which country the above functions took place in. The Inland
Revenue does not carry out audits, in the way that the tax authorities
of some countries do, but it may ask to see loan files or loan
documentation in order to establish that loans belong in the UK.

It will not usually accept that the transfer of loans from one branch
to another is effective for tax purposes. If a loan was initially
booked in the London branch its view is that the profits associated
with it cannot be transferred to another branch even if all the risk
and administration of the loan is transferred as well.

Another area of Inland Revenue interest is ensuring that a UK branch
receives adequate reward for work done for other parts of the bank.
This includes the raising of funds on the London markets for other
parts of the bank when the London branch is expected to make a margin
on the transaction.

The other side of the coin is the amounts paid to other parts of the
bank for work done for the UK branch. Here the Inland Revenue wants to
be sure that profits are not shifted out of the UK by the use of
charges for work performed outside the UK. A bank must be able to
justify its intra-group charges by reference to the amounts which would
be charged by third parties.

Two particular deductions claimed by most branch banks operating in
London have been scrutinised by the Inland Revenue in recent years. The
first is the deduction for head office charges relating to the UK
branch.

Under the terms of many tax treaties entered into by the UK, a UK
branch can deduct a proportion of head office expenses, but it has to
be able to demonstrate that the proportion is reasonable by reference
to the functions performed at head office for the UK branch.

The second is the deduction for interest payable to other parts of the
bank on funds advanced to the UK branch. The Inland Revenue view is
that an element of this interest should not be deductible, representing
the interest on the capital which the branch would have needed if it
was a subsidiary.

Many banks have argued vigorously against this disallowance but,
unfortunately, a test case has not been taken to clarify the legal
issue.

To settle their tax affairs, many banks have accepted a disallowance of
interest deduction based on a notional capital amount, often equal to
the cost of funding the branch's fixed assets.

The Inland Revenue has been criticised in recent years for the
complexity of its tax legislation. The 1993 legislation on the taxation
of foreign exchange transactions was a case in point, and this has a
big impact on banks due to the international nature of their business.

Particular features of this legislation which will be of interest to
banks are the election for accounts to be prepared in a non-sterling
currency for tax purposes, the deferral provisions for tax on
unrealised exchange gains on long-term capital assets and liabilities
and the transitional rules which take certain balances outside the new
rules for six years.

These new rules have become applicable to many banks from 1 January
1996 and important elections have to be made before 2 April 1996.

The UK banking community has been increasingly complaining that it is
being used as a tax collection agency for the government. This is
partly due to the vigorous approach of the Inland Revenue in recent
years in checking that banks are fully carrying out all their
withholding tax obligations.

Except in restricted circumstances, banks operating in London need to
withhold tax:

* from interest paid to individuals;

* from interest which is not paid in the ordinary course of banking
business;

* from interest on quoted Eurobonds, foreign interest or foreign
dividends collected as agent for UK residents (individuals or
companies);

* from foreign interest or foreign dividends where the bank is a paying
agent; and

* from salary payments.

The main area to which the Inland Revenue has devoted resources in
recent years is in checking the first of these; that banks are
correctly deducting income tax from interest paid to individuals.

Broadly, income tax must be deducted from payments of interest to
individuals unless it is on a qualifying certificate of deposit or a
qualifying time deposit of at least pounds 50,000 or the beneficial
owner of the interest has notified the bank in writing that he is not
usually resident in the UK.

In many cases the Inland Revenue has found the documentation in respect
of not ordinarily resident accounts to be inadequate and large
settlements of tax have had to be paid.

The Inland Revenue is now turning its attention and audit resources to
ensuring that the paying and collecting agent rules, items three and
four in the list above, are being correctly applied by banks.

The current legislation on this is outdated and new legislation will be
included in the 1996 Finance Bill. The indications are that, although
it has been announced as a deregulatory measure, it will more clearly
define the scope of the rules and set out the practicalities of
applying them, rather than greatly restricting the number of
transactions which fall within them.

The position is broadly that a bank must deduct tax from interest on
quoted Eurobonds, foreign interest or dividends where it obtains
payment of these amounts. This is particularly relevant to custodial
and private client business.

The main exception to the rules is where the person entitled to the
proceeds is not resident in the UK, and it is here that Inland Revenue
audits have brought problems in the banks to light.

The documentation supporting gross payment to non-residents has often
been inadequate or out of date. It is likely that the new legislation
will set out more clearly the documents which must be kept to support
gross payment but banks need to be sure that they do not have exposures
under the old rules as well.

Many banks in London employ expatriate staff and the Inland Revenue is
increasingly looking at their salary packages to ensure that the rules
for deduction of tax at source are fully complied with. A common area
for error is payments made in the home country. If these payments are
for work carried out in the UK tax should be deducted at source even if
payment is made outside the UK.

In a competitive environment, where cutting the cost base is paramount,
tax must be given due consideration to ensure that it does not become a
large cost.

VIEWPOINT: SHAPE UP FOR EUROPE

Europe has embarked on a historic endeavour of economic integration,
with the final goal of a political European Union. One important step
is the Maastricht Treaty and European economic and monetary union
(EMU).

No one should be surprised that the debate has become more noisy and
intense as deadlines draw closer. Important issues should be discussed
publicly and open dialogue and fair debate can only help this process.

There are two demands on European economic and monetary union: it
should be a union of stability, and it should not become a transfer
union. Only if these two preconditions are met can members reap the
benefits of a single currency in Europe. Only then will the new
Eurocurrency have a chance to gain broad acceptance.

There is a clear European consensus, formalised in the Maastricht
Treaty, that EMU can only be based on stability. Stability must not
only be created after the union begins, it must be brought into the
union by every country wishing to become a member. To ensure this, the
Maastricht Treaty contains a set of entry criteria in the areas of
inflation, interest and exchange rates as well as fiscal performance.

In our opinion all entry criteria, including the fiscal reference
levels, should be strictly met. Hence, there is a growing likelihood
that we will have to consider a small stability union comprising about
one half of EU members, for example Germany and its neighbours which,
however, account for a substantial share of total EU product.

The UK, with its stability and its economic role in Europe, would be a
natural part of EMU from the beginning. We hope that political
obstacles can be removed by the time the decisions have to be taken in
1998.

Stability from the outset is more important than initial all-inclusive
membership. We think of European integration as an ongoing process.
Each EU member country must be part of this process, but we have never
thought that entry at a later date should carry the outsider's stigma.
As long as the rules are the same for each member country and as long
as they are clear, we are all (the word may be allowed in this context)
insiders.

This has nothing to do with German 'power play' or with monetary union
'on German terms'. The issue is much simpler: the Deutschmark is one of
the world's three key currencies. Stability on world financial markets
is only possible if the issuers of the key currencies - US, Germany,
Japan - ensure responsible monetary policy and low government deficits.
The new European currency will be the successor to the Deutschmark and
must satisfy the same quality standards if the world financial system
is not to suffer.

Hence, each country joining EMU must realise that it is assuming the
rights and duties of a key currency country. The prime requirement in
this respect is financial discipline, not only when joining EMU, but in
the long run as well.

How successfully the European Central Bank can preserve the stability
of money will depend a great deal on the choice of monetary policy
instruments.

Instruments and operating procedures must be efficient and convincing,
in particular in the starting phase, when the European Central Bank
will not have any monetary policy record. It is essential that it can
rapidly prove its ability to contain inflation. This will be decisive
for the financial markets' view that the new currency is a 'high-
quality currency'.

In respect to the mechanics of the monetary changeover, financial
markets need to know which steps of the conversion are regulated by
administrative measures and which are left up to the market itself.

Competition between banks will help advance the process of monetary
union.

The banks will pay close attention to the interests of their customers
and respond to demand for products in the Eurocurrency by making
available an appropriate range. In offering Europroducts, all banks
within the monetary area will compete with each other. The emerging
single EU financial market will no longer be hampered by national
borders. Regulations and market entry barriers are being removed.
Intense competition will compel banks to act and react rapidly.

Deadlines drawing closer have a special meaning for banks since it will
be up to them to actually and practically handle first the transition
and then the new money. As banks, we will have to explain to our
customers that, at least, their economic future will not be jeopardised
by European monetary union and that we will be able to handle all
technical matters competently.

This means preparations have to start now, though there remains
considerable uncertainly about exactly what we must prepare for. In a
wider sense, this is not unusual, because dealing with an uncertain
future is just another expression of risk-taking. This is the banks'
business.

Banks must prepare themselves well and in good time for monetary union.
They must review their place in a monetary area that is caught up in a
process of convergence and explore the strategic options offered by a
large economic area with a single currency. Now that the single
European market has prompted them to reshape their business strategies
for Europe, financial institutions have to work out the implications of
the single currency for their own houses.

First, banks must adjust to a new authority in the field of monetary
policy - the European Central Bank - and to a different set of monetary
policy instruments. The heterogeneous national instruments we have
known are being unified and will be subject to unified handling as
well. Many familiar national monetary policy instruments may now
decline in importance.

Again, banks will have to examine the possible impact on their business
policies, specifically in the areas of liabilities management, currency
trading and securities.

The range of money market products is likely to converge EU-wide. Here,
banks will have to do some thinking, above all about the associated
rise in the costs of refunding as markets become more transparent.

Currency trading in future will centre round three main currencies (the
Eurocurrency, dollar and yen), and this reduction in the number of
currencies and the cessation of currency risks will mean a loss of
business for banks in the areas of money changing, hedging, swap deals
and arbitrage operations.

Monetary union will also have an impact on the securities business,
involving a far-reaching convergence of interest rates in the member
countries. This effect is already leading to portfolio shake-up in the
run-up to monetary union, and that is adding considerably to the
counselling needs of private and corporate customers.

Credit institutions must also adjust to meet technical requirements,
most of all in the areas of organisation and data processing, payments
and accounting. The introduction of a common European currency will
inevitably entail converting all accounts and all balance sheet items
to the new currency unit. Banks' software, too, must be converted - all
the way from their own accounting systems, via customer databases, to
electronic cash and voucher dispensing systems. All systems in the
areas of deposits, credit and securities must be adjusted.

The transition to new bank notes and coins will call for a huge
logistic effort. In payments, too, customers and banks must tackle the
conversion of all systems: from SWIFT and inter-bank payment systems,
automatic bulk transfers and payments, all the way to the electronic
links between banks and their corporate customers.

Banks would be adopting too shortsighted an approach if they only saw
the costs and drawbacks of monetary union. We must not lose sight of
the opportunities and the earnings potential for an agile institution
that is being created.

The best practical example is the US. Americans use one currency in a
country, which is in some ways more heterogeneous than the group of
European countries that will form EMU. No-one in the US would even
think of using more than one currency when travelling from New York to
Miami or to Los Angeles or doing business there.

Demands that transition to monetary union be managed without so-called
'competitive distortions' in the financial sector have entered the
debate with little challenge. Europe is all about competition, and
competition does not become distorted if some are seen as likely to
perform better than others.

The field of competition among banks will be service for customers who
will require products in the new Eurocurrency. Should some banks be
able to offer their new products better, faster and cheaper than their
competitors, then this is the kind of competition which is designed to
make Europe more productive. It is the mainstay of the single market.

INVESTMENT BANKING: A PURSE IN A WALLET

The cashless society may be some years away, but an increasing number
of schemes are trying to bring it closer.

In Europe, one of the most interesting is Mondex, based on a smart card
which is being tested in the UK town of Swindon by two clearing banks,
National Westminster and the Midland Bank. The CSFI recently invited
the project managers to describe its progress and discuss the
implications.

The heart of Mondex is a silicon chip embedded in a plastic card which
can be loaded with electronic cash from the holder's bank account via a
special terminal attached to a conventional telephone. It thus becomes
a 'purse' whose contents can be spent through terminals in shops (or
even transferred to other cards).

The transaction is authorised by the holder's PIN and takes only a few
seconds. Each card has an 'originator', which would have to be an
institution approved by the banking authorities, to bring the card
within the bounds of monetary control.

According to Mondex's promoters, the advantages of the card for the
consumer are its convenience, control and security (cards are
'lockable'), though anyone who loses their card would also lose the
money on it if they were uninsured. It also enables the holder to
withdraw 'cash' from his or her bank account from the comfort of their
home - something that home banking cannot do. For the retailer, the
benefits are better cost management, security, and the possibility for
value-added functions such as customer loyalty schemes.

The Swindon experiment went live in July with 1,000 consumers. There
are now over 8,000. More than 700 retailers, or 70 % of the total, had
signed up, car parks had been added, and buses would join soon. Mondex
payphones have now been installed on most street corners, and
cardholders can obtain cash through them 24 hours a day. This provides
the 'missing link' of home banking. There are now 50 payphones, rising
to 300, plus 1,000 in private homes.

About pounds 500,000 changed hands over Mondex in the first five
months, or some pounds 25,000 a week, which the promoters said was very
satisfactory even though it only amounts to pounds 3 per cardholder a
week.

The aim behind Mondex is to make it practical for everyday
transactions, even buying a bus ticket or a newspaper, which means
driving down the cost of producing it and running the system.

The aim was also to make Mondex 'democratic' - or separate it from
considerations of credit standing. Anyone should be able to have a
Mondex because it need not even be linked to a bank account. You could
buy a fully charged card in a store and give it to someone as a gift.
However, the facility to charge the card from your bank account would
be subject to status, and would cost money, about pounds 1.50 a month.

The sense of the CSFI meeting was that Mondex could bring clear
advantages to the retailer through improved cash management, but it was
less obvious how the consumer would benefit. They would have the cost
and bother of managing their cards, essentially to make transactions
which could more easily be done with cash. Unless it replaced cash
completely, Mondex would become yet another piece of plastic to keep in
an already crowded wallet.

Also, for larger purchases, the consumers would still do better to use
their credit card and enjoy the interest-free credit period, so if
Mondex had a future, it would have to be in the small transaction end
of the market.

Some participants were worried about the potential for money laundering
on Mondex cards. Could they not be used to spirit money out of shady
accounts? The money could not be 'tagged' in the way that numbered
banknotes are.

The scheme also has potentially profound implications for banks if
'originators' can be non-banks. This means that a whole sector of the
cash economy could operate without the help of banks. And there is no
reason why originators should be banks, though Mondex is in close touch
with the Bank of England over how 'originators' should be defined and
authorised.

Mondex's backers intend to run the Swindon experiment for another year
or two before deciding on a national roll-out. NatWest will not say how
many customers it will need to turn Mondex into a profit-making
proposition. What is important, it says, is to see if Mondex works, and
how it can be turned into a money spinner.

INVESTMENT BANKING: CATS THAT GOT THE CREAM

The right people, the right place, the right time - that sums up the
experience of the leading players in international mergers and
acquisitions work based in London in 1995.

It was the year when the big investment in M&A professionals made in
particular by the US investment banks over the last five years paid
dividends - and bonuses.

The boom in cross-border and other international M&A was only part of
the story: the volume of domestic transactions in the US and the UK
also soared.

As a result, fees from M&A received uncharacteristically prominent
mentions in the year-end statements of a number of the investment
banks.

At Lehman Brothers, chairman and chief executive Richard S. Fuld Jr
reported that fourth quarter 'merger and aquisition fees increased 50%'
compared with the same period of 1994. At both Morgan Stanley and JP
Morgan, merger advisory work got more than a passing reference.

Some idea of the scale of the increase in international work can be
gleaned from our tables. In 1994, the top 10 firms in cross-border work
racked up a combined dollars 104 billion worth of deals. In 1995, the
equivalent figure was dollars 215 billion. In both cases the figures
include some double counting, since as many as four or five advisers
may get credit for the same deal. Nevertheless, the trend is sharply
upwards.

For confirmation, look no further than the table of cross-border deals
worth dollars 1 billion or more (see page 18).

In 1994, The Banker tracked 27 such deals (either announced or
completed during the year) worth a combined dollars 52 billion. Last
year there were 39 deals in the same category, worth more than dollars
95 billion.

The big question is: can the boom last? Are there fundamental factors
at work that will continue to drive the world's big corporates into
each others' arms? Is the consolidation ongoing, or has it run its
course? Is the merger boom just a by-product of falling world interest
rates combined with the extended bull run in US and, to a lesser
extent, UK equities? The surge in takeover volumes in 1995 provokes
tempting comparisons with the previous boom at the end of the 1980s.

In the UK, according to figures from stockbrokers James Capel, the
value of deals announced or completed topped the pounds 41 billion mark
last year - or roughly twice the previous record year, 1989.

A similar pattern is apparent in the US, thanks mainly to an explosion
in multi-billion dollar bank mergers last year.

One leading investment banker in London points out that the bare
statistics reflect accidents of timing. 'If you look at UK transactions
last year the numbers are influenced by a couple of very large
transactions. I tend to think of deals happening on a much more
consistent basis. If you plot the activity over the longer term, the
trend is a lot smoother than the data suggests.'

That said, he also confirms that current business levels are way up on
those for the same period a year ago. 'If you look at our existing
backlog of transactions - projects on which terms are either agreed or
where there is a better than 50% chance of success - the total today is
already equivalent to about 60% of what we completed in 1995.' The
normal backlog is between 20% and 30% of a year's business.

One thing is certain. The deals done in 1995 were of a different order
to those done in the last boom.

In the peak year of 1989 the name of the game was leverage. The two big
deals of the year were the dollars 29.6 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco
by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) and Sir James Goldsmith's unsuccessful
dollars 21 billion offer for Britain's tobacco giant BAT Industries.

There was unlimited cash available to fund almost any big proposition -
or there was until the banks turned their backs on the proposed buyout
at United Airlines, Washington and the US courts got obstructive, and
the junk bond boom collapsed.

'Compared to the last boom cycle, this one is a lot less financially
motivated and much more strategically driven,' says Ed Annunziato, head
of international M&A at Merrill Lynch (whose cross-border deal volumes
placed the firm just outside the top ten in The Banker's league tables
last year).

'The strategic push is coming as a result of big changes in a handful
of industries. Regulatory change, technological change and cost
pressures associated with one or both - these have been important
drivers in the growth of M&A activity.'

But not the only ones. As important has been the need to squeeze out
the scale economies necessary if a business is to compete globally.

'We saw unprecedented levels of activity last year - almost a feeding
frenzy,' says Jim Downing, managing director and co-head of corporate
finance at Lehman Brothers in London. 'That was partly driven by the
desire to create global positioning on the part of big businesses. But
there was also a defensive quality to it: if your competitor takes out
one of the few remaining targets you can't afford to sit back and
watch.'

Having spent the first half of the 1990s streamlining their operations,
many big corporates are having to live with the prospect of limited
growth, he argues.

The answer is to acquire it. For those acquisitions, 'companies have
been focusing on those sectors where they're choosing to be global
businesses,' says Downing. 'And, in contrast to the 1980s, they're
doing it in a very targeted and surgical way.'

The ready availability of cheap money has played its part, too, he
accepts.

But, again, comparisons with 1989 would be misleading. Having rebuilt
their balance sheets over the course of the 1990s, UK companies, for
instance, are funding deals not from funny money but from internally
generated cash, or from justifiable bank borrowing.

According to the James Capel analysis, two-thirds of the consideration
paid in UK takeovers last year was in the form of cash. Buying other
businesses is a better bet than sticking the cash on deposit.

So long as interest rates remain low by historical standards, activity
on the part of UK companies will remain high, predicts Piers von
Simson, a managing director at SBC Warburg.

'Our projections envisage the generation of very substantial cash
surpluses in corporate UK this year,' he says, 'particularly in what
might broadly be defined as the consumer and service groups.'

Companies such as Tesco, Marks & Spencer and Reuters are generating
huge amounts of cash, he points out. 'The combined Glaxo Wellcome may
be highly geared at present, but the potential cash generation over the
next couple of years tops pounds 2 billion.'

The importance of the UK's contribution to Europe-wide M&A activity
cannot be overstated, says Klaus Diederichs, co-head of M&A for JP
Morgan in Europe. 'Eight out of every 10 big deals had a UK component
last year.

France was in second place, but a long way behind.'

Diederichs sees a number of risks in predicting another record year for
the international M&A business.

'First, if equity markets take a tumble, that will dent confidence.
When confidence goes, deals don't close. Second, there is a danger that
prices get driven too high. Third, there is a limit as to how many more
deals can be done in the most active sectors.

'For instance, a year ago there were 12 independent regional
electricity companies (RECs) in Britain; now there are just five.' For
these reasons, Morgan's team is working on the assumption that total
market volumes in the UK could fall by anything up to 20% in 1996.

CSFB professes itself similarly cautious. Stephen Hester, co-head of
investment banking in London, says 'our internal budgets suggest a 15%
decline in the market as a whole - but that would still leave 1996 the
second most active year in history.'

His concern is that M&A activity tends to peak when the economic cycle
is at or just past its peak. With the cycle turning down across much of
Europe, it is more than possible that M&A activity will turn down with
it.

One thing is certain: the outlook hangs crucially on three key
industries which generated a disproportionate amount of work for M&A
specialists in 1995. They are finance, pharmaceuticals and the world of
telecommunications and media.

No fewer than 23 of our 39 dollars 1 billion-plus deals fit into these
these sectors. 'In terms of those industries,' says Merrill's
Annunziato, 'there is going to be a lot more of the same - though in
pharmaceuticals the restructuring is clearly further advanced than in
the other two sectors. As far as financial institutions and the
telecoms/media sectors are concerned, the restructuring could last
another ten years. Certainly, in US banking, it's not remotely close to
being over.'

The deal lists of the leading investment banks bear testimony to the
frenetic activity in those three sectors over the past year.

In US banking, the size and value of deals expanded sharply,
culminating in the first big hostile takeover bid - Wells Fargo's
dollars 10 billion offer for First Interstate.

There are still 11,000 banks in the US, and plenty of scope for the
deal-makers to be creative. But the process is not confined to the US.

In Europe, for instance, CSFB was involved in 27 banking or insurance-
related deals last year (either completed or pending) and acted for
financial institutions in France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Italy,
Germany, Austria, Spain and the UK. The consolidation of banks in Italy
and Scandinavia is proving a fruitful source of income for several of
the M&A specialists.

So too is the gradual sell-off of Credit Lyonnais' peripheral assets,
some of them banking outposts, others non-bank assets.

Neither of the two investment banks responsible for putting together
the restructuring of some dollars 26 billion worth of CL assets - now
placed into the Consortium de Realisations (CDR) - gets credit in our
league tables for a deal that will take 20 years to complete: Paribas
acted for the French government, Lazard Freres Paris for CL.

But hunting down buyers for the various assets is proving a lucrative
occupation for most of the players in our tables. CSFB sold off Banque
Colbert's regional operations in France to Financiere Meeschaert, its
Paris-based asset management operations to NatWest and its Luxembourg
offshoot to Staal Bankiers, an offshoot of the Dutch Achmea Holding.

Merrill sold CL's Peruvian and Chilean operations (to Banca Commerciale
Italiana and Dresdner respectively) and JP Morgan advised CL Bank
Nederland on its sale to Generale de Banque. Warburg found buyers for
the CL-owned MGM cinema chains in Britain and the Netherlands.

The prospect of more big banking takeovers in the US looks a racing
certainty. But what about Europe?

Morgan Stanley's head of European investment banking operations, John
Studzinski, comments: 'If you look at the UK, there is both
demutualisation and the consolidation of retail services in progress.'
There is also plenty of scope for deals around Europe. 'The conclusion
must be that the process of integration will continue.'

Much the same can be said about the pharmaceuticals industry, where
Morgan Stanley had a hand in the year's two biggest cross-border deals
(acting for Marion Merrell Dow in its takeover by Hoechst of Germany
and for Sweden's Pharmacia in its dollars 13 billion merger with Upjohn
of the US).

It also acted for Chiron of the US in its dollars 2 billion tie-up with
Switzerland's Ciba-Geigy. Says Studzinski: 'There are at least three or
four more consolidations of a similar size to take place in the
industry. The only question is when they will happen.'

In the telecoms and media sectors it was the Lazard houses that put in
the most impressive performance, racking up a string of big deals. The
four it did for MCI Communications Corporation and the one for Seagrams
(the takeover of Hollywood studios group MCA) were alone worth a
combined dollars 10 billion.

Goldman, which acted for the Japanese vendor in the MCA sale, also did
its share of big deals in this area and Reimers is in no doubt there is
more to come.

Lehman's Downing points out the bulk of the media and telecoms deals
have been in the US: 'There is scope for a lot more consolidation in
Europe.' One-off factors were nonetheless apparent in one sector last
year. That was UK utilities, and especially the RECs.

Again Goldman did well, thanks to its acknowledged role as a defence
adviser, picking up four advisory mandates. While there may still be
some unfinished business, there is a finite number of deals to be done.

'There may be more consolidation to come, though lots of companies
appear to be running into domestic monopoly constraints,' says SBC
Warburg's von Simson. The firm acted for America's Southern Electric in
its successful bid for SWEB.

One counterbalancing factor that could sustain UK takeover activity -
particularly in the utility sector - is the threat of a Labour election
victory in a year or so's time.

'If you are an international strategist, the pressure is probably on
you to slip a UK deal in before the election,' says von Simson. 'Under
Labour, the onus is likely to be on the buyer to prove that a deal is a
good thing, rather than on the regulator to show there is nothing
damaging to it.' Be that as it may, M&A specialists expect to see
continental Europe pick up the baton. 'In 1996 you're more likely to
see a restructuring among utilities in Germany, Spain and Italy,'
predicts Morgan Stanley's Studzinski. Merrill's Annunziato agrees.

'German utilities have traditionally been conglomerate-owned. Deals are
likely as part of the refocusing of industry generally.' Or so
investment bankers would like to believe. The trouble is, the long
mooted 'deconglomeratisation' of Germany is proving a patchy affair.

Hoechst and Viag have both shown a willingness to prune peripheral
businesses, but few other German corporates have followed them.

One reason for this is that anti-avoidance provisions in the German tax
statutes could penalise a vendor if 10% or more of a demerged company's
shares subsequently change hands within a short space of time -
something that is highly likely if the demerged company is publicly
floated.

Von Simson argues that this ruling tends to be used as an excuse for
inaction by German industrialists.

'European Union members have all signed up to the concept of tax-free
demergers. I suspect that, if enough pressure were applied, the
legislation might be clarified or the tax authorities might give a
ruling that the anti-avoidance provisions did not apply.

'Pressure from the international investment community will translate
into action sooner or later. There will be disposals that have the
effect of deconglomeratising German industry - though perhaps not a
direct demerger along the lines of ICI/Zeneca.'

CSFB's Hester agrees. It is all part of what he sees as a long-term
trend: the 'Anglo-Saxonisation of continental Europe'. The impact of
new takeover codes, the harmonisation of accounting standards, the
appearance of international investors on local share registers - all of
this is helping to cement a change of attitude. The upturn in European
M&A activity last year looks no fluke.

But it will still take an enormous acceleration in the process to
compensate for a slowdown in UK merger activity - were that to happen
this year.

Morgan's Diederichs points to the fact that the value of French and
German deals combined last year was no more than a quarter of the total
recorded in the UK. 'If the pace of activity in the UK falters,
continental Europe cannot take up the slack,' he argues.

The caveat is well taken; and few of the main players in this game are
prepared to look beyond the next three months. But, right now, they
simply cannot believe their luck.

INVESTMENT BANKING: DIG DEEP FOR DEBT

In January, in what looked like a last act of desperation, Eurotunnel,
the crisis-stricken operator of the Channel tunnel, called on the UK
and French governments to guarantee a substantial bond issue to help
refinance its pounds 7.8 billion (dollars 11.8 billion) debt. The plan
proposed that the bond issue would involve a 'zero coupon' structure in
which there would be low or no interest payments for about 10 years.

But, far from being a miracle cure for the Chunnel operator's financial
difficulties, a closer look at the proposal showed it would merely
delay the pain and add to the company's bulging interest bill. Both the
French and the UK governments swiftly ruled out the plan.

The move follows Eurotunnel's announcement in September that it had
suspended interest payments on its debt mountain and was starting
negotiations with its banks to rearrange its finances. Eurotunnel's
four agent banks - National Westminster, Midland Bank, Banque Nationale
de Paris and Credit Lyonnais - were to report to the rest of the
banking syndicate, comprising 225 members, mainly UK, French and
Japanese banks, by 17 March.

Until then, both sides were bound by a pact of secrecy from commenting
publicly on the negotiations.

Traders and brokers in the UK and European corporate debt market will
have been watching keenly. Promising a record-breaking restructuring,
Eurotunnel's plight could provide a feast for the UK distressed debt
market.

The crisis comes when the UK market is facing a famine in the supply of
new names to trade, as the recovery of the UK economy continues. Many
UK companies which have been big debt trading situations are having
their difficulties resolved or recovering, for example, GPA and
Cordiant (Saatchi and Saatchi), while prospects for resolution for
others in the coming year are brightening, for example, Signet and
Somerfield.

While traders have been talking for some time about the possibilities,
and hindrances, for a market to develop in continental European
countries, the dwindling supply in the UK, barring Eurotunnel, may give
extra impetus to their efforts there and in trading of UK near-par,
good quality loans. Some are looking further afield, to the Far East
and Latin America.

But while Eurotunnel debt and derivatives of debt could prove to be a
bonanza for the corporate debt trading market, some traders admit to a
worry that the market could be swamped by big pieces of debt looking
for a home, which would depress the price. Few banks are willing to
sell at the mid-January price of around 37 pence in the pound, but an
upward move in the price is likely to provoke more trading.

Tony Tucker, senior director of Bank of America in London, argues that
Eurotunnel is big enough and diverse enough that the 'primary
principles of demand and sources of supply could work,' bringing about
an equilibrium in supply and demand.

Despite the uncertain outlook for the UK market, in 1995 volumes in UK
and European distressed and impaired loans appear to have continued to
increase, but estimates vary widely.

Bank of America estimates dollars 10 billion for 1995, up from about
dollars 6.5 billion in 1994. Of this dollars 10 billion, Tucker
explains that debt sales by original lenders in regularly quoted names
such as GPA account for about one third; other original sales account
for about another one third; while retrades among participants account
for the remaining third.

Other estimates are more modest. Don Pollard and David Newport, vice-
presidents of Citibank, estimate around dollars 8 billion was traded in
1995, including retrades.

Richard Brennan, director of international loan sales and trading at
Merrill Lynch, estimates only about dollars 2 billion of original debt
was traded in 1995, and says the original debt can trade as much as 10
to 15 times.

The increased volume reflects the greater number of traders and
investors in the market. There are now at least 10-12 serious
participants which have each committed capital of around dollars 100-
250 million and people to the market, points out Tucker. These have
brought more liquidity and competition to the market, and spreads in
the more liquid names have narrowed.

Besides these new players, two inter-dealer brokers have also entered
in the last year to 18 months, Patriot Securities in New York and
Canter Fitzgerald, which only deal with dealers, enabling them to
retain their anonymity until the deal is done. Pollard and Newport
observe that longer term local investors, mostly foreign banks in the
UK, have moved into the UK market, such as Standard Bank, Banco
Santander, West Merchant Bank and ING Bank, as well as some of the UK
clearing banks.

They have seen a flow from the US 'vulture' type high-yield investors,
to these local investors, which are looking for less risky plays and
are willing to make more moderate returns. This trend has provided US-
based investors with buyers for debt bought earlier in the
restructuring cycle.

'We probably do about half of our trades into local buyers, whereas the
year before we probably did about 80% of our trades back into US
buyers,' says Pollard.

In 1995, Brennan of Merrill Lynch noticed a growing acceptance of the
market as a viable way of managing the risk contained in a bank's
portfolio of assets by a number of UK clearing banks, which have become
actively involved both on the buy and sell side. Tucker adds that
portfolio analysis is exerting a growing influence on banks' management
of loans.

A notable exception is Barclays Bank, which has not bought or sold any
of its impaired debt. Terry Bond, lending services director, explains
that the bank has been a strong supporter of the Bank of England's
informal philosophy on financial workouts, the London Approach, which
aims to create and maintain stability during a workout. Barclays has
been anxious to continue to give a lead in stability, says Bond.

On the effect of debt trading on a standstill and financial
reconstruction, he says: 'We still have a sense of nervousness'. The
bank would also like to see how the market develops before it positions
itself as a player.

However, given the right circumstances, it might in the future consider
debt trading as an option. 'We have seen the emergence of a large
number of responsible players in the market. There isn't necessarily a
free for all which some people feared might happen; and if you have a
responsible market then it's something that you can actually learn to
live with,' Bond comments.

A fertile source of original distressed debt has been the debt-ridden
Japanese banks, which have been coming into the market more in 1995,
driven by a need and desire politically and commercially to clean up
their balance sheets, says Tucker. Pressure from the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and the Bank of Japan (central bank) for more realism on
their balance sheets, along with the Daiwa scandal and the admission
that some of the housing loan subsidiaries were under water, is forcing
the Japanese banks to look to write off as much of their bad debts as
possible at their fiscal year end in March 1996.

Many of the Japanese banks have sold out of GPA, Signet, Somerfield and
Isosceles, says Tucker, but not yet out of Eurotunnel. Leading Japanese
banks, which have almost dollars 2 billion in outstanding loans to
Eurotunnel, were reported in January to have said that they had no
plans for an early disposal of them.

It is estimated that the Japanese banks have sold more than half of
their European distressed debt, excluding Eurotunnel, over the past
three years.

In October, a series of damaging revelations, including the Daiwa
scandal, led to a premium being put on lending to Japanese banks, which
increased their cost of capital and was the catalyst for some of them
to sell thinner-priced, near par loans.

Traders have had mixed success at tackling the potential of continental
Europe. Bank of America sees France as a growing area: it opened an
adjunct office in France in 1995 and has traded the debt of all but one
of the French companies named in its price list.

These include: Air France Partners Leasing; Aluminium Dunkerque, the
aluminium smelting company partly owned by Pechiney; Groupe Bull, the
partially privatised computer company; and Orlyval, the tunnel between
Orly and Paris. There are plenty of obstacles to trading in French
loans, however, particularly when real estate or secured mortgage or
security of assets are involved, which are difficult and expensive to
transfer under French law. Bank of America has traded a Spanish credit,
but has not done any trading in German company debt.

Large syndicate deals such as Aluminium Dunkerque are unusual on the
Continent; 'club deals', involving a smaller number of banks than in a
syndication, are more common in continental Europe than in the UK.
There are also many bilateral deals, where a company has a separate
contract with each bank, for example, in Germany, which accounts for
the difficulty of trading there, says Tucker.

Pollard and Newport of Citibank observe that the UK and European market
has followed their expectations in all respects except one: trading has
been slower to take off in Europe than they envisaged. 'The market has
not performed as expected with respect to geographic diversity,' they
comment.

While France seems to be the next area, they admit that they have not
seen the holders of French loans prepared to accept what they think is
fair price. Of Germany, Pollard comments: 'The German banks seem to be
reluctant to let the loans go'.

Traders have also been eyeing with a certain relish recent banking
debacles for debt trading opportunities, such as Credit Lyonnais, Daiwa
Bank and Banco di Napoli of Italy, which are under pressure to reduce
their size.

But, so far, the few deals done have been to other members of the
lending syndicates in these names, rather than through intermediaries,
because of a reluctance to sell loans at less than par. Tucker of Bank
America admits: 'There is a frustration because we have put a huge
amount of effort into it.' The hope is that new management or stronger
directives from government will force these banks to take the hit and
to sell the loans at a discount.

Looking ahead to 1996, Tucker expects distressed volumes to flatten out
next year, while Pollard and Newport expect the volumes to be flat or
even down.

Besides Eurotunnel, a rare potential new big name at the start of 1996
was Trafalgar House, the troubled property company, but the jury was
still out on whether it would go into a restructuring.

Brennan of Merrill Lynch still sees plenty of opportunities, for
example, in convertibles and pure bonds: 'It may not be bank debt; it
may be other portions of the capital structure that will be traded.'
Pollard and Newport are planning to spend more of their time this year
trying to buy into situations on the Continent and are also hopeful
that the near-par market will continue to develop.

Some traders, undaunted by limited opportunities closer to home, are
looking even further afield to the Far East and Latin America. Bank of
America, for example, has been looking around Hongkong and Singapore.
In these countries bank debt is still quite healthy at the moment,
because yields are high and maturities are short, but Tucker believes
that sooner or later there is bound to be an oversupply.

He also sees potential in Thai, Korean and Indonesian debt. At the
moment he thinks Asian convertibles are interesting. He predicts that
'South East Asia could be half again the size of the UK and European
market in the next three to five years.'

For the more fearless, China is also potentially an enormous, but
complicated, market. In Latin America, Mexico holds potential because
of the numbers of defaults, but again is only for the more aggressive
brokers and traders with a high risk to return profile. It promises to
be a challenging ride for traders and investors.

INVESTMENT BANKING: GO FOR THE GILT

Two recent developments in the London financial markets have increased
investor awareness of money market funds as a viable alternative for
the management of short-term cash reserves.

The collapse of Barings almost one year ago sparked a debate among
financial institutions concerned about the safety of their overnight
cash balances.

Asset managers, pension fund administrators, corporate directors and
other fiduciaries have begun to question traditional deposit
arrangements which potentially expose their cash to a significant level
of credit risk.

The second development supporting increased interest in money market
funds is the introduction at the beginning of this year of an open
market in gilt (UK government securities)repos.

The emergence of a broad-based gilt repo market will provide money fund
managers with a fully collateralised instrument which will greatly
enhance their ability to meet investor liquidity needs.

A money market fund is essentially a stand-alone investment vehicle
operated much like other collective investment schemes. The fund is
invested in a diversified portfolio of high-grade short-term
instruments with the objective of protecting the principal value of
investor capital while providing liquidity and a reasonable level of
current income.

Money market funds are typically subject to regulatory controls
designed to protect principal value, including minimum quality
thresholds for investment, minimum diversification requirements and
maximum maturity levels both for instruments held by a fund and for the
fund's portfolio as a whole.

There are important differences between money market funds and
traditional bank deposits. A money market fund's assets are invested
solely for the benefit of its investors. Management is provided by an
outside investment adviser which is paid a fee for this service but the
fund receives the full benefit of the income earned net of this fee.

Banks, by comparison, are in the business of re-investing their
customers' deposits. A bank may charge a fee for specific cash
management services but this fee is in addition to the favourable
spread which the bank earns on the deposits themselves.

A second difference between a money market fund and a bank deposit is
that the fund is structured to separate completely asset management
from asset custody. Unlike a bank which accepts deposits from its
customers, the manager of a money market fund does not itself receive
or hold investor funds. All of the fund's assets are separately held in
a segregated account at a custodian bank where they are 'ring-fenced'
against claims of the bank's creditors.

The manager's job is to direct the day-to-day investment of these
assets in accordance with the investment objectives and policies set
forth in the fund's prospectus furnished to investors.

The most important distinction between money market funds and bank
deposits is that investors in a money fund receive the benefits of an
actively managed portfolio.

A bank deposit requires the commitment of investor monies for a set
period of time in order to earn a quoted rate of return. By contrast, a
money market fund pools investor subscriptions and actively manages the
pool to provide both daily liquidity and a market rate of return. An
actively managed portfolio is continuously invested in a variety of
high-grade short-term instruments selected by the manager to achieve
the fund's objectives. Through active management a money market fund in
effect 'securitises' its investors' cash.

In the US money market funds have achieved broad acceptance as a
valuable cash management tool for both institutional and individual
investors. Total net assets of money funds are now more than dollars
750 billion, with annual sales in excess of dollars 2 trillion.
Approximately 48% of money market fund assets are held for benefit of
institutions such as retirement plans, corporations, foundations and
charities, and a variety of fiduciary accounts.

In the US banks are major investors in money market funds and often
serve, through non-bank affiliates, as sponsors and advisers to funds.
Money market funds have also become accepted cash management vehicles
in other countries, notably France, where money market fund assets now
total in excess of dollars 250 billion, and Germany, where money funds
were first permitted in 1994 and have already attracted considerable
interest.

A money market fund industry has not developed in the UK quite simply
because, until now, there has been no need for one.

The establishment and growth of money funds in the US was in direct
response to a series of developments within the banking community in
the 1970s and early 1980s when regulatory limits on the level of
interest that could be paid by banks prevented them from giving
depositors market rates of return.

This period also witnessed the failure of a number of prominent banking
and savings institutions. Money market funds were created in response
to investor demand for a safe alternative that could provide
competitive returns.

Recent developments in the UK financial markets, though perhaps not as
dramatic as the events giving rise to the US money fund industry, are
nevertheless significant and could fuel a demand for money market funds
in the UK. The increased acceptance of such funds in major European
markets should also stimulate the use of money market funds by UK
institutions.

The collapse of Barings needs to be placed in context. It is important
to emphasise that Barings did nothing fundamentally wrong in the way it
handled its investors' overnight cash. Barings' decision to place
approximately pounds 500 million of such cash on deposit with its
affiliate bank conformed to the cash management practices of other
asset managers.

The problem was more systemic. Unlike securities held for its
customers, which were properly 'ring-fenced', overnight cash deposited
with the bank was reflected on its balance sheet as an unsecured asset
subject to the claims of creditors. When Barings failed it was only by
virtue of the ING acquisition that investors avoided a total loss of
their overnight cash then on deposit with the bank.

In the wake of Barings' collapse market participants have searched for
alternative solutions. As a 'stopgap' remedy UK asset managers and
other fiduciaries early last year began diversifying their deposits by
taking cash balances away from single institutions with which they
enjoyed an affiliation or other longstanding relationship and by
spreading those assets among a number of high quality banks.

Diversification clearly reduces the extent of exposure but it does not
address the core credit risk issues. There is also the problem of
locating a sufficient number of high-grade institutions to ensure an
adequate level of diversification.

Money market funds take a different approach to diversification and in
the process substantially reduce credit risk exposure. By investing
assets in a range of money market securities such as repos and
commercial paper, investor cash is 'securitised' and thereby
effectively protected against any potential creditor claims that might
otherwise be asserted.

Within a money fund credit risk is addressed as an investment matter
through proper portfolio diversification and compliance with minimum
quality guidelines. By carefully managing its portfolio maturities a
money market fund provides its investors with both overnight cash
liquidity and a market rate of return. In this way the fund serves as
an effective substitute for traditional bank deposit arrangements
without exposing investors to any significant degree of credit risk.

To work effectively money market funds must have access to a range of
investment vehicles that will enable them to achieve their safety,
liquidity and yield objectives. A key issue for a money market fund is
the ability to obtain overnight liquidity for a significant portion of
its assets in order to meet redemption requests of its investors.

In the US, as well as in France and Germany, liquidity has been
provided to market participants through a broad-based and highly liquid
'repo' market. A repo, or repurchase agreement, involves the short-term
(including overnight) sale of securities to a cash provider such as a
money market fund, coupled with a commitment to repurchase the
securities at an agreed-upon time and price, thereby determining the
yield during the purchaser's holding period.

Repos constitute among the lowest risk means of improving short-term
yields as the lender or buyer of repo can take advantage of both the
credit worthiness of its counterparties (the sellers of repo) and the
availability of high quality 'collateral,' which are the repo-ed
securities. In the US more than dollars 1trillion of repos is traded
each day. In the European repo markets, centred in London, annual net
purchases of repos had increased to a level of over dollars 7.3 billion
by the end of 1994.

From 2 January of this year there are no longer any official
restrictions on anyone repoing or lending and borrowing gilts, either
directly or indirectly through intermediaries. The removal of these
restrictions means that investors may now freely use gilt repo to
invest their cash balances.

As of mid-January, open market trading in gilt repos had not yet
resulted in a fully liquid repo market as participants and their
advisers were still working to resolve some lingering systems and
documentation issues. Yet it is probably safe to say at this early date
that there is widespread interest in the development of the repo market
as a short-term investment alternative.

If money market funds are to achieve the safe and liquid goals of their
shareholders it will be essential that a broad-based gilt repo market
becomes established. In advance of this development the alternatives
for money fund portfolios are to hold time deposits of a number of
highly rated banks, to invest in commercial paper of high-grade
corporate issuers and to engage in other strategies such as short-term
fully hedged swaps into liquid instruments denominated in other
currencies.

Thus far only a handful of sterling denominated money market funds have
been launched, and these have endeavoured to preserve maximum
flexibility in their investment programmes. Most have not been able to
assure investors of absolute liquidity, or 'same day' settlement on
redemption of their fund shares. The advent of gilt repo, therefore, is
an important step in the future development of actively managed money
market funds designed for UK institutional investors.

INVESTMENT BANKING: MOVE OVER

International bankers remain concerned about competition from the World
Bank's government-funded private sector finance arm, the International
Finance Corporation (IFC), for business which they consider could be
handled by private sector banks.

A report(1) last month from the Institute of International Finance
(IIF), the Washington-based group representing nearly 200 private
financial institutions from around the world, acknowledges that IFC has
taken on board the criticisms. But it argues that it should go further.

Last year IFC issued new guidelines on Collaboration with Private
International Financial Institutions. This is welcomed by IIF, which
emphasises the continuing 'strong interest of most private banks in
working in partnership with IFC'.

Nonetheless, IIF stresses the substantial change in the emerging
economies which, previously dependent on official financing, now
increasingly have access to commercial sources.

'Most of the private flows are .. concentrated in the more advanced
developing countries. These are the same countries where IFC is doing
most of its business. As a consequence, the potential for IFC
activities to displace services provided by private banks has increased
measurably.' Among nine recommendations for further action by IFC, the
report argues: 'IFC should adopt an active and transparent graduation
policy as part of a basic reorientation away from countries that have
access to international capital markets toward those that do not.
Generally, there should be a presumption that IFC will not support
transactions in countries designated as having substantial access to
international capital markets, especially transactions involving large,
well-known companies.' On underwriting; 'IFC should continue to limit
its underwriting of international securities to exceptional cases where
it is clear that the transaction cannot be completed without IFC's
presence.'

Pointing out that IFC has adopted a policy of not competing for
privatisation mandates awarded through bidding procedures, it argues
that a further step should be taken to 'adopt a policy of not competing
for any advisory mandates awarded through a bidding procedure.'

ITALY: LOSERS NOT CHOOSERS

When Banco di Napoli declared a 1995 half-year loss of L1,561 billion
(about dollars 1 billion) last autumn, it confirmed its capacity for
exploring the financial outer reaches. It had shocked markets earlier
in the year by declaring a loss of almost L1,000 billion for 1994, then
revised upwards to L1,147 billion.

Yet Banco di Napoli's awful performance should not have been a
surprise.

Other large southern banks had extended loss-making frontiers over
recent years, and Banco di Napoli operates in the same difficult
environment of the mezzogiorno's almost comatose economy and the
tenacious grip of politicial interference for which the south is
notorious.

The truth about the dismal quality of its loanbook could not be hidden
forever.

On its beam ends, the Neapolitan bank started 1996 in search of rescue.
It was thrown a line at the end of November, when the treasury ministry
and a group of banks agreed a L2,500 billion loan at market rates, a
move suggesting that the bank was suffering an awkward liquidity
shortage.

The loan only allows temporary respite, however, when what is needed is
radical restructuring both of its capital base and operations.

Indeed, a drastic re-shaping has been sought by Federico Pepe since his
appointment to the chief executive's hot seat last summer.

Heavy cuts are needed in the branch network, both to reduce losses and
slim assets. But this will not be enough, and a massive injection of
fresh capital, upwards of L3,000 billion, is also needed to put ratios
in order.

Though believed to enjoy central bank support, Pepe's plans have not
been taken on board by all fellow directors, some of whom have
vigorously opposed disposal of branches.

There is opposition also to dilution of the equity owned by the bank's
foundation. Seemingly unaware of the adage that losers cannot be
choosers, Neapolitan politicians want to continue controlling the bank
and calling the shots, and imagine that there are gullible white
knights ready to put their cash into a southern Italian bank that has
given no satisfaction to investors.

Banco di Napoli's shares were traded at L658 on 15 January, against a
1995/1996 high of L1,480.

A big headache for the supervisory authorities, as well as its
shareholders, Banco di Napoli is far from being the only problem in
Italian banking, however.

Associazione Bancaria Italiana (ABI, the Italian banking association)
published a review of the 1995 half-year results of a sample of 91
commercial banks, including all the major institutions, at the end of
last year.

The overall picture was gloomy. Although there was a slight increase in
interest margin for banks with nationwide operations, from 1.09% of
total assets in the first half of 1994 to 1.12% in the January to June
period last year, this is considered to have resulted from transitory
improvements in conditions.

Reviewing 1995's first-half results, Stefano Preda, professor of
economics at Milan's Bocconi University, noted that, faced by
difficulties in maintaining interest margins, many banks have tried to
boost earnings from services.

'Diversification is the typical strategic response to crisis in core
business. However, results do not at the moment seem comforting.' Preda
noted that Italy's banks have until now diversifed into sectors that
are similar to banking, mature and offering low margins and high risks.
He pointed to asset management where commissions of only L250 billion
were earned on more than L115,000 billion under management.

Preda considered that while Italy's banks must improve revenues, they
must also cut costs further. At more than L110 million, the average
annual cost per employee is far higher than in other sectors. The ratio
of operating costs to deposits and loans has been declining since 1991,
but this is not enough.

Fragmentation of the banking system prevents economies of scale.

'Concentration is the right path, and is obligatory in many cases where
size is insufficiently competitive,' said Preda.

ABI's figures show that while there was a general improvement in gross
operating results, and improvements in net profit for regional and
provincial banks, the large national banks' aggregate bottom line was
written in deep red.

Thanks to increased provisions and lower extraordinary gains, Italy's
large national banks showed an aggregate post-tax loss of L866 billion
in the first half of last year, compared with a profit of L445 billion
in the same period of 1994. Clearly Banco di Napoli's awesome losses
were influential, but other big banks hardly shone.

Even after booking L44 billion extraordinary gains, Credito Italiano
could report a post-tax end-of-June profit of only L91 billion (less
than dollars 60 million).

And while Istituto Bancario San Paolo di Torino showed a bottom line
surplus of L214 billion, it fell short of past achievements and what
might be expected of Italy's biggest bank.

Troubled Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS), whose former general manager
Vincenzo Pennarola is appealing through legal channels against his
dismissal in November, is another of Italy's faded banking glories.

It was able to report a half-year net profit of L77 billion (on total
assets of L100,174 billion) only thanks to booking L152 billion of
extraordinary gains.

And Milan's Cariplo, apparently still hopeful about making an initial
public offering of its shares, returned a half-year profit of L135
billion (on total assets of L131,271 billion) that is unlikely to
encourage queues of eager prospective shareholders.

There are no signs of joy at Banca di Roma either. Formed from the
merger of three unsparkling institutions (Banco di Roma, Banco di Santo
Spirito and Cassa di Risparmio di Roma) in the late 1980s and early
1990s, the bank has yet to shine.

Half-year profit of the bank (total assets of L153,665 billion) was a
meagre L53 billion. Moreove, the recent acquisitions of Banca
Mediterranea (L2 billion profit at 30 June) and Banca Nazionale
dell'Agricoltura (L17 billion loss) have done nothing to strengthen the
Rome bank.

Notwithstanding disappointing results and dodgy loan books, Italy's big
banks nevertheless seem to seek problems.

Perhaps it is because most (Cariplo, MPS, San Paolo, Banca di Roma and
the large southerners Banco di Napoli and Banco di Sicilia) still
belong firmly in the public sector.

That may also explain the apparent enthusiasm with which IMI (the
investment bank and financial services conglomerate), its three
controlling shareholders (Cariplo, San Paolo and MPS) and Banca di Roma
bought into the equity of the Mediaset television company owned by
former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi , in spite of enormous and
evident conflicts of interest.

At least Banco di Napoli was not among the banks which put up L400
billion to take a 6% stake in Mediaset at the end of December, though
its name does appear among the shareholders of Italy's TAV high speed
train project.

But that investment was made when the bank was reporting profits.
Survival is now the issue, rather than the collection of political
points that still seems to preoccupy many banks.

Professor Preda sees a trend that presents ample risks and a difficult
future if decisive structural intervention is not undertaken both in
individual banks and the system overall. Indeed, some bankers refer to
a crisis situation.

As Italian banking enters 1996, many questions remain unanswered, not
least, which of its members might go the way of Banco di Napoli.

FRANCE: PROFIT - OR LOSS

As expected, Paribas chief executive Andre Levy-Lang was officially
ified last December that he is under investigation by a French
magistrate looking into a case of falsified accounts at a Paribas
subsidiary, Ciments Francais.

This procedure, on which Paribas refuses to comment, allows the
magistrate to interrogate Levy-Lang. The magistrate is obviously trying
to determine if Paribas and its chief executive knew about the
falsified accounts, something that Paribas, which has instituted a
civil action in the case, has always denied.

Given the circumstances of the case it would seem highly unlikely that
Paribas was aware of the problem at Ciments Francais.

Perhaps the bigger question raised by the case is the degree to which a
holding company, like Paribas, can control its subsidiaries. And
whether a French holding company can control a French subsidiary - even
with five representatives on the board of directors of the subsidiary -
given the passive nature of boards in France vis a vis the executive
chairman. Ciments Francais' executive chairman, Pierre Conso, was a
respected member of the business community.

The case dates back to 1991 when one of Paribas' major shareholders,
the AXA insurance group, decided to get rid of its shares in Ciments
Francais, a cement group. After a bid Paribas ended up with 86% of the
group headed by Pierre Conso. Ciments Francais reported profits of
FF401 million (dollars 77.4 million) for 1991, a year when Paribas
posted a loss of FF200 million, the first in its history.

In April 1992, after trying unsuccessfully to fit the new activities in
with another industrial group, Paribas announced it was selling a
controlling shareholding of 54.7% of Ciments Francais to Italcementi,
part of the Pesenti family group, one of the most important family-held
groups in Italy.

The FF6.6 billion deal, arranged for the Pesenti by Mediobanca, made
Italcementi the largest cement company in Europe and the second largest
in the world.

In July 1992 Ciments Francais raised FF500 million in equity on the
market, guaranteed by Mediobanca and Paribas, both of which reportedly
ended up stuck with the paper.

At first this looked like hard luck but in the light of following
events was perhaps a stroke of good fortune since no big international
investors became mired in the deal.

In October 1992 an audit of Ciments Francais commissioned by
Italcementi uncovered FF2.7 billion in off balance-sheet activities
that had gone unreported in its official balance sheet and which
accounted for FF655 million of the FF740 million in losses for the
first semester of 1992. Conso was fired and later arrested.

Mediobanca, which has a small shareholding in Paribas, was infuriated.

Paribas deducted FF500 million from the purchase price and later took
off another FF325 million. It also took over some of the off balance-
sheet activities of Ciments Francais.

The FF800 million capital gain originally announced turned into a loss
for Paribas. A report ordered by the investigating magistrate concluded
that in 1991 Ciments Francais should have posted a FF120 million loss
instead of a profit.

One of the ironies in the story is that Giampiero Pesenti, head of
Italcementi, is also chairman of Gemina, the investment and financial
services group of Fiat, in which the Pesenti group as well as
Mediobanca also have shares.

The recent Mediobanca-concocted plan to merge the activities of Gemina
with the financial and industrial activities of the Ferruzzi group to
create a super-Gemina foundered, due to surprise losses at a Gemina
subsidiary, Rizzoli. This would have created the second largest group
in Italy after Fiat.

Now Gemina executives are under investigation for falsified accounts
and false corporate reporting. Paribas was to have taken a 5% stake in
the super-Gemina deal.

AUSTRIA: POST-UNION BLUES

Austria has a headache, or several. Sobered up after the excitement
which accompanied the overwhelming vote in the 1994 referendum in
favour of joining the European Union, the country is now coming to
terms with the implications of membership, a year after joining.

After the second election in just over a year, the once stable
political structure is in disarray.

The government still badly needs to tackle the budget deficit, the
issue which caused last year's breakdown of the ruling left/right
coalition.

The point has been made more urgent by commitment to meeting the
Maastricht criteria for membership of economic and monetary union
(EMU).

Rather than being marginalised as just a small country on the eastern
fringes of the EU, Austria aims to be a senior player in the big
league, while at the same time retaining a role as a gateway to the
emerging economies of central and eastern Europe. That objective is in
doubt.

A slowdown in economic growth is not helping. Nor is it providing a
promising background for the banks, already suffering in their home
market from slow loan growth and pressure on margins in a seriously
overbanked country.

Meanwhile, the political shenanigans have yet again put into abeyance
plans for privatisation of the government's stakes in the two biggest
banks. First in line is Creditanstalt, where the voting majority has
been up for grabs for nearly five years now; but the biggest, Bank
Austria, could also be affected.

That is one of the problems facing the new finance minister. Viktor
Klima, a Social Democrat (red) and former minister of transport, was
appointed by chancellor Franz Vranitzky (red) after Andreas Staribacher
resigned.

The move was widely welcomed in the banking sector as clearing the way
for another attempt at the planned privatisations and, possibly, for
sorting out the problems with the budget.

Staribacher, a tax consultant, had been brought in last April to
replace longserving (red) finance minister Ferdinand Lacina, who
stepped down after problems in negotiating the 1995 budget. (Last month
Lacina was named to succeed Herbert Lugmayr, who is retiring, as
chariman of GiroCredit, central clearing organisation for the savings
banks.)

Now the new finance minister faces the same problems as his
predecessors in 1996; the junior coalition partner, the People's Party
(black), has been pushing for cuts in the generous spending on social
security rather than tax increases.

The election in December had been brought on by the collapse of the
coalition over the budget argument after the People's Party's new
leader, Wolfgang Schussel, took a chance on improving the party's
representation in Parliament.

His gamble failed; the reds increased their seats from 65 to 72, the
blacks edged up from 52 to 53. The far right Freedom Party headed by
the populist Jorg Haider, which had previously been gaining ground and
challenging the established political set-up, stood still with 41 seats
against 42.

That leaves the government where it started. At the time of writing,
talks were still going on to renew the coalition.

Whatever agreement is reached between the parties, they have to tackle
the budget issue. The deficit was expected to reach 5.3% of gross
domestic product (GDP) last year. It needs to be cut to 3% to meet the
Maastricht convergence criteria. Until a budget is agreed for this year
predictions further ahead are shaky.

Some contribution is expected from the proceeds of privatisation of
extensive state holdings in industrial and commercial companies -
including the banks. But the fundamentals, which caused the previous
split, need to be sorted out.

Getting the deficit under control is not being helped by the economic
slowdown. The latest forecasts from GiroCredit indicate that GDP
growth, which hit 3.0% in 1994, slipped to 2.0% last year and could
fall to 1.7% this year.

The bank results have reflected the slowdown in the economy.
Preliminary indications for the full year from the biggest banks show
that, while business at home was quiet, international activities helped
to produce reasonably good results.

Bank Austria reported in late December that operating results for 1995
should be up by 16.8% at about S4.9 billion (dollars 485 million). The
bank has been working on cutting costs: 'The domestic branch network
was further streamlined through the closure or merger of branches.

'The number of branches and business units fell from 320 to 306, and
the bank plans to merge 20 more branches in 1996.'

In the home market: 'Demand for personal loans remains depressed due to
slow growth in disposable income, but is stronger than in 1994.
Business loans experienced growth, especially those granted to small
and medium-sized companies.'

Outside Austria 'international business has surpassed expectations. In
1995, the performance of all the bank's foreign offices was either good
or outstanding based on a comparison of the results posted for 1994'.

Bank Austria has been working to take advantage of the fact that it is
now under the same holding company which holds a majority of GiroCredit
(which is however fighting to avoid losing its its separate identity).

The asset management activities of the two banks have been merged. And
'agreement was reached with GiroCredit to direct external public
accountants to examine the possibilities for merging some of the
foreign offices of Bank Austria and GiroCredit'.

The bank has also been developing its external links. Cariplo of Italy
has agreed to increase its holding from 4.3% to 5.6% this year.

And last year Bank Austria formed a strategic link with Germany's
Westdeutsche Landesbank.

'The co-operation agreement .. foresees a participation of WestLB in
Bank Austria in the order of about 9.1% in Bank Austria's share capital
through a capital increase. The two banks moreover mutually declare
themselves to be preferred partners for cross-border financial
transactions.'

Creditanstalt has been particularly helped by foreign business.
Chairman Guido Schmidt-Chiari reported a rise of 16% in the CA Group's
after-tax surplus to about S2.2 billion.

'One dominant characteristic of the 1995 business year was the
favourable earnings situation in international business. While
accounting for some 50% of the consolidated balance sheet, foreign
business generated about two-thirds of the group's surplus for the
year.'

In contrast: 'Domestic business was under heavy pressure in 1995.

'The reasons for this development are to be seen in the extremely weak
credit demand during much of the year, the shift to short-term loans
with low interest rates and a general squeeze on the interest margin.'

GiroCredit, which as well as being the central institution for the
savings banks is a commercial bank in its own right, had a good year
with operating profit up 56% at S1.53 billion. The year was eventful,
including a reorganisation of risk management, restructuring the equity
investment portfolio and 'going public'.

To achieve this, the bank converted the whole of its outstanding
participating capital, with a nominal value of S300 million, into
preference shares which were offered to the public. 'Despite the
unfavourable market climate at the time, the issue was oversubscribed.
The preference stock is widely held, having been placed with private
and institutional investors in Austria and abroad.'

The problems of the banks were highlighted by rating agency Moody's in
its December 1995 review. The agency pointed to five challenges:

* Widespread overcapacity within the domestic banking system;

* Aggressive retail fund pricing coupled with relentless pressure on
loan margins which, together, continue to define the generally poor
profitability of Austrian banks;

* Slack loan demand for the foreseeable future as the Austrian economy
itself shows renewed signs of slowing down;

* High overhead ratios that are the product not only of underlying thin
core operating revenues but also of relatively high cost structures;

* The need, at least for some of the major banks, to rebuild their true
economic capital that, to an extent, had been impacted by the release
of hidden reserves (either through the sale of assets or reductions in
overprovisioning) during the recession.'

Moody's added: 'Looking ahead, the Austrian banking system as a whole
may have difficulties in pursuing any further far-reaching and more
painful restructuring after a number of years of targeted and
moderately successful cost containment measures.'

The agency highlighted the excessive number of banks. 'From a retail
banking point of view, Austria remains overbranched. With the exception
of Belgium, its banking system is the most overbanked in the European
Union with any one bank or bank branch serving, on average, a mere
1,384 people. Germany comes relatively close with 1,533 people served.'

Consolidation and restructuring within the banking system are needed.
Some progress has been made in the savings sector. But at the end of
the day developments depend on political influence and convincing
entrenched interests of the need to adapt to the new open environment
of EU membership.

Sorting out the privatisation programme would be a good starting point.
It would help to shape the future direction of the banks, as well as
making a significant, if one-off, contribution to cutting the budget
deficit.

Bank Austria is majority owned by the (historically red) City of
Vienna; but the Federal government has indicated its intention of
selling off its 22.8% voting stake. That has not prevented chief
executive Gerhard Randa from making long-term plans.

The greatest uncertainty is over Creditanstalt, where the long-running
saga of the sale has made it difficult for the management to plan
ahead.

While he was finance minister, Staribacher had called in JP Morgan to
put a value on the Federal government's stake - just under half the
capital but holding 70.5% of the votes.

Morgan determined that, while the bank was worth some S28-30 billion in
total, the government's controlling stake should command a premium.
That implied a valuation of some S18 billion, a useful contribution to
cutting the deficit (The Banker, 8/95, p31).

The coalition's collapse and the election meant that the sale was again
put off (The Banker, 11/95, p4). Now Klima has the chance to start the
process again. As usual, politics intervenes.

The sale offer had progressed as far as inviting indicative offers for
the Creditanstalt stake. It is believed that the consortium including
First Austrian Bank and Italy's Generali insurance group (known as the
'Austrian solution'), which has been showing interest for some time,
put down a marker. It is not known whether there were any other firm
approaches.

The nub of the issue is whether Austria will be prepared to allow a
traditionally black bank which goes back to the old Habsburg empire to
pass out of Austrian control.

Germany's Allianz insurance group had shown an interest, but backed
off; Switzerland's CS Holding group pulled out of a firm offer when it
met an increasingly xenophobic reaction.

Lacina, finance minister at the time, is believed to have at least
initially favoured the CS Holding approach. Klima is understood to have
opposed the deal, believing that the bank should stay in Austrian
hands.

Now he is in the driving seat. The problem will be to reconcile
national pride with giving value to the purchaser(s) of the
Creditanstalt stake and at the same time realising as much benefit as
possible to help cut the budget deficit.

There is a strong belief that the sales of the Federal government's
bank stakes will go ahead this year. That will be some relief to
everybody.

CZECH REPUBLIC: THE SECOND TIME AROUND

Parliamentary elections at the end of June are already casting a
shadow. Not that anyone expects the present coalition government led by
prime minister Vaclav Klaus and his Civic Democratic Party to lose. Nor
is there likely to be any disruption of the economic and political
stability which has characterised the Czech transition to a market
economy, easily the smoothest and most successful in post-communist
central and east Europe.

As Klaus has recently observed, his government, in office since June
1992, is already the longest serving since the collapse of the Austro-
Hungarian empire in 1918 led to the creation of an independent
Czechoslovakia - and ultimately to the emergence of the Czech republic
in 1992, when Slovakia split away.

This does not mean that this year's elections for the 200-seat chamber
of deputies (and later in the year for the newly-created 81-member
senate, or upper house) is likely to see another Klaus walkover.
According to the opinion polls, the main opposition group, the Social
Democratic Party, led by Milos Zeman, has moved up from 6.5% of the
vote at the 1992 election to around 20% support against 25-27% for
Vaclav Klaus's Civic Democratic Party.

By contrast, the two junior partners in the present coalition, the
Civic Democratic Alliance and Christian Democratic Union/Czech People's
Party, look like mustering around 6-8% of the vote, just about
sufficient to satisfy the 5% minimum to secure representation in the
new house. So do the communists, which makes the Czech republic the
only country in the region where former communists (reformed or
unreformed) have no prospect of being voted back into power.

But, while the elections are unlikely to see an upset, they are
nonetheless having an influence on the local political debate. Issues,
such as reform of the health service, education, pensions, and public
transport, which have tended to be neglected amid the broad political
consensus about the reform process, have been moving up the pecking
order.

So have questions arising from what prime minister Klaus has himself
described as the 'early post-transformation stage' to which 'Czech
society has now progressed'.

Longer-term questions about industrial policy, financial sector
regulation, and the role of banks and investment funds in corporate
governance have been prompted by a series of takeovers of companies and
investment funds and by several bank failures.

Last year's yawning trade deficit has underlined a growing debate about
Czech competitiveness. Can a country of 10 million people offer a home
market large enough to support industrial companies and financial
services groups capable of competing successfully in today's global
market place? Differences between the government and the central bank
over exchange rate policy have become increasingly public. The trade
deficit appears to strengthen the case for the Czech crown to be
devalued: the heavy, continuing inflow of foreign capital creates a
strong argument for revaluation.

The investment inflow is one measure of the international recognition
the so far successful transformation of the Czech economy has been
receiving.

Foreign direct and portfolio investment has been flooding in, bringing
the cumulative total since the transition began in 1990 to well over
dollars 5 billion.

In October the government fully liberalised all current account
transactions and also freed many capital account transactions, thus
achieving convertibility in terms of the International Monetary Fund's
Article VIII.

Then, in November, the Czech republic chalked up a notable double. The
country became the first in post-communist central and east Europe to
be accepted for membership of the industrial nations' club, the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation & Development.

In the same month, the country was the first in the region to be
awarded an 'A-stable' investment grade rating by Standard & Poor's, the
US credit rating agency.

The Czech economy, meanwhile, is expected to grow by another 4-5% this
year, for the third year running. Prime minister Klaus prefers to call
the downturn in the early 1990s not a recession but 'a transformation
shake-out' - a 'shake-out of the non-viable economic activities which
could exist only in protected Comecon markets, with distorted price
structures and huge subsidies'.

Unemployment never rose by very much, and is now less than 3% and still
falling. Productivity is rising. Inflation has fallen to single
figures, and is still declining. The Czech crown has been holding
steady on the world's exchanges. And, as Klaus is keen to point out,
Czech living standards (using purchasing power parity) are already back
to or above the level of the poorer member countries in the European
Union.

The only possibly worrying feature in an otherwise impressive record is
the trade deficit. Last year it looked set to reach dollars 3.5
billion, up sharply from dollars 470 million in 1994. But here, too,
Klaus sees this as natural in the early post-transformation stage of
the Czech economy.

Not only are imports likely to increase as the pace of industrial
output and construction quickens. Exports are also likely to be
diverted to the home market as the growth of investment and consumption
accelerates. With the country's overall international credibility
standing high, and investment pouring in, financing the trade deficit
poses no problem, at least for the present.

Vaclav Klaus goes further. He sees no reason to change the exchange
rate, unlike Josef Tosovsky, the able central bank governor, who has
been worried by the impact of heavy monetary inflows, especially short-
term speculative capital, upon the domestic money supply, and thus upon
inflationary pressure. According to Klaus, a devaluation would not
solve, at least in the short run, the balance of trade deficit, while a
revaluation - especially a small revaluation - would not discourage
monetary inflows.

Instead, the two may settle for a more modest change in exchange rate
policy. This would be to widen the band within which the Czech crown
trades against the dollars/DM currency basket. At present the band is
limited to 0.5% either side of parity.

Changing the band to as much as 3%, or possibly even 5%, either side of
parity could help to deter speculative flows as well as provide some
scope to promote competitiveness.

Competitiveness has already been improving to some extent. Industrial
productivity has risen. The low level of unemployment, despite large,
continuing lay-offs, indicates that the manpower shake-out in some
sectors has been absorbed by the fast growing small business and
services sectors.

'The low level of unemployment is a bottleneck to higher growth,' says
Josef Tosovsky of the National Bank; 'manpower and other resources are
still being hoarded by inefficient firms'.

Lubomir Soudek, chairman and chief executive of Skoda Plzen, the
country's largest heavy engineering firm, makes a similar point.

'Czech industry faces several competitive disadvantages. We still lag
behind in technology. There are still big problems over working methods
and ethics, including lower labour productivity because of outdated
management methods.

The general lack of capital is a major hindrance.

'Short-term loans from local Czech banks are not on as good terms as
those offered by western banks to their clients. Finally, a drawback
that cannot be overlooked is the relatively low level of direct
government support for Czech industry.'

As Soudek indicates, prime minister Klaus is inclined to leave things
to the market. But, for a long while, banks and other creditors
appeared reluctant to enforce the bankruptcy laws.

These were considerably strengthened in 1993 and another amendment to
quicken liquidation proceedings is in preparation now. It is only
recently, however, that the rate of enforcement has picked up. Between
late 1992 and May 1995 a total of 4,500 bankruptcy petitions were
filed, but only 600 bankruptcies were declared.

There are other indications that the pace of restructuring in Czech
industry may be about to quicken. Last year the second and final wave
of the Czech republic's voucher privatisation programme was completed,
raising the share of the country's gross domestic product generated by
the private sector to more than 70%. The flow of foreign direct
investment also boomed in 1995, in part boosted by the partial
privatisation sale of SPT Telecom to the Swiss and Dutch
telecommunications groups.

As Lubomir Soudek of Skoda Plzen says, many Czech companies are too
small to compete with the largest multinationals.

In October Stratton, a US investment company owned by Michael Dingman,
a Bahamas-based industrialist, announced that it had bought stakes in
eight leading Czech companies (in shipping, glass-making, pulp and
paper, and oil and gas exploration) from Prague-based Harvard Capital &
Consulting, the big privatisation investment fund group.

Stratton proposed to inject marketing, management, and financial
expertise into the eight firms, regarding itself as a medium-term
investor.

Eventually, it would sell its shares on to strategic investors or float
them on the market. Meanwhile, Stratton and Harvard (which had
subsequently bought in the market further shares in the same companies)
would vote their shares jointly.

This was followed by a move against other big privatisation investment
funds by a little-known Czech firm called Motoinvest acting in concert
with Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, two local banks. In a series of
stock market raids, Motoinvest bought blocks of shares in six
investment funds run by established local fund managers, saying that it
would dispense with the existing management and run the funds itself.

Shortly afterwards, Bankers Trust bought by agreement 40% stakes in two
investment funds run by Ceska Sporitelna (Czech Savings Bank),
intending to sell the stakes on to Western institutional investors.

Each of these moves, but especially Motoinvest's, sent a shock wave
through the relatively staid world of Czech fund management.
Motoinvest's ploy demonstrated the funds' vulnerability as long as
their own shares trade at big discounts to net asset value. The obvious
conclusion was that fund managers need to generate much better returns
on their portfolio of investments in privatised companies.

The government was also prompted to act more speedily to tighten up the
regulatory framework. The lack of transparency on the Prague Stock
Exchange has long been criticised as a major shortcoming and a source
of weakness. In future, acquisitions of stakes of more than 10% in a
company will have to be disclosed.

At the same time, the law is being changed to allow investment funds,
which have hitherto been restricted to a maximum 20% holding in any one
company, to elect to become managerial funds permitted to acquire
majority stakes in Czech companies.

Big changes also appear to be impending in the banking sector. Foreign
banks were becoming a major force in the local corporate and investment
banking markets when the National Bank temporarily stopped issuing new
banking licences in late 1993 and set about trying to encourage the
emergence through mergers of a tier of middle-sized local banks.

Now, with the failure of these hopes (despite the impending merger of
Banka Hana and Zemska Banka) and with the Czech government about
formally to announce its bid for European Union membership, the
National Bank is thinking of lifting or easing the ban on new licences,
with the UK's Midland Bank apparently heading the list of possible new
arrivals.

Meanwhile, two of the four large local banks, Ceska Sporitelna and
Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka (the former foreign trade bank), are at
'the very preliminary stage' of discussing the possibility of a merger.

These talks may never come to anything. But they point to one possible
way forward. The big local banks in the Czech republic (like those in
Hungary, another country of 10 million people) are relatively tiny
compared with the foreign banks with which they increasingly have to
compete, such as the big German, Austrian, American (including now GE
Capital), Swiss, and Dutch banks building up key positions in the
region's banking and financial markets.

Sooner or later, the 'big' local banks will have to follow their major
corporate clients as they expand abroad, just as Western banks had to
in their day.

As competition builds up in the run-up to European Union membership,
the big Czech (and Hungarian, Polish and other) banks will need to seek
strategic partners of their own or, alternatively, try to outgrow the
limitations of their own local home market by making acquisitions
elsewhere in the region.

In banking, as in other sectors, the second and perhaps the harder
stage of the transformation of the Czech economy is getting seriously
under way.

GLOBAL BANKING: HOME AND AWAY

The world's Top 50 global banks appear to have slowed their expansion
abroad as the trend towards consolidation in domestic banking sectors
takes hold.

The Banker's latest survey of global banking suggests that, while some
have expanded their percentage of overseas assets, others have returned
their focus to domestic markets.

The top ranking continues to be headed by the UK's Standard Chartered
with its percentage of assets abroad remaining above 70%. However, for
the second year running, the bank has relied on Hongkong for more than
50% of its pre-tax profits. Nevertheless, it does have an extensive
network throughout the high-growth region of Asia; predators with
ambitions in the area would find Standard Chartered a tempting
acquisition. In January, rumours were circulating, with the UK's
National Westminster Bank, ranked 13th globally, as a potential bidder.

One new entry into the top five is ABN-Amro Bank, whose overseas assets
figure this year of 61% includes those assets domiciled overseas booked
through the Netherlands. This figure looks set to increase further for
in 1994, the number of the bank's overseas branches increased from 461
to 540.

The Netherland's second largest bank, ING Bank, is also a bank that
focuses on international activities, having entered obscure foreign
markets such as North Korea and Cuba before its rivals. Its acquisition
of failed Barings will enhance its international activities. However,
the lack of information provided by the bank on its overseas assets
makes a comparison with ABN-Amro difficult. It is not surprising to
find the Dutch banks venturing abroad, given their saturated home
market.

The top players continue to include the 'Big Three' from Switzerland,
but their position in the global rankings has changed as they vie to
gain control of their domestic market.

Swiss Bank Corporation expanded domestically in 1994 through
acquisition, co-operation agreements and minority stakes, losing seven
places in the rankings as the percentage of its assets held abroad fell
from 53% to 47%.

Union Bank of Switzerland also expanded domestically by acquiring five
regional banks, resulting in a drop in its ranking to fourth from
second. CS Holdings made its large domestic acquisition of Swiss
Volksbank in 1993, followed in 1994 with the absorption of
Switzerland's largest regional bank, New Bank of Argovie.

However, such actions at home do not represent a change in overall
global strategy. Swiss Bank Corp took over the UK's SG Warburg in 1995
and CS Holdings has risen to second place in this year's rankings. Its
assets in the US through investment banking subsidiary CS First Boston
represent 30% of group total assets.

Other strong European representations come from the five French banks
which hold more than 40% of their assets abroad. Surprisingly, troubled
Credit Lyonnais, under pressure to dispose of assets to pay for its
overexpansion in the 1980s, now leads the French pack with 53.6%.
According to the controversial rescue plan announced in early 1995,
Credit Lyonnais was ordered to sell off 30% of its foreign assets.

Deutsche Bank leads the four German banks in the list, with 43% of
assets abroad as of end December 1994. Deutsche Bank's chairman Hilmar
Kopper said in November that the bank was only 'half German' and has
designs to become a global player in wholesale operations. With a 2.7%
share of the European Union market, it is the market leader and is
strengthening its investment banking operations in London through
subsidiary Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.

Better disclosure from Dresdner Bank indicates that 33% of its assets
are held abroad, and this figure looks set to rise further with last
year's acquisition of the UK's Kleinwort Benson.

Other developments among the European banks include a drop in Banco
Santander's assets abroad, from 38.6% to 29.7%, as a result of
absorbing failed Banesto. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya now assumes the position
of top global Spanish bank. In December, the UK's National Westminster
Bank sold off its US retail and commercial banking operations as a
result of competition arising from the rapid pace of consolidation in
the US banking market.

However, one of the bank's strategies is to build up NatWest Markets
internationally and it has recently expanded its futures operations in
Asia.

Outside Europe, Japan continues to be represented by 10 banks with two
newcomers, Mitsubishi Trust & Banking and Sumitomo Trust & Banking, in
this year's list through better disclosure of their overseas
activities. Their annual reports indicate ambitions to expand abroad,
especially in China and the Asia region. This is not surprising, given
the prolonged recession at home. However, a merger on 1 April between
Bank of Tokyo, the most international of the Japanese banks, and the
domestically stronger Mitsubishi Bank will create the world's largest
bank, but with a higher proportion of the new banks' assets residing at
home.

Of the three Australian banks in the list, a contrast of strategies
exists between National Australia Bank and Westpac. National Australia
Bank continues to expand abroad with its acquisition of Michigan
National Corp of the US, increasing its overseas assets figure to 47%.
This will be reflected in next year's survey. Meanwhile Westpac is
continuing to refocus on its domestic market after reckless over-
expansion in the 1980s, resulting in 1992 in a loss equivalent to one
third of its then Tier One capital.

Of the six US banks in the ranking, JP Morgan, Bankers Trust and
Citicorp all hold over 45% of their assets abroad. However, with
possible new regulations regarding interstate banking, US banks may
take advantage of the new opportunities to expand domestically.

Indeed, a process of consolidation is under way within the US banking
sector and in 1995, the biggest bank in the US was created by the
merger between Chemical Banking and Chase Manhattan. Now they hold
23.6% and 29.8% of assets abroad respectively, with the merger creating
a more powerful domestic than international franchise. For the moment.

Where they come from

Europe                  (25)
North America           (10)
Japan                   (10)

How we did it

The Banker's annual listing of global banks ranks the Top 100 largest
banks in the world according to their percentage of assets based
overseas. They all have a presence in London, New York and Tokyo.

Figures have been obtained from the banks or from their annual reports.
The ideal measure consists of assets booked through overseas offices as
well as overseas assets booked through domestic ones.

In some cases, through lack of information, estimates such as income
generated abroad have been used as the next best indicator.

To enable a comparison of global reach, asset figures in seven leading
financial centres are provided. However, in most cases the given
figures will exclude those assets domiciled in those overseas centres
which have been booked through domestic offices. Nevertheless, they do
provide an indication of the relative sizes of foreign banks'
operations.

Owing to the lack of information for London, employee totals have been
used, drawn from the November 1995 issue.

For Hongkong figures include the banks' subsidiaries but not their
branches.

For Singapore, figures also include contingent liabilities and
commitments.

JAPAN: HASHIMOTO TO THE RESCUE

History cannot record many cases of a country swapping prime ministers
for the sake of its banks and yet this is what has happened in Japan.

With the fate of the bankrupt housing loan corporations (Jusen) hanging
in the balance, and thus that of the banking system too, political
tough guy Ryutaro Hashimoto has taken over from mild-mannered Tomiichi
Murayama the role of premier and also that of defender of the financial
system.

Hashimoto would have become prime minister sooner or later - his
election last year as president of the majority Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP) ensured that. But Murayama's sudden resignation in early
January was precipitated not so much by a process of natural selection
as by fears that the parliamentary opposition would make mincemeat of
him over the Jusen affair. If he is to save his own political skin, and
the reputation of the parliamentary coalition in which he served as
trade and industry minister, Hashimoto has to champion the Jusen
rescue.

The issue is extremely important, not only for Japan but equally for
international financial markets. The fragile Japanese banking system
could be plunged back into turmoil if the Jusen scheme is turned into a
political football. The so-called Japan premium would reappear in
interbank markets, the Tokyo stock market would likely reverse its
recent gains and a dangerous downward economic spiral could result.

With so much at stake it was small wonder that Murayama, who is 71
years old and weary from the burden of 18 months in office, should
shrink from facing what threatened to be a full frontal challenge once
Japan's national Diet reconvened on 22 January. The Shinshinto
opposition party now has at its head Ichiro Ozawa, a man every bit as
ruthless politically as Hashimoto and who will seize any opportunity to
bring down the ruling coalition.

In a country like Japan which loves to hate its bankers, Shanshinto has
nothing to lose and everything to gain by capitalising on the Jusen
issue.

Japanese voters are often assumed to be docile but there is a
surprising degree of popular outrage over the scheme devised last
December by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) to rescue the mortgage
lending firm - using Yen 685 billion or dollars 6.8 billion of taxpayer
subsidies in the process .

Even now, some five years after the collapse of Japan's bubble economy,
bankers are still being berated by politicians and the public for
causing the bubble. That banks were forced into financing speculative
assets in the late 1980s after financial deregulation sent many former
clients in search of capital market finance rather than bank borrowings
is overlooked.

Virtually everyone is baying for the blood of the bankers and Ozawa is
an astute enough politician to exploit the popular ire and try to bring
about the downfall of the Hashimoto government over the Jusen issue.
Few in Japan would argue with Shinshinto's right to force the coalition
to seek a popular mandate after its unseemly power grab in 1993, but
the few who realise what is at stake wish the opposition had chosen
another issue on which to go to war.

The Jusen scheme represented the coping stone of an elaborate edifice
constructed by the finance minister under its former political head
Masayoshi Takemura, who heads the minority Sakigaki party within
Hashimoto's coalition. Under initiatives announced late last year, the
MoF arranged first for banks to come clean on their bubble-economy bad
loans, to beef up their management systems and to agree to a Resolution
Trust-type body being set up, financed by a steep hike in deposit
insurance premiums.

The ministry also promised to thoroughly overhaul itself and to render
its opaque supervision of Japan's financial system more transparent and
accountable in future.

But it was the Jusen scheme (which involved a considerable financial
sacrifice on the part of Japanese banks) that finally tipped
international confidence back in Japan's favour. Now, this could be in
jeopardy once more.

The Jusen problem is big by any measure. Out of total loans of around
Yen 13 trillion the seven firms (which began with residential mortgage
lending before splurging on commercial real estate financing in the
bubble economy) have seen some Yen 6.3 trillion worth go bad. Most is
attributable to banks and it represents one-third of the Yen 18
trillion in loans which the MoF says is now irrecoverable in the
Japanese financial system.

The public has selected the wrong target in pillorying the banks over
the Jusen scheme. Taxpayers' money is needed not so much because banks
(which founded and financed the housing corporations) have proved
unwilling or unable to shoulder the full burden of writing off bad
loans, but because hundreds of agricultural co-operatives which also
lent to the Jusen are shirking their share of the burden.

The co-ops, with formidable deposit-gathering powers through their
trading connections with farmers, have agreed to accept only a
fractional part of the Jusen loan write-offs relative to the size of
their exposure. Such is the co-ops' political influence, (especially
with Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party which depends heavily upon
the rural vote), that few politicians are prepared to attack them
publicly .

Banks are easy meat by comparison and even though there is risk for
Japan in jeopardising again the health of the banking system the
temptation to make political capita}il out of the Jusen issue appears
irresistible. If the Jusen scheme were to unravel, banks would be
forced to follow lengthy legal procedures in order to liquidate these
institutions and to crystallise their losses. The banking system would
see its international credit ratings sink even lower than they have
done already and more banks could suffer runs as the failed Hyogo Bank
did.

This cannot be allowed to happen, not only because of the systemic risk
it implies but also because Japan's fragile economic recovery will
almost certainly stall if banks do not soon become engines of credit
creation again. One reason why Japan's economy has been so weak for so
long - real GDP has grown by under l% on average over the past four
years - is because what little recovery has taken place has been
financed by a run down of savings and by tax rebates. Bank credit has
been absent.

Loans outstanding at Japan's 11 commercial or 'city' banks actually
fell by 1.4% from a year earlier to Yen 218.03 trillion by the end of
December, according to the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.

While loans at the three long-term credit banks and seven trust banks
have risen marginally, banks in general simply are not confident enough
about their balance sheets to engage in the kind of aggressive consumer
and business lending needed to underpin a substantial rise in demand.
Japanese banks badly need more generous tax treatment in writing off
bad debt but the quid pro quo for this was that they agree to shoulder
a heavy part of the Jusen rescue burden. If the scheme falls through,
so too presumably do the tax concessions.

Despite the critical importance of restoring the banking system to full
health in Japan, few people are prepared to sacrifice themselves for
this cause. This became painfully obvious when Hashimoto began casting
around for a new finance minister to replace Takemura, who himself was
only too eager to take theoopportunity offered by Murayama's
resignation to jump out of the hot seat.

Finally, Hashimoto had to turn 66-year-old Wataru Kubo, secretary
general of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the second largest force
within the ruling three-party coalition to make the 'sacrifice' of
offering himself up as finance minister. What is normally regarded as a
plum job would have gone to an LDP man but all the likely candidates
declined it.

Although Kubo's appointment assures Hashimoto of socialist party
support for the controversial Jusen scheme, political analysts say that
by putting the SDP stalwart in the direct firing line the new prime
minister has provided himself with a sacrificial lamb in the event that
a senior minister has to resign to take responsibility for the Jusen
scheme.

Hashimoto will insist that taxpayer's money being put into it should
prove at least partly repayable, if the Resolution Trust-type
institution being set up as part of the scheme succeeds in collecting
bad debts and realising collateral.

A significant part of these bad debts is owed by organised crime
(Yakuza) syndicates which borrowed from Jusen during the bubble but are
now refusing to repay loans. Bankers try to collect at their peril -
sometimes literally on pain of death. The bad debt issue could well
prove to be fatal for the aspirations of some Japanese politicians too,
to say nothing of its impact on Japan's financial system and economy.

TAIWAN: GIVE US A SMILE

Service quality and conservative management appeared to be the keys for
success in Taiwan's rocky financial market last year and may well
continue to be the formula in 1996, according to local bankers and
analysts.

Even though Taiwan maintained a 6.4% rate of real economic growth and
20% growth in exports, the island's domestic economy remained cool.

Financial markets were hit by the continued depression in the property
market and a stock market that lost about 27% of its value during the
year, factors which also slowed expansion of private consumption.

The outbreak of a number of financial scandals, a rising number of
bankruptcies and intensification of tensions with mainland China in the
second half of the year added to the perception of gloom in the
domestic economy, despite the strongest export sector performance in
years.

Indicators of the sluggish financial environment included soft growth
in the M2 money supply, which slowed from 13.1% in January to 8.4% by
November.

More critical for bankers was the relatively cool growth in loans and
investments, which rose by only 12.1% over the first 10 months of 1995,
compared to 15.1% during the same period in 1994. Moreover, the
percentage of non-performing loans rose to a high 3.1% by November,
according to Central Bank of China data.

Taiwan's major state-owned banks, which are particularly vulnerable to
exposure in loans to the property market and small enterprises, looked
likely to just barely meet earnings targets for the first half of the
1996 fiscal year (which began 1 July 1995).

Earnings for the top three state-owned commercial banks suffered from
the impact of a rising share of non-performing loans and losses in
securities investments.

During the first five months of their fiscal year (from July to
November) compared to the year-ago period, the pre-tax earnings for
First Commercial Bank slipped 14% to NTdollars 2.8 billion, while Hua
Nan Commercial Bank suffered a 22% decline to NTdollars 2.7 million and
the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank's pre-tax earnings reached only NTdollars
2.4 billion, about 5% off the year ago period.

On 31 December, the First Commercial Bank had deposits of NTdollars
614.1 billion and loans of NTdollars 499.9 billion, followed by Hua Nan
Commercial Bank with NTdollars 604.5 billion in deposits and NTdollars
480.4 billion in ordinary loans, and the Chang Hwa Commercial Bank with
NTdollars 593.3 billion in deposits and NTdollars 460.1 billion in
loans.

Despite the soft conditions, the island's 16 newer private banks
(mostly established in 1991-92) continued to attract a rising share of
deposits and loans. With NTdollars 11.3 billion in total deposits and
NTdollars 10.6 billion in loans, the combined weight of the new banks
approached the scale of a major state-owned bank.

But the pace of growth of the new banks slowed markedly from previous
years and their ranks showed more signs of differentiation in business
performance.

E. Sun Bank emerged as the leader in deposits for the first time with
NTdollars 82.7 billion, up 37% over last year, followed closely by
Cosmos Bank with NTdollars 82.6 billion and Taishin International Bank
with NTdollars 80.6 billion.

Six other banks reported deposits over NTdollars 70 billion. But the
fastest growth was tallied by En Tie Commercial Bank, the newest
entrant, with 46%, followed by Bank Sinopac with 42% expansion in
deposits.

Growth in loans was clearly far slower than for deposits last year for
the new banks. Only five had extended over NTdollars 70 billion in
loans by the end of 1995, led by Cosmos with NTdollars 75.9 billion, E.
Sun Bank with NTdollars 73.9 billion, and Taishin International Bank
with NTdollars 73.5 billion.

Indeed, virtually all banks faced difficulties in finding outlets for
rising deposits. None of the 16 new banks listed more loans than
deposits by year-end, averaging 94%.

Still, the new banks were more effective in this area than the three
state-owned commercial banks, among which the highest ratio was tallied
by First Commercial with a year-end 81.4% ratio of loans to deposits,
according to data published in the Commercial Times (8 January 1996).

More significantly, only five of the 16 newer private banks tallied pre-
tax earnings over 7% on revenues in what was the fourth year of
operation for most of them.

Overall, the new banks earned an average of NTdollars 630 million last
year and tallied a profitability rating of 5.88%, according to early
data collected by the vernacular Economic Daily News (5 January 1996).

Bank Sinopac was the most profitable bank with 7.83% of pre-tax
earnings compared to revenues with a reported NTdollars 807 million in
net earnings, followed by the Asia Pacific Bank, E. Sun Bank, Taishin
International Bank, and the Dah An Commercial Bank.

Four other banks scored pre-tax profitability rating over 6%, but seven
failed to reach this mark, with Bao Dao Commercial reporting the lowest
profitability ratio with 3.52% on NTdollars 352 million in pre-tax net
earnings.

Noted Professor Yin Nai-ping of the banking department of Taipei's
National Chengchi University: 'We are now beginning to see the
polarisation of the new banks into those that are well managed and
efficient and those that have less healthy management practices,
including excessive dealings with affiliates of associated business
groups.'

Banking insiders indicate that banks that played it safe by reducing
investment in securities and high-risk lending and those that turned to
consumer loans in 1995 came out with more positive results on the year-
end balance sheets.

The earnings of several new banks were hit hard by the end to write off
non-performing loans, particularly banks that focused lending
strategies on smaller enterprises and the property sector.

According to the Commercial Times (3 January 1996), Union Commercial
Bank wrote off close to NTdollars 200 million, the Dah An Commercial
Bank took a hit of about a NTdollars 100 million, and Pan Asia suffered
a NTdollars 80 million in bad loans, mostly to corporate clients.

On the flip side, a number of banks improved their balance sheets
markedly by shifting the focus of lending strategy to individual and
consumer loans.

Huang Yungjen, general manager of E. Sun Bank, said ESB's share of
loans to corporations and individuals had shifted from about 60:40 in
previous years to 55:45% last year and that the target is half-and-half
in 1996.

'The consumer lending market is mature here given the per capita income
of over USdollars 10,000, and in relatively poor economic conditions,
extending more consumer loans is a good way to disperse risk,' Huang
noted, adding that 'we can put more effort on corporate loans when the
economy improves'.

Huang said ESB also gained through a management priority on loan
'quality over quantity.' While the non-performing loan ratio for the 16
new banks averaged 3.15% by October 1995, ESB had a 1.9% ratio, thanks
in part to diversification to consumer lending and close risk
management of major clients with loans over NTdollars 50 million with
assigned staff and a headquarters computer database.

Huang also noted that ESB gained by playing the stock market
cautiously. 'We held down the investments by our trust department to
between NTdollars 100-200 million and ended up losing only about
NTdollars 30 million, compared to other private banks that lost as much
as NTdollars 200 million,' Huang said.

Yet despite the growing scale of the new banks, Chien Hung-Tao, general
manager of Hua Nan, maintains that they do not yet pose a major threat.
'As the new banks are under strong pressure from shareholders to turn
profits and as they bear higher costs, they cannot use low lending
rates to compete with us nor can they compete in terms of foreign
exchange services,' Chien noted.

Where the state-owned banks are feeling the heat from the new private
banks is in personnel. 'Service attitude at the new banks is clearly
better because they steal good employees from us,' complained another
executive in a top three state-owned bank. A key concern for state-
owned banks is whether a draft law allowing them greater flexibility in
personnel management will be passed this year.

For the new year, local bankers express cautious optimism. A forecast
issued by the Central Bank of China in late December anticipates that
consumer and investor confidence will revive after Taiwan's first
direct Presidential election on 23 March, and with continued strong
export growth and accelerated public infrastructure spending in the
second half, maintain a moderate 6.48% economic growth rate in 1996.

But analysts note that the new year contains a number of major
political uncertainties, mostly focused around the Presidential
election. While incumbent President Lee Teng-hui of the ruling
Kuomintang is favoured by most pundits to win the poll, the process
will also entail two potential cabinet reshuffles.

As a new legislature was elected in early December, Lee has to appoint
a premier in February for approval by the new Legislative Yuan, but the
winner of the presidential poll will also need to name a premier as
well, probably by May.

Moreover, as the Kuomintang's majority in the 164-seat Legislative Yuan
was reduced to a handful (85 seats), the new legislative environment
will be less predictable and the weight of the grassroots opposition
Democratic Progressive Party (53 seats) and the right-wing New Party
(21 seats) on financial policy more evident.

Not the least of bankers' concerns is whether mainland Chinese leaders
will move to moderate the current hard-line stance toward Taipei,
particularly if Lee, who has been pilloried in the controlled mainland
press, is elected.

ESB's Huang Yung-jen noted that his bank's targets for 1996 are set
conservatively 'as there are a large number of uncertainties'.

'As the government tries to implement the plans to turn Taiwan into an
Asia-Pacific regional operating and financial centre, the pace of
internationalisation will accelerate as will the competitive pressure
from foreign banks,' Huang noted.

'Expectations are that the economy won't be worse than last year, but
also not much better,' Huang said. 'Many say that conditions may
improve after the Presidential election and that relations with
mainland China will settle down afterward, but this remains to be seen.

'So we will retain a conservative approach and work to maintain the
quality of loans, improve the effectiveness of capital use, and put
more stress on consumer loans and other products for the individual
market to lower overall risk.'

1996 will be a key year for a number of new banks, particularly as
three, Grand Commercial, Dah An and the Chinese Bank, will become
eligible to apply for listing on the Taiwan Stock Exchange next year.

But TSE regulations also require that companies hoping to list as a
first grade stock must maintain pre-tax earnings to revenue ratios of
over 6% during the two years before application and that the latter
year's profit rate must be higher.

Of the three, Dah An and the Chinese Bank both attained earnings over
6% (7.2% and 6.41%, respectively), and plan to better this performance
in 1996.

However, Grand Commercial, which only tallied a 4.2% profit rate on
NTdollars 530 million in pre-tax earnings, will only be able to apply
for second-class listing, even if it attains its ambitious target of
NTdollars 988 million in earnings this year. The remaining banks are
under no less pressure to attain this earnings rate during the coming
two years.

Roger Chuang, executive vice-president of the Grand Commercial Bank,
said: 'We hope that after the Presidential election the overall
environment will improve and the stock market will revive. with
continued strong traditional business and improvement in non-core
areas, we should boost our earnings up to NTdollars 988 million.'

TAIWAN: STORM DAMAGE

Taiwan's financial authorities offered a draft programme to strengthen
the supervision of monetary institutions as part of an effort to
rebuild confidence in the island's financial sector in late December.
It had been racked by several scandals in the latter half of 1995, one
of which led to the censure of the central bank governor.

The series of scandals began in late July with a NTdollars 20 billion
run on the Changhua City Fourth Credit Co-operative after exposure of
embezzlement by its general manager for stock speculation that
ultimately led to the co-operative's absorption into the Taiwan Co-
operative Bank (TCB). Since then, a number of farmers associations'
credit branches have also experienced bank runs.

No sooner had this storm calmed than a NTdollars 10 billion run hit the
Taipei-based International Bills Finance Co (IBFC) in early August in
the wake of the arrest of a 29-year-old IBFC dealer on charges of
forgery and embezzlement in another stock market speculation scandal,
which included the state-run Bank of Taiwan among its victims.

In early December, the private Overseas Chinese Bank (OCB), in which
the finance ministry is the largest stockholder with 14.7%, suffered a
run of over NTdollars 10 billion when local media reported that a bank
shareholder had allegedly borrowed more than NTdollars 6 billion
without adequate collateral.

Former OCB executive director Liang Po-hsun, a construction tycoon, was
forced to resign his executive post in the wake of the scandal and the
bank was stabilised with the aid of a rescue package by local banks,
but may face prosecution.

Although the impact of these events has so far been limited, their
occurrence has sparked official and private concern for the health of
the financial system and criticism of alleged slow reaction and poor
supervision on the part of monetary authorities.

In September, the Executive Yuan (cabinet) approved administrative
punishments for 54 officials in connection with the Changhua and IBFC
scandals, including Deputy Finance Minister Chen Mu-tsai and Deputy
Central Bank of China Governor Chin Cheng-hsiung.

The Control Yuan, the highest government watchdog organ, followed by
voting on 29 December to censure Central Bank of China Governor Sheu
Yuan-tung and six other acting or retired officials of the Bank of
Taiwan for the IBFC affair. Moreover, Premier Lien Chan instructed the
finance ministry and the central bank to develop a plan to intensify
monitoring of the island's over 4,000 financial institutions. On 28
December, Finance Minister Lin Chen-kuo and Central Bank of China
Governor Sheu Yuan-dong issued a draft programme to intensify
inspection and monitoring of over 4,000 financial institutions and
dealing with financial crises through a new division of monitoring
responsibilities among the finance ministry, the central bank, the
Central Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC) and local governments.

Under the plan, the Taiwan Co-operative Bank will no longer supervise
basic level financial institutions, such as credit co-operatives or
farmers and credit branches of fishermen's associations.

From 1 July 1996, the CDIC will monitor such institutions which have
joined the insurance deposit programme, and local governments (namely,
the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taipei City and Kaohsiung
City) will be responsible for supervising non-CDIC member institutions
in their districts.

Responsibility for monitoring and crisis management over the island's
banks (including overseas branches) will be divided as follows:

* The Ministry of Finance will monitor new commercial banks established
after 1991 and the state-managed Farmers' Bank of China, the Chang Hwa
Commercial Bank and the Taiwan Enterprise Bank;

* The Central Bank of China will supervise the rest of the domestic
banking sector, including the state-run Chiao Tung Bank, the Export-
Import Bank of China, the Bank of Taiwan, the Land Bank of Taiwan, the
TCB, the Hua Nan Commercial Bank, the First Commercial Bank, and the
International Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).

Lin stated that, beginning 1 July 1996, branches of foreign banks
originating in Europe, the Americas and Africa will be inspected by the
finance ministry, while the remainder will be monitored by the central
bank.

The finance ministry will monitor the entire insurance sector, while
the central bank will oversee inspection of all bills finance
companies.

Lin also said that the deputy finance minister and deputy CBC governor
will jointly head a MOF-CBC financial inspection oversight committee
that will be empowered to adjust the method and rate of inspections.

Lin added that top executives of financial institutions will be
required to attend inspection meetings and that the finance ministry
will push to have internal auditors responsible not to management but
to the boards of directors or examiners to improve the quality of
internal auditing.

Lin also stated that his ministry would propose a new law to separate
the credit function from the island's farmers and fishermen's
association to bring these operations under the inspection system.

Sheu added that 'this is not a division of powers but an arrangement to
enhance the effectiveness of inspection and monitoring'.

'This is the first stage of improvement of the monitoring and
inspection system,' Sheu said. 'After a year or two, we will review to
make further improvements.'

Lin said that both agencies agreed that 'establishing an unitary agency
for monetary inspection is not feasible at present'.

In the meantime, prospects for passage by the Legislative Yuan of a
proposed statute to liberalise the personnel management of state-run
banks remain dim, he noted.

Hua Nan Commercial Bank General Manager Chien Hung-tao said the
scandals serve as 'a warning that banks need to continuously upgrade
management practices'.

'The Changhua City co-operative case was clearly one of wrong-doing by
top management, while the IBFC scandal was created by a working-level
trader,' Chien noted. 'Obviously internal auditing and management
structures need to be strengthened in all banks.'

Chien added that Hua Nan was now adopting a policy of moving employees
to new posts every two to three years and urging branch managers to
heighten awareness. 'Times are no longer so relaxed as before and you
can't blindly trust employees,' he warned. One banking analyst noted
that the finance ministry feels that 'it would be very difficult to get
statutes on firewalls to control affiliated trading between financial
units of conglomerates passed by the Legislative Yuan now as such
proposals would spark sharp opposition from the private banks'.

However, the analyst related that the finance ministry and central bank
'are already surveying conglomerate assets and their utilisation
quietly, even if they will not release such information openly'.

'But if the banking and other laws aren't revised, such problems will
continue to haunt the financial system,' he warned.

A watershed may occur, for good or ill, shortly as many analysts
anticipate a major reshuffling of the finance ministry and central bank
when a new cabinet is appointed.

President Lee Teng-hui is obliged to appoint a new premier in early
February in response to last December's election of a new Legislative
Yuan, but any premier confirmed by the legislature in February will
play a caretaker role through Taiwan's first direct Presidential
election on 23 March, after which the new president will have the
option of naming a new premier.

In the meantime, depositors may be finding their own solution to
uncertainty. According to central bank data, basic financial
institutions lost nearly NTdollars 175 billion in deposits from August
to November last year, while deposits in the island's postal savings
system rose over NTdollars 83 billion since July to reach a record
NTdollars 1.94 trillion by des lower interest rates.

TAIWAN: SIX FOR THE HIGH JUMP

The government's highest supervisory body, the Control Yuan, decided to
censure Central Bank of China Governor Sheu Yuan-dong and five other
serving or former officials of the central bank and the Bank of Taiwan
in connection with the International Bills Finance Co (IBFC) scandal
last December.

The Control Yuan's impeachment case said that Sheu, who was Bank of
Taiwan chairman until last May, mismanaged personnel relating to the
BoT trust department and did not exercise proper control over the trust
unit.

The Control Yuan brief stated that such mismanagement had sown the
seeds for the subsequent scandal as the former IBFC trader Yang Jui-yen
illegally borrowed NTdollars 39 billion from the BoT trust department.

Sheu declared that he would not resign, and he and the five other
persons impeached denied the charges. 'There are many misunderstandings
and claims not in accordance with fact (in the impeachment),' said
Sheu, who said he will put his case to The Committee on the Discipline
of Public Functionaries of the Judicial Yuan, which will now consider
the degree of punishment.

Professor Yin Nai-ping of the Department of Banking at Taipei's
National Chengchi University said the impeachment amounts to accounting
'to the public for the flurry of financial scandals'.

Yin noted that Sheu would probably not be faced with a severe penalty
'as he was not directly involved in the IBFC case and in fact the
central bank and the finance ministry coped with that scandal
relatively effectively'. He aded: 'But it will definitely hurt his
reputation.'

ASIA NOTES: CHINA'S MARKET LAUNCH

China passed another important financial landmark on 1 January, with
the launch of its unified interbank market.

The new system, being operated by the Foreign Exchange Trading Centre
in Shanghai, enables local banks and financial institutions to lend or
accept short-term deposits of one day up to less than four months.

It is using the same computer network as the foreign exchange market,
linking 35 cities in China. On the first day of trading it linked 27
cities.

'It is a very important step forward with respect to China's financial
reforms,' comments Benny Chiu, research manager of HongkongBank China
Services. He believes all the local banks and financial institutions,
such as investment and trust companies, will use the new market.

Stanley Wong, treasurer of Standard Chartered Bank in Hongkong,
believes that the development of the interbank market system and of
stabilised interest rates will enable a yield curve to be established,
which will in turn enable a forward market for the renminbi to be
developed.

Foreign banks are barred from doing renminbi business and so do not
have access to the new interbank market.

Until now China has had regional interbank markets with differing
operations and mechanisms. The Shanghai market was estimated to have
handled R200 billion (dollars 24 billion)of transactions last year.

Chiu explains that the new national market provides more structure and
formality by unifying the regional markets under the same regulations
and operations. It will also provide more market-based interest rates.

On 1 April, The People's Bank of China will start open market
operations formally, by which it will be able to offer interest rates
and control money supply.

This will enable the authorities to exercise macro-economic control of
the implementation of monetary policy, says Chiu.

Wong explains that, prior to the new system, local banks in China have
tended to lend or borrow among themselves on a city-by-city basis or on
a bilateral basis, lending and passing on surpluses or liquidity among
themselves at bilaterally agreed interest rates.

Difficulties arose in moving liquidity from one city to another. For
example, a shortage in Shanghai could not be readily met by a surplus
in Beijing.

This resulted in a disparity in interest rates, which ranged between 10-
15%.

ASIA NOTES: INDONESIA WIDENS BAND

Bank Indonesia (central bank), in a further liberalisation of
Indonesia's currency, widened the band within which the rupiah would be
freely traded from early January. The Bank has also issued guidelines
for a new regulation allowing banks to do derivatives transactions in
foreign exchange and interest rates, but not in securities and bonds.

The rupiah now trades within a 3% range in the intervention band, up
from 2%, that is, about 66 rupiah around an announced mid-rate, set by
Bank Indonesia against a basket of currencies. The Bank has also
created an inner 2% 'convergence' band, effectively within the 3% band,
for transactions with the finance ministry and government.

Bank Indonesia's recent band widening is the latest in a series which
began in December 1993. The shift creates more autonomy and flexibility
for the implementation of monetary policy.

Bank Indonesia is also pursuing a policy of depreciating the rupiah to
the US dollar by 4-5% a year to maintain export competiveness, since
the country still has a big current account deficit estimated by the
government at dollars 7.94 billion in fiscal 1995-96, or about 3.8% of
gross domestic product.

John Flint, treasury manager with Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation in Indonesia, comments that, given that interest rates in
other Asian countries, such as Thailand and Malaysia, have come down
quite aggressively so far this year, 'the chances are that people
looking for yield enhancement trades will move a little bit more to the
rupiah now.'

ASIA NOTES: WELCOME TO BURMA

The Burmese military government announced in late December that it will
allow foreign banks with representative offices in Rangoon, the
capital, to set up joint ventures with private Burmese banks. It is
reported that foreign banks would have to provide at least 35% of the
equity capital.

The invitation seems to have met with a lukewarm response from most
foreign banks in the country. Foreign bank sources say that most of the
22 foreign banks with representative offices would prefer to have full
branch operations.

Standard Chartered Bank, while looking at the options available, has no
immediate plans to do anything more than run its representative office,
says John Brinsden, resident director for institutional banking for the
sub-region.

Brinsden believes that the Burmese government's move in allowing joint
ventures with foreign banks is 'the first step down the road to their
eventually allowing foreign banks to actually run full branches there -
but that could be another two years or so.'

Besides the 22 foreign banks that already have representative offices,
a further 10 have been issued licences to open such offices. Of the 32
banks, most originate from Asia. The rest include four French banks;
Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corporation and Standard Chartered from the
UK; and Bank of Nova Scotia from Canada.

Burma has two state-owned banks, 11 non-exchange private banks and four
exchange private banks. Government related agents account for a large
number of the shareholders in the four exchange private banks.

The biggest constraint on growth and foreign investment remains the
repressive military government, which in November rejected requests by
the opposition National League for Democracy (NLD), headed by Aung San
Suu Kyi, for dialogue in a constitutional convention. Burma's ruling
military junta has consistently refused to recognise the results of the
1990 general elections, in which the NLD won 80% of the vote.

MACAU: BEIJING BOUNTY

Like Hongkong, Macau is an anomaly in Asia. The enclave, on the South
China coast, represents one of the last two vestiges of European
colonialism in the Chinese empire. In less than 18 months' time it will
be the last such outpost, as the sovereignty of Hongkong returns to
China.

Macau's own transition back to Chinese rule will not occur until 1999
and most observers agree that this will be far smoother than even the
most optimistic predictions for Hongkong's return to the Middle
Kingdom.

These political developments will have repercussions on the banking
sectors of the two regions and on individual banks. The most pressing
credit risks of banks in Hongkong are derived from their vulnerability
to uncertainties surrounding the upcoming transition. Macau banks are
likely to be indirectly affected and this will become one of the most
significant issues for the banks in the coming years.

As a regional and international financial centre, Macau has been
conclusively overshadowed by the breathtaking growth of Hongkong. In
contrast to the British authorities in the territory, which adopted a
laissez-faire policy with regard to financial and banking affairs,
Portugal restricted banks from operating in the enclave, at least until
1982.

During that year, the monetary authorities in Macau implemented a new
banking law which eased restrictions on foreign banks setting up shop
in the enclave and in the following five years, about 10 such banks
opened branches. At the end of 1995, the banking sector comprised six
locally-incorporated banks and 18 foreign banks. Nevertheless, the
difference in the size of the two banking systems is immense: Macau's
total banking assets are just 2% the size of Hongkong's.

Ironically, China's flagship financial institution, the Bank of China,
is by far the largest bank in the enclave, accounting for 33% of the
banking sector's total assets. Moreover, it is the dominant shareholder
of the largest locally-incorporated bank, Tai Fung Bank.

The growing presence of the Bank of China in Macau reflects the closer
ties between the mainland and the enclave in the lead-up to 1999. This
was further manifested on 16 October, 1995 when the Bank of China began
issuing Macau bank notes. Until then, Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU),
the enclave's de facto central bank, was the only bank to perform such
an activity. In the wake of this landmark note issue, the Bank of China
is expected to play a wider role in Macau's monetary affairs, in much
the same manner that it has and continues to do so in Hongkong.

Banks in Macau share many of the same strengths and weaknesses as
locally-incorporated Hongkong banks. They enjoy strong profits derived
largely from handsome earnings on their mortgage lending activities.
With the property market at this stage reasonably strong and
characterised by a low level of defaults, they have been able to boast
strong asset quality. At the same time, however, the banks in Macau
exhibit a noticeable lack of diversification in their assets.

Like their Hongkong counterparts, they are engaged overwhelmingly in
just two business activities: trade finance and property-related
lending. This has been accentuated by the flight of various
manufacturing concerns to South China in search of lower operating
costs. Therefore, while their asset quality now may be strong, the
underlying quality of their assets is quite weak and renders them
vulnerable to a change in the fortunes of the property market. This
issue will become particularly salient in light of both Hongkong's and
Macau's sovereign transition.

As a consequence of the oversupply of residential apartments in Macau,
local banks have been continuing their expansion into South China,
principally through trade finance and syndicated lending, and this has
seen their risk exposures to the region correspondingly rise. The
proportion of China-related credits on Macau banks' books is also
likely to increase in line with growing integration between the enclave
and the mainland and a potential easing of China's monetary policy.

Although they share many of the same characteristics, banks in Macau
are less profitable, less liquid and not as well capitalised as their
Hongkong counterparts. Lending accounts for a greater proportion of
their asset bases, but they have a slightly higher share of loans and
advances geared towards lower risk yet lower yielding trade financing.
On a regional scale, their performance as a group, measured by a
composite weighting of their profitability, liquidity and capital
adequacy is only slightly above average*.

Further opportunities essentially lie in South China, as will become
evident, given the limited prospects for expansion locally. This was
highlighted in the first three quarters of 1995 with the total loans of
the banking sector growing by a very subdued 4.5% compared to the same
period of 1994.

The relationship between banks in Hongkong and Macau go beyond shared
characteristics and operating similarities. Macau's pataca is pegged to
the Hongkong dollar and in a few year's time the territory and the
enclave will be part of the same sovereign state.

In 1983 and 1984, when Sino-British negotiations regarding the future
of Hongkong were at their most tenuous and Hongkong was in the midst of
a recession, this prompted runs on a number of Macau banks.

Given that the Hongkong dollar is pegged to the US dollar, Macau's
interest rate cycle closely follows both Hongkong's and America's. In
1994 and most of 1995, this gave rise to a difficult operating
environment for local banks, with interest spreads being slightly
squeezed.

The close relationship and intricate link between Hongkong and Macau
will clearly be demonstrated over the next two years, with developments
affecting banks in Hongkong likely to have a ripple effect on Macau
banks.

If the socio-political situation of Hongkong or South China takes a
turn for the worse, Macau banks are likely to suffer considerable
hardship. This is despite the fact that Macau's own transition to
Chinese sovereignty is expected to be rather smooth in light of the
fact that relations between Beijing and Lisbon have been more
harmonious than those between London and Beijing.

Portugal even offered Macau back to Beijing in 1974 after the former
turned socialist. Macau's transition is almost regarded as an aside in
comparison to the international attention Hongkong and 1997 is
receiving. The enclave's value in terms of strategic financial
performance is far less than the territory's.

Macau banks will be operating in a period of uncertainty in the
intermediate term for geopolitical reasons clearly beyond their
control. Nevertheless, following an increasingly closer degree of
integration between the enclave and South China, the banks' assets are
set to expand if the economic conditions are ripe. At this stage there
is unlikely to be a sharp shift in the composition of the banks' loan
books and thus mortgage lending and trade finance will very much
continue to characterise their business activities.

In this context will be the growing influence of the Bank of China both
in its actual operations in the enclave and greater say in Macau's
monetary affairs. In the meantime, the world is watching events
unfolding as its high profile neighbour which will undoubtedly have a
significant impact on developments in Macau.

LATIN NOTES: ZEDILLO'S BIG BAILOUT

The loan restructuring at Mexico's leading bank Banamex marks a turning
point in the Zedillo government's effort to resolve the post-
devaluation crisis in the financial system.

Proponents of this move view the Banamex agreement as a big step toward
ending the year-old crisis, but critics fear the deal establishes a
precedent for mushrooming subsidies to the banking industry.

At issue is the government's agreement in mid-December to issue 10-year
bonds to Banamex for dollars 2 billion in Banamex loans, acquired by
the official bank deposit insurance agency Fobaproa. Payments on an
estimated 43% of the loans sold to Fobaproa were already past due, with
most of the remaining debts classified as high-risk and many expected
to become non-performing during 1996. The Banacci financial group that
controls Banamex will increase its capitalisation by dollars 1.1
billion during 1996.

Even critics of the deal agree that this will enhance the quality of
Banamex's loan portfolio and substantially improve its capital ratio.
At the time of the deal, Banamex management estimated that gross past-
due loans had increased from Mexdollars 15.3 billion at end-September
to more than Mexdollars 17 billion by December. The loan sale to
Fobaproa reduced the bank's past-due loans by more than a third; the
ratio of past-due to total loans outstanding fell from 12.8% at end-
September to 9% or less.

Banamex's commitment to a capital increase should boost its capital
adequacy ratio from 10.4% in December to 15% when recapitalisation is
completed this year. About half of the dollars 1.1 billion capital
infusion is expected to be raised through equity and debt issues in
capital markets; over dollars 500 million will be generated from
internal funding sources.

The biggest concern raised by the Banamex operation is the precedent
that it establishes for expanded federal support for bank restructuring
this year.

The quid pro quo of government purchase of troubled loans in exchange
for bank commitments to recapitalisation was established in mid-1995 by
federal agreements to buy dollars 1.5 billion debts from Probursa and
Serfin.

But the extension of the bank-support programme to the country's
largest - and one of its most financially sound - financial
institutions signals that all banks will be offered the option of
negotiating a similar agreement.

Banco Mexicano, a financially solid subsidiary of the Invermexico
financial group, followed Banamex with a deal in late December to sell
dollars 900 million in loans to Fobaproa and pledge a capital increase
of dollars 500 million by the end of 1996.

Questions over the scale of the government's open-ended fiscal
commitment to bank bail-outs will intensify in the wake of the Zedillo
government's decision to extend the ADE programme - which subsidises
interest relief for individual and small-business debtors - by three
months to end-April.

About 75% of an estimated 2.1 million problem loans targeted for ADE
relief - mainly credit card and mortgage debt - had been restructured
by year-end 1995. The hike in interest rates in the fourth quarter has
magnified the cost of the subsidy for the fixed concessionary rates
applied to restructured debts, and the extension appears certain to
push ADE costs above the dollars 2.3 billion budgeted.

LATIN NOTES: BANESPA GOOD HEALTH RECIPE

The Cardoso government's decision to end the year-old federal
intervention in Sao Paulo's troubled state bank Banespa provides a
symbol of the improving economic and banking outlook for Brazil.

While the return of Banespa management to state control marks a setback
for reformers who favoured outright privatisation, most analysts credit
the Cardoso government for implementing long overdue measures to slash
staffing and restructure assets that have left Brazil's largest state
bank in better financial health.

The Banespa action in mid-January helped a resurgence in economic
confidence, fuelled by further progress on the government's agenda for
social security, fiscal and administrative reforms that underpin its
stabilisation and growth programme.

A flurry of concern in mid-1995 over deterioration in the current
account balance and inflation has faded as the trade account has
returned to surplus and price growth has slowed. Monthly surpluses in
the second semester narrowed the trade deficit for the first 11 months
of 1995 to dollars 3.1 billion, while consumer inflation in 1995 fell
to a 22-year low at 23.2%.

And with international reserves hovering near dollars 50 billion, the
real was holding firm above 0.97 units to the dollar in January.

The banking industry should benefit from the improving economic
environment as stabilisation in current account and inflation trends
widens the central bank's room for easing interest rates lower in 1996.

President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's has indicated that he will move
cautiously in cutting interest rates. But with GDP growth this year
expected to approach 5% and minimal risk of an inflation resurgence,
banks should show steady growth in lending activity over 1996.

LATIN NOTES: NOW, WHERE WERE WE?

Argentina's commercial banks began this year roughly where they left
off in December 1994, before the Mexican crisis triggered a plunge in
peso osits as Argentine investors scrambled to protect themselves from
devaluation risk by seeking safety in dollars.

After bottoming out around dollars 37 billion in March 1995, Argentine
bank deposits have clawed back lost ground to reach dollars 45.1
billion in peso and dollar holdings - about the level on the eve of the
Mexico scare.

Investors' persistent preference for hard currency is evident in the
steady climb of dollar deposits to more than dollars 24 billion, some
dollars 3.2 billion higher than peso deposits in the banking system.

Industry analysts expect growth in peso and dollar deposits to continue
as economic growth recovers, setting the stage for a revival in dormant
corporate lending business by the year end. The fall in consumer
inflation to less than 2% in 1995 points to further decline in interest
rates from their March 1995 peak.

MEXICO: NO EASY RECIPE

Q The Mexican government has built an extensive - and costly - safety
net of programmes to prevent the considerable liquidity and asset
quality blems of the banking industry over the past year triggering a
wider crisis in the financial system.

What has been the level of government financial assistance to the banks
over the past year and how much will it need to allocate to support
programmes in 1996? Also, how would you characterise the government's
current policy on bank intervention, especially in the light of recent
moves regarding Inverlat and Banamex?

A Preventing or containing a financial crisis is not an end in itself.
The ultimate goal of the authorities should always be the protection of
the real sector of the economy and, thereby, the welfare of the
population. However, an immediate objective is maintaining and
strengthening the financial system, which has the banking system at its
core. This is essential to enable banks to efficiently perform their
main role, credit intermediation, without which the functioning of any
modern economy would be impossible.

Managing financial crises is never easy, nor susceptible to recipes of
general application. However, there are some basic principles to be
observed, among which the following must be included: preventing the
development of systemic risk; avoiding an unwarranted expansion of
central bank credit; shunning political and other pressures to bail out
stockholders of financial institutions while, at the same time,
protecting the legitimate interests of both creditors and borrowers;
minimising the fiscal costs that may be inherent to the policies
adopted to overcome the crisis and, if feasible, distributing these
costs over a number of years, and interfering the least possible with
the normal functioning of markets.

In order to deal with the impact of the December 1994 devaluation on
commercial banks a comprehensive package was adopted and is currently
being applied. The components of the package are the following: a
dollar liquidity facility; a temporary capitalisation
programme(PROCAPTE); adoption of the Investment Unit (UDI) scheme to
manage the problem of accelerated, and not contractually foreseen,
amortisation of credits in real terms caused by inflation; easing of
some restrictions concerning participation in the capital of commercial
banks in order to attract new investors, both foreign and domestic;
acquisition of a fraction of banks' loan portfolios in a two to one
ratio of new capital paid in by stockholders, so as to provide an
incentive for banks to maintain adequate levels of provisions and
capitalisation; strengthening of supervision; and a debtor support
programme(ADE) to encourage additional loan restructuring, prevent the
development of non-payment practices, provide interest relief and offer
a legal truce to debtors.

The projected fiscal cost represents a net present value of Mexdollars
90.8 billion (dollars 12.1 billion), equivalent to 5.5% of estimated
GDP for 1995. The fiscal cost of the ADE programme in 1995 was absorbed
via the application of a fraction of the fiscal surplus generated in
that year. The remainder, an amount which in net present value terms is
equivalent to 4.7% of 1995's expected GDP, will be generated gradually
throughout the life of the programmes. A portion of this cost will be
financed by the commercial banks themselves.

Direct intervention in troubled institutions has been limited to a few
cases. Recourse to this sort of action by the National Banking and
Securities Commission takes place only to the extent that other
options, such as merger or outright sale, are viable at all or within a
reasonable term. Banks' stockholders lose their investment, or see
their participation diluted, should the state, through FOBAPROA, become
an owner. In that eventuality, FOBAPROA would only be a temporary owner
as it would immediately proceed to find new suitable shareholders.

Q Monetary policy has been the focus of considerable controversy and
debate over the past year. Some complain that an excessively tight
policy threatens to deepen the recession, others feel the fall in the
Cetes (Treasury Bill) rate last September may have been too rapid.

What are the primary objectives for monetary policy in 1996 and what
benchmarks has the Banco de Mexico established for money supply growth?
A As stated in the Law of Banco de Mexico, the primary objective of
monetary policy is price stability. Consequently, it is imperative that
monetary policy in 1996 be aimed at fostering the convergence of the
public's inflation expectations towards the objective announced by the
government. To this end, central bank policy should be defined in terms
of a variable under its control and which the public can easily
monitor. For 1996, as in the previous year, Banco de Mexico decided to
set a limit on the increase of its net domestic assets. It is expected
that the expansion of the demand for base money in 1996 will be in the
order of Mexdollars 18 billion. The needed growth of the supply of base
money will originate from the accumulation of net international
reserves and a maximum increase of Mexdollars 15 billion in net
domestic assets of the central bank.

In its monetary programme for 1996, a widely distributed document,
Banco de Mexico announced quarterly limits on the growth of its net
domestic assets.

These limits take into account the seasonal behaviour of the demand for
base money and the expected path of net international reserves
accumulation.

It must be stressed that in accordance with the stabilisation programme
adopted by Mexico, monetary policy, combined with other measures taken
by the Federal Government, has been geared towards attaining, among
others, two very important objectives: a steady reduction of the
inflation rate and lower interest rates. The latter, however, will not
be achieved by artificial means but rather as a consequence of
generating expectations of declining inflation. It is a mistake to
compare, as some analysts do, the level of the Cetes rate in the most
recent primary auction (about 41%) with the rate of past annual
inflation observed at end-year 1995. It is prospective inflation that
matters. If the market expects lower inflation in the future, it is
only natural for nominal interest rates to fall.

Q The Zedillo government established a 1996 consumer inflation target
of 20.5% and GDP growth target of 3% in the document accompanying the
federal budget last November. Do you see the inflation target as
realistic and how will the central bank balance the conflicting demands
of curbing inflation and stimulating growth during 1996?

A Mexico's experience, in line with those of many other countries,
confirms that monetary policy makes its best contribution to economic
growth and employment when it is aimed at achieving price stability.

Banco de Mexico will assuredly contribute its full efforts in order to
accomplish the economic programme's 20.5% annual inflation objective.

Nonetheless, having an explicit inflation target does not necessarily
imply that the central bank is making a projection of future price
behaviour. It is a well-known fact that a central bank cannot directly
control changes in the general price level. Its influence over
inflation is indirect, through the effects of its actions on aggregate
demand. Furthermore, there are several variables, not under the
influence of central banks, which have a marked incidence on the
behaviour of prices. In sum, the proper monetary policy is a necessary
and useful, although not sufficient condition to ensure the attainment
of an inflation target.

To the extent that the average exchange rate in 1996 coincides with
that included in the programme, and indirect taxes, prices of goods and
services produced by the public sector, foreign inflation, and
international prices of raw materials remain roughly in line with the
projections in the economic programme, an annual inflation of 20.5% is
within reach. At any rate, the monetary programme was designed on the
basis of the 20.5% inflation assumption and will not be modified.

Q The peso's devaluation of more than 120% from December 1994 to year
end 1995 has ushered in a sweeping overhaul in exchange rate policy.

What is the Banco de Mexico's current exchange rate policy, what
criteria will guide future interventions and to what extent will the
Bank permit the peso to depreciate during 1996 especially with the
government's stated goal of an average exchange rate of 7.7 new pesos
to the dollars?

A On 22 December, 1994 Mexico adopted a floating exchange rate regime.
From mid- March to October 1995, Banco de Mexico did not intervene in
the foreign exchange market. However, during the last two months of
that year it did so four times in order to reduce unwarranted
volatility in the market.

Like most central banks, Banco de Mexico recognises that occasional
interventions may be necessary to smooth out erratic movements in the
exchange rate. Sporadic interventions do not mean that Banco de Mexico
has a real exchange rate objective. The market determines the exchange
rate and, therefore, the latter is by definition an equilibrium rate.
In that sense, the exchange rate can be neither undevalued nor
overvalued.

In order to present the 1996 Budget to Congress, which includes items
denominated in foreign currency, the government had to have an estimate
of the average nominal exchange rate for the year. However, this
estimate, 7.7 pesos per dollar, should not be interpreted as a goal. It
is not a revealed specific support level for the peso which the central
bank is bound to defend.

Q Do you believe that the existing central bank law goes far enough in
establishing and protecting the Banco de Mexico's role as an
independent monetary authority?

A In August 1993, Congress approved an amendment to the Mexican
Constitution whereby the central bank was granted autonomy. The new law
for Banco de Mexico was passed and came into effect on 1 April 1994.

For autonomy to be effective, the central bank must have control over
all of its credit operations. Thus, the Constitution states that no
authority may order Banco de Mexico to grant financing, either through
credit of any sort or through acquisition of assets.

One of the foundations of the autonomy of Banco de Mexico is the
independence of judgment of the persons responsible for conducting the
bank's affairs. Thus, its administration has been entrusted to a five-
member board chaired by a governor. The governor is named for a six-
year term starting at the beginning of the fourth calendar year of the
six-year presidential term, while the four deputy governors are
appointed for overlapping eight-year terms, each one being designated
every two years.

Thus, the composition of the board assures the stability and continuity
of policy that is brought about by a long-term perspective in the
setting of policy. Board members can only be removed for reasons of
serious offence, as defined in the law.

Existing central bank legislation in Mexico indeed goes far enough in
protecting the central bank's role as an independent monetary
authority.

Critics should read the pertinent Mexican legislation and modify their
characterisation of Banco de Mexico as an institution subservient to
the federal government's economic and political interests.

Those who claim that in spite of the respective legal provisions
autonomy has not been effective in practice bear the burden of proof.
Such assertions overlook the fact that for a long period Banco de
Mexico has not granted net financing to the federal government.

At times, critics seem to argue that central bank autonomy means having
the power to select the exchange rate regime. In Mexico, as in nearly
all countries, that decision rests on the government.

Q Do you believe that present international support (from the US, IMF,
World Bank and other institutions) is sufficient to preserve exchange
rate and broader economic stabilisation during 1996?

A In the weeks following the December 1994 devaluation, financial
markets reacted violently, as fears mounted that the government and
other borrowers would not comply with payments to non-residents due in
the short-term.

Mexico's crisis had immediate effects upon several markets, mainly in
Latin America, and there was a serious risk of systemic repercussions.
The gravity of the situation called for exceptional international
assistance. Thus, a financial package was put together with the help of
the United States, Canada, the International Monetary Fund and the Bank
for International Settlements. This package has allowed Mexico to
comply with its obligations and has thus facilitated the stabilisation
of financial markets. To date, Mexico has drawn dollars 20.8 billion
dollars net, far less than originally estimated, and in all likelihood
will not need additional support. As early as May 1995, renewed
possibilities for placing Mexican paper in international markets have
emerged and are gradually increasing.

GHANA: RERUN THE GOLD RUSH

Long known mainly for its gold and cocoa exports, Ghana has
restructured and diversified its economy enough to go from backwater to
bona fide emerging market in ten years.

In a business climate that is already flourishing by Africa's humble
standards, new opportunities are arising in what is being called the
continent's most ambitious privatisation effort. The Jerry Rawlings
government is working closely with the World Bank to sell off the
country's largest bank, two smaller ones it also owns, and other key
state assets in communications, transport, insurance and other sectors.

No matter how much promotion is done, no one expects it will be easy to
convince potential buyers to invest in Africa. But the run-up is
nevertheless providing extensive advisory work for the handful of
strong privately owned banks that already exist in Ghana. Add the heavy
demand for financing that the country's private banks already face,
plus the related business they see via the small but growing local
stock market, and you have a serious operational challenge for the
people who run them.

The busy environment has begun attracting experienced international
talent to Accra, where a decade of sustained 5% annual gross domestic
product (GDP) growth has brought Mercedes SLs, satellite dishes and
cellular phones popping up alongside the more traditional trappings of
African life.

In have come people like CJ Best, a veteran US banker who arrived in
1994 to manage CAL Merchant Bank under the auspices of an international
public/private sector co-operative venture called the African
Management Services Co. (AMSCO). 'It's an exciting time to be here,' he
said. 'The whole economy has become much more dynamic. Ghana has the
potential to become a focal point for all of Anglophone West Africa.'

From headquarters in Amsterdam just across from the ING tower, AMSCO
uses a combination of government and corporate funds to help owners of
promising African companies locate new full-time managers with the hard-
to-find skills they need. It then provides them with training grants
and networking opportunities throughout their contracts to help build
competitiveness in their firms.

CAL was launched by a private Ghanaian group that had IFC financing in
1990 when the government first allowed private competition in banking.
Since then it has built up dollars 39.4 million in assets and strong
local market shares in trade finance, capital markets and advisory
services. It needed a general manager who could build it into an
institution that top clients in New York and London would use.

For that AMSCO found them Best, who had specialised in African finance
for more than 20 years at Chase Manhattan, the New York branch of
United Bank for Africa, and elsewhere. His job is to help build CAL's
growth into the international merchant bank of choice at a time when
Ghana is poised to attract additional private investment from abroad.

He plans to devote much of 1996 to giving all his employees
comprehensive training through resources provided by AMSCO's Management
Development Fund, whose donors include bilateral aid agencies from the
US and Europe, and hopefully turn the bank into a globally competitive
institution that will set a precedent for Ghana and all of Africa.

'A lot of my work involves training by example, both on questions of
overall management and specific needs such as credit analysis, all the
various elements of risk and so on,' he said.

'We've historically provided a lot of letters of credit to Ghanaian
companies, and now are building up a corporate finance group that
should be at full strength in about 12 months.'

CAL is a rarity in Ghanaian banking in that it has no government
ownership.

It and the other local niche players which deal with an international
clientele such as Ecobank, Databank, and the local affiliates of
Barclays and Standard Chartered, have a unique vantage point on the
planned privatisation of the country's largest financial institutions.
They are closely involved in plans to prepare larger competitors for
sale under contracts funded by the World Bank, which recently said the
small private banks were 'more adept and efficient at financial
intermediation' than those the government owns.

Topping the for-sale list is Ghana Commercial Bank, the country's
largest with dollars 141 million in Tier One capital, almost half of
the country's banking assets, and an established international
presence.

Two smaller domestic lenders, Social Security Bank and National
Investment Bank, also are on the block. The idea is to bring the
government shareholding down to 40% in each case, with 30% being listed
on the stock exchange and another 30% going to a foreign strategic
partner who can bring in new management sophistication and an
international network to support the country's growing export strengths
in gold, timber, cocoa and other commodities.

All three banks could spell interesting opportunities if offered at the
right price. But investors are wary of 1994's 70% inflation and 40%
currency devaluation against the dollar, and few international banks
have shown interest lately in buying minority stakes in emerging
markets. Except for South Africa, they seem unwilling to take on
Africa's risks, especially in the wake of the Meridian-BIAO collapse.
That leaves much promotional work for the World Bank-funded advisory
teams.

Best's team at CAL, for example, is working with Johannesburg-based
Nedcor and KPMG Peat Marwick to get National Investment Bank ready for
sale.

Another South African institution, Standard Bank, is working with
Coopers & Lybrand on a similar effort for Social Security Bank, while
Credit Commercial de France and Price Waterhouse are working on Ghana
Commercial Bank. No one yet knows if any eventual buyers can be
attracted from Europe, Asia, the US, South Africa, or anywhere else, or
what sort of incentive packages they might require.

'If any place in Africa outside of South Africa is attractive to
international commercial banks, Ghana would be,' said World Bank
financial sector specialist Elie Saleeby. 'But the question is whether
their strategic plans leave them in a mood for buying anywhere.'

The privatisations are intended to be the crowning achievement of the
Financial Sector Adjustment Programme (FINSAP), a restructuring effort
that has received dollars 200 million of World Bank funding since 1987.
It has prompted big changes in Ghana's state-run institutions,
including a cleaning up of balance sheets through transfer of non-
performing public and private sector assets to a government trust,
reform of daily operations and introduction of new prudential
regulations.

'Noteworthy achievements have been made in Ghana,' Saleeby said. 'It is
a financial sector where significant efficiencies have been introduced,
although there is still more to be done. It's emerging fast, and like
all emerging markets there will be hiccups from time to time. But the
greatest challenge is to maintain momentum, and they've done a fairly
good job of maintaining it so far.'

The goal is to get Ghana's leading banks up to international standards.
The World Bank argues that can only come with the participation of top
international partners as core investors. Emerging market bank watchers
say such transactions can be a good way for the host institution to
obtain valuable capital, access to new management, and global
operational links that it cannot get at home.

Polish export finance specialist BRE, for example, sold a 21% stake to
Commerzbank a year ago, thus gaining 'a leg up on its domestic and
international competition' and a reputation as 'the most innovative
Polish bank' in the view of Creditanstalt Investment Bank analysts. ING
and Allied Irish Bank hold similarly sized chunks of other Polish
banks, and in December GE Capital Services paid dollars 87 million for
a controlling 32.5% stake in Hungary's Budapest Bank, which Credit
Suisse had considered but then rejected a year earlier.

That, though, was Europe. Africa may be of far less interest to
strategic investors of that calibre from Western Europe and the US,
perhaps opening a door for banks from South African banks to buy their
way into Ghana. How much it would cost is unknown, but sources close to
the process say the transactions could take another year or more to
conclude, and may require deferred payment plans of other sizeable
incentives. The Rawlings government has meanwhile already floated 30%
of Social Security Bank on the local stock exchange, and now may do the
same with the two other banks on its list.

Meanwhile, CS First Boston and Ecobank have also just begun World Bank-
funded advisory work on the upcoming privatisation of Ghana Telecom,
set to be the biggest divestiture since 1994's dollars 450 million sale
of part of the state holding in Ashanti Goldfields to portfolio
investors through a GDR and local capital market issue. Ghana Airways
and the Tema oil refinery are also set for sale. It all adds up to big
business for the country's few private banks.

BARCLAYS TESTS BARCLAYZONE

Barclays Bank has launched a three-month pilot to test the acceptance
of an interactive share dealing branch system. The touch-screen
multimedia system, called BarclayZone, provides a two-way video link
between the customer and Barclays Stockbrokers based in Glasgow. It
provides information, advice and facilities for share registration and
dealing. The pilot will take place in three branches and will test
customers' appetite for such a service with the possibility for
extension to other services such as taxation services, wills, unit
trusts, portfolio management and travel or health insurance.

A successful pilot will also see BarclayZone sites opening in airports,
train stations and out of town shopping centres.

BarclayZone has accounted for a 'significant investment'. It was
developed by Barclays Multimedia, a division of Barclays Group
Operations Technology, which was set up in mid-1992 by Joseph de Feo,
head of Barclays' IT department. It is the latest in a series of remote
banking services that were launched by Barclays in 1995.

Those included a multimedia kiosk developed in conjunction with Thomas
Cook to provide travel and related financial services, a home shopping
service via the Internet called BarclaySquare and a home banking
service via PC for personal customers, called Barclays PC Banking,
available at the end of this month.

REUTERS LAUNCHES KOBRA

Reuters, the news, information and dealing room systems' vendor, has
launched a software package, Kobra, to provide users with tools to
create their own information selection, manipulation and display. Kobra
enables users, with a constant standard display, to mix information
from different information sources on one screen.

Based on object-oriented technology, whereby programs are broken up
into modules (objects) and functions, Kobra integrates different types
of information (data, text and graphics) in real time.

Kobra comes in four different versions targeting different levels of
user.

Run mode provides users with access to pre-arranged displays.

Montage mode is for more specialised users to build their own displays.
Link mode builds on functionality provided by the Montage mode but
provides links between items coming in from different sources.

Development mode is designed as a toolkit for creating objects that can
be used on any of the other levels of workstation.

Reuters has also ventured further into the information superhighway by
acquiring a 2.5% stake in Yahoo, a software browser for the Internet.
This extends Reuters' policy of supplying news services on a wholesale
basis to various Internet suppliers (including Yahoo, the Microsoft
Network and Compuserve); a relationship analogous to Reuters supplying
news services to newspapers.

Peter Thomas, director media relations, Reuters, says: 'We see the
Internet as an opportunity for us but, as everybody else, we continue
to research the best way for it to be utilised'. He continues: 'Because
of its performance and security issues it is not something that we can
directly use at this stage, but technology is moving very fast'.

PRICE OF LOTUS NOTES CUT

Lotus Corporation has changed the pricing structure of its leading
messaging and groupware product, Lotus Notes, which is used by more
that 3.3 million people. The wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM (The
Banker, 7/95, p89), has cut the price of the desktop version of Lotus
Notes by more than half (58%) in an attempt to 'accelerate sales and
deployment' of the product.

However, Lotus has increased the price of the Notes server products,
required to run Notes in the network environment, to bring them more in
line with other client-server products which use a lower client cost
and a higher server cost, according to Jim Moffat, communications'
product manager, Lotus (UK). Before the announcement the client and the
server products' pricing structure was the same.

'Because of the performance enhancements to the product, we are
supporting many more users for our server, and because customers buy
many more clients than servers, the cost of ownership is actually going
down drastically,' says Moffat.

The announcement came prior to the shipment of Notes Release 4 which
started last month in the US and Europe. The product includes new
features such as intelligent agents to make it easier to store, and
navigate through, information; Internet access via the InterNotes Web
Navigator; and tools for developing Web applications. Lotus also has a
new Notes Mail client.

NEW DERIVATIVES MESSAGING STANDARDS

SWIFT, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication,
has introduced a new series of derivatives message standards. In
conjunction with the International Swaps and Derivatives Association
(ISDA), the trade association for over-the-counter derivatives, SWIFT
has introduced message standards for single currency interest rate swap
confirmation, cross currency interest rate swap confirmation and
interest rate reset confirmation.

TELERATE LIVE CHANGES

In separate announcements, Dow Jones Telerate announced that it is
amalgamating its dealing room television service, Telerate Live, with
the service transmitted by its majority owned subsidiary, European
Business News (EBN).

Telerate claims that under the new arrangement the price for the
service will be free and the coverage of the service will be extended
from the UK to include the Continent. The announcement also means that
Telerate no longer needs pay EBN to produce its TV service. Production
is now shared with Flextech, a subsidiary of US's TCI, which owns 30%
of EBN.

Dow Jones will continue to support Dow Jones Investor Network the
forerunner for Telerate Live which is broadcast in the US.

Bloomberg, on the other hand, has announced the availability of its
dealing room television service to the European market. It intends the
service to be transmitted to all its customers' terminals free of
charge. Bloomberg believes the pricing structure will encourage more
people to take its terminals.

There is an appetite for such TV services in the dealing room but price
is a key issue. Dow Jones Telerate may have miscalculated by charging
for their service. A city insider adds: 'I do not think that Dow Jones
developed separate programme material that was so new in its content
and presentation that made it of value to the City'.

BOLERO CHOOSES SWIFT

Bolero, a pan-European initiative for the automation of commercial
trade documentation, has selected SWIFT to build the main component of
its system, the central registry. The registry, which sits at the heart
of the Bolero system, is designed to store and maintain information
about all transactions going through Bolero.

The announcement comes following the withdrawal from the scheme of the
previous central registry developers, Cable & Wireless, on the grounds
that they were hoping to set up their own competing service.

Cable & Wireless had participated in, and partly sponsored, the Bolero
project and pilot which comprised 25 multi-national organisations and
six banks.

The project was designed to prove the technical feasibility of the
automation of bills of lading.

Other sponsors included the European Commission which paid 50% of the
estimated ECU3.7 million pilot and Unisource (an alliance between the
telecoms suppliers of Sweden, Holland, Spain and Switzerland). The
pilot came to a successful end in mid-September.

TFS PARTS FROM SYNTEGRA

Thomson Financial Services (TFS) has pulled out of its year old
partnership with Syntegra, the systems' integration division of British
Telecom. The partnership was set up after the Bank of England's
appointment of Syntegra and Swift as network providers to the UK
securities industry's electronic share settlement system, Crest.

Syntegra and TFS entered the agreement on the proviso that Syntegra
would develop the SettleNet service whereas Thomson would at a later
stage bring expertise and added value to that service.

Explains Kevin Milne, director Thomson Financial Services:
'Unfortunately, despite our best efforts to reach a detailed contract
with Syntegra, we have been unable to do so. It now looks as though
Syntegra's policy has changed so that an agreement with TFS no longer
looks possible'.

Syntegra was surprised by Thomson's announcement but did not feel the
announcement would affect its positioning which it claims stands at
around 60% of the Crest networking market.

Crestco, the company that owns Crest, has commented that the break-up
does not affect the development of Crest, scheduled to go live on 15
July 1996.

On 15 January network trials began. During that time workstations were
rolled out.

TECHNOLOGY: CONVERT OR CRASH

When European political leaders confirmed the timetable for European
Monetary Union (EMU) at the December Madrid summit, media coverage
focused on the currency's new name and on which countries might meet
the macro-economic convergence criteria by 1999.

Little or no attention was devoted to the practical question of whether
the banks will be ready to meet the timetable. But, whatever the
political and economic hurdles which EMU must overcome, the challenge
of making the necessary changes to computer systems within the banking
industry may prove to be its most serious handicap.

As the sector is already dogged by a constant stream of software
failures, the risk of development problems on IT projects on the scale
of EMU preparation is considerable. This problem will be exacerbated by
a demand for specialist IT skills, which will be in limited supply.

So it is imperative that immediate action should be taken to prepare
for the conversion of banks' computer systems to handle a single
currency, if the deadlines for EMU are to be met. However, continued
uncertainty over the details of the currency changeover is impeding
progress.

EMU will involve largescale enhancement or rewrite of multiple systems
across most parts of a bank, all of which must interrelate and complete
within the same ambitious timescale.

To say there is a significant systems delivery risk is an
understatement - experience suggests there is a certainty of major
systems development failure in many banks and a very high likelihood of
knock-on impact on other projects and business functions. Moreover, if
a software development fails once an irrevocable commitment is made to
EMU, there will be no fallback option if a bank intends trading after E-
Day.

Nor will these likely failings be isolated incidents. The transition to
EMU will be exposed to the weakest link in the chain. If any one member
of a payments network is behind, for example, then an EMU-compatible
network cannot go live. Similarly, if a particular segment of the
banking industry in a given country is not ready, then conversion to
the new currency at the retail level cannot take place.

Failsafe approaches to systems development do exist. However, they
usually involve more protracted development timescales and their
adoption would jeopardise the ambitious deadlines for EMU.

A typical big bank has hundreds of separate systems in operation, each
with its own natural life cycle. The additional step of adapting these
systems for EMU may invalidate previous decisions regarding investment
priorities and shorten the shelf-life of individual systems.

For larger banks, the development costs of preparing IT systems for the
single currency are therefore expected to exceed ECU60 million.

However, following recent cutbacks, banks have little spare capacity in
IT development. For this reason, EMU investment needs to be
incorporated into IT planning cycles as a matter of urgency.

It is important that banks undertake both a 'top down' and a 'bottom
up' assessment of the systems impact of EMU, to arrive at a realistic
understanding of the changes required and a credible assessment of the
timing and resourcing implications.

A recent report, European Monetary Union - critical IT supply-side
issues, produced by CGS, evaluated the demand which EMU will place on
the IT services industry, and whether the industry has the capacity to
meet this demand.

The only comprehensive estimate of the systems cost of EMU to banks
stands at ECU5 billion. Based on this figure and on assessments derived
from experience of working on EMU projects in Germany, the Netherlands
and France, CGS has modelled the likely pattern of demand for IT
services.

While concluding that demand is unlikely to exceed the capacity of the
IT services industry, the CGS findings reveal that considerable
uncertainty still remains because:

* estimates of the demand itself are shrouded in doubt;

* the supply of appropriate IT resources cannot be turned on at will;

* the timing of this sudden demand surge coincides with other demand
peaks.

Although European political leaders have agreed upon the timetable for
EMU, the structures necessary to support the unification process remain
ambiguous and undecided. As yet no legal framework exists and there is
scarcely more clarity now than a year ago on the crucial question of a
dual currency operation.

Moreover, little work has been done to estimate how the demand for Euro-
denominated accounts will affect different sectors of the economy. Even
the characteristics of the new currency itself - such as interest
calculation and capitalisation rules - remain undefined. So to estimate
the full scale of the technological transition with any accuracy is
extremely difficult.

The costs of currency changeover published to date are minimum
estimates only and, in the manner of all such calculations, will tend
to creep upwards as detailed requirements become clearer. Indeed, as
figures were based on the assumption of a Big Bang conversion and a
period of dual currency operation now seems more likely, IT costs are
likely to be inflated by at least 50%.

One thing is certain, however: IT resources are not interchangeable
commodities and specialist skills in limited supply are likely to
present real supply side bottlenecks, despite theoretical capacity in
the IT industry as a whole.

First, larger banks and retail banks are more likely to use in-house
developed systems than smaller and wholesale banks. The danger will be
where internally developed old systems, supporting core parts of the
business, require major redevelopment to accommodate EMU. These are the
very systems where banks may be least able to turn to external
resources to make the necessary changes.

Second, for industry segments such as international branch banking, and
functional areas such as treasury, the critical path for EMU will be
the changes made by package vendors.

From an EMU perspective, packaged software, which is written to be
flexible, is likely to accommodate change more easily than much of the
old bespoke software in banks. Vendors typically have limited financial
resilience, however, and may be reluctant to act until the uncertainty
surrounding EMU is eliminated. And there will undoubtedly be a small
minority of package vendors who experience problems in implementing the
necessary changes for EMU.

As these problems will become clear only late in the day, affected
banks will have little opportunity to develop alternative systems.

Given the scale of effort demanded, it is reasonable to expect banks
across Europe to respond to the prospect of a single currency with a
frenzy of detailed planning and impact assessment. Unfortunately,
progress is far from uniform. This is in part a question of political
geography. In Germany, the Netherlands and France, for example, CGS is
working with banks which have a 'sleeves up' attitude to EMU, based on
a conviction that it will happen. By contrast, at least one UK clearing
bank has devoted neither time, thought, nor resources to the issue,
based on a conviction that, for the UK at least, EMU will not happen.

All European banks face the same dilemma: they can wait until 1998 to
discover whether their country will join EMU, when it will be too late
to implement the systems changes, forcing a negative decision; or they
can invest now for an outcome which may not arise.

It is unclear whether governments, or even banks themselves, appreciate
just how large an effort is involved in preparing banks' IT systems for
EMU, or indeed the urgency of moving on to a war footing today to
ensure that the necessary changes are properly planned and executed.

It is essential that institutions such as central banks and banking
federations should seek to encourage a more coordinated approach to
currency changeover, if the deadlines for the single currency are to be
met.

The first step should be the establishment of guidelines for banks to
assess the systems impact of EMU, combined with milestones at which
banks must explain their plans and monitor progress.

Early warning systems should also be established to enable problems
within individual institutions to be identified swiftly and rectified
before the point of irretrievable breakdown is reached.

Finally, contingency plans should be set in place, perhaps including
software rescue services, temporary bureau processing, or systems loans
between banks.

The significance of IT preparation for EMU should not be
underestimated.

Otherwise, come 1998, some countries may find themselves unable to
participate in EMU, irrespective of their success in achieving economic
convergence criteria.

IT preparation may seem a mundane consideration in comparison to the
continuing debate on the economic and political implications of EMU.

Nevertheless, it is an indisputable fact that no country will be able
to proceed with EMU unless its national banking community has made
sufficient progress in making the necessary modifications to computer
systems.

company

TECHNOLOGY: EUROPE'S IT BOOM

The European IT software and services market is forecast to grow 8% a
year for the next five years, boosting market size to more than dollars
130 billion by the year 2000, according to Input, a global intelligence
and consulting firm.

In another report published in January, European Software and Services
Market - Competitive Analysis, 1995, Input ranks the market shares of
the leading European software and service vendors.

In 1994, the top 20 vendors accumulated revenues of dollars 29.6
billion or 35.7% of the total European market of dollars 83.3 billion.

The report highlights IBM's domination in Europe, which holds the top
slot in France, Germany and the UK. However, it has had its position
eroded in the Nordic region by the formation of groups through
acquisition, for example, Celsius in Sweden; by forceful niche players
in Denmark; and robust defence of their markets by local vendors in
Finland and Norway.

US vendors such as CSC, Andersen Consulting and EDS continue to
dominate tenders for big contracts, except for SAP of Germany.

In the Netherlands, national vendors - Philips, BSO-Origin, Raet,
Roccade, Getronics - have recently announced alliances to extend their
geographical reach and extend their service portfolios.

The report also highlights the emergence of new entrants, for example,
telecommunications vendors, such as MCI and AT&T, which continue to
extend their range of services.

They have done this either through acquisition, for example, MCI
acquired SHL for dollars 1 billion last year; or by the creation of a
professional services unit internally, for example, AT&T Solutions.
AT&T is now in the throes of a major restructuring.

The report observes that some vendors are relationship builders rather
than technology experts. They are using 'value-based pricing' to
differentiate themselves from the competition and establish long-term
relationships with clients based on improvement in business, rather
than IT, metrics.

Among banks worldwide, expenditure for outsourcing, systems integration
and network services is growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR)
of 15%, says Input in a study of worldwide banking information
services.

Outsourcing is increasing at a CAGR of 19%, since banks are now using
outsourcing to handle business functions, network management and
desktop services as well as application and platform systems
operations.

A recent survey by Information Week of the biggest information systems
spenders in Europe in 1995 put three banks among the top 10: Barclays
Bank was the third biggest spender with dollars 1.3 billion; ABN Amro
Holdings was fifth with dollars 960 million; and Deutsche Bank was
ninth with dollars 814 million.

TECHNOLOGY: FRAUD BUSTERS

Last September three fraudsters were jailed for a pounds 120,000
swindle which involved the first home-made high street cash dispenser.
More than 300 bank and building society customers were fooled by the
Halifax 'card cash' dispenser which had been carefully built into the
front of an equally fictitious mortgage broker's premises in East
London.

According to Moira Lavery of lawyers, Dibb Lupton and Broomhead, not
one of the victims realised, as they tried in vain to withdraw cash,
that their personal identification numbers and card details had been
secretly recorded to make counterfeit cards, later used to plunder
their accounts.

While these fraudsters were caught and were jailed for up to four
years, the fake cash dispenser they built highlights the lengths
fraudsters will go to and the ingenuity used against financial
institutions and the public.

The Lebanese loop, a piece of camera film inserted into an automated
teller machine (ATM), is another ingenious device to defraud
cardholders.

For Lorna Harris, head of the fraud prevention unit of the UK's
Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS), the struggle is not
to get complacent and to be ever vigilant against new types of fraud.
Although plastic card fraud can never be fully eradicated, considerable
progress is being made in limiting losses.

In the UK, plastic card fraud losses have declined rapidly in recent
years since the peak in 1991 when losses reached pounds 165.5 million.
In 1994 fraud losses fell to pounds 96.8 million , 25% lower than in
1993, and Lorna Harris says the 1995 figure is expected to show a
further downward trend.

Why the improvement? APACS attributes the success to better co-
operation between banks, retailers and the public and the banks'
authorisation strategy introduced in 1992.

Before then about 10-12% of all plastic card transactions required
authorisation but, since the banks got together and developed an
approach across all retail sectors from April 1994, some 30% of all
card transactions are authorised and fraud losses in certain retail
sectors have fallen as much as 75%.

For banks, fraud is not seen as a competitive issue and the UK banks'
willingness to co-operate with each other, along with the existence of
an umbrella body such as APACS, is viewed as critical to recent
success. Also, the negotiation of a tariff reduction with British
Telecom lowered the cost of authorisation calls for retailers and added
to the spirit of co-operation.

In other countries, card fraud has been rising and global figures for
Visa show a worldwide confirmed fraud total of dollars 675 million for
the year ending June 1995. The US accounts for 58.2% of this figure.
Many countries, however, the US included, do not have an inter-industry
umbrella organisation such as APACS in the UK and many believe that the
lack of such a coordinating vehicle has been the reason behind growing
losses in these countries.

New approaches are being used to limit card losses which are still
dominated by lost/stolen cards which make up 71.1% of the latest UK
losses. The emergence of 'hot card' checking has become invaluable in
cutting fraud.

With 5,000 cards lost or stolen every day out of a total of 86 million
cards issued in the UK the problem for issuers, retailers and customers
has been growing with retail outlets, such as petrol stations, being
the most fraud prone, accounting for around a quarter of all losses.

In the petrol sector, with a high volume of low-value transactions, the
use of on-line authorisation has proved inappropriate and 'hot card'
checking, using a simple swipe mechanism, has proved very effective. A
cashier can tell within seconds whether a credit, debit or cheque
guarantee card is being used fraudulently.

In the last three years hot card files and hot card broadcasting have
helped to combat fraud and provide a low-cost alternative to on-line
authorisation.

The market leader, CardClear, uses terrestrial television networks to
transmit data on lost/stolen cards to retailers and hopes to have 5,300
installed sites by 1997.

CardClear managing director, Brian Raven, says hot card broadcasting
has been endorsed by the UK banks for use in the petrol sector and
since October 1993 Barclaycard's losses (largest UK card issuer) in
that sector have fallen by 54%. Raven also believes that cross-border
fraud is growing (from 13.2% of all losses in 1992 to 21.7% in 1994)
and that the market need for hot-card broadcasting will expand.

CardClear hopes to use satellite broadcasting to carry its service into
continental Europe for use by European banks on a pan-European basis.
In January it announced a three-year agreement with UK petrol retailer,
Mobil, to install its hot card system in Mobil's 700 retail outlets
throughout the country. And Raven hopes to provide a range of
information services to retail and other market sectors .

One recent card innovation, however, does not appear to have been that
effective. The photocard has been described more as a novelty than a
fraud prevention tool and surveys from Norway and New Zealand indicate
that it has no more advantages than a card without a photo.

While two leading banks in the UK have introduced photocards, the take-
up has only been a modest 30% and industry statistics show that only
500,000 photocards have been issued, amounting to just 0.6% of the UK
market.

Sophisticated new technology is also expected to provide significant
improvements in combating card fraud, with new products to be launched
soon.

'Europay believes that neural networks are an important element of its
risk management strategy, along with the introduction of smart cards,'
says Patrick Nelson, business development manager for the UK and
Ireland for Europay International, Europe's leading international
payments organisation.

'Counterfeit fraud is still very much a risk for card issuers and
acquirers across Europe and many local systems are unable to deal with
this problem.

'Europay's new neural net fraud prevention system, set for launch in
the first quarter this year, identifies likely patterns of fraud based
on a merchant's international activity.

'This means that, unlike other neural network systems that analyse
cardholder behaviour, Europay's system is able to flag suspicious
purchases without any delay to the cardholder at the point of sale. By
focusing on fraudulent or targeted merchants such as stores selling
brands of upmarket Swiss watches, the system has the potential to
prevent 12% of international fraud volumes.'

Nelson explains: 'Europay chose neural network technology to complement
its existing fraud prevention measures as it can be quickly adapted to
take into consideration changing circumstances and does not require
strict models to be imposed from the outset. For the past 12 months
Europay has been working with Nestor to refine its system by using data
collected from clearing payment transactions.

'After rigorously testing the system on its mainframes to make sure it
can cope with huge volumes of data, Europay is now in a position to be
able to deliver the system to members either as a stand-alone product
or to complement the technology they have developed themselves.

'By tailoring the system to meet the individual requirements of each
bank, Europay is confident that neural network technology will play a
key role in fighting fraud across Europe.' The smart card also
represents another big step forward in fraud prevention.

France already has a 'chip' card in action which has proved hugely
successful against crime. But it lacks international compatibility. In
the UK, a strategic approach to add chips to plastic cards has been
established through APACS. The so-called ICC project is expected to
have a chip card in production by the end of 1997.

Although the chip project was prompted by concerns over fraud, and the
realisation that magnetic strip technology was reaching the end of its
life cycle, APACS soon became aware that the industry costs of
introducing the new chip technology could not be justified on projected
fraud savings alone.

APACS notes that the recent growth in electronic commerce has placed a
new imperative on financial institutions to be able to offer secure
payment services. The Internet is a prime example of the need for such
secure payments.

Chip-enabled plastic, as such, is a good entry point as the card is a
useful mechanism for transporting the chip which, in turn, is good
technology for storing the tokens necessary for secure services.

The UK aims to have 50% of its point-of-sale terminal base converted to
chip delivering 65% by value of UK transaction turnover by the end of
the millennium. It is anticipated that the whole of the ATM network
will be converted in a similar period or earlier.

The project, which includes the active involvement of the major
schemes, Europay (representing Mastercard), Visa and Switch should
provide a quantum leap in card security.

Smart cards will provide the future technology for the payments
industry.

Initially, experts suggest, the new cards will probably be programmed
with a signature comparison facility, along with an ability to check
the card user's pin code.

But if the technology improves, so-called biometric information could
be included, possibly involving a finger-print scan, dynamic signature
verification, back of hand vein checks, retina scans and - perhaps one
day - voice recognition. This will certainly give tomorrow's fraudsters
plenty to ponder.

THE BOTTOM LINE

The outlook for European economies and financial institutions over the
short, medium and long term bears considerable scrutiny. Uncertainties
and unknowables notwithstanding, the prospect of much faster change
than many people believe or can absorb is, or should be, of major
concern. The fall of communism in the late 1980s led to a cataclysm in
central and eastern Europe; the spillover, the spectacular economic
growth in Asia, and the pervasive impact of technology are factors that
many in western Europe may not have fully taken on board.

As historian Eric Hobsbawm noted in Age of Extremes: 'Perhaps the most
striking characteristic of the end of the twentieth century is the
tension between the accelerating process of globalisation and the
inability of both public institutions and the collective behaviour of
human beings to come to terms with it.'

Although western Europe is not alone in wrestling with these issues,
history and tradition weigh heavily on those in the EU; radical change
will not come easily. Already this year the spectre of economic
weakness and reduced growth has spread across the continent and touched
the strongest economy, Germany. Recent figures showing rising
unemployment, lower growth expectations and expected larger budget
deficits have altered perceptions of Germany and, as a result, Europe
overall.

Analysts believe the near term risk in Europe is one of deflation as
countries, while continuing to keep a hold on inflation, struggle to
meet Maastricht convergence criteria for European economic and monetary
union (EMU) and strong core currencies erode competitiveness.

However, the risks are also much broader. Much is at stake and monetary
union is only one aspect of a Europe needing to reposition itself in a
fast-changing global environment.

But EMU represents the prime challenge now and 1996 is critical if
union is to proceed. By the end of this year experts believe it will be
clear whether January 1999 will be the genuine starting date, and if
the project is viable.

A consensus appears to be emerging that a small group of countries
could start, but that both Germany and France would have to be
included, as anything less than two major economies would not be
acceptable. Will the convergence criteria be met? Some recent views
suggest that Germany and France are now likely to have deficits in 1997
of 3.3% of gross domestic product (GDP), in excess of the official 3.0%
criteria, but that governments would not object to such modest
overshooting.

The problem comes if the current economic downturn persists and the
deficits rise to the 4% of GDP range. Governments would then find it
difficult to accept such large overshootings, even if other criteria
were more or less acceptable. Does Europe, from the handful of
countries that could make 1999 to those which cannot, have the will to
meet the targets and strive for long-term goals?

Alexandre Lamfalussy, president of the European Monetary Institute, the
forerunner of the European Central Bank, made encouraging noises in
late January. 'European citizens are just as mature and well-informed
as financial market operators. Over time experience has taught them to
assess the effects of economic policy decisions from the viewpoint
which goes beyond the short term.

'They are, therefore, aware of the overriding necessity of bringing the
rising trend of public spending on social security, health care and
pension schemes under control - because they know that in the long term
these increases will jeopardise the whole of our social welfare
system.' Unfortunately, Lamfalussy appears more hopeful than realistic.
Evidence suggests that, except perhaps for the Germans, governments,
the public and financial institutions are not well aware of the long-
term implications of EMU and have scarcely addressed the issue beyond
narrow, parochial parameters.

Most banks appear not to be technically prepared even if the political
go-ahead is given. And what will be the relationship between the
handful of countries that could make 1999 and those which do not?

Uncertainties multiply and even if Lamfalussy's optimistic opinion of
'European citizens' is accepted, much still needs to be done to make
the partnership between the political decision-makers and the private
sector on EMU really work. There is little evidence to show that
financial institutions are taking a proactive stance on anything to do
with EMU.

Can a wait and see policy work? If the 1999 start founders, as it
might, and delays are ruled unacceptable, as is likely, the lack of an
EMU process will have severe long-term implications. EMU, like it or
not, is Europe's response to globalisation and if a void ensues then
Europe will be the loser.

Looking longer term to 2006, what are the prospects? The only
certainties appear to be that Asia will not stand still and that
technology will continue to reshape employment. Since the industrial
revolution technology has shifted employment upstream; today that
process is accelerating and politicians' rhetoric that more education
is needed belies the fact that fewer real jobs in certain sectors are
being created and fewer are likely to be created.

EMU represents a long-term strategy for Europe. It may not be perfect
but if governments, the public and also banks do not take a proactive
approach there will be no strategy. Europeans need to look to their
future and act accordingly.

COURTING FAVOR: S&LS GIVEN NARROW ODDS ON SUPERVISORY GOODWILL

Oral arguments held on supervisory goodwill Feb. 10
revealed a bitterly divided, 11-member court likely to decide for or
against the thrift industry by a margin as thin as a single vote.
     Industry lawyers were buoyed by the receptiveness of many
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit judges to its
arguments and by concession of key points by the government. But too many
judges still appear to be leaning toward the governments camp to predict an
industry win in the battle over whether Uncle Sam owes thriftsboth living
and deadfor supervisory goodwill promises made during the debacle.
     Between 40 and 50 supervisory goodwill cases have already
been filed and a victory in this lead case could encourage more to step
forward. The number of cases could rise above 100 and claims could add up
to $1 billion.
     Its too close to call, said Daniel J. Goldberg, an attorney
with Housley Goldberg & Kantarian in Washington. Goldberg predicted a 6-5
or 7-4 decision in a ruling that could take a year.
     Edward H. Sisson, a lawyer with Arnold & Porter, a
Washington firm representing several supervisory goodwill cases, said he
was encouraged by how the court received the arguments, giving a slight
edge to thrifts.
     Sisson said that government arguments, such as that
supervisory goodwill agreements were not contracts and the so-called
sovereign acts doctrine, were revealed as red herrings.
     Under sovereign acts doctrine, the government can breach
contracts without obligation so long as it acts to benefit the general
welfare.
     Sisson and other observers were surprised that the
governments attorney, Douglas Letter, conceded under grilling from Judge
Pauline Newman that the goodwill agreements did constitute contracts.
Newman dissented in a pro-government decision by a three-member panel of
the same court in May 1993.
     If we agree with the court of federal claims that these are
contracts, Newman said, then the govern-ments position on sovereign rights
doesnt apply.
     Goldberg said he was also surprised that Letter appeared to
concede the regulatory capital credit issue to thrifts. This could be
significant, Goldberg said, since the counsel for Glendale, Jerry Stouck of
Spriggs & Hollingsworth, and for Statesman, Charles J. Cooper of Shaw,
Pittman, Potts & Trowbridge, pursued somewhat different strategies.
     Statesmans claim is widely seen to be stronger than
Glendales and Goldberg said it was possible, though less likely, that
Statesman would prevail but not Glendale. But both have valid contracts, he
hastened to add.
     The oral arguments were punctuated by interruptions from
argumentative judges, who asked for clarifications or interjected sarcastic
barbs. Several judges seemed intolerant of the governments attempt to walk
away from a contract and from responsibility for any attendant damages.
     Letter repeatedly invoked an interpretation of the Supreme
Court ruling in Powen vs. Public Agencies Opposed to Social Security
Entrapment, 477 U.S. 441, a 1986 case suggesting that the government has a
right to break a contract.
     At one point Judge S. Jay Plager cut in, telling him, I
want you to remember something from first year [law school] contracts
class.
     I had a terrible first year contracts professor, Letter
said. I learned almost nothing.
     Plager instructed Letter that nobody disputes that the
government can break a contract. But when a contract is broken damages must
be paid. Plager then said that thrifts never would have taken on millions
of dollars in liability by taking over insolvent institutions without
goodwill accounting promises from the government. Nor would regulators have
tried to resolve one failing thrift by dragging down another, said Plager,
referring to the knock-out impact of broken goodwill promises.
     I have arguments for all of that, Letter said.
     Obviously something you learned in contracts, Plager said.
     Or in my opinions, joked Chief Judge Helen Nies, who wrote
the majority opinion in the earlier pro-government decision.
     Minutes later, Letter tried to flatter Plager by saying, I
wish I had had you as my first year contracts professor.
     Me too, we wouldnt be here, the judge retorted.
     In the course of his argument, Nies pressed Stouck to show
her where in Glendales agreement did the government specifically agree to a
40-year goodwill amortization period and promise that there would be no
change in policy, the so-called double promise.
     Stouck said these details were spelled out in a letter to
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board by Glendales accountant in a letter he
said was integrated into the contract.

INTERSTATE BRANCHING BILL: IT HAS LEGS

With interstate branching legislation appearing to have its
best shot in almost a decade in passing Congress this year, industry
lawyers and lobbyists are scrambling to reshape a measure cynics had given
little chance of winning congressional approval this yearif ever.
     It has legs, one legislative lobbyist for a bank trade
group in Washington said. I never thought I would ever see it passed in my
lifetime, nevertheless my career, he said with  little sarcasm.
     The linchpin of the political viability of the legislation
is language that bars branching across state lines without acquisitiona big
carrot to community banks  because it offers  a potential windfall if they
want to sell out.
     An amendment to the legislation offering incentives to
institutions seeking to branch interstate to do so by acquiring troubled or
marginally capitalized institutions is among options being proposed by some
members of Congress, industry officials and regulators. No such requirement
is contained in the initial legislation that passed the financial
institutions subcommittee of the House Banking Committee Feb. 3 by a 29-0
vote. Ironically, the bill was passed before it was officially introduced.
But markup by the full banking committee could come before the end of
February.
     Another potential change would be to allow states to opt
out of Douglas amendment repeal, an amendment that will be sought by the
Independent Bankers Association of America. That group believes that the
legislation passed Feb. 3 gives the back of its hand to 14 states that have
not chosen to allow holding companies outside regional compacts to acquire
banks in their state.
     The bill passed by the House panel permits full nationwide
interstate bank holding company acquisitions one year after enactment and
national bank interstate branching by acquisition three years after
enactment. The bill allows states to opt out entirely from interstate
branching within three years after enactment of branching legislation. The
bill also allows bank holding companies operating in more than one state to
consolidate those subsidiaries into one bank 18 months after enactment.
     But  securities analysts and industry lobbyists believe
that the IBAAs concerns about allowing states to opt out of repeal of the
Douglas amendment is a mere face-saving move aimed at disguising the fact
the IBAA was caught off guard by Sen. Christopher J. Dodds, D-Conn.,
announcement and the new-found momentum behind the bill that Dodds decision
created.
     These officials also said that the only bank of note to
benefit from a state opting out of repeal of the Douglas amendment would be
Barnett Bank of Jacksonville,  a $38 billion-asset institution that
dominates the Florida market but is weak outside the state. One analyst in
New York speculated that two potential acquirers Barnett would like to hold
off are BankAmerica in California and Chemical Bank of New York.
     Steve Verdier, senior legislative counsel for the IBAA,
confirmed that the IBAA was surprised at Dodds announcement and the new-
found potential for the bill to pass. I think you could write that about
anyone in Washington connected with banking legislation, he said. No one
outside of Mark Leggett, the Washington lobbyist for NationsBank, gave
interstate branching more than an outside chance of passage this year.
     No small part of its new-found momentum is the statement
Feb. 3 by  Dodd announcing that he would not seek to bog the legislation
down by adding an amendment that hamstrings the ability of banks of all
sizes to grow their insurance sales business.

MULDOON DOES $1 BILLION IN CONVERSIONS IN 1993

Insiders arent the only ones benefiting from sweet mutual
conversion deals. Muldoon, Murphy & Faucette of Washington did the legal
billing on 15 mutual to stock flips in 1993 worth a total of $1.03 billion.
     While Silver, Freedman & Taff handled six more flip deals
than Muldoon, its rival handled bigger flips that issued far more stock.
Offerings associated with Muldoon averaged $68.5 million per flip. Silver
flips averaged $42.2 million.
     We came out on top because we have a lot of very
experienced people who work in securities and almost everybody has
government experience, said Joseph A. Muldoon Jr. He said the firm thrives
because it takes good care of its clients.
     The top underwriting, legal and appraisal firms dominated
the biggest of the 109 thrifts that converted from mutual to stock form
last year, raising $2.1 billion in gross proceeds, according to the data of
SNL Securities.
     The king of the conversion hill is Adams Cohen Securities,
the underwriting firm on Long Island. It had a piece of flip deals worth
$1.1 billion, or more than half of the total 1993 gross. The dozen flip
deals associated with Adams Cohen  averaged $94.4 million in gross
proceeds.
     Kaplan Associates of Washington led the appraiser group;
deals associated with this firm came to $1.05 billion, almost twice as much
as its next closest competitor, RP Financial Inc. Kaplan flips also had the
biggest gross per appraiser, averaging $75.3 million.
     The lead firms in these groups handled the doozy deals of
1993. When the Coral Gables Federal Savings & Loan Association flipped
early last year, it was the largest  since a few big flips in the mid-
1980s, according to Robert Adams, managing director of Adams Cohen. The
Coral Gables deal was eclipsed at the end of the year by Astoria Federal
Savings Bank in Lake Success, N.Y., only to be eclipsed earlier this year
by the mother of all flips, Green Point Savings Bank with about $6 billion
in assets.
     Muldoon and Adams did both the Astoria and Green Point
deals. Appraising for Astoria was done by Kaplan; RP Financial of
Arlington, Va., the second largest flip appraiser, handled Green Point.
     Close scrutiny of mutual to stock flips by regulators and
members of Congress concerned about excessive insider benefits has these
firms uncertain about what 1994 will hold.
     As to 1994, I would say were very cautious, Adams said. We
dont know where the congressional hearings and legislation [on mutual
flips] will go. He said the firm is keeping an eye to the windward and
diversifying. Were substantially expanding our sales trading activity and
other research work, he said.
     Muldoon predicted a clampdown on merger-conversions, but he
was cautiously optimistic that conversions will continue.

CREDIT UNIONS ARE HEDGING THEIR BETS

The National Credit Union Administration has the authority
to allow AT&T Family Credit Union in North Carolina to serve additional
employee groups, the credit union and Credit Union National Association
claim in a motion made in federal district court in Washington. However,
given the possibility that banks could win the case, the two defendants
also say that even if the banks win, relief should only be prospective.
     AT&T Family and CUNAs brief, filed as a motion for summary
judgment in First National Bank and Trust Co., et al vs. NCUA, No. 90-2948,
is a crucial component of a lawsuit that could have broad legal, political
and competitive implications for both the credit union and banking
industries.
     The American Bankers Association filed the suit on behalf
of First National Bank and Trust, arguing that the Federal Credit Union Act
common bond criteria bars credit unions from expanding their field of
membership beyond their primary service group, that is employees of AT&T in
North Carolina.
     In summing up the banking industrys case, AT&T Family
Credit Union and CUNA put it best:
     The relief sought in plaintiffs complaint includes a
declaration that all amendments to Family Federals charter that were
requested after Nov. 14, 1989 are null and void. Such a declaration would
divest Family Federal of approximately 95 employee groups. These groups
have 34,000 members30.3% of the total membership of the credit union. This
would have a catastrophic effect on Family Federal and its members.
     Besides its argument that NCUAs action was proper and
Family Federals charter is lawful and valid, the Family Federal-CUNA brief
hedges its bets by saying that even if the banks are right, giving banks
what they want would impose harm on the credit union of great magnitude,
while the competitive harm to the plaintiffs that would result from
prospective relief only is negligible.
     The brief added, This requires the court either to rule
that the banks are not entitled to retroactive relief or, at the very
least, to hold an evidentiary hearing to evaluate the relative harms and
other equitable factors such as waiver and estoppel.
     Banks are seeking divestiture because they believe that
credit unions have become unfair competitors because they are not taxed and
yet can offer the same services.

D&OS FACE EXTENDED STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

Giving another kick to one of its favorite political
footballs, Congress has moved to extend the statute of limitations for
civil actions against insiders at failed thrifts.
     Sen. Alfonse M. DAmato, R-N.Y., pushed for the extension as
part of his efforts to keep pressure on the Clinton administration in
regard to White-watergate, the controversy surrounding the role of the
president and his wife in an Arkansas real estate project that was funded
by a savings and loan that later collapsed.
     DAmato offered an amendment Feb. 9 to a supplemental
appropriations bill that allows the Resolution Trust Corp. to bring civil
suits for fraud and gross negligence until Dec. 31, 1995. The Senate
approved the amendment the same day by a vote of 95-0, and on Feb. 11 the
House of Representatives voted 390-1 to instruct their conferees to retain
the amendment.
     This means that those who are potentially liable to the
taxpayers cant hide behind the calendar or a legal technicality, the
ranking Republican on the Senate Banking Committee said. Congress will not
tolerate gross fraud or negligence at the taxpayers expenseno matter who
the culprits are.
     DAmato was joined in offering the amendment by Sens. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
     DAmato said he pushed for the extension for fear that the
statute of limitations would run out by the end of February for cases
involving the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, the institution connected
to the Whitewater resort development in Arkansas.
     He cited the administrations repeated failure to provide
any specific information regarding the expiration of the civil statute of
limitations in the Madison/Whitewater controversy.
     Under current law, the statue of limitations for fraud and
gross negligence is five years. DAmatos amendment, certain to pass because
it was attached to a supplemental appropriations bill, extends the statute
of limitations in cases involving failed S&Ls to the same date that the RTC
goes out of business.
     Now that the RTC will have additional time, we must be
concerned that it will use it to conduct a thorough investigation and then
recover some of the billions of dollars taxpayers have poured into the
savings and loan bailout.

DAVID PAUL GUILTY ON SECURITIES CHARGES

Andrew Wheat
In a surprise move David L. Paulwho became a symbol of the
S&L era as the defunct head of the former CenTrust Bankpleaded guilty Feb.
10 to remaining charges in a 100-count indictment.
     Miami-based CenTrust failed in early 1990 at an estimated
taxpayer cost of $1.5 billion. The indictment came two years later and a
jury was selected last October for the first batch of counts that charged
that Paul had diverted bank funds to pay for the work on his mansion and
had obstructed justice. The jury found Paul guilty of many of those
charges.
     The second batch of charges to which Paul just plead guilty
cover racketeering allegations that Paul and his associates misled
regulators and purchasers of CenTrust subordinated debentures about the
underwriting of CenTrust junk bond investments.
     A 1991 FDIC suit against junk bond king Michael Milken
argued that directors of several thrifts, such as Paul, Charles Keating and
Thomas Spiegel, allowed Milken to draw on their funds to support prices and
prevent defaults in his multibillion house of cards. Each of these persons
intended to share in the plunder of their respective institutions and to
obtain other benefits the Milken Group provided to those who purchased
large quantities of Drexel-underwritten junk bonds, the suit said.
     An additional charge in the second batch of Paul charges
was that CenTrust parked a piece of the offering with Bank of Credit and
Commerce International parties to make it appear that it was more heavily
subscribed than it was. Further charges allege that CenTrust transactions
with Charles Keatings Lincoln Savings and Loan contained material
information that was not disclosed to auditors.
     Sentencing is scheduled for April 1, April Fools Day.
There will also be Rico forfeiture proceeding March 21.
     I have a hard timeeven for internal purposesestimating what
kind of sentence he might be faced with, said Allan Sullivan, the assistant
U.S. attorney handling the case. It all is governed by sentencing
guidelines. Its all calculated based on fraud losses, and aggravating or
mitigating factors.
     This marks the conclusion of a successful prosecution
against Paul resulting in his prosecution on Rico charges, Sullivan said.
     In an interview with The Thrift Regulator in October (Oct.
4, page 3) Pauls attorney, Stephen Neal of the Chicago office of Kirkland &
Ellis, said there was no question the bank had paid for work on Pauls
house. But he dismissed the second set of chargesto which his client has
now pleaded guiltyas nonsense put into the indictment solely to soil Pauls
name through guilt by association with Keating and BCCI.
     Neal could not be reached for an updated comment.

PROMPT ACTION ON SUPERFUND LAW SOUGHT

It is doubtful that the banking industry will be successful
in trying to use a negative court decision on the ability of a government
agency to exempt lenders from hazardous waste cleanup suits brought by
private parties as a lever to force Congress to act quickly on a law which
provides that protection. That will mean that for the time being,
persuading judges to read the lender liability exemption in the current
Superfund law broadly is the best way for lenders to reduce their potential
liability for cleanup of hazardous waste.
     One of the reasons prompt action on the legislation, the
Superfund Reau-thorization Law, H.R. 3800 and S. 1834, is unlikely is that
Congress, even under the most optimistic of scenarios, will have little
time to deal with it this year. Second, the misery-loves-company groups
that brought the court suit against the Environmental Protection Agencys
1992 regulation are unlikely to cave in quickly to pressure from the
administration and members of Congress, even though these groups are
acutely aware of the potential economic impact of leaving lenders out to
dry for the damage caused by borrowers to the environment.
     The two groups are state and local governments and the
chemical industry, both with a big stake in having someone with deep
pockets share the blame for cleanup of hazardous waste. The suit is Kelley
vs. EPA. Frank J. Kelley is the attorney general of Michigan. The Chemical
Manufacturers Association was the co-plaintiff in the case.
     The bill does what a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the D.C. Circuit says the EPA doesnt have the authority to do unilaterally,
establish strict limits on when lenders are liable for hazardous waste
cleanup. But in its Feb. 4 decision, the court held that Congress must
grant EPA the authority to limit lender liability. Otherwise, courts will
determine the extent of lender liability based on the current Superfund
law, the court said. The EPA promulgated the rule in response to the Fleet
Factors decision in the 11th U.S. Circuit in 1990, which imposed liability
on lenders based on the theory that the mere capacity to influence a
borrowers decisionmaking was sufficient to make the lender potentially
liable. It in effect called into question the secured lender exemption in
the original Superfund statute.
     Elliott P. Laws, assistant administrator for the Office of
Solid Waste and Emergency Response at the EPA, testified before a House
panel Feb. 10 that the provisions in the reauthori-zation law regarding
lenders and trustees has assumed a greater level of importance.
     Although the government has not yet determined whether to
seek a rehearing by the full court in the case, the administrations
proposal would confirm EPAs authority to administer the statute in a fair
and effective manner, Laws said. An unnecessary imposition of liability on
lenders and trustees ... would have a chilling effect on the provision of
working capital to otherwise credit-worthy borrowers, or to provide funds
for the purchase of environmentally distressed property. Clear liability
standards for lenders and trustees are necessary elements of the
administrations plan to rehabilitate urban brownfields and to bring
distressed property back into the stream of commerce.
     Besides strictly limiting lender liability, the proposed
legislation would overhaul the manner in which shares of responsibility for
cleanup of hazardous waste would be allocated and provide for expedited
settlements. Laws summed it up this way: The administration intends to
increase fairness and reduce transaction costswith the expectation that
most parties will settle their liability to the U.S. and that more money
will be spent on cleanups, rather than lawyers.
     Under the proposed law an early, expeditious and obligatory
allocation process would be created. Each liable partys share of response
costs would be allocated by a neutral, third-party allocator. The proposed
process is intended to reduce, if not virtually eliminate, the expensive
and time-consuming process of litigating these issues in federal district
court, Laws said. The plan offers substantial incentives to parties who
choose to settle their liability, and disincentives to parties who choose
to litigate following the allocation.
     The American Bankers Association acted strongly against the
court decision and called for prompt action on the legislation. The ABA
said it would seek a rehearing before the full court on the rulingit has
been certified as an intervenorbut industry lawyers believe that is a
holding action aimed at persuading Congress to move quickly on the bill.
The only thing that could yield a rehearing is the still-to-be published
dissent of Chief Judge Abner Mikva to the courts ruling.  ABA and the
government could  seek review from the full court if Mikvas dissent is
strong enough, in the eyes of  ABA and the government, to put enough doubt
in the minds of other members as to warrant rehearing.

ILLINOIS GOVERNOR MAY REVIVE PROPOSAL FOR CHICAGO BEARS' INDOOR STADIUM

By Aaron Baar
CHICAGO

     Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar may resurrect a plan to build an
indoor stadium for the Chicago Bears professional football team if a
proposal to renovate the team's current home, Soldier Field, is indeed
dead.
    "We plan to touch base with both the Bears and city hall to determine
the status of the renovation proposal," said Edgar spokesman Eric Robinson.
"If the governor is convinced the proposal is dead, he's prepared to
explore other avenues to keep the Bears in Chicago."
    One avenue favored by the governor is the possibility of building an
indoor, multi-use facility in the Chicago area that has become known as
"McDome," Robinson said.
    In the summer of 1995, state officials hinted that a domed stadium
could be built with bonds issued by the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition
Authority. Although the authority has used most of its $937 million of bond
authorization, state officials had said it might be possible to issue
stadium bonds by refinancing existing debt, a plan that still may be
favored by Edgar.
    "The governor believes that a multipurpose facility could be built
without raising taxes," he said. Robinson would not give details about how
that might be done.
    In October, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley unveiled a $156 million plan
to renovate Soldier Field, the Bears' current home. The proposal calls for
the Chicago Park District to issue $100 million of taxable revenue bonds,
backed by annual club seat fees, revenues from permanent seat licenses,
concession fees, and a contribution from the team. The park district would
also issue the remaining $56 million of bonds payable with property tax or
other district revenues.
    Team officials have deemed the Soldier Field proposal unacceptable and
have reportedly declared negotiations with the city dead. However, Edgar
wanted to be assured of that demise before reviving the McDome possibility,
Robinson said.
    "In the environment we work in, things are never dead until they're
dead," he said. "We want to verify that from both sides (before moving
forward)."
    Meanwhile, a group of Indiana business leaders are continuing their
push to build a new, $312 million stadium for the Bears in Gary, Ind., to
be financed with taxable bonds issued by the group. About 60% of the bonds
would be repaid with various stadium-related private sources. The remaining
40% would be repaid from revenues from a proposed 0.5% economic development
income tax to be levied in the county.

THE BULLHORN



    "Nothing that was written in their response successfully gets around
the fact that Merrill Lynch guided this county into bankruptcy."
    - J. Michael Hennigan, a lawyer for Orange County, arguing that it's
not enough for Merrill to say that the investments it chose for the county
were legal.

    "The emerging managers are to the pension fund what Pawtucket is to the
Boston Red Sox. The idea is that the farm team will, through good
performance, soon make the majors and be given more assets to invest."
    - Rhode Island Treasurer Nancy J. Mayer explaining her "emerging
managers" program, which gives small investment firms a chance to invest
state pension funds.

    "This is a money train, and if you get between the people who want the
money and the people who spend the money, you've got problems."
    - Franklin White, the former chief executive officer of the L.A.
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who was fired after an often bitter
struggle over Los Angeles' $5.8 billion bond-financed subway project.

    "He sent her to the dump, and I mean that literally - he sent her to
the county's Integrated Waste Management Department."
    - Steven J. Kaplan, the attorney for former Orange County finance
director Eileen T. Walsh, who has filed a discrimination lawsuit against
the county over her demotion.

    "People have taken their money out of closed-end funds to go play the
hotter games in town."
    - Donald L. Cassidy, senior researcher at Lipper Analytical Services
Inc., which found that the yields on municipal closed-end funds are
approaching taxable Treasury yields.

BOND VOLUME CAP, IN TROUBLE AGAIN, NEEDS REPAIR

By Joan Pryde
WASHINGTON

  - Every once in a while, something happens that puts the
private-activity bond volume cap - and its problems - in the spotlight, and
gives municipal bond proponents a chance to remind Congress the cap needs
fixing.
    The current problem stems from the federal government's partial
shutdown, which includes the Census Bureau, the agency responsible for
publishing the figures states use each year to compute the amounts they are
allowed to allocate to bond issuers.
    Under normal circumstances, Census would have released that report last
week, so that officials could begin this year knowing exactly how much they
have to work with. But because Census workers are on furlough, states will
have to wait awhile before they know what their 1996 cap amounts are going
to be.
    But the problem is even worse than that: If past experience is a guide,
states may not be able to use those population numbers when they eventually
come out.
    Back in 1990 Census issued the wrong figures during the last week of
December, and corrected itself with a new report in January. The Treasury
Department ruled that neither report conformed to the letter of the law,
and told states they had to go back and use their 1990 volume cap amounts
for 1991.
    If history repeats itself, states in 1996 will be stuck with year-old
volume caps again, and the largest states, which have growing populations
and huge demand for private-activity bond authority, will be hurt the most.
    One improvement over last time is that issuers probably will not have
to wait six months before the issue is resolved. When the 1991 snafu
occurred, the Treasury did not issue a ruling until July, leaving states in
the dark for the first half of the year - the period in which they
typically allocate most of their volume cap authority.
    The Treasury apparently learned its lesson from that debacle and has
been routinely issuing a revenue procedure a few weeks after the beginning
of each year, confirming that the numbers in the previous December's Census
report are the correct ones to use. Last week Treasury officials declined
comment on this latest mess, and it will be interesting to see how they
resolve the problem and whether they do so quickly.
    But the difficulties caused by the delayed Census report illustrate an
even deeper problem facing those who must live under the confines of the
cap: its inequity.
    Under the volume cap law, states are permitted each year to allocate
the greater of $50 per capita or $150 million in private-activity bond
authority. In 1995 that left 21 states at the $150 million level, and many
of those with more bond authority than they knew what to do with.
    But most of the larger states, which are stuck with $50 per capita, are
chafing under the cap's restrictions. They, of course, are the ones who
stand to be hurt if states are forced to revert to their 1995 allotments -
thus, not accounting for any growth in population - in 1996.
    There are other problems with the volume cap that affect all states.
Chief among them is the fact that the cap is not indexed for inflation, so
while in dollar terms the cap has remained constant, in reality it has
dropped over the last several years.
    In 1993 the Public Securities Association reported that inflation had
eroded the cap to the point where it was really $41.25 per capita, not $50,
and $120.8 million, not $150 million.
    Despite the problems that persist, legislation to ease the volume cap
has never caught fire in Congress. Rep. Bill Coyne, D-Pa., in 1993
introduced a broad bill to ease bond curbs, which included a provision that
would have indexed the cap for inflation. But Congress never acted on that
bill.
    Former Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa, offered a proposal in 1993 designed to
help alleviate the cap's inequities. Grandy's proposal would have allowed
states with an overabundance of cap authority to shift the authority to
states that had used up their cap in a given year. But Congress took no
action on his measure, either.
    And so problems with the volume cap continue. If the population-report
mess creates enough difficulties for the states, 1996 may finally be the
year that Congress is forced to take a hard look at the volume cap law and
what can be done to improve it.

    In sharp contrast to California's stagnant construction industry,
building projects rising in Sacramento have created a mini-boom in the
capital city.
    The skyline in downtown Sacramento has been reshaped to include more
high-rise buildings, many of them used by federal, local, and state
government. Money used to reinvent the city's downtown isn't coming from
private dollars, but instead from lease revenue bonds and other forms of
public finance.
    There are currently two large buildings being constructed and financed
through lease revenue bonds: the massive new federal office and court
building, and a new addition to the Sacramento Convention Center complex,
operated by the city. And what will be Sacramento's sixth major state-owned
building to go up in less than three years - an 850,000-square-foot office
building that will house the California Environmental Protection Agency -
is already in the planning stages.
    Critics complain that the state relies too heavily on expensive
financing in order to avoid getting voter approval for general obligation
bonds, which can be sold at a lower interest rate. Financing construction
projects with lease revenue bonds can cost the issuer up to twice as much
in interest as other forms of financing.
    "Using lease revenue bonds for construction is a fairly standard
practice," said Jerry Beavers of the California Legislative Analysts
Office. "We're putting out so much in interest that in the end, after the
bonds have been paid off, it costs almost double what it actually cost to
put up the building."
    Lease revenue bonds are paid off - typically over 20 years - from funds
formerly used to pay for leased buildings. Supporting the use of lease
revenue bonds is Gov. Pete Wilson, who contends that they are a good use of
taxpayers' money.
    However, some officials note that as the current upswing in
construction shows, the state is nibbling away at escaping its lease
obligations. Currently the state leases 7.2 million square feet of office
space around Sacramento, while it owns 5.1 million.
    "We've used lease revenue bonds for a long time to help finance
construction costs both (in Sacramento) and elsewhere," said Craig
Reynolds, chief of staff for state Sen. Lucy Killea, I-San Diego. "However,
there has been some talk in committee with the proposal of new construction
projects to take a closer look at the financing. This will likely happen."
    In general, state government is a major employer in Sacramento, hiring
62,600 at the seasonal peak, excluding college and university employees.
California employs 195,700 people statewide.
    Construction projects awaiting legislative approval include two massive
low-rise buildings in the city's suburbs and a cluster of new high-rise
buildings on state-owned property south and east of the capitol.
    One of the state buildings considered to be among the most extravagant
is owned by the California Public Employees' Retirement System. It is
designed with six terraced levels that are enclosed by outside walls and
concealed behind jasmine shrubbery that extends around the building for two
blocks. Offices open out to the man-made garden setting.
    However, because of its private funding, the building has received
little criticism. The $78 million cost was paid by using seven days' worth
of the investment returns on the organization's $94 billion portfolio.
Unlike other state agencies, CalPERS receives no tax-generated money.
    "I think the public would rather have the state build some of these
buildings using other, more cheaper ways ... or no public money at all,"
Beavers said. "There has been so much growth in the past few years, that
now we are realizing it is time to put a plan together that will manage it
better."
    Legislators are expected to soon devise a plan to organize and manage
the buildings, as well as develop a plan to regulate growth around
Sacramento.

MONEY MARKET FUNDS: YEAR-END UPSURGE IN TAX-FREE FUND YIELDS IS
TYPICAL, PLAYERS SAY

By Elizabeth Roy

    Tax-free money market fund yields shot up last week - but market
participants said the surge was typical year-end behavior.
    Meanwhile, the Dec. 22 downgrades by Standard & Poor's Corp. of four
Japanese banks that provide letters of credit for money market fund
securities has not affected trading, the participants said.
    They said the market had already priced in the downgrades.
    Standard & Poor's downgraded Mitsubishi Bank to A-plus from AA-minus,
Sanwa Bank to A from AA-minus, and the Sumitomo Bank and Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank to A from A-plus.
    On Thursday the rating agency also downgraded Fuji Bank, to A-minus
from A-plus. All five banks were placed on CreditWatch in August.
    Money market yields rise at year-end for two main reasons.
    First, demand wanes as retail investors withdraw funds either to cover
holiday or other expenses, or to avoid paying intangibles taxes in states
such as Florida and North Carolina. Those states tax investors based on
their holdings on the last day of the year.
    Institutional investors also retreat from money market funds in the
final weeks of the year, players said, either to make tax payments on Dec.
15, or to trim the number of investments they have to print on their year-
end balance sheets.
    At the same time, remarketing agents also want to enter the new year
with clean balance sheets. As a result, they offer money market funds high
yields on daily and weekly floaters in an effort to clear them from their
books.
    "We're obviously seeing a year-end spike, due to a lot of money that's
been leaving the arena," said Bradford Owensby, municipal securities
analyst for the $1.3 billion Nations Tax-Exempt Fund and the $110 million
Nations Municipal Reserve Fund.
    The investment adviser for the funds, a wholly owned subsidiary of
NationsBank of North Carolina, as of yesterday became known as TradeStreet
Investment Associates Inc.
    Referring to the high yields being offered on money market instruments,
Owensby said: "Dealers don't want inventory, so they've been jacking up
their rates."
    The high yields are aimed at corporate "crossover" buyers in particular
- those that can invest in either taxable or tax-free products, he added.
    Andrea White, assistant vice president in municipal trading at Harris
Trust and Savings Bank, agreed.
    "Yields have been going up fairly substantially," said White, whose
firm runs a $400 million tax-free money market fund and a $250 million
common trust fund.
    In the week leading up to last Wednesday, yields on weekly floaters
rose 45 basis points, and those on daily floaters were up 100 basis points,
she said.
    Also on Wednesday, White said, weekly floaters were yielding in the
4.95% to 5.10% range, compared to returns of 3.70% on tax-free commercial
paper maturing in February.
    After Jan. 1, however, short-term yields should drop down to about 2%
and stay there for at least a couple of weeks as cash flows back into money
market funds, she added.
    Only on July 1 do investors receive as much money in the form of coupon
payments and bonds maturing as they do on Jan. 1, White noted.
    The Harris money market funds have lost $15 million to $20 million in
recent weeks, but the managers expect to have to cope with $50 million of
inflows starting today, White said.
    Jim Hannan, vice president at First National Bank of Maryland and
manager of the $88 million ARK Funds Tax-Free Money Market Portfolio, said
some weekly floaters have been resetting at yields as high as 5.25% - a
taxable-equivalent yield of 8%.
    "The first week in January, that'll come down to 3.5%," he said.
    In the meantime, Hannan said, a money market fund yielding 4.25%, as
his was on Wednesday, offers a taxable-equivalent yield of 6.55% - 95 basis
points over the 5.60% that the typical taxable fund is offering crossover
buyers.
    Even so, Hannan's fund saw the assets of its institutional class drop
to $71 million from $80 million at the beginning of December, he said,
adding that he expects the money to return this month.

BROKER PROFILE: MUNI INVESTORS SHOULD AVOID FUNDS, BROKER SAYS

By Jon Birger

    Mutual funds offer far more advantages for equity investors than for
municipal bond investors, according to Bill Glassner, an independent broker
in Cedar Knolls, N.J., affiliated with Royal Alliance Associates Inc.
    With an equity fund, "a manager really adds value" compared to what a
broker can do, said Glassner, who has about 400 clients with accounts
totaling $150 million. "I don't have the time to research individual
companies on my own and give them the diversification they need."
    Municipal bond funds also offer diversification and expert research.
However, in Glassner's opinion, municipal funds' inherent interest rate
risk outweighs their advantages.
    For fixed-income investors, Glassner recommends only products with "a
finite life," principally bonds but also unit investment trusts, he said.
    When Glassner has clients who come to him with existing holdings in
bond funds, "I tell them, 'If you didn't like the fluctuations of 1994 -
not knowing where you stood with a fund - here's another approach: you can
buy the individual bond and no matter what happens with the ups and downs
of the market, you're going to get your money back.'
    "The individual client understands that even if everything goes wrong
like it did in 1994, they have a guaranteed value on a certain date," he
said. With a fund, there is no specific date when investors are guaranteed
full return of principal.
    While a patient fund investor should eventually recoup his full
investment - either through higher yields or appreciating shares -  "it's
harder for the unsophisticated client to visualize that," Glassner said.
    One of the few scenarios in which Glassner does recommend bond funds is
for investors interested in the high-yield sector of the municipal market.
    "I only use funds for things that I can't efficiently buy on my own,"
he said. "On the (high-yield) muni side, I use a fund that has the
resources and the people to research the small deals - the unrated deals -
and to diversify in a portfolio in order to make it safer."
    Glassner's favorite high-yield fund is the Van Kampen Merritt Tax Free
High Income Fund.
    About 40% of Glassner's accounts is invested in municipals - the
remainder divided about equally between equities and taxable mortgage-
backed securities.
    A self-described bargain hunter in the equity market, Glassner takes
few such risks when buying individual municipal bonds.
    Municipal bond investors "are basically looking for safety," he said.
"I go out of my way to be real safe."
    While Glassner said he understands why many yield-hungry institutional
portfolio managers prefer A or triple-B rated bonds, he does not recommend
this strategy for retail buyers.
    Individual investors who buy municipals want peace of mind, he said.
    "And especially with these low yields (and narrow credit quality
spreads), you're picking up so little extra by taking the uninsured bond,"
he said.
    About 70% of Glassner's clients are New Jersey residents. He generally
advises these investors to buy Garden State bonds in order to take
advantage of the in-state tax advantage.
    Interest earned on New Jersey bonds is exempt from the state income
tax, which is 6.58% for individuals in the top tax bracket.
    "I'm not too concerned about the New Jersey economy," Glassner said of
his clients' high exposure in the state. "But I will buy a state like Texas
if I see enough yield to cover the New Jersey tax."
    Some of Glassner's best-selling New Jersey issuers include the state of
New Jersey itself, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, and the Port
Authority of New York and New Jersey.
    He and his clients also like northern New Jersey municipalities such as
Essex County, Parsippany, and West Orange Township Board of Education.
    "Investors are generally a little more comfortable if they know the
town," he said.
    Glassner is a big fan of zero-coupon bonds, particularly for investors
with a specific time horizon.
    "I use the zeros a lot," he said. "I have a lot of people who just
don't care about the income and they love buying a bond at 25 cents on the
dollar or 50 cents if it's shorter.
    "And I also find higher yields there because the marketplace doesn't
really like (zero-coupon bonds). In general they want the bonds with the
cash flow."
    Zero-coupon bonds issued by Camden County Municipal Utility District
have been among his top sellers, according to Glassner.
    Because Camden is one of New Jersey's most economically depressed
areas, these bonds "don't trade real well, so we end up with a good yield,"
he said. "They're insured, and we're going to hold them" to maturity.
    For sophisticated investors willing to take on a little risk, Glassner
recommends housing bonds.
    "Some people view the fact that there can be an unpredictable,
extraordinary redemption as a negative," he said. "I view that as a
positive."
    Investors are compensated for the call risk with above-market yields,
he explained.
    "You can sometimes get a real high coupon at a very small premium with
a housing bond," Glassner said. "I usually view a three- or six-month
break-even period as fair, but I've got to find a client who knows there's
a little risk of losing the premium a day after he buys it."
    Glassner's clients generally buy bonds in the four- to 12-year maturity
range - "though I do have some clients who will go out 30 years as part of
a laddered portfolio.
    "In general, people are looking for 5%" yield, he continued. "Five
percent seems to be the psychological barrier right now."
    Investors seem to have adjusted to long-term yields in the 5% to 5.5%
range, according to Glassner.
    "The area where I get the most resistance is in the shorter end, where
they're taking 4% or 4.25% for a maturity that they don't think is that
short - four to eight years," he said. "A lot of clients would rather leave
the money in cash."
    As for the flat tax, Glassner said neither he nor his clients are
particularly concerned.
    "Nobody's really talking about it - it hasn't come up at all (in
conversations with clients) during the second half of the year," he said.
    Glassner does not believe a flat tax will pass. And even if it did -
thereby reducing municipals' resale value - investors who hold their bonds
to maturity would not be affected, he said.

PORTFOLIO MANAGER PROFILE: CONSERVATIVE MANAGING CAN REAP REWARDS

By Sarah Stirland

     A top performance can be achieved even with a conservative strategy,
according to Ronald H. Schwartz, portfolio manager of STI Capital
Management's $150 million STI Classic Investment Grade Tax-Exempt Bond
Fund.
    Schwartz's portfolio has consistently landed among the top five
performing intermediate funds over last three years.
    But he said he achieves his results incrementally. "Our philosophy is
that we don't try to hit a home run," he said.
    "We don't feel like we can forecast interest rates far out into the
future accurately for a long time period, so we will have our short-term
bias based on our fundamental and technical analysis - we're not going to
make major bets by any means," he said.
    In addition to managing the intermediate bond fund, Schwartz oversees a
total of $1.4 billion in municipals in a Florida fund and two common trust
funds.
    But it is the intermediate bond fund that has regularly appeared in the
Lipper Analytical Services Inc. top-five performer rankings this year.
    Schwartz's fund recorded a one-year total return to the end of the
third quarter of 11.31%, ranking first out of 111 intermediate funds.
    In 1994, Lipper named the portfolio top performer in its class.
    Nothing Out of the Ordinary
    Despite this achievement, Schwartz describes his investment strategy as
doing nothing particularly out of the ordinary.
    Schwartz has kept the average maturity of the fund relatively short,
currently at seven and a half years, with an average duration of five
years.
    That positioning is in keeping with his philosophy of not making big
interest rate bets, he said.
    "If we're bullish on the market we'll extend the average maturity to
eight years, but we're not going to say: 'We know interest rates are going
to go lower, let's change this average maturity from seven and a half years
to 15 years,' " he said.
    Instead, Schwartz said that he will extend or contract his maturities
slightly from his neutral level of seven and a half years, according to his
rate forecast.
    "It's the unknowns that really move this market and you can't predict
those," he added.
    Instead, Schwartz uses yield curve analysis to find value and to
achieve his goal of the highest total return possible.
    "We constantly look at the current yield curve market and look at where
on the yield curve would be best to invest," he said.
    Currently, Schwartz is buying in the intermediate area, where he thinks
the value is.
    In this 15- to 20-year sector, he said, investors can find yields
almost as high as those on 30-year bonds with less risk.
    "When you go out 10 more years to the 30 years, all you pick up is 10
basis points," he said.
    Risk-Reward Ratio
    "We don't feel that risk-reward ratio is to your benefit, so let's take
less risk by going into the 20-year area and all we give up is maybe five
to 10 basis points - that's worthwhile, to us," he explained.
    "You're basically getting 98% of the 30-year bond with the 20-year
bond, so you're taking less risk or volatility while earning 98% of the 30-
year bond," he added.
    In addition to using to using yield curve analysis, he gauges value by
comparing municipals to Treasury securities, he said.
    The intermediate area also currently looks attractive using this
measure, he said.
    At the moment Schwartz is pursuing a barbell strategy.
    In addition to extending his maturity out to about eight years at the
beginning of 1995 when he was optimistic about the market, he has been
buying prerefunded bonds at the short end of the curve.
    "They've been yielding 78% to 80% of Treasuries - that's a very
attractive ratio for the shorter end and for something that is the most
secure bond in the market," he said.
    Schwartz's barbell approach involves buying securities in the one- to
six-year area and in the 15- to 20-year area.
    "We feel like that's the area of the curve that has the best return
potential in this kind of environment," he said.
    Schwartz said that although there is nothing unusual about his
strategy, he manages to find value because the STI fund is a national one
and can also, like many other national portfolios, take advantage of the
supply and demand inequities that crop up in the market at different times
of the year, he said.
    This ability to pick and choose between the different states gives him
an edge over state-specific funds, he said.
    Tracking Prices
    Schwartz said that he also makes the most of market inefficiencies by
keeping records of the price levels at which different bonds trade.
    "We do very extensive historic relationship spreads of how bonds should
trade against each other," he said.
    "For example, how should a general obligation bond trade versus a
revenue bond? How should a specialty-state bond trade versus a non-
specialty-state bond? How should a premium bond trade versus a discount
bond," he said.
    Schwartz buys and trades according to the aberrations he sees in these
historic relationships, he said.
    Currently, he is taking advantage of the oversupply of bonds and then
waiting for the New Year to roll in when a lot of bonds mature, are called
or make their coupon payments.
    He estimates that more than $40 billion of cash will flood the market
in January - bringing demand, which he believes will create a good selling
climate.
    As part of his strategy of managing by making small but progressive
changes to his portfolio, Schwartz will trade bonds even if they only give
him a slight advantage, he said.
    "If Floridas are trading expensive and Washington bonds are trading
cheap, then I will do that trade and earn a quarter and give that return to
investors," he said.
    Feeling Optimistic
    At the moment, Schwartz has extended his portfolio because he has
started to feel optimistic about the market again, after worrying, earlier
this year, that the rally had run its course this year.
    In addition, he has been buying intermediate bonds because they are
looking attractive again at the moment.
    "In the 15-year area, we have seen yields as expensive as 85%, as cheap
as 88.3% and it's currently at 88.2%, so you see it's at one of the
cheapest areas versus Treasuries for the last three months, and over the
past year, it's been as cheap as 89.4%," he said.
    Schwartz said he does not like to take credit risk either.
    "We've seen too many investors reaching for yield and buying credits
that are not adequately compensating them for the risk," he said.
    Areas he avoids are housing bonds and utility bonds, he said.
    Schwartz's avoidance of housing bonds fits with his philosophy that
total return is the best measure of performance rather than income.
    He believes that portfolios that rely on income are not as worthwhile
as funds that rely on total return because total return measures the total
value of the portfolio - not just the income, which could be boosted by
sacrificing capital.
    Housing bonds in particular give investors high coupon payments but
their value often amortizes as the securities age, not to mention they miss
out on the chance to benefit from rising prices.
    "A housing bond is going to give you a lot of income, but in a bull
market, those bonds are not going to appreciate very much at all because
they are going to be called and the investor is not going to see that in
the total return number," he said.
    "In a year like this past year, if you just had housing bonds, you
could never have a 13% return," he added.
    He points to the Securities and Exchange Commission's 1993 ruling that
funds must compare their performance with an index in their prospectuses as
an example of how important achieving a high total return is.
    Schwartz added that he believes total return is the best measure of a
fund's performance despite the fact that it ignores investors' tax brackets
and any capital gains tax liability that may be created.
    Despite his bias toward total return, Schwartz believes that funds that
emphasize current income will still flourish.
    "I think that current income funds are going to be around and will do
well.

SOUTHWEST BOND-WATCH



California
    Six months after former Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. - known as
the state's leading political powerbroker - takes over the San Francisco
mayor's office, a new city charter will make him even more powerful.
    The 90-page charter was approved by voters in the city's November
primary and gives the mayor authority over parts of local government that
were once off limits to politicians.
    The expanded duties include management of all bond-funded and capital
projects, including a $200 million voter-approved renovation of city hall.
That function is now handled by an autonomous chief administrative officer
appointed by the Board of Supervisors.
    Brown will also have the power to play a stronger role in forming San
Francisco's $2.8 billion annual budget.
    "This should eliminate some of the chaos and nonperformance of city
government," Brown said in a press statement. "More things get done if
there is one person you can absolutely rely on."
    Brown was elected mayor Dec. 12 after serving in the Legislature for
more than a quarter century, including 14 years as Assembly speaker.

    Oregon
    In its first major financing as an independent corporation, the Oregon
Health Sciences University late last month announced it will sell $211.8
million of revenue bonds, both to fund a number of projects and to refund
old debt.
    About $110 million of the proceeds are slated to replace patient areas
in Doernbecher Children's Hospital, and expand its adult and pediatric
critical-care facilities.
    Another $20 million will be used to update laboratories and catch up on
deferred maintenance of the teaching hospital's instructional and research
facilities. And $59 million will be used to refund prior issues.

    Wyoming
    The Internal Revenue Service has approved a program that uses state
funds to back general obligation bonds issued by local school districts,
allowing them to borrow with higher credit ratings, according to a
statement released by Cheyenne law firm Rothegerber, Appel, Powers, &
Johnson.
    "This ruling will allow the state to go forward with the School Bond
Guarantee Program for public education in the state," state auditor Dave
Ferrari said in the prepared statement. Ferrari helped draft the 1994
legislation that established the program.
    The ruling - issued in a private letter from the IRS - grants Wyoming
the approval needed to continue the program.
    "The ruling was essential in order for the program to operate as
intended," said Gregory Johnson, an attorney with the firm, which was
counsel to the state in seeking approval.
    Under the program, part of the $800 million Common School Account in
the Permanent Land Fund can be used to guarantee payment of principal and
interest on school-district issued GO bonds.
    IRS approval was sought to ensure the tax exempt status of the state-
backed local school bonds, officials said.

NEW TREASURERS: KENTUCKY'S JOHN HAMILTON STRESSES A HANDS-ON STYLE

By David Kaplan

    Two of John Kennedy Hamilton's foremost goals as he takes the office of
Kentucky treasurer this week are to adopt a more hands-on approach to
managing the state's $2.7 billion short-term cash fund and to develop a
state-run local government investment pool.
    Hamilton describes himself as a conservative businessman but a
Democrat. "With a name like 'John Kennedy,' how could I be anything else?"
he said. He also noted that at 32, he's Kentucky's youngest treasurer this
century.
    Despite the fact that Hamilton completed only one year toward his
bachelor's degree at Lexington Community College, he is credited with
"turning a failing (transportation) business around and increasing gross
revenue by $350,000."
    The company, United Transportation Inc. of Lexington, was where
Hamilton honed his managerial skills as president from 1983 - the year he
left college - to August 1995.
    Hamilton, a political neophyte, plans on exploring the possibility of
expanding the treasurer's investment activities - perhaps by adding
management of an LGIP to the office's responsibilities.
    "We're going to work more closely with Kentucky's finance secretary and
the revenue cabinet compared to the last treasurer," Hamilton said. "Those
two agencies play an essential role in the state's investment programs.
There needs to be an active and independent participant involved."
    When pressed for details, Hamilton said he is interested in expanding
the treasurer's presence in investment policy decisions, but not
necessarily his authority.
    Hamilton succeeds another Democrat, Frances Jones Mills, who served
three separate terms as Kentucky's treasurer, the first beginning in 1976.
    "Ms. Mills often didn't attend the meetings of the State Investment
Commission," he said. "She would often send a surrogate. That will not
happen with me. But as far as any changes in investment policies, I will
have to learn more about the process before proposing anything."
    Under state law, the treasurer serves as vice chairman of the State
Investment Commission, which meets quarterly and essentially acts as an
oversight board.
    The day-to-day operation of the cash fund is conducted by the Office of
Financial Management and Economic Analysis.
    "Historically, the Investment Commission approves policies and
procedures and the staff of my office implements their decisions," said Don
Mullis, executive director of the financial management office.
    There is currently at least one LGIP in the state, but that is operated
by the Kentucky Municipal League and the Kentucky Association of Counties,
Mullis noted.
    Although the state is permitted to establish an investment pool, one
has never been authorized, Mullis said.
    "If such a pool were begun, it would in all likelihood start with the
Investment Commission and be managed and administered by this office,"
Mullis added.
    Kentucky's cash fund is doing fairly well, Hamilton said, pointing to
the revenue surplus of several million dollars. He said he hopes to enhance
the surplus by examining ways to boost returns for the state's cash fund.
    "For me the biggest challenge ahead is restoring the sense of integrity
of this office," Hamilton said. "So maintaining a strong presence on the
Investment Commission will be a good step in that direction."

NONPROFIT IOWA HEALTH SYSTEMS TO MERGE

CHICAGO

    Two not-for-profit health systems in Iowa have signed a
preliminary agreement to merge, leaving unclear the status of $220 million
of outstanding debt.
    Officials of the Iowa Health System last week approved a memorandum of
understanding to merge with St. Luke's Health System. The memorandum is
good until March 1; Scott Eldridge, chief financial officer of St. Luke's,
said he expects the final agreement to be reached late next month.
    St. Luke's now has about $70 million of outstanding tax-exempt debt,
Eldridge said. All of the health system's bonds have been sold with
insurance, and therefore carry a triple-A rating, he added.
    The Iowa Health System has about $150 million of outstanding tax-exempt
revenue debt, according to chief financial officer William Miller. He said
the debt is rated A-plus by Standard & Poor's Corp. and A1 by Moody's
Investors Service.
    "I can't really say what will happen to the debt in the merged
organization because it hasn't been decided yet," said Eldridge.
    "We're sorting out those options now," echoed Miller. "One thing we
know for sure is that there certainly won't be a refinancing."
    Eldridge suggested that the two groups may become jointly obligated for
the combined $220 million of debt now outstanding.
    "It looks like ultimately, we will (both) be fully responsible for all
the debt of the merged organization, instead of carrying individual debt
for each operating unit," he added.
    Eldridge said Sioux City-based St. Luke's decided to merge with Des
Moines-based Iowa Health System primarily to capture a bigger share of
statewide managed-care health contracts.
    "Both systems are strong, and they'll be getting stronger through the
merger," said Eldridge. "We view it as a way to attract more (primary care)
physicians into our systems."

SCHOOLS' NEEDS ARE FERTILE GROUND

By Kieran Beer

    There was a time when immigrant children from all over the world got
their first taste of the American dream at the local public school.
    Public schools constructed in the 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s were safe,
clean, well-lit places. Some of them were even elegant structures,
expressions of the nation's faith in public education and the opportunity
for personal advancement.
    Times certainly have changed. The structures built decades ago, which
served to school other generations, are in decay, and there seems to be
little public will to restore them or to build new schools.
    That certainly is the conclusion of the page one story that ran in the
New York Times the day after Christmas. The story cited hard numbers from
the Government Accounting Office that $112 billion is needed to renovate
old schools and build new ones. Despite that need, states, municipalities,
and school districts are spending less than ever on schools'
infrastructure.
    The Times account also offered anecdotal evidence of our neglect of
schools that sound like accounts of life in the third world: a collapsed
ceiling in Montgomery County, Ala., that could have injured children; a
leaky roof and condemned gymnasium in a New York City school; and termite
infestation in New Orleans.
    Like any crisis, the state of the infrastructure of America's public
schools has myriad causes. Among these are overcrowding caused by a new
wave of immigrants - particularly in places like Texas, Florida,
California, and New York - and the fact that baby boomers have produced
their own boomlet of school-age children. But no confluence of problems
excuses our society's indifference to children and to the dark future such
indifference will create.
    All of this provides muni bankers with an opportunity to be the good
guys, despite all the heat they have taken during the debate about a flat
tax. A number of flat tax proponents have characterized muni bankers -
referring to them as Wall Street bankers to emphasize their distance from
Main Street - as an ignoble lot who, in league with government bureaucrats,
help fund boondoggles and profit at the expense of the taxpayer. Well,
building and repairing schools is not a boondoggle - it is a noble
endeavor.
    But to be the good guys, the municipal bond community will need to
continue to reinvent itself. Even as a number of more nimble firms are
looking at project finance and other alternative methods of finance, the
municipal bond community should be exploring both traditional and new ways
to build new schools and repair existing ones.
    Alternative methods of finance are necessary given the anti-tax, anti-
spend political climate. Brokering a private-public partnership between the
information technology vendors and the states to upgrade schools is one
place to start.
    Another reason creative methods of finance will be needed for education
infrastructure is that education itself needs to undergo revolutionary
change. Even as we try to figure out ways to give kids good one-on-one
learning experiences with teachers, it is important to apply the revolution
in information technology to education. (Hence, the importance of the
information technology companies.)
    There is no reason that a state's best teachers - or even the country's
- should not be accessible electronically to thousands of children
regardless of the school districts they live in, one member of the
municipal bond community observed. "Schools ought to look more like the
Sony Movie Megaplex than Adlai Stevenson (Intermediate High School)," said
an investment banker.
    There are many obstacles - including the need to work out the tension
between local and regional control of schools. But a vision that returns to
making school structures express our faith in education and the future is
worth fighting for.

NEWS AND TRENDS: SOUTH CAROLINA TREASURY VOLUNTEERS EARN HAPPY RETURNS
OVER HOLIDAYS

By Richard Richtmyer

    While most public employees in South Carolina were doing their last-
minute holiday shopping on Dec. 23, Treasurer Richard A. Eckstrom and
several Treasury staffers were busy with some shopping of their own -
hunting for bargains in the capital markets.
    And on Dec. 26, while the malls were jammed with people waiting in line
to make their holiday shopping returns, the state Treasury was looking for
higher returns on South Carolina's surplus funds.
    Although both days were official state holidays, the treasurer and some
staff members volunteered their time - while investment banks and the
Federal Reserve were open - in an effort to boost the returns on state
funds that otherwise would have remained dormant, according to John
Pownall, deputy treasurer in charge of investments.
    In all, the state Treasury managed to pick up about $11,300 in extra
income on $152 million in idle funds over the holidays, Pownall said. The
total returns were about $93,700, while they would have been about $82,400
had the funds been allowed to remain dormant, earning about 4.8%, he
said.
    The state picked up the extra income by investing in five-day
repurchase agreements with state banks, Pownall said.
    Eckstrom and Pownall, along with Treasury staff members Faye Nealy,
Leanne Register, and Chuck Sanders, participated in the volunteer effort,
which was the second time the group had volunteered on holidays. The first
was on Nov. 24, the Friday after Thanksgiving.
    During that holiday, though, the extra earnings were less - about
$3,000 extra on a total investment of $43 million, Pownall said.
    The idea for the volunteer program came from long-time treasury staffer
Ken Cliatt, Pownall said.
    "As soon as we took office, (Cliatt) sent me an e-mail message telling
me that he had been suggesting this for some time," Pownall said. "He
thought there was some low-hanging fruit here that we could take advantage
of. And we thought that this was just too good an idea to pass up - it's
just common sense, basic investing."
    Although the extra earnings are not earmarked for charities because of
statutory restrictions, the benefits will be passed on to the people of the
state, who can in turn pass them on to the state's needy, Pownall said.
    "(Giving the money to charity) is a great idea, but unfortunately it's
something that the law wouldn't allow us to do," Pownall said.
    "But we think that to the extent that the taxpayers have a little extra
money in their pockets, maybe they can put it to use in charities or other
causes," he continued.
    "It may be a Christmas present to the taxpayers."

WHAT'S SELLING: COLORADO PAPER RATES COMING BACK TO EARTH AFTER BUSY
DECEMBERBY SARAH STIRLAND


    Colorado paper is currently trading at rates that are less
stratospheric than usual, according to Richard O'Connor, a municipal trader
in Kirkpatrick Pettis' Denver office.
    "Sometimes Colorado paper gets levels out for the bid that you can't
believe," he said.
    Last Wednesday, "Colorado paper got a number that you would consider a
strong general-market number. It wasn't trading as though there were no
Colorado paper around."
    O'Connor attributes this change to the lack of market participants at
this time of year and November's flood of issuance in the state.
    Normally, Colorado municipal bonds trade at above-market levels because
Amendment 1 has made in-state paper scarce. The amendment mandates that all
new bond issuance must be voter-approved.
    In early December, retail investors in Colorado were gobbling up
prerefunded bonds with a vengeance.
    "There was a huge appetite for prerefunds - you couldn't find bonds.
There was so much retail appetite because a lot of money came due Dec. 1,"
he said. "You could easily sell a $1 million block of prerefunded bonds."
    Many retail investors, who tend to be older retirees, have a preference
for these types of Treasury-backed securities or for other triple-A rated
names because of previous bad experiences with higher yielding credits,
O'Connor said.
    "When you have your older investors who have been burned in the past on
lesser credits, they don't care what it is so long as it's Moody's
(Investors Service) and (Standard & Poor's Corp.) triple-A," he said.
    To get his hands on prerefunded Colorado bonds, O'Connor contacted
mutual funds that owned the securities and offered them high prices, he
said.
    "You pay them what would appear at the time a fairly stellar number for
bonds - they couldn't necessarily turn you down and you turn around and
flip (the bonds) in a phone call," he said.

CALIFORNIA QUAKE AUTHORITY SLATES BOND SALE

LOS ANGELES

    The newly formed California Earthquake Authority has
slated a syndicate led by Morgan Stanley & Co. to underwrite a $1.5 billion
revenue bond sale later this year, part of the $10.5 billion in funds the
new agency needs.
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Bear Stearns & Co. are also among the major
firms in the syndicate, according to the announcement from insurance
commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
    In addition to the bond sale, other funding sources for the authority's
plan to pay homeowner earthquake damage claims includes $1 billion in cash
contributions from insurance companies, and another $3 billion in funds
promised by insurance companies if necessary to pay claims.
    The plan also includes $2 billion from reinsurers, $1 billion assessed
from earthquake insurance policy holders, and $2 billion from additional
assessments on insurers, Quackenbush spokesman Richard Wiebe said.
    Quackenbush, elected in November 1994, returned last month from a two-
week global jaunt aimed at seeking reinsurance for the new authority.
    Gov. Pete Wilson in October signed into a law a bill appropriating
$500,000 to investigate the viability of an earthquake insurance authority
and laying much of the groundwork needed for its start-up.
    Quackenbush and Wilson proposed the authority's creation last summer in
the wake of an exodus of homeowner's insurance carriers after massive
damage claims stemming from the January 1994 Northridge earthquake near Los
Angeles.

PROBE OF EL PASO COUNTY, COLO., FUND BROADENS TO EXAMINE TREASURER

By Darrell Preston
DALLAS

    An investigation into the El Paso County, Colo. pension fund
has widened to include treasurer Sharon Shipley.
    El Paso County district attorney John Suthers' office confirmed last
week that Shipley is now being included in an investigation centering on
former pension fund manager Mike Witty.
    Witty resigned from the pension board in 1994 after the county
discovered there was no bidding process when he was awarded consulting
contracts to oversee the $80 million fund's real estate investments,
according to county officials.
    However, the inclusion of Shipley in the inquiry is not expected to
have any immediate impact on the treasurer's office or county finances or
operations, said Ken Kile, deputy county treasurer.
    "I don't believe it's gotten to the point where it will have much
effect," said Kile.
    Shipley, who is still on the job, did not return telephone calls
seeking comment.
    Suthers' investigation began after the county learned of a secret,
unauthorized bank account that Witty allegedly set up in the fund's name in
1993. Since then, two audits have been launched, including one by the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which county commissioners approved in
early December.
    But last week Suthers announced that his investigation had grown to
include charges that Shipley and pension fund board member Carl Hatton
borrowed thousands of dollars from Witty while he was awarded consulting
work.
    Hatton resigned from the board after Suthers' announcement Dec. 26, but
Shipley, who served as chairwoman of the pension fund until Dec. 20,
remains on the board. The new chairman is Dan May, a deputy district
attorney who has been on the board since 1994.
    Hatton and Witty could not be reached by press time.
    An audit county commissioners released Dec. 18 found that while Witty
controlled county pension funds, they were invested heavily in real estate.
The report by Aurora, Colo.-based Comiskey & Co. found that the fund's
concentration in real estate increased to 34% from zero between 1992 and
1994.
    An earlier audit in May 1994 noted that besides his $55,000 salary to
manage the fund, Witty earned more than $500,000 in 1993 and 1994 under his
contract with the fund as a private consultant to oversee the fund's real
estate investments.

WHAT TO DO WITH A CALIFORNIA BUDGET SURPLUS

LOS ANGELES

    When California Journal - a Sacramento-based political
monthly magazine - recently asked a number of state budget observers about
a hypothetical surplus of $1 billion, it got responses ranging from doubt
that such a positive number could ever occur to calls for tax cuts.
    Stephen Zimmermann, Western region managing director for Standard &
Poor's Corp. in San Francisco, said in the Journal's January issue that
California's first priority must be to pass a true balanced budget - one
that doesn't require crossover borrowing from one fiscal year to another.
He also suggested a reasonable reserve of at least several percent of the
budget.
    "As for further bonded debt, we'd like to see a real capital needs plan
that prioritizes expenditures funded by bonds," Zimmermann told the state's
leading political journal.
    "California's current debt service is now about 5% of the budget," he
added. "That's considered moderate, so increasing it is not particularly a
problem, as long as the capital expenditures are orderly and planned."
    Joel Fox, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association,
suggested that a surplus ought to retire bond debt to improve the state's
bond ratings.
    The anti-tax activist also told the Journal that some taxes should be
trimmed, and suggested that the state's massive surplus under former Gov.
Ronald Reagan in 1974 led to pressure that brought about tax and bonding
limits under Proposition 13.

MOODY'S SEES NEXT HUD BILL HAVING 'FAR-REACHING' IMPACT ON BONDS

By Joan Pryde
WASHINGTON

    Moody's Investors Service says provisions in the still-
unresolved HUD appropriations bill for fiscal 1996 set the stage for major
changes in bond-related federal housing programs next year when lawmakers
draft legislation reauthorizing those programs.
    "While the housing appropriations bill did not contain substantial
changes to Section 8 or FHA insurance, it would appear to indicate that the
final outcome of the Capitol Hill debate on housing programs may have more
far-reaching implications for bonds backed by such federal housing
assistance, as well as for bondholder security," Moody's said in a recent
report.
    Congress passed the funding bill for the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and agencies within HUD such as the Federal Housing
Administration, in late November. President Clinton vetoed the measure on
Dec. 18, because he disagreed with funding levels of other agencies in the
bill not related to HUD. Congress is expected to try to fashion a new bill
more to his liking.
    Among the HUD provisions in the vetoed bill important to the municipal
market, one would have given HUD temporary authority to renew expiring
subsidy contracts under the Section 8 rent subsidy program. The provision
is designed to keep alive revenue streams for bond-financed multifamily
housing projects under the program while Congress in 1996 comes up with a
plan for revamping the Section 8 program.
    Although Moody's said the provision is helpful to keep those projects
going, the bill does not provide for subsidy increases during the next
year, which could cause problems.
    "Extending contracts at current contract rents for one year would keep
subsidy levels constant," the ratings agency said in a report titled
Moody's Monitors Rating Implications of HUD Debate. "To the extent,
however, that expenses increase while subsidy levels remain constant, this
may signal the beginning of new financial stresses for these projects,
subject to the economics of individual projects."
    The Clinton administration and Congress want to overhaul the Section 8
program because the federal government cannot afford to renew the thousands
of subsidy contracts set to expire in the next several years. The
administration has proposed transforming the subsidies - which now are paid
to project owners - into certificates issued directly to tenants.
    For projects also backed by FHA insurance, the administration has
proposed requiring owners to "mark to market" - that is, adjust their
contract rents to market levels and restructure their underlying debt. In
the event that the lower rent could not support a given mortgage, the loan
would go into default, and a claim would be made against the FHA insurance
fund.
    The appropriations bill just vetoed by Clinton included a provision
that would have permitted HUD to begin testing its mark-to-market plan on
15,000 units of multifamily housing out of a total of about 800,000 that
receive Section 8 subsidies.
    Moody's said that trial would be instructive, because the big question
about mark-to-market is whether the FHA can handle a big influx of
insurance claims that is sure to result if the program is fully
implemented.
    "While the ratings on these bonds are based on the FHA insurance, a
question remains as to the ability of FHA to process and pay claims in a
timely fashion," especially if implementation of mark-to-market sharply
increased the number of claims that the housing agency was having to
process, Moody's said.
    If that were to happen, "Moody's view on these bonds could be
affected," the ratings agency said.
    Moody's said it has requested information from state housing finance
agencies regarding their multifamily portfolios "to better gauge the impact
of potential changes to the programs."
    "In the course of our ongoing surveillance efforts, we are maintaining
a dialogue with the agencies regarding the ways in which they are preparing
for potential changes which could affect their Section 8 portfolios,"
Moody's said.

CHANCES DWINDLE FOR REFORM OF THE GLASS-STEAGALL ACT

By Martha M. Canan

    The prospects for overhauling the Glass-Steagall Act have dimmed
considerably since last year because commercial banking and insurance
interests cannot resolve a dispute over bank insurance powers.
    As a result, the issue of whether banks should have authority to
underwrite municipal revenue bonds is being held hostage to the insurance
dispute, which threatens to derail House banking reform legislation this
year, lobbyists say.
    If Congress does not act on Glass-Steagall this year, the Federal
Reserve Board is expected to come under increasing pressure to expand bank
securities powers, including the ability to underwrite revenue bonds,
through regulatory action.
    The effort to reform the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which prohibits
mixing commercial and investment banking, gained momentum last spring when
the House Banking and Commerce committees passed a bill that would allow
banks and securities firms to affiliate through holding companies.
    The legislation would give banks new power to underwrite revenue bonds,
in addition to existing authority to directly underwrite less lucrative
general obligation bonds. However, banks would be required to engage in
such new activity only through separately capitalized holding-company
affiliates. An earlier version of the bill would have allowed banks to
directly underwrite revenue bonds, but the current language omits that
authority.
    The dispute between the commercial banking and insurance industries
involves a provision in a related regulatory relief bill that would halt
for at least five years any regulatory effort by the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency to expand bank insurance powers. A related
issue is whether to allow banks under federal law to affiliate with
insurance companies.
    Insurance interests strongly oppose letting commercial banks into their
business, while commercial banking interests view insurance activities as
essential to their ability to compete with other financial services
providers in a technologically advanced global marketplace.
    The insurance dispute has prevented the House leadership from bringing
the Glass-Steagall bill to the floor, because lawmakers do not want to
choose between the two influential industries, which contribute heavily to
political campaigns. House leaders have long planned to combine the Glass-
Steagall and regulatory relief measures into one package for a floor vote.
    Months-long negotiations between banking and insurance industry
representatives and House leaders and staff - including Speaker Newt
Gingrich, R-Ga., Rules Committee chairman Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and
Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa - have made little progress
towards crafting a compromise.
    In a recent letter to Thomas Labrecque, chairman and chief executive
officer of Chase Manhattan Corp. and member of the Bankers Roundtable,
Leach expressed his frustration with what he views as the intransigence of
banks that oppose any change in the U.S. comptroller's powers on bank
insurance, sources said.
    The letter, which the Banking Committee and the Roundtable refused to
release, prompted speculation that Leach may be ready to suspend or
terminate the talks, although some lobbyists said they could not imagine
Leach pulling the plug after all the effort he has put into passage of the
bill.
    A subsequent press release issued by the American Council of Life
Insurance last Thursday reinforced the pressure Leach appears to be putting
on the banks. The council "noted with regret the failure of negotiations
this year regarding insurance provisions contained in (the reform bill)."
The statement said ACLI officials "expressed frustration with the 'delaying
tactics' employed by banking representatives to reach a workable
compromise."
    The council, which represents 600 insurance companies, charged the
banking interests with being "inflexible," while saying that insurance
companies have made "significant concessions."
    But Alfred Pollard, senior director at the Roundtable, said the
statement reflects "the complexity and difficulty" of the numerous
insurance issues under discussion. "There has been no effort to delay on
our part," he said.
    At this point, "it's ... looking pretty bleak" for passage of a Glass-
Steagall bill in this Congress, said James McLaughlin, director of agency
relations for the American Bankers Association. "Most people ... think it
is already dead, but there is always a slim possibility, at least for the
first few months of the year," that the House will pass a bill in time for
the Senate to act, he said.
    Even if the House passes a bill, any debate in the Senate promises to
be contentious, as would be efforts to reconcile differing House and Senate
versions of the measure, McLaughlin and other lobbyists said.
    Legislation sponsored by Senate Banking Committee chairman Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., would allow affiliations not only between commercial banks
and securities firms, but also insurance companies and industrial
companies. This approach raises major policy issues, such as whether to
allow companies like General Motors into the banking and brokerage
businesses, McLaughlin said.
    D'Amato has said he will not act on his legislation until the House
takes action, a Senate Banking Committee spokesman said.
    D'Amato has made clear he does not want to repeat what occurred during
previous sessions of Congress, when the Senate three times passed a Glass-
Steagall reform bill, only to have it die in the House, lobbyists said.
However, election-year politics mean that Senate action cannot be ruled
out, even if the House fails to act, because senators may want to placate
financial services constituents who want reform, lobbyists said.
    House Banking Committee spokesman Dave Runkel maintained that the House
Glass-Steagall bill "is not dead" and that committee staff, led by Joseph
Seidel, are continuing to broker meetings with banking and insurance
industry representatives to reach a compromise.
    While the main sticking point is over insurance, the rest of the bill
affecting the ability of banks and securities firms to enter each other's
business "is pretty much intact," Runkel said.
    Wall Street and regional securities firms have differing interests and
concerns about letting commercial banks into their business, with regional
firms more opposed to competition from banks. The Securities Industry
Association has said it supports legislation that would put securities
firms on equal footing with banks and not subject the firms to more
burdensome banking regulation.
    The securities association has been supportive of banking interests on
the insurance dispute, because securities firms that want to enter
commercial banking do not want to be forced to divest insurance-related
businesses.
    But the securities group opposes letting banks directly underwrite
revenue bonds and other securities, and the association was a major force
in getting Leach to change the bill to require banks to engage in such
activity through separately capitalized units.
    But the requirement would discourage many of the couple of hundred
banks that now underwrite GO bonds from setting up separate units to sell
revenue bonds because of higher associated costs, McLaughlin said. Among
other things, the banks would have to set up firewalls between the
affiliate and the parent and other units, which would mean separate boards,
separate sales, no joint marketing, and other mechanisms aimed at
protecting federally insured deposits from the risks of investment banking.
    Roughly 30 banks now have affiliates engaged in so-called non-eligible
securities activities, such as revenue bond underwriting, under Section 20
of the Glass-Steagall Act. The Fed allows creation of such affiliates that
meet strict revenue limit, firewall, and other requirements.
    If Congress does not act this year, the Fed is expected to come under
pressure to ease these requirements for Section 20 affiliates, thus paving
the way for expanded bank securities activities. But the Fed probably would
act only in small incremental steps, and many banks still would be
discouraged from setting up Section 20 units because of costs, banking
lobbyists say.
    Fed regulations now limit revenues that can be derived from Section 20
securities activities to 10% of gross revenues. The Fed could "easily"
raise this cap to 25%, "if not higher," said Melanie Fein, a banking
attorney with Arnold & Porter.
    However, Gingrich said in a recent letter to Leach that he has no
intention of contacting the Fed to encourage such action. "I prefer passing
the Glass-Steagall bill in as close a consensus position as possible so
that Congress will ultimately make the policy determinations on these
important issues, and not regulators," he said.
    The Dec. 13 letter came as a follow-up to a meeting earlier in the
month among Gingrich, Leach, congressional staff, and representatives of
J.P. Morgan & Co., Banc One, Chase Manhattan Bank, Chemical Bank, and Bank
of America. Gingrich said the banking representatives appeared to have
misunderstood his answer to a question about Fed activity in this area.
    Meanwhile, a "pivotal event" for banks this year that could change the
whole face of the Glass-Steagall debate promises to be a U.S. Supreme Court
decision, which is expected by the end of June in Barnett Bank v. Tom
Gallagher, Insurance Commissioner, Fein said.
    The case, which is set for oral argument on Jan. 16, asks whether
national banks with branches in towns of less than 5,000 people have the
right to sell insurance in small towns, even if a state law prohibits any
such activity. The National Bank Act prohibits national banks from
underwriting insurance but contains a key exemption allowing such activity
in towns of up to 5,000.
    More than a dozen states have "anti-affiliation" laws like the Florida
law at issue in the case. These laws prohibit commercial banks from
encroaching on the business of insurance agents.
    If the high court rules that state law "trumps federal law in this
area, then banks would not be able to use the town of 5,000 exemption to
sell insurance," Fein said. "That would mean that banks would need to push
harder in Congress to gain legislative authority to sell insurance," she
said.
    If the court rules that the federal law preempts local law, banks would
have even less need than they do now for Glass-Steagall reform legislation,
Fein said. Much will depend on the decision, which could be limited in its
impact depending on how narrow it is, she said.

LOUISIANA GOVERNOR-ELECT: VOTERS NEED A VOICE ON GAMING

By Christopher McEntee
ATLANTA

     Louisiana Governor-elect Mike Foster says voters should
decide whether they want gambling, and plans to call a special session for
mid-March to get lawmakers' support for a referendum.
    A referendum would either uphold or throw out video poker, riverboat
gambling, and the New Orleans land-based casino that the state Legislature
made legal in a 1992 act.
    Foster, who takes office Jan. 8, feels that gambling was "rammed down
the people's throat" without a referendum, said Marsanne Golsby, Foster's
press secretary. Moreover, public opinion has soured on gambling because of
federal probes of several state lawmakers' connections with the gaming
industry and poor revenue growth from gaming.
    Rather than allowing separate votes for each form of gaming, Foster
will request an "all-or-nothing" vote, Golsby said.
    Regardless of the outcome of the referendum, Louisiana will have
gambling for the foreseeable future. The state has existing contracts or
licenses with a number of operators that would not be affected by the vote,
Golsby said. Gambling would have to be phased out as licenses and contracts
expire.
    In the some cases, such as video poker, the state grants a one-year
license annually, so these machines could be shut down almost immediately
if voters reject gaming. But the state's 12 riverboats would stick around
longer because they were given five-year contracts that start to run out in
1998.
    But New Orleans voters could have to wait until Harrah's Jazz Co.'s 30-
year contract runs out before they see a land-based casino leave their
city. That is unless that contract was broken when Harrah's Jazz, the
partnership developing the casino, filed for voluntary bankruptcy
protection on Nov. 22.
    Foster and his aides are working closely with Harrah's Jazz, Golsby
said, to figure out what the company intends to do about its finances and
its plans to build what they claimed would be the world's largest casino.
The partnership has until mid-March to present a reorganization plan in
U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
    But Golsby said Foster is reluctant to comment about Harrah's plans,
other than saying the state will review its proposals when it comes to
revenue-sharing agreements.
    For its part, Harrah's Jazz says it wants to push ahead with casino
building, yet Louisiana must cut red tape associated with the project and
allow it to reduce capital and fixed costs in its operating contract.
    Harrah's Entertainment vice president Colin V. Reed said last month
three changes must be made to its contract before a casino can be
"successful in a market that has substantially less" demand for gambling
than first imagined.
    First, the casino would scale back the number of slot machines and
games. Secondly, Harrah's Jazz would ask its bondholders to become equity
partners in the operation while it attempts to secure more cash.
    Lastly, Harrah's Jazz said the state must be more "flexible" about
receiving the $100 million minimum annual tax Harrah's Jazz is committed to
paying. The tax is the single largest fixed cost in the project.
    Reed suggested that the state should take $125 million, which has
already been paid, and use that money as an advance on the tax until the
permanent casino is in business. He claimed that the deferral of taxes
would be acceptable under state law because the casino would not be able to
make its minimum payments otherwise.
    Under their plan, the state expected to receive the greater of 18.5% of
gaming revenues or a $100 million flat tax from its sole New Orleans
casino, operated by Harrah's Jazz. To date, the state has received only $13
million from a temporary casino set up in advance of the permanent Harrah's
facility.
    State budget officials estimate that riverboats and video poker will
generate about $375 million in tax revenue throughout Louisiana in fiscal
1996.
    If they intend to repeal gaming laws, state lawmakers must approve a
constitutional amendment by a two-thirds vote and ask that voters take up
the issue. If legislators approve an amendment in mid-March, it could go
before the public 45 days later at the earliest, or be placed on the ballot
in November.

ENDING WITH A BANG, 1995 VOLUME SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS

By Yong Lim

    Suprising market observers, December was the fifth straight month in
which municipal bond issuance beat 1994 levels, according to figures
compiled from Securities Data Co.
    However, 1994 still stays slightly ahead of 1995 for overall long-term
new-issue volume.
    State and local governments sold 818 issues totaling $16.76 billion in
December, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in December
1994. This follows June and November of 1995, with $18.4 billion and $17.99
billion, respectively, as the third biggest month of new-issue volume.
    In 1995, bond sales totaled $156.22 billion, 5% below the $164.5
billion sold in 1994.
    Refunding issues rose a staggering 273% in December, to $3.86 billion
from $1.04 billion in December 1994, while issues that combined new-money
and refunding bonds rose nearly twelve-fold in December, to $1.69 billion
from $131 million.
    New-money issuance ended 1995 at $111.15 billion, 3% below 1994's
figure of $114.31 billion. Refundings for the year were $32.94 billion,
down 15% from $38.91 billion, while combined issues totaled $12.13 billion,
up 8% from $11.28 billion.
    Transportation, education, and housing were the only specific purposes
to show increases in bond sales from 1994. Transportation issues were up a
solid 13% in 1995, to $16.78 billion from $14.82 billion. Education issues
had a small 8% increase to $32.06 billion from $29.6 billion in 1994.
Housing increased a slight 2% to $16.16 billion from $15.86 billion in
1994.
    Public facilities, which covers libraries, stadiums, and fire stations,
suffered the greatest percentage drop from 1994, falling a hefty 32% to
$5.68 billion from $8.37 billion. The largest category, general purpose,
posted a 5% decline in 1995, to $39.37 billion from $41.57 billion.
Declines in other purpose categories ranged from a scant 4% dip for
utilities to a large 28% decline for environmental facilities.
    New issues subject to the alternative minimum tax for individuals
remained slightly above 1994 levels, rising 7%, to $17.95 billion from
$16.86 billion. Taxable municipal bond sales posted a 13% rise, to $9.53
billion from $8.45 billion.
    Bonds sold through negotiation rose a meek 0.3% in 1995, to $112.63
billion from $112.25 billion in 1994. Competitively sold issues declined a
solid 17%, to $40.85 billion from $49.47 billion.
    Revenue bond financing fell 11% in 1995, to $96.73 billion from $108.71
billion in 1994. General obligation issuance, however, rose a modest 7%, to
$59.49 billion from $55.79 billion.
    Variable-rate securities rose 5% in 1995, to $19.16 billion from $18.32
billion. The sale of convertible municipal bonds, which are zero-coupon
bonds that can be converted into current-coupon securities, have
quadrupled, to $296.5 million from just $69.3 million in 1994.
    The use of bond insurance to enhance new municipal issues increased 11%
in 1995, to $68.08 billion from $61.31 billion.
    Bank letters of credit declined 19% in 1995, to $9.91 billion from
$12.16 billion in 1994, while the use of collateralized mortgages and
mortgage insurance fell 21%, to $3.72 billion from $4.72 billion.
    California issuers were the busiest among the 50 states in 1995,
selling $20.14 billion. That was down 21% from $25.62 billion in 1994. New
York was second with $18.73 billion, down 1%, followed by Texas with $10.47
billion, up 1%; Florida with $9.05 billion, up a strong 18%; and
Pennsylvania with $7.15 billion, down 19%. Only 26 states and one U.S.
territory reported higher new-issue volume in 1995. North Dakota reported
the highest increase, doubling its 1994 volume of $241 million to $547
million in 1995. Delaware had the biggest decrease in volume, cutting in
half its 1994 figure of $364 million to $163 million in 1995.
    Bond issuance dropped more strongly at the state level than at the
local level in 1995. Cities, villages, towns, counties, local districts,
and local authorities showed a combined 2% drop in 1995, to $91.25 billion
from $93.4 billion. At the same time, state governments and agencies posted
a combined 9% decline, to $62.49 billion from $68.38 billion.
    Securities Data's volume figures are based on long-term bonds with
final maturities of 13 months or more. Private placements are included, but
taxable bonds sold by private nonprofit organizations and remarketings of
variable-rate bonds are excluded. The figures are preliminary and subject
to revision.

CASH FLOWS BACK INTO MUTUAL FUNDS, BUT NOT EVERYONE GETS A SHARE

By Elizabeth Roy

    Cash flows into both national and single-state mutual funds edged into
positive territory in November, reaching $274.8 million and partly undoing
October's $509.4 million in losses, according to figures from the
Investment Company Institute.
    The gains were modest, however, and several mutual fund companies said
they had not seen their share. They blamed the growing appeal of retirement
investing, the stock market's stellar performance, and the delayed federal
budget for investors' lack of interest.
    According to the ICI, national funds saw inflows of $190.4 million in
November, compared to October's outflows of $284.2 million. With reinvested
dividends the figures were inflows of $528.9 million and $55.6 million,
respectively.
    State funds gained $84.4 million in November, compared to losses of
$225.5 million the previous month. With reinvested dividends, there were
inflows of $349.2 million and $40.3 million, respectively.
    Municipal money market funds also posted inflows in November, as in
October. Excluding reinvested dividends, the funds added $12.5 billion in
November, compared to $13.1 billion the previous month. Including
dividends, both months recorded $15.3 billion inflows.
    In its monthly report, Charles Schwab Investment Management Inc. said
it sold just $300,000 net of all firms' tax-advantaged bond funds in
November, down from $35.6 million in October, with reinvested dividends
included.
    A drop in sales from $136.8 million in October to $104.5 million in
November accounted for the bulk of the shift, according to Schwab spokesman
Tom Taggart.
    At least part of the drop is seasonal, Taggart said.
    "Toward the end of the year, a lot of people tend to reshuffle their
portfolios," he said.
    In addition, Taggart said, the stock market's excellent performance has
led many investors to shift cash from bonds to equities in anticipation of
another great year for stocks.
    The growth of retirement investing has further sidelined municipals,
since those tax-deferred assets do not flow into tax-exempt funds, Taggart
said.
    Fidelity Management & Research Co. experienced net sales of $14 million
in November, including reinvested dividends, according to spokeswoman Teri
Kilduff.
    But as of Dec. 21, Fidelity's tax-free funds had experienced net
redemptions of $41 million - a development Kilduff blamed on investor
anxiety over the delayed federal budget.
    At Stein Roe & Farnham Inc., spokeswoman Marilyn Morrison said:
"Municipal bonds continue to be pretty stagnant."
    The largest outflows have come from the firm's national long-term fund,
while its intermediate fund has seen the lightest redemptions, Morrison
said.
    The firm attributes that pattern to investor perception that long-term
funds will suffer most in the event of major tax reform, she added.
    By contrast, USAA Investment Management Co. benefited from the net
sales trend identified by the ICI. Company president Michael Roth said the
firm's tax-free funds saw inflows of $41 million in November. Roth said
investors were attracted by the high yields reached by municipals due to
the market's rally and fear of tax reform.
    Smith Barney Inc. has also seen its share of gains, said executive vice
president Jessica Bibliowicz. December has emerged as the strongest month
of 1995 for its tax-free funds, which also posted gains in November, she
said.
    Investor confidence in portfolio manager Joe Deane is largely
responsible, according to Bibliowicz.
    "Being the number-one ranked fund doesn't hurt," she said.

CALIFORNIA DEBATES WHETHER TO LINK SCHOOL FUNDING TO BUILDING PRISONS

By Antonio A. Prado
LOS ANGELES

    Top California GOP lawmakers said they hope partisan
politics don't get in the way as they reconvene today in hopes of passing a
resolution by next Monday to place a $3 billion state school general
obligation bond issue on the March 26 primary election ballot.
    Last year's legislative session ended in September with Republicans and
Democrats deadlocked over GOP insistence that school bonds be linked to a
prison bond initiative.
    That stalemate must be broken within the next few days, or the measures
will have to wait until November for the next opportunity to appear on a
statewide ballot, according to California Secretary of State Bill Jones.
    However, the same stumbling blocks that tripped up the bill in
September are still in place. While both sides agree on the need for school
construction funding, a Republican bill to be introduced today by
Assemblyman Jim Brulte, R-Rancho Cucamonga, nonetheless includes a $1.9
billion GO bond measure for new prison construction.
    "We have a need for school construction, and a need for prison
construction, and Republicans will propose a bill in the early part of the
session to do both," Brulte said in a press statement.
    The Democratic school bond proposal does not include the prison bond
provisions. Both measures require two-thirds majority approval in the
Assembly and state Senate for passage.
    "The Republican approach is still to hold the schools hostage to
building prisons," said Assemblyman Richard Katz, D-Los Angeles, who last
month succeeded San Francisco Mayor-elect Willie L. Brown Jr. as the lower
house's top Democrat.
    "The Democratic view is (that) we need to build public schools to
reduce class size," Katz said. "And after we deal with schools, then we'll
deal with prisons."
    Aides to Brulte and Katz would not speculate on whether either side
would budge and allow a compromise.
    When the Legislature reconvenes today, the raucous Assembly will return
to a divided house and probable battles over its leadership.
    With Brown's departure on Dec. 14 following his election as San
Francisco mayor, the Assembly was left with 41 Republicans, 37 Democrats,
one Reform Party member, and one vacancy.
    The GOP will probably try to install Orange County assemblyman and
party leader Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, into the speakership, ousting
Brian Setencich, R-Fresno. Republicans are wary of Setencich because he was
elected in an overwhelmingly Democratic vote.
    And while the more docile state Senate has 21 Democrats holding a
simple majority control - with 16 Republicans, two independents, and one
vacancy - Brulte's bond bill probably won't gain the 27 votes needed to
pass even that less partisan body.
    Senate president pro tempore Bill Lockyer, D-Hayward, said he opposes
any linkage of school bonds to prisons, adding through an aide that his
party caucus wants to curb what he called the "reckless spending" that has
made California's prisons among the most expensive in the nation.
    Meanwhile, education groups are urging lawmakers to cast politics aside
and place school GO bonds on the March ballot.
    The state Department of Finance has estimated that California's school
capital project needs at least $7 billion to refurbish aging facilities and
build new schools to handle statewide enrollments estimated at 140,000 new
students annually.
    "If California's financial situation were more dire, I could understand
my colleagues' concerns," said longtime Assemblywoman Dede Alpert, D-La
Jolla, chairwoman of the Assembly Education Committee, and among those
opposed to linking school and prison bonds. "But our classrooms are the
most overcrowded in the nation."
    She added that while California's debt levels are up, they are moderate
compared to some states.

N.Y.C. ECONOMIC AGENCY POSTS ANOTHER BANNER YEAR

By Christina Pretto

     Increased business confidence in the local economy helped to make 1995
another record year for the bonding arm of the New York City Economic
Development Corp.
    In one fell swoop last year, the city's Industrial Development Agency
used up its entire annual allotment of private-activity bond volume - $120
million - to help finance a recycling plant on Staten Island for Pratt
Industries, an Australian company.
    That deal and others, including some scheduled to close this week,
brings the agency's total issuance for the year to more than $864 million,
just $7 million less than 1994's $871 million. Going forward, development
agency officials expect 1996 issuance levels to resemble those in 1995.
    The agency is able to exceed its annual allotment of private-activity
bonds by using allocations built up in previous years and by applying for
extra capacity from state private-activity reserves.
    In 1995, the agency completed 39 transactions that ranged in size from
$253 million to $1.3 million. In 1994, the agency completed 24
transactions.
    The numbers run in sharp contrast to issuance levels between 1987 and
1993. The most bonds issued in the period was $417 million of debt in 1991.
A more typical year was 1987, when the agency issued about $44 million of
debt.
    Corporation officials attribute the increase largely to a greater
confidence in the economy on the part of small businesses and nonprofits,
which has made the businesses more willing to take on long-term debt.
Better marketing of the agency's programs has also increased demand, they
said.
    Indeed, corporation president Charles Millard said he would like more
businesses and nonprofits - especially smaller ones - to take advantage of
the Development Agency's ability to issue tax-exempt bonds to raise
capital. Such financing is viewed by city officials as an investment tool
to revive the city's weak economy.
    The Industrial Development Agency is a subsidiary of the Economic
Development Corp., a public-benefit, quasi-governmental entity that is
charged with improving the city's business climate.
    The Development Agency - among other programs - issues revenue bonds
for both businesses and nonprofit 501(c)(3) organizations needing funds for
capital investment.
    Both the corporation and the Development Agency have been at the
forefront of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to retain and attract
business - and thus jobs and tax revenues, crucial to a city that in the
last five years has lost more than 400,000 jobs while battling to close
chronic multibillion-dollar budget gaps.
    The issue for Pratt Industries is a key transaction in Giuliani's
agenda to bring in new business. The agency plans to sell another $150
million of debt for Pratt in 1996.
    The agency also recently sold about $253 million of bonds to finance a
co-generation plant for the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a transaction that was
begun nearly four years ago. Together, the two projects are expected to
generate more than 800 jobs.
    But the agency is not focused solely on large deals - quite the
opposite. The lion's share of its issues over the past two years have been
less than $10 million, and have targeted smaller businesses and nonprofits,
such as a $1.3 million issue for the Dance Theater Workshop, a Manhattan
dance group.
    "I want more not-for-profits and small businesses to know we're
available," Millard said in a telephone interview. "If they can get access
to capital, then they can have an opportunity to grow."
    Many of the smaller issues are unrated and privately placed with funds
that are familiar with agency programs and need to diversify their
portfolios with small blocks of debt that are still triple- or double-tax-
exempt. The bonds are rarely traded and instead are held to maturity.
    To facilitate many of the agency's debt transactions, the corporation
must first acquire a title interest in a client's property. Such
acquisition creates a public interest in the business and legally justifies
the issuance of tax-exempt bonds.
    Issuance is also subject to allocation of New York State's allotment of
private-activity bond capacity. Of the state's $900 million annual private-
activity capacity, the city's Development Agency receives $120 million a
year.
    The agency may also apply for reserve allocation, which the state sets
aside every year, totaling $300 million. Both state and local agencies may
draw from the reserve on a case-by-case basis, subject to approval by the
state Economic Development Department, headed by Charles Gargano.

S&P SAYS UPGRADE FOR N.Y. WILL COME WITH BUDGET BALANCE

By Christina Pretto

    Standard & Poor's Corp. last week said New York State is in line for an
upgrade to A from A-minus if Republican Gov. George Pataki succeeds in
pushing through plans to cut spending and impose structural balance for the
fiscal 1997 budget.
    However, the rating agency warned that an upgrade to above the A-level
is years away because the state has yet to demonstrate a commitment to
fiscal responsibility over an extended period.
    Market reaction to the statement was virtually nil, as holiday doldrums
kept trading activity low, several traders said.
    "New York paper is pretty stretched as it is," one trader said. "I
think everybody is into a holiday mode."
    Nonetheless, market participants have been grumbling over the past few
months that the state - the lowest rated in the country by Standard &
Poor's - is due for an upgrade as it embarks on a path of tax cuts coupled
with spending reductions.
    The upgrade to A - if it happens - will occur in or around March.
Richard Marino, a director at Standard & Poor's, said in an interview last
week that the positive outlook on the rating would be removed at around
that time.
    "We're going to make a determination as to whether the rating is A or
A-minus in March," Marino said. "At that point we'll take the positive
outlook off the rating and replace it with a stable outlook."
    An upgrade to A will hinge on the state's enacting a structurally
balanced budget that reduces general-fund spending, like that currently
being proposed by Pataki, Marino said.
    Whether that happens, however, is subject to significant risk,
including legislative opposition to cuts in social service spending and
uncertainty surrounding changes in federal funding for entitlement
programs, Marino added.
    Moody's Investors Service already rates New York State's general
obligation bonds A.
    Overall, Standard & Poor's praised Pataki's proposed $63.3 billion all-
funds budget for the fiscal year that begins April 1 - particularly the
administration's effort to introduce the plan a month ahead of schedule.
    "This was an extremely difficult task given the uncertainty surrounding
the federal budget," the rating agency said in a statement.
    The plan also calls for reducing state general-fund spending for the
second straight year, moving budgeting to a cash basis, and balancing tax
cuts with cuts in spending, particularly in Medicaid.
    Separate but related budget initiatives include a proposal by Pataki
that both the executive and legislative branches agree on one set of
revenue estimates for budget deliberations, which rating analysts said
would be a step in the right direction.
    "Any serious movement ... to this method of revenue forecasting would
be viewed positively," Standard & Poor's said.
    Currently, the two parties constantly haggle over revenue estimates,
which are often revised upward simply to accommodate an unwillingness to
reduce spending. As a result, deficits are exacerbated, credit analysts
said.
    The governor has also proposed constitutional amendments to require:
the Legislature to enact a balanced budget; the governor to propose the
executive budget by Dec. 1; and the enactment of an austerity budget when
the budget is passed late, rather than the use of emergency appropriations.
    "While these initiatives are very long-term in nature ... if carried
through, (they) could position New York to have a credit rating more in
line with other states in the country," the rating agency said.
    But the state must do a few other things to garner an above-A rating,
Marino said, suggesting an elimination - or significant drawdown - of the
state's $4 billion accumulated deficit, and years of on-time budget
enactments.
    "An above-A level wouldn't happen before the end of the century,"
Marino said. "We're looking for long-term actions."
    But some market observers argue that the Pataki administration's
willingness to fight for spending reductions and tax cuts deserves
significant recognition from the rating agencies.
    "It's ridiculous. We're below West Virginia and Louisiana," said one
analyst. "Come on."

AS FEDERAL AID GAP SQUEEZES N.J., STATE SELLS TRANS EARLY

By David Kaplan

     The impasse over fiscal 1996 federal appropriations bills has forced
New Jersey to accelerate short-term debt issuance as delays in federal
payments for Medicaid and other programs cause cash-flow problems.
    While a number of states have the resources to make up for the overdue
aid from Washington, a prolonged stalemate between Congress and the
president could put other states in the same fix as New Jersey, said Hyman
C. Grossman, a managing director for Standard & Poor's Corp.
    With no agreements on appropriations for federal departments governing
Medicaid, Medicare, welfare, or job training - the most significant
programs sending money to the states - many states have been spending their
own funds on those programs since the federal fiscal year began Oct. 1.
    Yesterday, New Jersey completed the second - and final, according to
state Treasury officials - installment of a $505 million short-term cash-
flow borrowing authorization by issuing a $250 million commercial paper tax
and revenue anticipation note.
    The issue was rated A1-plus by Standard & Poor's and Prime-1 by Moody's
Investors Service. A line of credit from Union Bank of Switzerland ensured
adequate liquidity for the commercial paper program, and helped secure the
high ratings, rating agency analysts said.
    On Dec. 5, New Jersey issued $200 million in commercial paper Trans as
a result of the cash-flow pressure caused by delay in aid from Washington,
state officials said.
    A spokeswoman for the state treasurer said that while the state is
permitted to borrow $505 million, the $450 million in commercial paper
Trans should cover for the absence of federal assistance.
    Of the programs that receive federal aid, New Jersey's Human Services
Department faces the greatest potential for disruption, Grossman noted.
Most of the proceeds from the commercial paper will go to human services.
    "Different states are handling effects of the budget impasse in
different ways," Grossman said. "Most states are handling the cash-flow
problems internally. They can move money around - apparently with less
difficulty than New Jersey. But some states have legal restrictions on the
ability to borrow internally."
    Florida is one state that has been able to successfully transfer money
within its borders to cover the delayed federal aid, Grossman said.
    "In effect, what Florida has done is advance money to service providers
that ordinarily would have been paid from federal money," Grossman said.
"When and if the federal budget gets straightened out, federal money will
flow down to Tallahassee and then the state will reimburse from whence they
borrowed."
    New Jersey doesn't have constraints that prevent borrowing internally,
Grossman said. But state officials probably concluded that it was less
costly to issue debt than to shift money around internally, he said.
    "When you borrow internally, you have to pay a taxable rate," Grossman
said. "It's cheaper to go out and issue tax-exempt commercial paper."
    The commercial paper Trans should cover the state's liquidity for at
least six weeks, said David Alter, an assistant vice president with
Moody's.
    "It should be said that the state has adequate reserves to maintain the
difference from that shortfall," Alter added. "The month-ending balance for
January is sufficient even without the cash-flow borrowing. It's to
preserve proper liquidity, because at some point in January, the state
would normally experience a low point anyway. This borrowing is a little
more than usual, but they expected to do it anyway."
    At this point in time, both Grossman and Alter said that no other
states have accelerated their issuance as a result of the federal
government shutdown. But they do expect other states to follow suit if the
impasse lasts through January.
    On Dec. 22, Congress passed a continuing spending resolution that will
expire midnight Jan. 3. The programs operating under that resolution are
Aid to Families With Dependent Children, veterans benefits, and the budget
for the District of Colombia.
    "Of course, this is America and this thing will get resolved at some
point and by the time February rolls around, cash-flow estimates show a
large bump up in revenues," Alter said. "So while the situation is
difficult for New Jersey, it is by no means desperate."

GOLDMAN BACK AT TOP OF THE HEAP; ISSUANCE HEALTHIER THAN EXPECTED

By Yong Lim

    Goldman, Sachs & Co. won the top municipal underwriting spot in 1995,
knocking Merrill Lynch & Co. out of the number one senior manager position,
according to figures compiled from Securities Data Co.'s database.
    Merrill, top lead manager in 1993 and 1994, dropped to second position
for that category but took the top honor among co-managers.
    The figures also show long-term bond sales totaled $156.22 billion in
1995, helped by a strong close to the year. The figure was higher than most
market observers had expected but still 5% below the $164.5 billion sold in
1994, according to Securities Data.
    In December, state and local governments sold 818 issues totaling
$16.76 billion, up a strong 65% from the $10.16 billion marketed in
December 1994, Securities Data said. Private placements are included in all
volume figures but not the underwriting rankings. (See article on page 3.)
    Last year Goldman Sachs lead managed 307 issues, totaling $19.83
billion. That accounted for 12.8% of the $154.94 billion of long-term bonds
sold through negotiated and competitive underwriting during the period.
    Merrill Lynch lead managed $17 billion in 1995, followed by Smith
Barney Inc. with $12.98 billion, PaineWebber Inc. with $12.71 billion, and
Lehman Brothers with $9.83 billion.
    Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch have been in a dogfight for the top of
the municipal underwriting rankings since 1987. Merrill, which last won the
crown in 1994, has won five out of the last nine years. But Goldman easily
prevailed in 1995, not only taking first place for the year as a whole but
also grabbing each quarter's top honors.
    In co-manager rankings, where each manager in an issue is given credit
for the full par value of the sale, Merrill Lynch led in long-term bond
sales, with 779 issues totaling $45.9 billion, followed closely by Smith
Barney with $44.88 billion.
    After them came Goldman Sachs with $44.57 billion, PaineWebber with
$41.63 billion, and Lehman Brothers with $35.61 billion. Merrill last won
the co-manager rankings in 1989. PaineWebber has dominated from 1990 to
1994 as top co-manager in municipal underwriting.
    By a large margin, New York City was the leading issuer of long-term
bonds in 1995, with 14 issues totaling $5.42 billion. It was the biggest
seller of debt from 1991 to 1993, but was eclipsed by the state of
California 1994.
    The New York State Dormitory Authority was second in 1995 with $1.79
billion of long-term bonds sold, followed by the New Jersey Transportation
Trust Fund Authority with $1.59 billion.
    Connecticut followed with $1.56 billion, and the Foothill/Eastern
Transportation Corridor, Calif., with $1.51 billion.
    California fell from first in 1994 to ninth place with $1.25 billion.
    Except for the second quarter, where Foothill/Eastern was the top
issuer, New York City led every quarter in 1995.
    Securities Data's long-term bond rankings are based on issues with
final maturities of 13 months or longer, while short-term rankings are
based on issues maturing in under 13 months. Municipal forward sales are
included, but private placements, remarketings, and taxable debt issued
directly by private nonprofit organizations are excluded. The rankings are
subject to revision.

SAYING GOODBYE TO 1995, PLAYERS HOPE FOR QUICK PRIMARY PICKUP

By Michael Stanton

    After a week of solid gains despite light post-holiday volume,
municipal market players say they are looking forward to a rise in activity
this week to validate prices' climb.
    Last week's almost dormant primary market is expected to be replaced by
a more active new-issue sector starting tomorrow, but although the calendar
is heavier, several underwriters noted that many of the deals planned for
this week are refundings whose ultimate timing will rely on the market's
performance.
    Leading that list is an insured $155 million electric system revenue
refunding issue for Sikeston, Mo., that is scheduled to be priced in the
negotiated sector by lead manager A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc.
    An underwriter at the firm said the deal - originally planned for late
December before the market deteriorated under the weight of a supply surge
- has returned to the calendar for next week, but could be delayed again.
    "We put it on the calendar, but the market's going to have to tell us
when it's going to be priced," the underwriter said.
    Other significant deals on the negotiated calendar for this week
include an $89.3 million general obligation public improvement refunding
bond issue for Richmond that is set to be priced by Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    Meanwhile, Smith Barney Inc., as senior manager, plans to price a $66.4
million sales tax revenue refunding issue for the Riverside County, Calif.,
Transportation Commission. The deal is set to be insured by Financial
Guaranty Insurance Co.
    In other negotiated action, Goldman Sachs will return to the market as
senior manager for a $65 million hospital revenue refunding issue for
Integris Health Systems in Oklahoma. The deal is set to be sold with
insurance from AMBAC Indemnity Corp.
    The competitive sector, meanwhile, will gear up for a $127 million
refunding from Clark County, Nev., on Thursday, while a long-awaited $183.9
million Florida Board of Education refunding remains on 24-hour notice.
    In Thursday's secondary market activity, traders said municipal prices
were unchanged to up #1/4 of a point in light trading, with what demand
there was coming from other dealers, while major buy-side participants
moved into a "holiday mode" ahead of Friday's early close and the long
weekend for New Year's Day.
    Although traders uniformly cautioned that the week's gains were based
on very thin trading activity, most said the slow primary market supply and
light forward calendar, lent the market a firm tone going into the new
year.
    "The primary's not going to be dead like it was this week, but it's
still going to be relatively quiet, so from the supply side of things, I
think we still have a good tone," another trader said.
    The Bond Buyer's 30-day visible supply of new issues expected to come
to market within the next month totaled $2.29 billion Thursday, up $141.4
million from Wednesday. That comprised $1.06 billion of competitive issues,
up $141.4 million, and $1.23 billion of negotiated issues, which was
unchanged.
    Standard & Poor's Blue List of dealer inventories fell $119.9 million,
to $1.44 billion.
    With the impasse over the federal budget causing a suspension in data
releases from the Commerce Department and Bureau of Labor Statistics,
fixed-income players were forced to turn to several privately compiled
sources for insight into the economy's health.
    Although data on the number of initial unemployment claims for the week
of Dec. 18 was delayed, the Conference Board reported that its index of
help-wanted advertising volume fell four points to 127 in November, which
is considered to reflect a drop in the supply of jobs and a slowing
economy.
    The signs of economic weakness helped government market traders sustain
their week-long rally, pushing the 30-year Treasury bond through the 6%
psychological barrier, where it stayed for the remainder of the session.
Late Thursday, the long bond was quoted up #12/32, to yield 5.98%.
    But both the Treasury and municipal markets' attention remained focused
on Washington, with players voicing hopes that the stress of the government
shutdown, along with the rapidly approaching presidential primary season,
would lead to a quick agreement between White House and congressional
leaders to balance the budget.
    The debt futures markets moved up in line with the cash markets'
bearish tone, although the municipal futures contract continued to
underperform the Treasury contract. The March municipal contract closed up
#9/32 Thursday, to 120#23/32.
    But the MOB spread widened again, and was calculated at negative 13
Thursday, compared with negative nine Wednesday.

MUNI BRIEFS

First-time buyers of municipal bonds are quick to pick up on the
apparent contradiction of double-A-rated bonds yielding less than
supposedly more secure triple-A insured bonds, according to Robert W.
Chamberlin, senior vice president and chief municipal analyst for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc.
     While Chamberlin and other analysts agreed there is no simple
explanation, they all said supply and demand is a major factor behind the
difference, typically four to eight basis points.
     "In pure economic terms, a lot of anything tends to cheapen the
price -- even with something that (in theory) should be high-priced,''
Chamberlin explained. "That clearly is what is happening with triple-A
rated bonds.''
According to the Public Securities Association, almost 45% of
new municipal issues came to market with insurance in 1995.-- Jon Birger

Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., is working on separate legislative
proposals that would dramatically change municipal market disclosure and
make it harder for municipalities to file for bankruptcy.
     The legislation, which is still being drafted but could be
introduced during the next few weeks or months, stems from a hearing on
Orange County that was held last July by the House Banking Committee's
capital markets subcommittee that Baker chairs, an aide and other sources
said this week.
     Baker had said after those hearings that he planned to introduce
legislation to improve municipal disclosure and to make it more difficult
for local governments to file for bankruptcy.
     It is not yet clear what support Baker would have for the
legislation from congressional committees that have jurisdiction over these
issues or from municipal market groups.
     But the Public Securities Association and Government Finance
Officers Association plan to consider the draft disclosure bill at meetings
later this month, officials with those groups said. --  Lynn Stevens Hume

Environmental and transportation bills important to
infrastructure finance are expected to see a lot of congressional activity
this year -- but not necessarily passage.
     Lobbyists and analysts give flow control and drinking water
bills better chances for final action than reauthorization of the Clean
Water Act. On transportation, the House is expected to take more initiative
than the Senate in laying the groundwork for next year's debate on
reauthorizing a major 1991 highway law.
     Analysts Debra Coy and Gregg Orrill of Washington Analysis,
which is part of the investment banking arm of the HSBC Group, said in a
recent report that drinking water and flow control bills, along with
Superfund legislation, "continue to be our best bets for completed
environmental legislation by mid-1996.''-- Martha M. Canan

Potential changes in federal funding will move to the front
burner as the number one item affecting state credit ratings in 1996,
according to a report from Moody's Investors Service released earlier this
year.
     Health care and welfare are the areas in which state credit
quality is most vulnerable, the rating agency said, emphasizing the
widespread reliance of states on federal support -- and voter pressure for
lower taxes.
     But Moody's said ratings changes this year do not have to be all
one-way.-- Peter List

The National Association of Bond Lawyers is calling on federal
regulators to withdraw the long-pending private-activity bond rules, offer
a new set of proposed regulations for comment, and move quickly to make
them final.
     Although a number of issuer groups have suggested re-proposing
the private-activity bond rules, this is the first time the bond lawyers
association has called for a newly proposed set of regulations since the
rules were first published in December 1994.
For a number of reasons, "including the significance of this
regulatory project and its widespread impact on state and local
governments, we believe that re-proposing the proposed regulations with
modifications and amendments would be the most prudent way to proceed with
this project,'' NABL said in a letter released earlier this month.-- Joan
Pryde

Rep. Christopher Cox is working with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to draft legislation that would simplify municipal disclosure
and make it more like corporate disclosure without repealing the Tower
Amendment to the securities laws.
     The draft legislation may also propose setting federal
requirements for municipal financial reporting, accounting, and auditing.
     "The idea would be to avoid any conflict with Tower and to avoid
the imposition of any new costs'' or burdens on issuers and other market
participants, Cox, a Republican from Orange County, said in an interview
Jan. 5.
     Cox said he hopes to have a draft bill ready within 30 days to
discuss with state and local groups, the Public Securities Association, and
other municipal market participants.
     "I intend to work closely with the commission and with
interested market participants for an extended period before introducing
the legislation,'' he said.-- Lynn Stevens Hume

LOS ANGELES PLANS TO SELL ONTARIO AIRPORT BONDS IN APRIL

The City of Los Angeles Department of Airports will sell
between $90 million and $150 million in revenue bonds this spring to pay
for a new terminal complex at Ontario International Airport in Southern
California's Inland Empire.
     The financing team is already in place. The financial
advisers are Lazard Freres & Co., Charles A. Bell Securities Corp., and
Marilyn L. Garcia. The agency was working with Lazard Freres' Los Angeles
office before it closed. The firm's relationship with the city continues
from its New York office. O'Melveny & Myers in Los Angeles is bond counsel.
     The Ontario bond issue, tentatively scheduled for April,
will be for about $90 million if the department builds only two terminals
in the new complex and leaves space for a third structure to be built
later.
     But the city also sought construction bids for building all
three terminal buildings to see if it could get an attractive price, given
the current weakness in the state's construction industry. Construction
bids are due Jan. 26.
     If all three buildings are constructed at this time, the
project's cost will be $343 million, with bonds financing $150 million of
the project, said Kathy Van Ness, deputy management analyst for the
department.
     "We've been having some protracted discussions on the
structure of the bond issue," Van Ness said. The agency is discussing how
to finance the project using airport revenues, passenger facility fees and
federal grants.
     Last year, the department refinanced revenue bonds tied to
Los Angeles International Airport so it could remove covenants that
prohibited the use of airport revenues for non-airport uses and restricted
the transfer of airport revenues to the city's general fund. In addition to
LAX and Ontario, the department also runs the city's Burbank Airport and
Palmdale Airport.
     In last summer's bond sale, the department included
insurance at the bidder's option that was provided by FGIC. It's uncertain
whether the agency will offer enhancement on the Ontario issue, Van Ness
said.
     Ontario handles 6 million passengers a year in its fast-
growing service area that includes five million residents and covers San
Bernardino and Riverside counties, and portions of northern Orange County
and eastern Los Angeles County. By comparison, 50 million passengers travel
through LAX annually.
     Ontario airport's lower profile among investors will be a
challenge for the agency. Van Ness said she is considering offering an
optional tour of the airport and region to the ratings agencies.
     Passenger traffic at the airport, located about 35 miles
east of Los Angeles, has increased steadily for the past decade.
     In 1975, 1.29 million people used the airport. In 1993, 6.2
million travelers used the airport and 353,000 tons of air freight were
shipped from the facility. The new terminal complex will provide capacity
for 12 million passengers.

MWD HOPES A BOND RALLY WILL PERMIT REFINANCING

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California
spent much of last week watching interest rates, waiting for the
opportunity to sell a $200 million refunding issue.
     "We need to get down to record low interest rates to do
this deal," said Bert Becker, chief financial officer for the MWD. As
California Public Finance was going to press Jan. 10, Becker said interest
rates were about "20 basis points away from our target."
     "There's still some optimism from several economists and
brokerage firms that there's still some hope for a rally," he said from his
Los Angeles office.
     Becker, who described the market-sensitive bond sale as a
"day-to-day, week-to-week" situation, said he's hopeful the deal will be
completed this month.
     Smith Barney Inc. is the underwriter. O'Melveny & Myers and
Robinson & Pearman are co-bond counsel. Hawkins, Delafield & Wood is
disclosure counsel and Fulbright & Jaworski is underwriter counsel. O'Brien
Partners Inc. is serving as financial adviser.
     Bond proceeds will be used for both advanced and current
refundings.
     The refunding will include a 1991 offering that helped pay for
work on the district's Eastside reservoir project and Jensen treatment
plant.
     The district is paying an average interest rate of 5.6% on
its outstanding debt of $2.1 billion.

POLLUTION AUTHORITY SELLS $11.2 MILLION ISSUE FOR RECYCLING

The California Pollution Control Financing Authority sold
$11.2 million in revenue bonds to build recycling facilities in Contra
Costa County.
     Bond proceeds from the Dec. 7 sale will allow Contra Costa
Waste Service Inc. to convert an existing building into a materials
recovery and transfer facility and build a processing facility in
Pittsburg. The project, which will process 1,500 tons of solid waster per
day, is expected to create 17 jobs.

BANKAMERICA OPENS ATLANTA OFFICE

BA Securities Inc. opened a public finance office in
Atlanta Jan. 2 to work on muncipal securities and corporate-related
transactions in the tax-exempt market. The new office is the third public
finance unit that BankAmerica has opened in the last two years outside of
California. In October 1993, the company opened an office in Dallas, and
another in Chicago in May 1995.
     The office is headed by J. David Hospodar, an Atlanta
resident who has worked for Goldman, Sachs & Co. and CS First Boston. The
bank is likely to gradually add staff in Atlanta.
     "We're looking for additional people -- and it's a buyer's
market right now -- so I'm taking my time," said Anthony J. Taddey, senior
managing director.
     The firm also has public finance offices in San Francisco,
Los Angeles, and in Seattle through the banking company's Seafirst
subsidiary.

MERRILL LYNCH MOST ACTIVE UNDERWRITER IN 1995

After a tumultuous year in public finance in which several
firms left the business and the aftershocks of Orange County's bankruptcy
were felt nationally, many look forward to a brighter year ahead.
     Merrill Lynch & Co. topped the list of lead underwriters in
California for full-year 1995 despite its ties to Orange County. Merrill
Lynch worked on 40 bond issues in California totaling $3.3 billion, giving
the firm a 16.5% share of the market. Issuers the firm worked with last
year included the State of California, the San Diego County Regional
Transportation Commission, San Bernardino County, Los Angeles County, and
the City of Long Beach.
     "We hope to see more issuance at the state level" this
year, said H. Cody Press III, managing director and manager at Merrill
Lynch in Los Angeles.
     Other players also see increased activity this year.
     "I see volume about 10% higher than last year nationally,
and maybe a little higher in California because our recovery is underway,"
said Anthony J. Taddey, senior managing director at BA Securities Inc. He
also anticipates a very strong note season in California this summer.
     Michael P. George, managing director at J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. in San Francisco,  said he expects "clients will continue
to be very judicious about bond issuance."
     "There will be more strategic financing and less clean,
plain-vanilla financings," he said, adding that issuers will be under even
greater pressure to do more with fewer dollars.
     Merrill Lynch was followed by Goldman, Sachs & Co. as the
most active underwriter in California last year. Goldman worked on 27 deals
totaling $2.3 billion for an 11.4% market share.
     PaineWebber Inc. followed with a 10.6% share of the market.
The firm worked on 43 issues totaling $2.1 billion in principal amount.
     Smith Barney Inc. was the fourth most active underwriter,
handling 44 issues totaling $1.8 billion in principal amount. Smith Barney
held 8.9% of the California market.
     Rounding out the top five was Morgan Stanley & Co., which
handled 10 issues totaling $1.6 billion. The firm captured 8.1% of the
market. Morgan Stanley's 1995 major clients included the City of San Diego
and the San Jose/Santa Clara Clean Water Financing Authority.
     Among bond counsel, Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe in San
Francisco captured the top spot in both California and nationally.
     "While Orrick has been ranked number one for seven of the
last eight years, holding that position for 1995 is particularly gratifying
in light of the nearly 50% reduction in dollar amount of debt issued by the
State of California," said Roger Davis, chairman of Orrick's public finance
department. Davis also anticipates the state will be a more active issuer
this year.
     Orrick served on 215 issues with a principal amount of $8.3
billion, giving the firm a 41.4% market share. Following Orrick was Jones
Hall Hill & White; Stradling, Yocca, Carlson & Rauth; Pamela S. Jue P.C.;
and O'Melveny & Myers.
     The most active financial adviser last year was Public
Financial Management Inc., which worked on 30 issues in California with a
principal amount of $2.9 billion, giving the firm almost 15% of the
California market. Following Public Financial were Public Resources
Advisory Group, O'Brien Partners Inc., Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance,
and Kelling , Northcross & Nobriga Inc.

SNOWFALL IN EAST BOOSTS BAROMETER

In an unusual week in which the Blizzard of '96 hindered market
activity, the California Debt Barometer's yield jumped seven basis points
to 5.74%.
     Among the larger deals underway in California last week was the
tentative sale of $200 million in revenue bonds from the Metropolitan Water
District of Southern California. The district was waiting for lower
interest rates to complete the transaction, which is being handled by Smith
Barney Inc. (See story on Page 1.)
     An $85 million revenue bond issue from the California Health
Facilities Finance Authority, originally planned for last week, was
rescheduled for this week. PaineWebber Inc. is handling the transaction.
     Elsewhere in the market, bond fund managers remained generally
bullish and continued to favor discount and noncallable bonds, Cadmus Hicks
wrote in his weekly market report for John Nuveen & Co.
     As the barometer data were gathered, the Bond Buyer's 30-day
visible supply of new issues expected to come to market within the next
month stood at $4.74 billion.

MENLO PARK ISSUE ENJOYED RIGHT TIMING

The importance of timing a bond sale was apparent in this
month's sale of Menlo Park Community Development Authority's $32.3 million
tax allocation refunding bonds.
     The deal was among the first out of the gate this year,
coming to market on the morning of Jan. 2.
     "We priced it first thing Tuesday morning, right after the
holiday," said Richard G. Kiss, a managing director at Piper Jaffray Inc.
in San Francisco.
     Trading got off to a quiet start that day, but by midday
activity picked up.
     "We did exactly the right thing because I don't think we
could have achieved those levels" later in the week, Kiss said, adding that
the final decision to price Tuesday morning was made at a 6:30 a.m.
conference call that day.
     Cadmus Hicks at John Nuveen & Co. in Irvine also noted that
"the deals priced earlier in the week did extremely well."
     Menlo Park wanted to achieve $1 million in present-value
savings through the refinancing of bonds originally issued in 1988 and
1992. The Silicon Valley community achieved that objective by realizing
$1.04 million in present-value savings, Kiss said.
     Menlo Park originally planned to sell the bonds in the
second week of December, but the market moved away. Wishing to avoid
pricing the bonds during the slow holiday period of late December, the city
decided to wait until this month to sell the bonds.
     The original bond proceeds paid for improvements in housing
projects, a senior citizen center, and other capital improvements in the
redevelopment area in the city's Belle Haven neighborhood, said Uma
Chokkalingam, Menlo Park's finance director.

SF SHOPS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown announced in his inaugural
address Jan. 8 that he is considering financing $150 million in affordable
housing.
      Details were sketchy on how the bond financing would be
structured. In his speech, Brown suggested that some of the money would be
raised through a tax-increment bond issue.
      Word has it that San Francisco's new mayor is considering a
$100 million general obligation bond issue and a $50 million tax-increment
issue, tied to the city's Golden Gateway Project Area.
      Brown also noted in his inaugural address that the city
must invest in its infrastructure, with or without state and federal
dollars.
      Brown's reference to infrastructure is another sign that
public finance issues will get more attention from the general public this
year as San Francisco and other California cities try to meet public
service demands with increasingly scarce dollars and debt capacity.

LAWMAKERS KICK OFF NEW YEAR WITH BIG BOND MEASURES

The California Assembly elected a new speaker and agreed to
place a $3 billion school bond measure on the March ballot when it
reconvened Jan. 3.
     The Assembly elected Curt Pringle, R-Garden Grove, to be
the body's fourth speaker in the last 12 months after ousting Brian
Setencich, R-Fresno, who held the position with primarily Democratic
support.
     The school bond measure received a vote of 68-to-6 in favor
of placing it on the March ballot. The proposal died in the final hours of
the 1995 session when Republican lawmakers linked their support of school
bonds to Democratic support for prison bonds.
     The $3 billion bond measure for the March ballot would
provide more than $2 billion for school rehabilitation and construction and
$900 million for improvements to state college and university campuses.
     The outcome of the election is somewhat uncertain,
especially given voters' current mood to limit government spending and to
keep tax dollars at the local level, instead of sending them to Sacramento
and Washington.
     At the forefront of the effort to persuade voters to
approve the school bond measure will be the California State PTA.
     "There are a lot of people who are concerned about
government debt, and it's not a concern to be taken lightly," Betty DeFea,
director of legislation for the PTA, acknowledged. "It's like personal and
corporate debt, however. You have to realize what it is you're going into
debt for and then assess whether it's worth the financial risk."
     "Schools and children are worth that up-front investment,"
she said. "It's wise not to put ourselves in bonded indebtedness for
everything we want, but some things we need."
     Education was also a priority reflected in Gov. Pete
Wilson's proposed $61.5 billion budget, which was announced Jan. 10. Wilson
proposed spending more money on schools, canceling fee increases at
colleges and universities, and providing a tax cut for almost every
California resident.
     The governor is asking Californians to approve $7.8 billion
in bond measures to help pay for new schools, prisons, juvenile jails and
the replacement or seismic retrofitting of state roads and bridges.
     State Treasurer Matt Fong and Finance Director Russ Gould
will be going to New York later this month to discuss the state's financial
plans, among other matters.
     "While infrastructure needs require $7.8 billion in
additional debt, those bonds will be issued by my office in a prudent
manner, balancing the necessities with our ability to pay for them," Fong
said.
     "Californians may be in a better position to take on more
bonded debt because our economic outlook remains positive," he said. "For
the fifth year in a row, revenues exceed general fund expenditures,
demonstrating that government spends within its means."
     "The investment community does recognize our state's
improving performance. Often our bonds trade at the double A rate, rather
than at the single A rating," the treasurer said.

TECHNOLOGY PROLIFERATION OF 1980s TO SHAPE CARD
MARKET IN 1990s

     With the credit card industry now in what has been termed
"the third decade of card growth," a new agenda of challenges
awaits it.  The coming of the 1990s reinforces the rapid pace at
which change occurred over the past 10 years and how competitive
the current marketplace has become.
     The advances made in electronic processing capabilities in
the 1980s have set the stage for what are expected to be even
more innovative and flexible payment systems ahead.  "As we build
those, there will be the ability to offer a variety of payment
mechanisms--whether they be proprietary credit or proprietary
debit or just various other forms of credit programs," Larry
Myatt, vice president of marketing and product development at
Sears Payment Systems Inc., told CARD NEWS.
     Despite an electronic environment better able to affect
change, by way of providing more options to retailers and
consumers in a shorter period of time, there is still the need to
fine-tune and clarify card product strategies.
     The proliferation of products in the 1980s was designed to
fit various  customer segments, card enhancements, warranty
programs, airline discounts and frequent flier programs.
     But some of what happened has resulted in major internal
divisions.
     "We see every element of the business polarized," Alex Hart,
president of MasterCard International, said about bank cards.
     The industry is divided between issuers and acquirers, a
split seen as possibly eroding future cooperative efforts,
according to an examination of card polarization and consol-
idation, prepared by Edgar, Dunn & Conover Inc., the San
Francisco-based management consulting firm.
     An increasing portion of the industry is concentrated among
fewer participants in both the issuing and acquiring segments.
Consolidation on the acquiring side has resulted in
the entry of third-party processors with little or no interest in
the issuing side of the business.  Moreover, the proposition that
banking can retain control of the retail payment system in the
upcoming years is very much open to debate.  The largest bank
card processor today by a substantial margin is not a bank but
First Data Resources, a subsidiary--most troubling of all to bank
card issuers--of American Express.

      The top 10 issuers of bank cards in the late 1990s probably
will not be banks, noted David Poe, a principal with Edgar, Dunn
& Conover.  Of the top 10 acquirers at present, 4 of the
processors on the acquiring side of the merchant business account
for some 45% of the volume in dollars, he said.
     In addition, processors have developed innovations aimed at
certain market  segments, such as electronic draft capture (EDC)
and low-cost authorization.
     Non-bank competitors such as American Express and Sears,
Roebuck & Co. are gaining control of more point-of-sale (POS)
terminals, as several banks have given up the merchant side of
the business.
     The card system is opening up to yet more competition.
Namely, Ford Motor Co., General Electric (GE) Credit, Household
Bank of Chicago, General Motors, and--potentially posing the
greatest threat of all--American Telephone & Telegraph Co.
(AT&T).
     The acquiring business is consolidating because of the
inability of many banks to remain competitive in the merchant
marketplace.  "Rather than sell their portfolios to their banking
competitors, most banks have chosen to sell to non-banks," stated
Charles Russell, CEO of Visa U.S.A.
     One recent exception to that trend was the acquisition by
Citicorp--one of the largest card processors--of the merchant
card business of FCC National Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of
First Chicago Corp.  But many industry analysts think the
merchant business will remain within banking only in rare
instances such as this.
     Sears Payment Systems recently announced it will process the
$60 million private-label card portfolio of Lochmere Inc., a
retailer In Woburn, Mass.

  Invading others' turfs

     Deregulation in the 1980s provided the card industry
tremendous freedom with regard to pricing flexibility.  The
decade saw the emergence of annual and  other fees, competitive
pricing, and much pressure on interest rates and annual fees from
new entrants into the marketplace.
     During the period, there were also the first signs of
saturation, slow growth, and lower response rates to mailings.
The merger and acquisition mania also began with Chemical Bank's
acquisition of Continental's card portfolio.   Bank cards began
trying to increase their share of the lucrative travel and
entertainment (T&E) market long dominated by American Express,
which made its own entree into the large, mainstream retail
markets.
     Another development of the 1980s, the issuing of securities
backed by credit card receivables, now accounts for billions of
dollars of securitized assets in this country.
     Citicorp, which has securitized close to $8 billion in card
receivables,  now is offering $750 million in bonds in its
largest overseas issue to date backed by receivables generated in
the United States.  Sears also is considering the distribution
outside the country of its own card outstandings.   In the
present market, the name of the game is differentiation.  "Our
prime directive is to tailor products and services to meet the
specific consumer's needs," Russell said.
     Segmentation became a buzzword in the 1980s as it pertained
to gold, affinity, business and student cards.  There was a new
focus on customer service by the card industry and a growth in
national solicitations, spelling the end of only regional and
statewide marketing.
     Bank cards now face increasing competition from all sides.
In already trying to accommodate the demands of individual market
segments, bank cards are accepted for payment in supermarkets,
fast-food restaurants, movie theaters, parking lots, toll booths,
and the health-care industry.  Part of the emphasis here is on
speed in the card authorization and purchase process.
     When Sears introduced its Discover card in early 1986, the
growth of consumer credit was at its peak, noted Carl Steidtmann,
vice president for senior management and chief economist at
Management Horizons, a division of Price Waterhouse.
     In the realm of differentiated offerings, Discover is
selling a cashback feature that no other bank or non-bank card
has.

  Potential new products

     But we may be entering a period when a similar opportunity
exists for the introduction of new products.  The reason is that
the burst of activity in the early 1990s probably will be the
last peak of credit growth in the 1990s, Steidtmann pointed out.
     Others contend that new product introduction remains
increasingly diffi-cult.  "We're not in the same cooperative
relationship that we all used to be in when everything was done
within the banking community," said Poe.
     In this decade, many observers say, it will be necessary to
better understand the data reflecting what is taking place within
the customer base that bank cards now have.  Financial
institutions will need information even more to manage the risk
of credit cards, noted Donald Auriemma, president of Auriemma
Consulting Group in Garden City, N.Y.
     The 1990s will see, for the first time in a decade and a
half, a rising savings rate, Steidtmann said.  This will happen
primarily for reasons related to demographics.
     The savers currently are people between ages 45 and 60.  The
savings rate did not decline due to tax law changes, individual
retirement accounts (IRAs), or even societal greed, Steidtmann
said.  The real reason was demographics because in the 1980s the
number of people in the key savings sector went down.  In the
previous decade, the growth of installment credit was
unprecedented, driven largely by the demographics of the time and
a fairly stable economic environment.  While the economy at
present is robust, the 1990s has been projected as an era in
which unemployment and the demand for credit will fall.
     With low unemployment, people from a lower socioeconomic
level will enter the mainstream of the economy, resulting in an
increased penetration of cards.  Aside from more savings, there
will be more looking for ways to reduce one's own credit
exposure, Steidtmann said.  "What previously had gone into debt
payment and into the creation of debt will now go into savings,"
he added.      Demographics, to the extent they indicate a
turning against the credit culture, pose an unpromising picture
for credit in the 1990s.  The growth of
income also will have an effect on credit in the new decade.
There will be average rates of growth in income but a significant
change in the distribution of income.
     The demand for credit will decline, not relatively but in
absolute terms.  Households will not have the same demand for
credit as has been the case.
     The issue of market share will become critical to third-
party, bank, and proprietary cards.  The 1990s should see a
reduced demand for proprietary cards with the trend toward
reducing credit.

Squeeze on small issuers

     Market share will be the essential component in any AT&T
credit card product that enters the market.  The share and card
base that AT&T could draw on, in terms of its calling card
population, represents a huge potential marketing advantage.  If
the telecommunications giant offers a cobranded Visa card, for
example, it will most likely be at the expense of the cards that
cardholders already have.
     In the 1980s, the growth of private-label credit cards was
not nearly as great as that of bank cards.  There has been a move
within the large sector of retailers to come back to private-
label cards because of the enhanced marketing  capabilities
provided to them, such as target promotions and more information
about the consumers who buy in their stores.
     "Our perspective is that private-label credit cards or
proprietary credit cards, merchants' own programs, probably will
not grow in terms of total numbers of accounts, as far as the
bank card market will grow in the next few years," observed Larry
Myatt of Sears Payment Systems.

  Third-party bank cards

     However, he thinks there is good growth prospect for those
third-party processors--like Sears Payment--in devising private
label programs for merchants, as retailers look at the costs
associated with operating their own programs.  Therefore, a shift
from in-house to third-party operated programs is expected.
     Those who maintain their own credit card system in-house now
will look to third-party processors for other ways of maintaining
that capability because of the costs of new systems and
equipment.  There is expected to be more movement  toward third-
party processors maintaining the retailer card base than any
changes in or out of the private label business.
     If strategic alliances can be formed between both credit
offerers and retailers, the opportunity may be created for third-
party offerings to develop  in the arena of bank card credit.
This is probably the one component of the industry that will
experience growth in the 1990s, due to its ability to offer many
of the benefits of a proprietary card at the cost of a bank card,
according to Steidtmann.
     Such alliances will have to be based on joint marketing, on
providing information through the channel of distribution, the
quality of service, the ability to bring customers to a retailer
who would not go there otherwise, and on a much less expensive
economic model.
     This outcome is not likely to come about unless the view of
credit and retail executives toward credit moves from competition
and confrontation to one of cooperation, Myatt added.
     In terms of other payment mechanisms, many observers see an
enormous untapped market for debit cards at the point of sale--in
the form of proprietary debit, automated clearing house (ACH)
debit or direct debit.
     ACH debit is expected to be a very active means of payment
in the 1990s, Myatt said.  Part of its implementation was delayed
over the controversy in-volving Entree, the national POS debit
mark that MasterCard and Visa had been jointly developing.
     An antitrust lawsuit filed last summer by the attorneys
general in New York and in 12 states has stalled that program
indefinitely, if not permanently.
     ACH debit has been touted as a national debit card operated
through a bank card-like mechanism, as Entree was proposed to be.
In addition, American Express or Discover could offer this
product with their own cards.
     The other ACH vehicle is private-label debit, in which the
retailer itself--California's Vons Supermarket is one example--is
the card issuer.  In the 1980s, the financial and retail sectors
were hesitant about whether banks would take the lead in debit
cards or if that drive would be spearheaded by individual
retailers.
     It makes sense from a consumer standpoint to be able to have
a debit card that can be used at a variety of retail
establishments, Myatt told us.
     "Frankly, we have a lot of concerns about ACH-driven
products unless they are bank controlled and bank driven," said
MasterCard's Hart.
     The origin of a proprietary debit environment is akin to
private-label credit cards in that the objective is the
generation of additional sales volume and added customer
convenience.   Proponents see private-label debit making sense in
supermarkets where a lot of checks are now written, and at
gasoline stations where there already exist examples of
proprietary debit cards.

  New decade's trends

     Some of the trends in the 1990s will no doubt be
continuations of existing  developments.  Insiders stress that
the card industry must know the true net costs when features are
added to cards or efforts are made to attract different customer
segments.  Additionally, the industry will require better product
and customer profitability information, and it is looking toward
the development of systems that allow making those kinds of
determinations.
     Further segmentation of card products needs to be in terms
of segregating  between convenience users and revolvers.
Questions to be addressed include  whether to increase spending
allowed on a credit limit, and permitting the use of a card on a
monthly basis as a charge card--with a line of credit still the
foundation for an account.
     The 1990s are certain to bring a substantial increase in
non-bank card competition.  JCB, Japan's largest bank-issued
credit card, is seeking to be-come a major world player and to
increase its merchant network outside Japan.
     The card already is moving to overtake Diners Club.  JCB can
offer the card electronically, can come in and negotiate with a
relatively few processors and reach a large percentage of retail
establishments.
     One new product likely to emerge in the future is a coin
replacement card, or possibly a pre-paid card, for handling small
transactions.
     From all indications, there is strong interest in the United
States in chip technology and, specifically, in the integrated
circuit chip capabilities of smart cards.  Unlike in Japan and
Europe, the cards have no proximity to their source in the United
States, and have been more difficult to implement. Smart cards
offer potentially many variables and, for that reason, U.S. banks
are less inclined to agree on the direction in which to proceed,
noted Kevin Wilby, vice president of the retail transaction
division at Business Modeling Techniques Inc. (BMT) in Rochester,
N.Y.  On top of that, the first demand in this country would be
for the institution of smart card standards--which poses a much
more difficult task than the magnetic stripe that reflects a
standard format, he said.
     Consolidation and internationalization in the industry is
expected to continue, with more pressure to process transactions
inexpensively.  Besides controlling operating expenses, many
officials see a need for behavioral scoring at the point of sale
to minimize the number of declines in the system.  The
enhancement of this intelligence at the point of sale will be a
factor in controlling credit losses.
     Aside from network and communications enhancements to
support this new level of intelligence in database management,
the focus will continue on making investments in systems and on
the maximizing of efficiencies.

NEW YORK STATE LAW BARS MERCHANTS FROM
REQUIRING ADDRESSES ON CARD SALES SLIPS

     A new law that took effect last week in New York state,
reportedly the first of its kind in the nation, prohibits
merchants from requiring customers to put their address or
telephone number on sales slips when making purchases by credit
card.
     This controversial practice--along with that of recording
credit card numbers on personal checks when a purchase is made by
check--has been sharply criticized by consumer advocates, who
have maintained that merchants are exposing customers to
potential fraud and are violating their personal privacy (CN,
Oct. 30, 1989, p. 1).
     The state law will "address the unauthorized dissemination
of personal information," said Daniel Feldman, a state
assemblyman who sponsored the bill.  He also introduced
legislation last year that mandated carbonless credit card forms
in New York.
     While both the Visa and MasterCard associations appeared
uneasy over con-sumers being made to write their card number, its
expiration date and a phone number on checks, they have focused
more attention on ending the requirement by  merchants that a
cardholder's phone number be written on a credit card sales draft
in order to complete a card transaction.
     The Bankcard Holders of America (BHA), a Herndon, Va.-based
consumer education group, has urged the 2 bankcard associations
and the National Retail Merchants Association (NRMA), among
others, to clarify and enforce policies to bar the current check-
cashing policies of merchants.
     Visa and MasterCard spokesmen have said the associations
have a limited ability to take action in response to these check
acceptance procedures.  The bank card industry has rules in place
to protect itself against liability for the use of a credit card
to pay for returned checks.
     A number of merchants in the state were convincing customers
that their address and phone number were necessary to make credit
card purchases, Feldman  said, when the information actually was
being used to compile mailing lists.    One exception to the law
is that merchants who do not have the capability to verify a
customer's card electronically may still ask for a customer's
address or phone number.  The penalty for violations of the law
is $250.

CHASE TO ACQUIRE CARD PORTFOLIOS WITH COMBINED
OUTSTANDINGS OF $660 MILLION

     The Chase Manhattan Bank (USA), the Delaware affiliate of
Chase Manhattan Bank, will acquire the credit card portfolio of
Bank of Boston Corp. and its affiliate, Bank of Boston
Connecticut.  In addition, Chase has acquired the majority of the
credit card portfolio of Investors Savings Bank of Richmond, Va.
     The combined outstandings of the MasterCard and Visa
portfolios represent  $660 million.  The Bank of Boston portfolio
has $625 million in outstandings, and the outstanding balances of
Investors portfolio are approximately $35 million.
     Last year, Chase also purchased the portfolios of Michigan
National Bank, Meritor Financial Group of Philadelphia, and
Leader Federal Savings Bank in Memphis, Tenn.
     Bank of Boston, in a move similar to the response of other
New England institutions to the region's slumping real estate
market, said it would write off about $300 million in loans for
the final quarter of 1989 and set aside about $280 million for
other possible losses.  But the company predicted it would break
even in the fourth quarter and earn a $145 million profit for
1989, due in part to its decision to sell its credit card
business, which has 675,000 cardholders.
     Bank officials said the card business, while profitable,
would drain financial resources that the bank would rather put
toward marketing other consumer products such as home equity,
residential mortgages and education loans.
     The Investors portfolio includes approximately 40,000
MasterCard and Visa accounts.  The institution also has entered
into an agent bank agreement with Chase under which it will
continue to offer credit cards bearing the Investors name and
logo to its customers throughout Virginia.  In the future, the
accounts of Investors' existing card customers will be serviced
by Chase with no disruption in service.

*New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and

*New Jersey Transit Corp., a commuter bus and
rail system, will allow commuters to use credit
cards to pay for tickets starting in the fall.  The
system already accepts Visa, MasterCard, and Dis-
cover cards at a number of agent sites and ticket
vending machines.  This project, which is being developed at
Nynex Information Solutions Group, will allow commuters at a
later point to have their accounts  debited for ticket purchases.
Nynex is linking all credit card ticketing operations, permitting
New Jersey Transit to cut costs by negotiating the lowest prices
from suppliers of credit authorization and settlement services.
New Jersey Transit is now discussing joint ticketing with the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the umbrella organization
for several New York-area mass transit operations.  The New York
City Transit Authority, the Metro North and the Long Island
Railroad commuter trains plan to offer ticket payment options
that would automatically debit bank accounts.

     *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia

     *Telephone calls made by credit card at the 2 Philadelphia
area airports will be among the options provided by MCI Mid-
Atlantic under a new major contract for public pay phone service.
     The 3-year, $10.5 million agreement, between the city of
Philadelphia and MCI Mid-Atlantic, will provide long-distance
service to pay phone customers at Philadelphia International and
Northeast Philadelphia Airports.  MCI will provide "0" plus
services to customers making collect, third-party, person-to-
person and credit card calls at any of the 550 pay phones at both
airports.  This development is part of the implementation of
equal access at public pay phones that was decreed by court order
for non-AT&T carriers.  The order, in a 1988 decision by U.S.
District Judge Harold Greene, covers calls made on cards as well
as other operator-assisted calls.  The national pay phone market
is estimated to be worth $2 billion a year.  "Pay phone premise
owners and managers--particularly high-volume users such as
municipalities, airports, hotels and such--can receive
substantial benefits through MCI now that the pay phone market is
a matter of choice," said George Taylor, president of MCI's Mid-
Atlantic Division which covers customers in Pennsylvania, New
Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and the
District of Columbia.

AIR TRAVEL CARD ADDING INTERNATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR WORLDWIDE
PHONE CALL CHARGES

     Air Travel Card and Executive TeleCard Ltd.
have announced an agreement to permit cardholders to  charge
international telephone calls on their Air Travel Card account.
This makes Air Travel Card and its licensee cards, "AirPlus" in
Europe and "Passage"  in the Far East, the first corporate travel
card to offer a worldwide telephone  charge system to its
members.
     Designed as a card product for executive travelers wanting
to make direct dial or operator-assisted international calls, Air
Travel Card enables members to have easy access to more than 60
countries where the system is in operation.  The services
provided by the Switzerland-based Executive TeleCard allow
telephone users to charge calls between countries outside the
United States.
     This umbrella agreement invites each of Air Travel Card's 30
issuing airlines to enter into separate contracts with Executive
TeleCard in the upcoming months.  A number of the issuing
airlines already have expressed an interest in this optional
service for their customers.
     "We are proud to offer this one-of-a-kind telephone charge
system and look forward to featuring it as one of Air Travel
Card's unique customer benefits,"  said Charles Fischer,
executive secretary for Air Travel Card.

  Card eliminates phoning obstacles

     The Executive TeleCard System, which can be accessed from
both private and public telephones worldwide, eliminates the many
problems often posed by language barriers, confusing instructions
and coin-operated pay phones, ex-plained Robert Roach, president
of Executive TeleCard.  It also avoids the surcharges that are
customarily applied by hotels.
     "The Air Travel Card customer is a perfect match to
Executive TeleCard's product line," Roach said.  "We are
enthusiastic about this agreement and look forward to providing
this added service to the more than 1.5 million users of
the Air Travel Card."
     Established in 1936 as a charge card--known then as
Universal Air Travel Card Plan--Air Travel Card is used by more
than 50% of the Fortune 500 companies.  It is sponsored by
members of the Air Transport Association of America and the
International Air Transport Association.
     The card is administered by the Air Travel Card Board of
Management currently composed of representatives from American
Airlines, Eastern Airlines,  Trans World Airlines, United
Airlines, British Airways, Lufthansa and Japan Airlines.  The
card is accepted by more than 200 affiliated airlines worldwide.
     The "AirPlus" card is issued by 9 European airlines, and
"Passage" is issued by Japan Airlines.  Both cards have other
usage beyond air travel.  (Air Travel Card, 1709 New York Ave.
NW, Washington, DC 20006, 202/626-4224.)

-RETAILERS MAY LEVY CREDIT CARD USERS

CARD SYSTEMS- RETAILERS MAY LEVY CREDIT CARD USERS
(C) 1994 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

Netherlands: Following a move by the Dutch  Ministry
of Economic Affairs, Dutch retailers now have the
option of levying a surcharge on credit card
purchases or offering a discount to customers using
cash or other rival forms of payment. The ministry
said that the lifting of the ban on discrimination by
retailers between forms of payment, would affect
American Express, Eurocard, VSB International, part
of Dutch-Belgian Fortis and Diners Club Benelux.
Dutch shopkeepers currently pay around a five percent
commission to credit card companies.

The idea is to is to stimulate customers to use
cheaper forms of payment such as cash transactions
and automatic transfers.

The Netherlands' small businesses' federation, KNOV,
and consumer association, Consumentenbond, anticipate
that retailers will be able to curtail use of credit
cards through publicity campaigns and by refusing
this form of payment.  The hope is that credit card
issuers will reduce rates since credit cards will now
have to compete more openly with other payment
methods.

There are around three million credit card users in
the Netherlands(10 percent of the population)
accounting for DFl 6bn in turnover and 30 million
transactions a year. Retailers pay around DFl 300m a
year in commissions.

It is interesting to note that similar moves which
were brought into force in the UK some years ago have
had little impact and few retailers seem to have
taken up the option of charging for card transactions
or offering discounts for cash.

(C) 1994 M2 COMMUNICATIONS LTD

China: The number of credit card holders in China
will jump this year to hit seven million, up from
four million at the end of 1993, forecasts China's
official Economic Information Daily. The number of
cardholders for Peony card issued by the Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China, doubled last year to
two million, which sent total transaction value
soaring 455 percent to 50 billion yuan ($5.7
billion). The bank expects the number of its card
holders to grow to 3.5 million this year, with
spending doubling to 100 billion yuan ($11.5
billion). Speaking to the China Daily, Chen Xiaoyan,
director of the bank's credit card department, said
the goal is to increase the number of its Peony
credit card holders from 2m to 3.5m. And the bank
expects holders to spend 100bn yuan ($11.49bn) with
the cards - twice last year's figure. The number of
stores accepting the card is to expand to 30,000,
5,000 more than last year. Peony card holders account
for half of the country's total credit card holders.
The other credit cards are issued by The People's
Construction Bank of China, The Bank of China and the
Agricultural Bank of China.  MasterCard and Visa have
also entered the Chinese market in co-operation with
Chinese banks.

USA: Visa International, Crestar Bank and US Order
have signed an agreement to pilot screen phone
technology for home banking, shopping, and
information services. The program began this month
and will run approximately one year.  About 400
Crestar customers from the greater Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area who hold a Crestar Premier
MoneyCard (a Visa check card) will participate.
Users will require a special telephone with a display
screen and magnetic stripe card reader. To use the
system, a card is first swiped through the reader and
the user enters a PIN to gain access to the system.
Consumers participating in the test will use leased
US Order ScanFones containing specialized bill
payment software.  The software supports bill
payment, reads the Crestar/Visa card information,
encrypts the PIN, and transmits the bill pay session
to US Order for processing.  VisaNet is used to
obtain PIN verification from Crestar Bank, as well as
to route the payment request to Crestar for
authorization on the payment date specified by the
consumer. Finally, US Order sends the consumer's
payment directly to the biller, using the US Order
BankPlus host bill processing system.

EBT'S NATIONAL QUEST:  Negotiations are under way to create the first

EBT'S NATIONAL QUEST:  Negotiations are under way to create the first
national electronic benefits transfer network.  The electronic benefits
council of the National Automated Clearing House Association is negotiating
with the board of directors of the Quest shared regional EFT network to use
the Quest logo as a national mark for EBT cards, CardFax has learned.  The
council will use the mark to let benefit recipients know where they can use
their cards.  The council, which was formed last year to create a national set
of EBT operating rules, adopted a set of standards in principle last month
(CardFax 12/19).  "If you start from scratch, there's a lot of paperwork and
forms you must fill out in developing a logo.  We can avoid that by buying an
existing logo," Helena Sims, senior director of the council, tells CardFax.
The council hopes to complete the negotiations within several weeks, Sims
says.  The logo would be purchased with funds collected from member dues.
Terms of the deal, including what the council will pay to use the Quest logo,
were not revealed.



The Kentucky-based Quest EFT network dissolved in July 1995 after its member
institutions migrated to the Delaware-based MAC regional EFT network.  The
network-which exists in name only-is owned by Transaction Services Co.  Equity
owners of Transaction Services include Transfinancial Bank, PNC Bank of
Kentucky, National City Bank of Kentucky, Owensboro National Bank, Bank of
Louisville, Bank One Kentucky and Bank One Lexington.  "We don't want the
Quest mark to be used in a bank-owned ATM environment, but we may consider
using the mark on EBT cards," Al Metzler, Bank One Kentucky senior vice
president and chairman of the Quest board, tells CardFax.

PROFIT PICTURE:  Competition and higher funding costs pulled credit card

PROFIT PICTURE:  Competition and higher funding costs pulled credit card
profits down in 1995, Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Investment
Bankers, estimates.  Hammer says general-purpose cards had a 3.60% pre-tax
return on assets and a 2.16% after-tax return last year, down 30 basis points
(0.3 percentage points) from 1994's returns.  Balance-transfer competition
coupled with a 40-basis-point increase in the average cost of funds to 6.1%,
caused the profit decline.  Estimates are based on interviews with card
issuers, processors and analysts.

INQUIRING FINES:  In February, First Fidelity Bancorp will begin to charge
consumers 75 cents for balance inquiries made with tellers and 50 cents for
inquiries made through its toll-free number if their accounts fall below
minimum-balance requirements, CardFax has learned.  Customers still will
receive two free teller inquiries and two free remote inquiries every month.
The fees are an attempt to migrate excess branch inquiries to ATMs.  First
Fidelity has 715 ATMs.

WARNING SIGNS:  Nearly 17% of disposable income now goes to pay mortgage

WARNING SIGNS:  Nearly 17% of disposable income now goes to pay mortgage and
consumer debt, including credit cards, reports Alison Emmerich, associate
director at Standard & Poor's Corp., which rates credit card-backed
securities.  That level is approaching the earlier high of about 18% in 1989.
"It's certainly not up to its peak, but it is moving up, and that's a cause
for concern," Emmerich tells CardFax.

RATE REFORM:  The MAC regional electronic funds transfer network has narrowed
the gap in interchange rates within the 30-state network.  Depending on each
market, interchange on a cash withdrawal will vary from 32 cents to 38 cents,
compared to the previous rate of 30 cents to 40 cents.  The ultimate goal is
to have a single rate throughout the network, Phillip Valvardi, network
director, tells CardFax.

STAND TO GAIN:  Executives with card issuers gained more than their
counterparts at card-support companies (CardFax 12/26), but a trend toward
option-based and at-risk bonuses obscures the actual compensation some execs
stand to realize.  Capital One Financial Corp.  Chairman and CEO Richard D.
Fairbank and President and Chief Operating Officer Nigel W.  Morris could
together garner $52 million if the company's stock hits $50 a share.  Options
granted to First Data Corp.  Chairman Henry C.  Duques had a net gain of more
than $8.4 million in less than six months.

in 1996 than mergers or acquisitions, reports a survey of 50 issuers by

anticipate modest growth in 1996, 58% expect moderate growth, and 9%
anticipate explosive growth.

SOBRIETY:  While the credit card business has been robust in the past three

SOBRIETY:  While the credit card business has been robust in the past three
years, some card executives predict the party will soon take on a somber tone,
prompted partly by intense competition that has resulted in declining response
rates to solicitations.  "We think 1996 will be another difficult year because
the card has become a commodity," says James J.  Ahearn, president of
Boatmen's Credit Card Bank.  While Ahearn predicts receivables could grow as
much as 20% industry wide, he says much of that increase may come from
convenience users who don't pay interest.

GOOD, BAD AND UGLY:  A survey by First Manhattan Consulting Group reports

GOOD, BAD AND UGLY:  A survey by First Manhattan Consulting Group reports
that the typical bank makes money on 30% of its customers, breaks even on 20%,
and loses money on the remaining 50%.  The survey also shows only 2% of
consumers never visit a branch.  "Very few consumers are really self-service
oriented," says Seamus McMahon, First Manhattan's managing vice president, who
adds that the results show the importance of banks freeing up resources from
unprofitable channels to focus on retaining their most desirable customers.

CHIPS ON DEMAND:  Smart cards won't be an everyday item in the U.S.  until at
least 1998, James J.  Farrell III, advertising manager for Motorola Inc.'s
CSIC Microcontroller division, tells CardFax.  Farrell says he expects smart
card trial programs to be launched in 1996, followed by rollouts in 1997.
Motorola, the world's leading supplier of microchips for smart cards, will be
able to produce 10 million microchips per week by 2000, he says.  Motorola is
doubling the size of its smart card factory in East Kilbride, Scotland, to
meet demand and is laying the groundwork for similar factories in Britain and
the U.S.

SALES PITCH:  A key selling point of commercial on-line networks for credit

SALES PITCH:  A key selling point of commercial on-line networks for credit
card issuers is that on-line networks are marketing themselves aggressively to
consumers.  America Online, for example, has launched a television advertising
campaign.  "No one is selling the Internet; users must decide for themselves
to log onto it," explains Tim Kemp, manager of emerging technology for First
Chicago Corp.  "On-line networks have their own sales force."  As the
popularity of on-line networks increases, issuers are likely to establish a
presence on more than one network, card experts say.

EXCLUSIVE:  AMEX TESTS SMART CARD

AMERICAN EXPRESS is testing a multiple application chip-based card in
its New York City headquarters, sources have told CI.

The pilot, which began in late December, has processed the first
chip-based credit card transactions in the US. Unlike the card
associations, which are pushing stored-value applications, American
Express has installed T&E (green or gold card), Optima and corporate
accounts on one card. Future applications might include electronic
purse and loyalty programmes, according to a source familiar with the
programme.

The microprocessor chip cards are produced by Solaic, a division of
French-based Group Sligos, and smart card terminals will be provided by
US manufacturer VeriFone and French producer Dassault Electronique.

During the pilot, about 30 to 100 cards are being tested by employees.
At the point of sale, a consumer inserts his/her card into a reader/pin
pad, enters a personal code and selects to which account the purchase
will be billed. American Express' back office has already certified the
VeriFone Omni460 base terminal and the SC450 smart card peripheral.

The card is accepted at the company cafeteria but the test will be
expanded to include other sites within the World Financial Center, a
source said. A table-service restaurant at headquarters will also test
portable terminals manufactured by Dassault.

American Express confirmed that since before Christmas, it has been
operating a small employee test of a multi-application smart credit and
charge card. Fewer than 50 cards were involved, she said, emphasising
that it was not a significant event in the opinion of the company.

American Express has taken a leadership position within the Smart Card
Forum, a US-based multi-industry group set up to advocate the
development of smart card systems. Robert Wesley, who is head of
international smart card business development at Amex, is a member of
the Forum's executive board and head of the travel and entertainment
subcommittee.

Internally, smart cards comprise one section of an advanced payments
group which also oversees ExpressNet, an on-line service which appears
on America Online, a private online computer network.

Another key Amex executive, David Boyles, is head of the prepaid card
subcommittee in addition to leading information technology efforts at
the company's Utah-based Stored Value division, formerly known as the
Travelers Cheque group.

In addition, Boyles' group has internally posted several job openings
for the Salt Lake City site, suggesting the division is preparing for
additional work and that smart card efforts may be consolidated in
Utah. The Stored Value group oversees travellers cheques, Amex Special
Teams, which install purse card systems on college campuses, and Amex
Telecom, which is getting into the prepaid phone card business.

In related news, American Express has secured the co-operation of
MasterCard for terminal interoperability. At a CardTech/SecureTech
regional trade show in San Jose, California, officials from American
Express and MasterCard processed smart card transactions using their
respective cards on a common terminal.

American Express has been eager to be included in the payment system
specification work carried on by Europay International, MasterCard
International and Visa International. The demonstration paves the way
for all bank and Amex smart cards to be processed on one terminal,
satisfying a key demand of the merchant community.

ASIA-PACIFIC:  PYNE RESIGNS AS VISA HEAD

IN A SHOCK announcement, Visa International has revealed that its
president for the Asia-Pacific region, Lindsay Pyne, has resigned.

It is understood that Pyne will leave Visa some time in June. He will
stay on in his current position until the appointment of the new
president for the Asia-Pacific region.

While Visa has said Pyne is leaving "to pursue other business
interests", industry sources have said there have been rumours
circulating for two to three weeks that he had been approached by a
recruitment firm representing an international insurance organisation
operating in the region.

Pyne's resignation comes after having spent just two years at Visa
Asia-Pacific. He was earlier involved in spearheading a major
reorganisation of the Bank of New Zealand. Observers said the
resignation of Visa's most senior executive in Asia could not have come
at a worse time, as MasterCard is perceived to be gaining market share.

Also, sceptics said that for Pyne to leave when Visa is still in the
development stages of a number of important initiatives should concern
members over the long-term direction of the card association. One
source said: "It is a shame to come at a time when members are looking
for stability from the association. There is no continuity with people
resigning, we are not able to follow through with initiatives we are
planning with Visa."

Other member institutions were surprised at the news. Many had not
expected the resignation One banker commented:"They have been going
through a lot of turbulence over the past year. There has been a spate
of senior executive turnover."

PHILIPPINES TARGETED FOR CARD GROWTH

TWO PLAYERS have entered the Philippine cards market in the last year,
confirming predictions that the market is ripe for expansion.

According to the president of the Credit Card Association of the
Philippines, Dennis Legaspi, the country now has a total of 12 players
and the market has grown by 60 percent to 70 percent in the last 12
months to reach 1.5 million cards in force.

In terms of billings, growth in the past year was estimated to be in
the order of 30 percent to 40 percent. Observers are predicting that
growth rates will continue in the 50 percent range in 1996.

LandBank Visa card

One of the new players in the market, LandBank of the Philippines,
recently introduced its first credit card, the LandBank Visa card on
November 13.

To make the card more accessible to prospective cardholders, the income
requirement for the card is P120,000 ($4,600), as compared to the
industry standard of P200,000. Explaining the rationale behind this
strategy, Felicitas Mozo-Dimaano who heads LandBank's card business,
said that there is a large well of "cardable people" who can be tapped.

The LandBank Visa card entitles cardholders to savings on utility bills
when they use the card. In terms of settlement of their outstanding
accounts, special payment features allow cardholders to opt for
payments for costly items worth over P2,000 to be made in three-monthly
increments, up to 24 months.

In addition, a payment scheme known as Lite Payment Option, allows
cardholders to make partial payment of their account of at least 10
percent of their monthly purchases and cash advances. Cardholders can
also withdraw up to P20,000 a day from the bank's ATMs and ATMs from
the Megalink-run network.

PVB Visa card

The Philippine Veterans Bank (PVB), one of the Philippines' newest
banks, has also entered the credit card issuing business. An agreement
with Equitable Credit Card Network, an affiliate of Equitable Banking,
has allowed the bank to issue a Visa card by using the former's card
processing capabilities in its card issuing business.

PVB, a private commercial bank owned by 500,000 World War Two veterans,
started operations in August 1992. It issues the Classic and the
Veteran Gold Card, catering to both the middle and upscale markets.

Existing players

As competition increases, some of the more established players are
looking to consolidate their positions by introducing new products or
enhancing existing ones. Bank of the Philippine Islands, one of the top
five issuers, is to roll out the BPI MasterCard later this month.

As for its standard Burgundy card, this will receive a revamp and will
be relaunched to carry a longer repayment period, and a lower minimum
payment of 5 percent of monthly balances. In addition, the bank will
continue to run its successful"Frequent User, Sure Winner" bonus
point/incentive programme until mid-1996.

Citibank, which has 300,000 cards in issue, is banking on its enhanced
customer service to keep its top position in the market. The bank,
which claimed to have achieved a 91 percent score in terms of overall
satisfaction of its customers, has recently introduced the 24-hour
Citicard Banking Center which offers a wide range of banking and credit
card transactions.

Meanwhile, the Far East Bank and Trust Company introduced a new
instalment plan for holders of the FarEastCard. The low interest plan
offers cardholders an instalment limit equivalent to three times their
regular credit limit, up to a maximum of P150,000. In addition, the
bank will waive interest on the first instalment payment.

SINGAPORE BILLINGS HIT ALL-TIME HIGH

DESPITE THE fact that Singapore's retail sector is still in the
doldrums, MasterCard International has just released statistics showing
that billings on MasterCard-branded credit cards during the 1995
pre-Christmas season rose 14 percent from the same period in 1994,
reaching an all-time high of S$34.25 million ($24 million).

The MasterCard-sponsored survey shows transaction figures in all retail
sectors from December 10 through December 23. Statistics also indicated
that mail-order purchases registered a corresponding increase, but at a
faster pace of 82.7 percent, reaching S$409,000.

The international card association said that its analysis of a number
of sectors, including travel and entertainment, retail and services
which comprised health care, education, etc, showed that card spending
on all sectors experienced year-on-year growth in 1995.

The fastest growth was recorded by the service sector which grew by 31
percent, growing from S$3 million in 1994 to S$3.9 million in 1995.
Trailing behind were the travel and entertainment and retail sectors
which grew by 13 percent and 12 percent respectively.

Overall T&E spending in 1994 was S$9.3 million, which jumped to S$10
million in 1995. The retail sector grew from S$17.3 million in 1994 to
S$19.4 million in 1995.

A breakdown of the retail and services sectors showed that growth was
helped by increases in hardware purchases and spending on education
which expanded dramatically by 127 percent and 190 percent
respectively.

GERMANY:  BAHNCARD MISSES TARGET

A SURVEY conducted by German business newspaper Handelsblatt suggests
that Germany's largest co-branding deal between Citibank and Deutsche
Bahn has failed to reach its targets. According to the survey, only 20
percent of the 3 million Bahncard holders have opted for the payment
function which has been on offer since last July.

It is three years since Deutsche Bahn, Germany's national railways
operator, introduced the Bahncard, which costs DM220 ($153) and offers
half-price travel for a year.

The product quickly attracted a customer base of more than 3 million
and so impressed the banks that they competed vigorously to provide a
payment function: Citibank was finally selected as the Bahn's
co-branding partner and agreed to offer either a Visa or an Electron
chip at no additional charge.

Citibank acknowledged from the start of the marketing campaign last
July that the deal would be profitable only if cross-selling activities
were successful. Since revolving credit is scarcely used, and there is
no annual fee for the card, Citibank had no prospects of generating
adequate revenue from the card itself.

The bank estimated that 50 percent of existing Bahncard holders would
opt for either Electron or Visa functions and that 1.5 million to 2
million new customers would be won. But Handelsblatt's survey indicates
that the past six months have fallen far short of those goals.

Citibank is refusing to comment on the Handelsblatt survey and also
declines to produce its own figures on the "improved" Bahncard, arguing
that the marketing campaign got off to a slow start. Deutsche Bahn
commented that the marketing figures could not be analysed properly
until the product had been on the market for 12 months.

The marketing campaign hit problems from the start. Citibank signed the
deal with Deutsche Bahn on the assumption that all cards would
automatically carry either the Electron or the Visa function. But after
protests from consumer groups, Citibank said the payment option would
be provided only if customers expressly asked for them.

GERMANY:  GZS SIGNS DEAL WITH VISA

THE TRADITIONAL division between Visa and the German banking community
has ended. Visa has been awarded processing rights to Gesellschaft fur
Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the Eurocard/MasterCard processing centre in
Germany.

In return, processing houses in the Visa camp, such as B+S
Kartenservice may process Eurocard/MasterCard payments, although this
was previously the sole preserve of the GZS.

The deal is regarded as a triumph for the GZS, which recognised some
time ago that it would in future have to compete with its member banks
and their affiliates for card processing work. The bank-owned
organisation responded by investing in new processing systems - and
applying for a Visa processing licence.

Traditionally, most German banks issued Eurocard/MasterCard cards only,
while Visa issuers such as BfG Bank and Berliner Bank were very much
the exception. But now a number of institutions are offering both
Eurocard/MasterCard and Visa. For the processing houses, this is a
chance to win the processing contracts for both Visa and
Eurocard/MasterCard, but also carries the risk of losing existing
business.

The Visa deal is effectively an admission by the GZS that it is now
competing with its own member banks for processing contracts and can no
longer afford to exist on Eurocard/MasterCard business alone.

In recent months most large banking groups have established some sort
of processing capability and, as a result, some savings banks
(Sparkassen) are reported to have cancelled their processing agreements
with GZS altogether.

But the GZS believes the capability to process both Visa and Eurocard
payments will be crucial in future."Dual processing capability will be
a benchmark for measuring the success or failure of card processing
houses," a statement said.

SOUTH AFRICA:  CLICKS ROLLS OUT FIRST NATIONAL LOYALTY CARD

SOUTH AFRICA'S health and beauty store, Clicks, plans to extend use of
its loyalty Clubcard from the Western Cape to the Northern Province at
the end of March. It then plans to take it to national roll-out in July
to be available in all 160 of its stores.

According to Ingrid Bosman, direct marketing manager for the Clicks
Clubcard, the card is "South Africa's first true loyalty card". Before
the launch, Click's management researched the success of direct loyalty
cards in the UK, France, Spain and the US.

Since August 31 1995, 200,000 cards have been given free to customers
and it is expected that this figure will rise to 400,000-600,000 later
this year.

"Customers can't use the card for payments, it's purely for collecting
points," Bosman said. One point is given for every R5 ($1.40) spent
with a minimum of a R10 spend. After three months, if the customer has
collected 50 points, then discounts may be given from 5 percent off
cosmetics and jewellery to 2 percent off all other purchases.

"The discounts are the direct benefit to customers after three months,"
Bosman said. Other advantages include cardholders receiving the Clicks
Christmas catalogue before general release, information on special
sales and promotions and new product launches.

South African retailer Dions had a similar loyalty store card a few
years ago but this was discontinued."In South Africa there are a lot of
private label credit cards and some of them are incurring debt, so we
didn't want this problem. We want to use the card as a marketing tool
and not be bogged down with maintenance," Bosman said.

Interested customers can fill out their enrolment forms in-store where
they are given a card number for immediate use. The card is then put
through the cashier's till when paying for purchases and the card
number is linked to that sale. The card supplier to Clicks is BN Card

TURKEY THIRD COUNTRY TO OFFER SIGNIA

TURKEY HAS become the third country in Europe after the UK and
Switzerland to offer Europay's exclusive Signia card. It will initially
be offered to selected customers of Garanti Bank and Yapi Kredi with
three other Turkish banks coming on stream later this year.

According to Derya Goknar, Europay's operations manager for East
Europe, "as time passed it became more difficult to differentiate
between Gold and Classic cardholders. So we thought we would recreate
the distinction with the Signia card. We believe that in the next three
years, 3,000 Signia cards will be issued."

Europay already has 400,000 MasterCard cards in Turkey of which 55,000
are Gold cards. It also has 2 million Cirrus/Maestro cards issued by
its 22 member banks.

"Signia is not just a card product but is being positioned as a private
banking product," Mehmet Sezgin, Europay's regional business manager
for Turkey, told CI. He added that about five Turkish banks are
actively researching ways to offer private banking to their selected
clients. "Signia is the first product offered by those banks wanting to
get into private banking and as such is the first product of its kind
on the Turkish market," Sezgin said.

A minimum credit limit of $50,000 is required in order to become a
cardholder and each application must be approved by the bank's board of
directors.

"Our market research in the last year-and-a-half gave a positive
outcome. Yes, there is a market for the Signia card. The packaging
around Gold cards has not been successful and this has been eroding the
higher market segment for Visa and MasterCard," Sezgin added. He
maintained that Eurocard/MasterCard cards have a transaction value 35
percent higher than on Visa cards.

It is expected that the annual fee will be set at $500 with an interest
rate of 16 percent monthly. Inflation in Turkey is currently running at
higher than 100 percent.

TARGA'S EARLY SUCCESS IN ITALY

TARGA, THE co-branded Fiat card issued by Instituto San Paolo di Torino
is surpassing targets, according to preliminary results. The
Eurocard-branded card is said to be generating three times as many
sales as other credit cards.

The card was launched in March 1995 and allows cardholders to
accumulate points which can be redeemed against the purchase of a Fiat
car or other services, such as Lufthansa flights.

Roberto Culasso, product manager responsible for the Targa card at San
Paolo di Torino, said: "The product was the idea of Europay and was
inspired by the General Motors card. It has proved highly suited to the
Italian market.

"The average annual expenditure on the Targa card was running at L2.5
million ($1,500) and L3 million. At the end of last year, we estimated
that average spending on the Targa card was L7 million to L8 million.
The definitive figure will not be available until March this year, but
I would not be surprised if it was higher than our current estimates,"
Culasso said.

Meanwhile, the number of Targa cards in issue passed the 100,000 mark
and additional partners are expected to join the points scheme,
bringing the figure to about ten.

Europay International pointed to the success of the card to illustrate
the wisdom of its decision to work with the Italian banks."Targa
typifies Europay's approach in Italy, where we are to committed to
working closely with the banks. We feel this is more effective than
merely promoting our brand," said Gaetano Carboni, senior area manager
in Southern Europe for Europay.

Recent figures from Europay show that the Italian market is finally
showing signs of growth. Transaction volume for credit and debit cards
in the Europay stable increased by 21 percent in 1995, while the number
of payments went up by 31 percent.

The number of Europay products increased by 15 percent last year, with
the number of debit cards rising to 3.6 million and credit cards going
to 754,000.

Visa, however, continues to dominate the market, with 4.7 million debit
and credit cards in circulation and transaction volume of $7 billion.

FRANCE:  CARTE BLEUE REDESIGNS CARD

THE NATIONAL Carte Bleue card is to take on a new look, giving the bank
logo more prominence. Its logo is to appear as it does on the
International Carte Bleue Visa card (at the bottom, on the right, just
above the hologram).

The new design is an integral part of the Groupement Carte Bleue
strategy designed to relaunch the Carte Bleue brand in synergy with the
print advertising campaign launched last autumn in national magazines
(See CI 142).

The redesigning of the domestic-only Carte Bleue card appears as one of
the major plans in support of the Groupement Carte Bleue's press
advertising campaign in the national magazines, said the company. In
fact, the overall design of the cards belonging to the Carte Bleue
range has to follow a certain logic and be coherent with the clearly
defined brand policy, it added.

In addition to the appearance of the Carte Bleue logo on the front of
the card and to the increased amount of space available for bank
branding, the other components of the changed design are as follows:

- the horizontal hologram in the middle of the card is to become a
square hologram in the right-hand column, as on international cards,
with the original design: this new hologram will appear on all French
bank cards designed for domestic use;

- the CB logo, symbol of interoperability and of acceptance among
French retailers, will occupy the space at the top, on the right, above
the hologram.

Jean-Marc Bornet, chief executive of Groupement Carte Bleue, told CI:
"This change in the visual aspect of the Carte Bleue Nationale (a
product already in use among nearly 5 million customers), is part of
the Groupement's long-term policy of concentrating the range of cards
on the Carte Bleue brand, which is greatly appreciated by French
people.

"This focusing on Carte Bleue as well as the greatly increased
co-operation with Visa are the two poles of a policy designed to
improve the Carte Bleue members' profits through the increase in the
value of their products".

HOUSEHOLD, WAGONLIT CO-BRAND

HOUSEHOLD INTERNATIONAL is to co-brand corporate T&E cards with Carlson
Wagonlit Travel, the second-largest travel agency in the world, in a
partnership that targets a market dominated by American Express.

Household Bank is well known as the seventh-largest bank card issuer
and a leader in co-branding, such as the GM and Pacific Bell card
programmes. It has also become one of the leading issuers of MasterCard
corporate cards in the US with 127,000 cards.

The Illinois-based finance company initiated corporate card programmes
for its co-branding partners, including General Motors and two of its
subsidiaries, Electronic Data Services and Hughes Corporation.
Household also issues cards for Ameritech, Palomar Products, and for
itself.

As part of the exclusive partnership, Carlson will market its cards to
multinational corporations based in the US starting this quarter, to
European countries in the second quarter and in Asia and elsewhere in
1997. Household Limited, a credit card bank in the UK, gives the
company a foothold in Europe. Carlson Wagonlit operates the Carlson
Travel Network, AT Mays in the UK and Viajes Ecuador in Spain.

The Household deal is also a victory at the expense of First Bank
Systems, which was Carlson's co-brand partner from 1993. That
relationship ended in December. First Bank remains the leader among
bank T&E card issuers with 575,000 commercial cards and 250,000
purchasing cards branded by Visa. American Express, however, dominates
the commercial T&E market with more than 7 million cards.

Carlson Wagonlit, which is based in Minneapolis and Paris reported $12
billion in sales last year with 4,000 locations in 125 countries. The
agency will contribute its extensive corporate client list and its
travel service.

A Household spokesman said the companies had created a fully integrated
reporting package that goes beyond turnkey software provided by
MasterCard.

Co-branded corporate cards are a rarity, since T&E cards do not earn
interest income from revolvers and so do not generate the same profit
dynamics as consumer credit cards.

Wells Fargo Bank and Cincinnati-based Star Bank last year introduced
commercial cards with travel rewards built in, but neither involved a
leading player such as Carlson.

UNITED STATES:  CITI TESTS UNBRANDED CARD

CITIBANK, THE world's largest bank card issuer, has broken with
tradition by launching a non-Citibank-branded card, under the banner of
"CBSD". This stands for Citibank South Dakota, one of the New York City
money centre's issuing banks.

Citibank has solicited customers with an unbranded Visa gold card that
makes no mention of the bank, with the exception of some fine print
among the terms and conditions.   The offer represents a major shift in
strategy for a bank that has heavily promoted its name for years. But a
bank spokeswoman denied that Citibank was changing its long-term
strategy of promoting the bank brand.

"It's not a strategy but rather a test to reaffirm how important the
brand is. We do things like this to gauge customer reactions," she
said. The bank regards the test as being no different than offering
different combinations of fee, service and interest rates to different
customers.

In 1986, Citibank purchased the Choice card programme which featured a
rate lower than the standard Citibank Visa card but without any extra
benefits. It was offered to customers with exceptional credit records
in the era shortly before the upsurge in competition.

The CBSD card offered a 4.9 percent teaser rate for six months, no
annual fee and up to $15,000 credit limit. The rate increased to 5.4
percent above prime.

In recent months, Citibank has invested more heavily in its cards
business, which began growing in the latter half of 1995 after several
years of stagnation. It has also been promoting its name in new ways,
dropping its familiar Citibank Visa advertisements in favour of the
bank name alone.

MARINE MIDLAND EXPANDS ADVANTAGE PROGRAMME

IN AN EFFORT to keep its most profitable customers, Marine Midland Bank
has launched a rewards programme, called MarineAdvantage.

Midland Marine, a Buffalo, New York-based subsidiary of HSBC Holdings,
introduced the loyalty programme this month. It plans to solicit the
remainder of its portfolio by offering the same value-added rewards
programme for a fee.

The result is a seven-tier rewards scheme whereby cardholders can
redeem points accumulated through charge activity. The programme, which
features rewards offered by retail, travel and dining partners, mirrors
one offered by its UK-based parent Midland Bank.

Peter Davidson, executive vice president and head of consumer banking
at Marine Midland said it is essential to retain lucrative customers
already on the books. "The approach we take in customer management is
one of determining who our most profitable customers are and
determining what it is that attracts those people," he said.

Marine Midland divides its portfolio into four categories of revenue
generation: highly profitable; moderately profitable; marginally
profitable, or those which cover variable costs; and the unprofitable,
which do not cover fixed or variable costs.

Davidson said Marine Midland is looking to "put a wall up" around its
core customers. "In most cases, 20 percent of the portfolio generates
100 percent of the profits," he said. Those accounts that are marginal
or unprofitable should be charged fees or higher rates to either make
them more profitable or encourage the customers to close their account.

Because of the fierce competition in the market, it may be very costly
to replace one good customer. "If you have a highly profitable
customer, that customer may generate upwards of $300, $400 or $500 a
year for the bank. To lose one of those, you might need ten average
customers. If you could spend on an existing account what you would on
a new account, then that is well worth your while."

The MarineAdvantage programme also addresses the attrition of
value-conscious customers, those who have been lured away by co-branded
schemes. "We already addressed the needs of price conscious and service
conscious customers," he said.

Marine Midland consumer research found cardholders preferred fun or
out-of-the-ordinary rewards, and rewards that are attainable sooner
rather than later. This self-branded programme is administered by
Maritz of Missouri, a third party that developed card-based employee
incentive programmes.

Davidson also said Marine Midland will test ways of getting rid of
unprofitable customers in the second quarter of this year. "One
approach is to price them, to the point where they accept the terms or
leave - a $50, $75 or $100 fee," he said.

All of this suggests that Marine Midland, too, hopes to tap into the
booming credit card business. The bank is just starting to make a dent
in the marketplace, growing its loans by $300 million last year to $1.8
billion in receivables, placing it among the 30 largest US portfolios.
"We see cards as a very profitable product, when managed properly, and
we feel it is still a growth business, what with the new uses that are
coming about."

Still, Davidson acknowledged several danger signs that have emerged at
the end of 1995: a dip in consumer confidence and a slight rise in
personal bankruptcies and charge-off rates."It may be time to be a
little cautious and concentrate on finding the best customers that are
out there in the marketplace, given signs that the economy perhaps is
softening a little bit. I don't think there are any disasters out there
yet, but it's a good time to be prudent."

CITIBANK FORD CARD REACHES 4.4 MILLION TARGET

CITIBANK'S FORD credit card programme, usually in the shadow of its
more successful rival issued by Household Bank/General Motors, is
finally coming into its own.

According to annual surveys conducted by Brittain Associates, a
marketing consultancy based in Atlanta, Ford's rebate and marketing
partner strategies are having the desired effect, with the number of
cards reaching 4.4 million, an increase of 350,000 accounts since 1994.

Both Texaco petrol and Hertz Rental Car sales have enjoyed increased
sales as a result of Ford Citibank cardholders seeking to build up
rebate points faster.

The study is good news to card issuers, since it shows that allied
marketing partners do benefit from their association with card
programmes while at the same time they add value to the programme. "By
all appearances, it's a win-win-win situation for Ford, Citibank and
their marketing partners," said Bruce Brittain, president of the
consultancy.

"We have seen a net 7 percent growth in the number of accounts in the
past 12 months and evidence that their revolvers are carrying larger
balances. These are healthy signs for the portfolio," Brittain said.

In a separate survey, Brittain also noted that American Express' Optima
True Grace has grown 45 percent since April or an additional 500,000
accounts. The study suggested that American Express is reaching a
younger, less affluent segment than its traditional business.

Meanwhile, the quietly successful General Electric Rewards card may
have declined as much as 20 percent in the same six month period.
Brittain says that once again, changes to the card's rebate schemes
trigger cardholder behaviour. In this case, rebates were remitted as an
annual cheque starting July 1995, rather than coupons to be used with
marketing partners. If a programme change is to blame, Brittain
explained, then he expects the portfolio numbers to rebound in the
coming months.

Petrol rebate cards continue to perform well. Chemical Bank's Shell Oil
card enjoyed a 15 percent increase in accounts in the last nine months.
Virtually all of the accounts are new to Chemical's portfolio (soon to
be called Chase Manhattan) and two-thirds were already Shell
proprietary customers who were converted.

According to the survey, the GE Exxon card has only attracted 250,000
cards in its first year, a quarter of the size of the Shell programme
after the same duration. Brittain found that Exxon, unlike Shell, did
not market the card to its entire proprietary portfolio.

SPONSORSHIPS YIELD RICH HARVEST

Credit card companies have joined brewers and cigarette makers as some
of the most active sponsors of sporting and entertainment events in the
world. Joseph A Giannone reports

WITH ADVERTISING and other marketing channels growing increasingly
cluttered, credit card issuers and organisations are seeking to
increase their profile through sponsorship of major events. Sporting
events are being selected to market cards and the brands as well as tap
into some of the enthusiasm fans have for their sports.

Exclusivity does not come cheap, however. According to IEG Sponsorship
Report, a newsletter covering the sponsorship trade, Visa International
spent between $30 million and $35 million on sponsorship rights on the
National Football League, the Elton John tour and some destination
deals.

MasterCard is spending $10 million to $15 million towards the soccer
World Cup in 1998, the National Hockey League and several golf
competitions. MasterCard and its members spent a combined $75 million
in relation to World Cup 1994.

Card sponsorships took off in 1984 when American Express was a leading
sponsor to the Olympics, according to Jim Andrews of IEG, a consultancy
specialising in sponsorships. But in 1988 Visa took over lead
sponsorship and has subsequently generated great success by exploiting
its exclusive sponsorship rights.

Sponsorship activity grew heated this year, as the two associations and
American Express each landed one among three major sports leagues. In
April 1995, Visa announced its deal with the National Football League
with an estimated value of $50 million over five years. Visa this
summer created tie-ins as the official card of Triple Crown horse
racing.

American Express in May signed on with the National Basketball League,
paying $30 million for three years. It also signed a sponsorship deal
with the Dallas Cowboys football club to be the official card of Texas
Stadium, though Visa has rights bestowed by the league.

The most recent industry deal was scored by MasterCard in December with
a four-year, $2 million exclusive deal with the National Hockey League.
MasterCard is touting its gold cards at several title golf tournaments,
such as the PGA Grand Slam and the Colonial.

Likewise, the NHL hockey and NASCAR automobile racing circuit will be
used to promote standard cards. Three more golf title sponsorships are
pending, a MasterCard spokeswoman said.

Visa and MasterCard continued their worldwide sponsorship commitments.
Visa paid $40 million for the 1992 and 1996 Olympics.

MasterCard seized on World Cup soccer as a global marketing platform.
It paid $10 million to sponsor the 1998 championships in France,
according to IEG. A four-year package of associated sponsorships
leading up to the games is worth $40 million.

Credit card groups are not alone in seizing on sponsorship as a new way
of doing business, according to Jim Andrews, an IEG vice president.
Sponsorship spending will top $5.4 billion in the US next year, 15
percent more than the $4.7 billion projected to be spent in 1995.

Sponsorships have become popular as a rallying point for everything a
company does. For MasterCard and Visa, the World Cup and Olympics have
formed the cornerstone promotions used by members as well as the
associations.

"In sponsorships, it's not just what you have, it's what you do with
it," said Mava Heffler, MasterCard senior vice president in charge of
sponsorships. MasterCard, she said, has expanded its soccer sponsorship
to include a broadcast television soccer report and markets the brand
as host of smaller events leading up to the World Cup championships.

"The current level of activity can be traced to the Olympics, in terms
of what it has done for sponsors in a number of ways. Companies have
found that whenever they ran promotions to make donations to the teams,
their usage went up," Andrews said.

The big winner in all of this, though, may be Delaware-based MBNA
America, the second-largest bank card issuer in the US and king of
affinity credit cards. At the same time as Visa secured the NFL spot,
MBNA was chosen as the issuer for 30 professional football franchises.
Likewise, MBNA has been tapped by MasterCard to issue cards for all 26
hockey teams.

ADVANTA LOOKS AT GLOBAL EXPANSION

Advanta Corporation, one of the fastest growing credit card issuers in
the US, is getting serious about reproducing its success in other
countries. Joseph A Giannone reports

ADVANTA IS joining the swelling ranks of US non-bank credit card
issuers that are expanding beyond national boundaries. Last year,
Advanta formed a joint venture with Royal Bank of Scotland to issue
cards in the UK. And that, according to Advanta International head Jim
Allhusen, is just the beginning.

"International business will be a key part of corporate expansion and
it will be a major part of our strategy. We plan to be opportunistic
when we find markets that are inefficient or stagnant," Allhusen said.

Within the US, the limited-purpose credit card issuer based near
Philadelphia has jumped into the elite top 20 while it continues to
outperform the industry. Advanta managed $11.9 billion in assets at the
end of the third quarter, making it the 13th-largest issuer in the US.
In the first nine months of 1995, the company added 1 million new
accounts for a total of more than 4 million.

The company, which has its roots in making loans to educators in
Pennsylvania, has recruited several industry luminaries with
international credentials. Most notably, former MasterCard
International chief executive Alex "Pete" Hart joined in 1994 and was
subsequently named CEO of the company.

Hart has since lured two association colleagues to join him: Arthur
Kranzley, formerly head of MasterCard's worldwide debit business, who
came on board in the autumn.

Earlier this month, the company hired Hung-Fu "Hank" Chiang, who left
his post as general manager of MasterCard China. Chiang also had worked
with Hart at First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles.

Chiang, an American of Chinese descent, will report to James Allhusen,
an executive vice president in charge of Advanta International, a
newly-formed group. Allhusen, who ran consumer banking and cards for
Standard Chartered Bank, came on board last year. His career includes
stints in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.

Allhusen noted that Hart, Chiang and he all have expertise and contacts
in Asian markets. He said people were now in place to develop an Asian
strategy. When asked if a China strategy were in place at Advanta,
Allhusen replied, "No, not yet."

But company executives speak openly of plans for global expansion by
way of joint ventures with indigenous partners in certain high-growth
markets. Unlike Citibank, MBNA or Household International, which have
set up issuing banks in target markets, Advanta will seek to create
ventures with like-minded banks as it did with Royal Bank of Scotland
last year.

"We believe Advanta has skills within the company which have made it
very successful in the US. We see opportunities in foreign markets to
use those same skills to our advantage. My job is to find out which
skills are most transportable across borders and to find partners we
could work with in those markets," said Allhusen, naming RBS as an
example.

Royal Bank, he said, "is just as committed to the success of the
proposition, has a strong image, a strong brand and an infrastructure
to support a cards operation. What we bring is a number of skills that
have not yet been developed in the UK market."

In recent months, Advanta has been more aggressive in seeking
publicity, another sign that the company seeks recognition as a leading
cards player.

Allhusen said the increase is coincidental, since the company recently
has had much to proclaim. Advanta has a motive in trying to earn the
favour of Wall Street to boost its share price, a tactic recently
employed by First USA. News of international expansion could help
rectify a depressed price-earnings ratio of 12.5, which according to
Allhusen is"lower than it ought to be."

Along with the other pure plays, Advanta's Class A stock took a plunge
at the end of December, dropping to $38 per share from an October high
of $49.

According to analysts pure play companies such as Advanta, which derive
almost 100 percent of their revenues from credit cards, have suffered
from recent reports that make gloomy predictions for the future. In the
last few quarters, charge offs and personal delinquency rates have
crept upward on average, though individually Advanta's loss experience
has been better than the industry as a whole.

RAYMOND JAMES MOVES INTO TRADITIONAL BANKING FIRST: HERE COME THE
BROKER-DEALERS

In the financial equivalent of "man bites dog," Raymond
James Financial Inc. has underway a major thrust into traditional banking
services via its wholly owned bank, Raymond James Bank. The St. Petersburg-
based financial conglomerate will offer in February FDIC-insured products
like checking and savings accounts. And, in a few months the bank will
market home equity lines of credit, and, possibly, residential mortgages.
     If all goes well, the securities dealer's bank might become
the nation's largest virtual bank. Theresa Schefstad, the president and CEO
of Raymond James Bank, promises to reach her market "telephonically and
electronically. Our objective is to provide consolidated financial services
so all (customers') financial services can be received from our firm," she
said.
     The bank's initial target market will be the securities
company's hefty customer base of some 300,000 clients.
     "We'll be able to offer our clients several product
choices. We have the FDIC option, our credit interest program (sweep
account) option, and the third is our Heritage mutual funds," Schefstad
explained. The Heritage funds are Raymond James' proprietary mutual funds.
     The company will continue its tradition of not providing
additional incentive to brokers selling top proprietary products.
"Compensation is consistent for all three product options," Schefstad said.
This compensation practice appears to have worked to the detriment of the
Heritage fund family, where growth of the individual funds has fallen
behind other brokerage house proprietary funds, despite the company's
nationwide branch network.
     Schefstad said that James is the only broker/dealer to
wholly own a full-service bank. Unlike other nonbanking companies, which
must resort to the "nonbank bank" strategy to get into the banking
business, James purchased the bank branches with a total deposit base of
$12 million from the Resolution Trust Co. In May, 1994 the company
chartered the Raymond James Bank FSB, which has a capability to operate in
all 50 states.
     The bank ended 1995 with approximately $162 million in
assets and $136 million in deposits.
     Over the past 20 months, Schefstad, the bank staff has been
wrestling with regulatory approvals, developing disclosure policies and
integrating the bank's systems into the Raymond James computer network.
     "Because of who owns us, we've had to obtain regulatory
approval for everything we've done. For example, when we developed our
consolidated statement, we received approval (beforehand) of our disclosure
policy and separation of accounts," Schefstad said.
     The bank will maintain a physical branch office near its
headquarters in Florida. Schefstad envisions the remainder of the bank's
efforts taking place electronically, particularly through the nationwide
automated teller machine networks. Of course, deposit-taking via the ATM
has yet to gain wide acceptance, but Schefstad said the firm's brokerage
clients are sophisticated enough to understand and use direct-deposit
options available through the automated clearing house system.--John J.

SECOND PUERTO RICAN DEAL CAPS DECEMBER CALENDAR

Eying the market throughout 1995, FirstBank of Puerto Rico
became the second bank from the island to issue subordinated debt in
December.
     The state-chartered commercial bank completed a $100
million offering of 10-year subordinated notes that priced at 200 basis
points over Treasurys for a coupon of 7.625% at 99.277 to yield 7.730%. The
notes, which carry a split rating of Baa3/BB-plus, carried 144A language,
enabling a public-style execution of the offering without registration at
the Securities & Exchange Commission. The relatively rich spread resulted
from S&P rating the issue just below investment grade, said Annie Astor,
chief financial officer.
     The need for Tier 2 capital and the exceptionally low rates
in December, dropping below 6%, were the key factors prompting FirstBank to
issue the bonds, according to Astor. The deal represents the bank's first
independent bond offering.
     Jefferies & Co. captured the leading underwriting position
on the deal because of  its relationship with the bank, and Smith Barney
Inc. acted as co-manager. The private notes were purchased by about 15
insurance companies.
     Investors were attracted to the offering in large part by
the bank's phenomenal growth over the last five years, in which it has had
an average return on assets of 8% and a return on equity of 25%. Since the
bank's initial public offering in January 1987, the stock has appreciated
in value by 1200%, Astor said. Headquartered in San Juan, the $2.4 billion
asset bank switched from a thrift charter to a commercial bank charter last
year.
     The deal for First Bank follows a first-time subordinated
offering by another Puerto Rican bank that was completed earlier in the
month. BanPonce Corp., rated Baa2/BBB, originally offered $100 million in
10-year subordinated notes, and later increased the public offering to $125
million. That deal, which priced at 105 basis points over comparable
Treasurys, was underwritten entirely by CS First Boston (see CFO Alert
12/11/95, P.5)

SUSQUEHANNA ADDING DEBT TO EQUITY TO FUND ACQUISITION

Seeking to fund its expansion efforts, Susquehanna
Bancshares Inc. recently issued shares of common stock and is prepping an
offering of senior notes that is expected to hit the market at the end of
January.
     "We're in the process of acquiring a thrift in Maryland for
$63 million, and we don't have that cash on hand," said J. Stanley Mull,
vice president of the Treasury at Susquehanna. The acquisition of Fairfax
Corp., located in Baltimore, follows the thrift acquisitions last April of
Atlantic Federal Savings Bank and Reisters Town Federal Savings Bank.
     Including the greenshoe option, a total of 1.495 million
shares were issued at $26.50 per share, or $25.31 after underwriting fees,
for proceeds of $37.8 million, Mull said. Oppenheimer & Co. led the
offering, followed by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. and Legg Mason Wood
Walker Inc.
     Susquehanna chose Oppenheimer as lead on the deal because
of advisory services the investment bank had provided in the past, Mull
said, noting that Keefe, Bruyette added a strong, bank-market name to the
deal, and Legg Mason provided strong distribution in the Maryland area,
where many of the bonds were sold. Around two-thirds of the offering was
sold at the retail level, and the rest to institutional investors.
     Susquehanna anticipates approaching the debt market later
in January to offer up to $35 million in senior debt, the proceeds of which
will also be devoted to the acquisition, Mull said. He noted that a
maturity for the notes had yet to be determined. Oppenheimer and Keefe
Bruyette will underwrite the offering.
     Susquehanna Bancshares Inc., which has $3 billion in assets
in both Pennsylvania and Maryland, operates six commercial banks. It
recently formed a subsidiary, Susquehanna Bancshares Inc. South, to act as
the holding company for the thrift assets.

BANK BONDS ON TOP: ONE AWESOME YEAR

Returns on bonds issued by banking institutions climbed to
remarkable heights in 1995 -- relatively speaking. Whether they can sustain
last year's pace, however, is another story.
     Aggregate total returns reached 21.85%, topped by single-A
rated banks, which found a return of 22.11%. Although the total return for
corporates overall was higher at 22.24%, duration adjusted returns,
considered a more accurate measure, showed bank bonds besting virtually all
other corporate and government securities (see table on P. 2).
     Still, the heights to which bank returns climbed are
relative to their starting point at the beginning of the year.
     "Banks were cheaper going in, so there was a big upside,"
said Anne Robinson, a fixed income analyst at Bear Stearns. She added that
bank spreads widened considerably toward the end of 1994, largely due to
Federal Reserve interest rate hikes earlier in the year.
     Spreads on bank bonds are strongly correlated to interest
rates, due to the interest rate sensitivity of banks' businesses, which may
account for some widening of spreads in the third quarter 1995. At that
time, minor concerns of inflation were sparked. Shortly after, however,
positive inflation numbers were released, a number of large banks announced
mergers, and there was significant purchasing of U.S. Treasurys by the
Japanese central bank, which drove rates down. These factors all worked to
tighten spreads in the fourth quarter, actually doubling returns from the
previous quarter,  to nearly record levels. However, investors see little
room for improvement in the bank bond market, at least compared to other
corporate bonds.
     "Our view is that spreads are at fairly narrow levels, and
there's not much room for upside," said Mike O'Brien, a banking analyst at
Fidelity. He noted that while there has been some deterioration in banking
fundamentals, such as credit quality, those fundamentals are still very
strong. "An investor wouldn't be overweighting in the bank sector, but
probably wouldn't be getting out either. The sector may not perform as well
as before, but we don't think it will have problems."
     O'Brien further noted that consolidation in the industry,
which has been a driving factor behind the rally, appears to be winding
down somewhat, and that upside stemming from ratings upgrades has probably
leveled off.
     "The sector is balancing out at high single-A -- it's hard
to get excited about the sector," O'Brien said. He noted that Fidelity is
focusing on shorter-maturity debt  --  buying five-year paper rather than
20-year -- to guard against spreads potentially widening later in the year.
     Robinson generally agreed with O'Brien's prognosis of the
bank sector, noting that there is only a 30-basis point spread difference
between the best and weakest banks. That compares to a 45-basis point
difference at this time last year.
     "We don't see spreads tightening any further. But an
investor can still make money in banks if rates go down later in the year,"
she said.

POTENTIAL FUNDING DILEMMA: MIXED MESSAGES FROM FASB

Banks that left securities in the held-to-maturity category
of Financial Accounting Standard 115 during the recently provided transfer
window, with the intention of using those securities later to do repurchase
agreement transactions, may find that strategy closed to them if a proposed
standard from the Financial Accounting Standards Board is enacted in its
current form.
     The proposed standard was issued as an exposure draft
around the same time that FASB provided banks with a window to transfer
securities currently classified as held to maturity into the available-for-
sale category without a penalty. The window of opportunity in FAS 115,
Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, closed at
the end of 1995, after which such transfers are strictly prohibited. The
proposed treatment for longer-term repos likely influenced held-to-maturity
designations under FAS 115 during the restructuring window, and will
continue to do so.
     For example, a financial manager may have intended to use a
five-year bond classified in held to maturity as collateral in a repo
transaction next year. However, that may not be possible under the same
favorable terms if the proposed statement becomes an accounting standard,
and so the manager may have chosen to use one of the other two categories
instead.
     Banking institutions typically designate securities used
for longer-term repos into the held-to-maturity category,  where unrealized
gains and losses needn't be marked to market. However, the proposed
statement would require any repos with a maturity of three months or more
to be recorded as a sale, and hence marked to market. Banks would thereby
be limited to using repos with maturities of less than three months, which
are still liabilities under the proposed statement. The proposed sale
treatment for longer-term repos increases volatility in capital and would
suddenly have to appear in the income statement when the rule comes into
effect. The proposed transition date currently is Dec. 15, 1996.
     "This is a major concern for our industry," said Marti
Sworobuk at America's Community Bankers. "Smaller banks and thrifts depend
on repos for general banking operations. Many of our members believe that
the proposed standard would do away with repos beyond three months and
increase their costs by at least 30-40 basis points."
     These institutions can also turn to the Federal Home Loan
Bank system for advances, although that is a more expensive source of
funding. In addition, Sworobuk noted, the future of the FHLB as an easily
accessible and available funding source is uncertain given the current
political climate.
     FASB  has noted that the three-month maturity limit on
repos is a period that was arrived at arbitrarily, largely because the
Board believed that the vast majority of repo transactions held far shorter
maturities.
     "We've since learned that there are more transactions with
durations around three months than we thought," said Halsey Bullen, the
project manager at FASB. He noted that the Board generally attempts to
derive arbitrary thresholds where there is a low concentration of business
activity, in order to avoid dramatic differences in accounting requirements
for many similar transactions. FASB will likely reconsider the three-month
limit as it continues its deliberations.
     Following the comment deadline Jan. 22, FASB will hold a
public hearing toward the end of February. As of the middle of last week,
the accounting standard setter had received about 25 comments, most of
which were notifications to testify at the public hearing.
     America's Community Bankers was preparing last week a
letter to FASB in order to express the views of its constituents.  The
trade group recently surveyed members with assets of $1 billion or more for
their views on the proposed statement, and found that many banks believe
the standard would eliminate a source of cheap, long-term funding. A large
savings bank in Wisconsin noted that it intends to extend its use of repos
out to one or two years, and that the proposed change would negatively
influence its operations.
     "To make a long story short, they're all saying that they
would have to shorten maturities and go to a higher-cost-of-funding
source," Sworobuk said.

BUYBACKS DROP OFF IN '95 MERGER MANIA

The heady volume of stock repurchase programs announced by
banks slackened in 1995 from the previous year, while repurchase programs
announced by thrifts more than doubled in the same period, according to
Securities Data  Co.
     The volume of announced programs in 1995 fell 25% from the
year before to just over $20 billion, a drop that surprised analysts, who
noted possible reasons including frenetic merger activity and heady stock
values.
     Observers of the savings and loan industry attributed the
nearly 140% increase in the volume of stock repurchases announced by
thrifts to factors that have been affecting banks for some time, including
the need to use capital and control burgeoning earnings-per-share and
return-on-equity ratios.
     Perhaps the most important reason, they said, was to ward
off acquirers seeking assets on the cheap.
     Marni Pont, an analyst at Keefe Bruyette & Woods Inc., said
that stock buybacks can prohibit banks from engaging in stock poolings, a
complication experienced by First Bank System in its efforts to acquire
First Interstate. She noted that banks may thus have decided to limit their
buybacks in favor of poolings, a strategy confirmed by the treasurer of a
regional bank whose institution recently chose to cut short its announced
buyback for that very reason.
     Another reason, Pont noted, was the rapidly rising values
of bank stocks, which, according to Keefe's KBI 50, provided an average
total return in 1995 of 60.02%.
     Yet despite a total return of 63% in 1995, AmSouth Bancorp.
decided to pursue a stock buyback last fall in order provide shares for its
employee benefit and stock plans.
     "You can generate a fairly good internal rate of return
(through a buyback) because the increase you achieve in EPS and ROE seems
to offset any cost that you incur through book value dilution," said List
Underwood, head of finance at the bank.

BANK GROUPS JOIN ARMS AGAINST FILING PENALTIES

Representatives of the nation's lending industries have
joined together to oppose a Clinton administration proposal for a plan they
believe will raise the penalties for failing to file, or filing
inaccurately, so-called "information returns," -- the infamous 1099s.
     These forms are used by lenders to report payments of
dividends, interest and interest accrued on accounts but not precisely
paid. For example, the original issue discount on certificates of deposit,
U.S. government securities or similar instruments.
     The Clinton administration proposal sprang out of the
budget stalemate that has persisted over the last several weeks. The
administration submitted a proposal to the Republican leadership in
Congress Dec. 7 as an alternative to Republican calls for deep cuts in the
federal budget. The proposal outlines increases in miscellaneous fees and
the closing of certain loopholes. Aimed more at stirring indigination than
winning congressional support, the proposal includes several other
provisions that the administration knew would be opposed by powerful
corporate interests. For example, it calls for federal banking regulators
to impose examination fees on state-chartered banks.
     The provision at issue appeared to be limited to payments
for services that were reportable on Form 1099-MISC. However, according to
a letter to Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin dated Jan. 2, the
lenders said that an explanation provided by the Joint Committee on
Taxation Dec. 15 indicated a provision with much broader scope.
     Those signing onto the letter include Credit Union National
Association, the American Bankers Association, the American Land Title
Association, America's Community Bankers, the Independent Bankers
Association of America, the Investment Company Institute, the National
Association of Realtors, the Public Securities Association and the
Securities Industry Association.
     The implication is that even if the proposal had merit, it
is unlikely to be supported in Congress--especially in an election year.
However, given that this is not a normal budget process, the groups are
joining together to marshall their muscle out of fear that in a late night
deal, the provision could be swept into a compromise--at great cost to
lenders of all stripes.
     The letter says the industries "strongly oppose" the
administration's plan.

CITICORP ISSUES FIRST SUB DEAL IN STORMY NEW YEAR

Finance officials overcame the snow drifts and icy roads
after last week's blizzard to complete the first subordinated transaction
of the new year.
     Citicorp issued $250 million in 10-year subordinated notes.
Rated A2/A, the paper priced at 62.5 basis points over comparable Treasurys
for a coupon of 6.375% at 99.672 to yield 6.42%. The issue carries a bullet
repayment.
     The deal was led by Salomon Brothers, followed by co-
managers Bear Stearns, Citicorp Securities, Goldman Sachs and Merrill
Lynch.
     The new year has been relatively quiet in the bank bond
market, despite talk the week before last of a stockpile of deals ready to
hit the market and take advantage of still relatively low rates. In fact,
investment bankers said that more offerings might have hit the market last
week had the storm arrived in lesser force. Interest rates also jumped
during the week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged on consecutive
days.
     Still, the Citicorp deal was said to have met with mild
resistance in the market, requiring a series of swaps to complete the deal
in a timely fashion once the issue began trading.
     Sources predicted a number of offerings approaching the
market this week and the next. Meridian Bancorp Inc., headquartered in
Reading, PA, was rumored to be preparing to hit the market shortly.

SEGMENT ACCOUNTING RULES NEAR ISSUE

Accounting standards-setters in the United States and
Canada plan to follow their global counterpart this week by issuing draft
rules governing when businesses must disclose financial information about
their regional operations and product lines.
     The North Americans' exposure drafts on what are usually
referred to as "segment reporting" or "disaggregated disclosures" are
slightly less onerous than the one released Dec. 20 by the London-based
International Accounting Standards Committee. While the IASC draft could
require disclosures based on certain parameters, the identical drafts to be
issued by America's Financial Accounting Standards Board and the Canadian
Institute of Chartered Accountants goes no further than to press for
companies to report segments based on how they break down their operations.
     This difference of opinion has been going for at least a
year, and officials from all three groups are expected to engage in more
haggling on the issue this summer. Comments on all three sets of proposals
will be due June 30.
     Once it becomes a standard, the segment reporting rule
promises to shed more light on how and where banks make their money. And
the rule became even more important last month when Deutsche Bank announced
it would start publishing its group results according to International
Accounting Standards. That will mark the end of the use of so-called hidden
reserves to smooth out balance sheets.
     Under the IASC's exposure draft, companies would provide at
least one breakdown of risks and returns based on business or geographical
lines. In most cases, the actual one used should be whatever way internal
financial reports are sent to the CEO, the IASC said.
     The North American approach also starts with the way a
business views itself, but unlike the IASC it stops there. "IASC ...
recognizes the fact that this information does not always reflect the
dominant source and nature of risks and returns," wrote Paul Pacter, IASC's
project manager. "In certain cases, therefore, information needs to be
modified for external reporting purposes."-- Craig Webb

Bank of Boston Bets on Securitization

   Hoping to resuscitate its real estate lending business, Bank of Boston
Corp. is radically altering its operations: From now on, it will only
originate commercial mortgages that can be securitized.
   In an exclusive arrangement, the nation's 16th-largest bank has engaged
Goldman, Sachs & Co. to structure and distribute mortgage-backed notes that
can be sold to several classes of investors.
   Bank of Boston's move is a departure from the traditional real estate
operations of banks, which have always been long-term holders of commercial
mortgages. It's performance is sure to be tracked by regional banks
nationwide, many of which are weighing similar plans.
   The strategic shift results from months of discussions between senior
officials at Bank of Boston and outside securitization experts, including
advisers from Kenneth Leventhal & Co. and the New York law firm of Weil,
Gotshal & Manges.
   In talks earlier this month with borrowers and other outsiders, Bank of
Boston management expressed a sense of urgency about shifting its approach
from "book and hold" to "originate and sell." According to a bank position
paper, failure to adopt a securitization strategy would jeopardize its
commercial mortgage franchise. Under such a scenario, the bank said it
would:
   * "Lose a large portion of our asset base in one to three years."
   * "Have no competitive term credit to attract new relationships."
   * "[See its] revenues decline due to the loss of higher spread credit."
   * "Not be in control of our balance sheet as we continue to acquire
banks."
   Like many other institutions, Bank of Boston has been a reluctant real
estate lender during the early part of this decade - in contrast to its
aggressive style in the 1980s. For the most part, it has been booking mini-
perms (three- to five-year loans) that carry strict covenants and recourse
provisions. With such onerous terms, the bank has been losing prospective
borrowers to its competitors, and the outlook has worsened with the
proliferation of Wall Street's commercial mortgage conduits.
   Now that real estate values are rebounding, the bank wants to offer
friendlier terms on loans that can be regularly packaged into commercial
MBS and rolled off its balance sheet.
   In July, Bank of Boston's 90 commercial mortgage originators will start
hawking the new product line. It features long-term (five- to 20-year)
loans without covenants or recourse provisions. The bank will write
$750,000 to $10 million loans. The credits will carry fixed and adjustable
rates, amortizing over 20 or 25 years.
   The goal: To re-establish Bank of Boston as a one-stop resource for
developers and other real estate owners in need of construction, mini-perm
or long-term financing. The new program is designed to finance shopping
centers (anchored and unanchored), apartment buildings,
industrial/warehouse facilities, office buildings and hotels.
   By securitizing these loans, Bank of Boston can continue to build real
estate relationships and generate fee income, while meeting management
concerns about its asset-liability mix, risk exposure and capital
requirements.
   How does the bank plan to profit from its securitization program? The
bulk of its earnings will come from the "positive arbitrage" that is left
over from a loan's interest rate after paying issuance expenses and the
required yield to MBS holders.
   The bank estimates it will charge borrowers 275 to 350 basis points over
the Treasury curve and be left with 50 to 70 bp of profit. That projection
is considered somewhat optimistic, given that lenders are being forced to
lower their loan prices in order to cope with mounting competition.
   On top of the loan spread, the bank will also collect an origination fee
equal to 1.5% to 2.25% of the total loan amount, plus a $16,500 application
charge.
   MBS investors can expect Goldman, Sachs to provide a fairly regular flow
of multi-class issues, each backed by at least 30 mortgages. A typical
issue will be made up of a triple-A rated senior tranche yielding 100 to
125 bp over Treasuries, a smaller single- or double-A tranche yielding 140
to 175 bp over, a double- or triple-B class yielding 300 to 600 bp over and
an unrated piece with spreads in the mid- to high-teens.
   Spokesman for Bank of Boston and Goldman, Sachs did not return calls for
comment.
   Bank of Boston is counting on the securitization program to
substantially boost its origination capacity from its current annual
commercial mortgage output of about $250 million. It's not known whether
the bank also plans to securitize part of its $3.5 billion in existing real
estate loans, which were not underwritten with MBS investors in mind.
Nearly half of its current portfolio is secured by New England properties,
with the rest scattered throughout the U.S.

S&P Tops Rivals in Ratings Volume

   Standard & Poor's Corp. was the most active rating agency in the
commercial MBS market in 1993, working on more than half of the year's
dollar volume, according to data compiled by Commercial Mortgage Alert.
   Of the $14.7 billion in transactions for which rating information was
gathered, S&P rated offerings valued at $7.6 billion.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc. and Duff & Phelps Corp. were neck-and-neck
for second place. Fitch rated issues valued at $6.75 billion, while D&P's
total was $6.70 billion. Moody's Investors Service Inc. came in last, with
$6.2 billion of rated deals.
   S&P also ranked first based on the number of deals rated, with 46,
followed by D&P (42), Fitch (36) and Moody's (28).
   The survey - the first ever to track rating-agency activity in the CMBS
market - also showed that Fitch's business grew by a whopping 63% last
year, from $4.1 billion in 1992. The number of deals it rated more than
tripled.
   Moody's was the only agency to see its volume fall, logging a 12%
decline, from $7.1 billion.
   Still, several executives at Wall Street firms expressed surprise that
the agency ended up so close to the pack. Moody's suffered several key
staff defections last year, which limited its ability to process
transactions. The firm estimates that it turned away a couple of billion
dollars of offerings that it otherwise would have rated.
   What's more, Moody's has taken a strict view on certain types of
commercial MBS. That strategy has rankled underwriters, opened up
opportunities for rival agencies and, ultimately, cost Moody's some market
share. But because of its stellar reputation among bondholders, Moody's
ended up rating most of the year's biggest deals.
   Investment bankers weigh a number of factors when selecting a rating
agency, but the requirements of investors tend to be the dominant factor.
MBS buyers often insist that transactions be rated by either S&P or Moody's
- the two most-established agencies. And for most deals, they want the
comfort of two ratings. This opens the door for the market upstarts, D&P
and Fitch.
   Another key factor is service: How quickly and smoothly a deal will be
rated, as well as the accessibility of analysts to investors. At the end of
last year, when deal volume picked up sharply, the agencies were swamped
with business. Moody's temporarily stopped accepting additional business in
September. S&P, which has a much bigger staff dedicated to commercial MBS,
was forced to do the same the following month.
   Things have calmed down somewhat since the beginning of the year, with
deals usually taking six to eight weeks to go through the rating process.
One Wall Street executive commented that all of the agencies still have
bottlenecks, but he - and several others - singled out Fitch for providing
particularly good service.
   Because the issuer's cost of funds is generally the overriding concern
in every deal, underwriters are known to shop for agencies that will
require the least subordination in order to attain the desired rating. An
increase in the level of subordination, or other credit enhancement
features, can lead to dramatically higher borrowing costs.
   The individual bias of each agency is also well known in the market.
Moody's, for example, is comfortable with multi-family and retail deals,
but is wary of offerings backed by debt on office buildings and hotels.
Fitch has led the way on deals collateralized by nonperforming assets, but
is especially strict on offerings with single borrowers.
   D&P has been regarded as the most lenient and least influential of the
agencies. But underwriters said that D&P has become tougher under the
direction of Joseph C. Franzetti, a respected analyst who was recruited
last September from S&P, where he ran the mortgage-backed securities group.
    At the other end of the scale is Moody's, which seems to pride itself
on being the toughest rater. Last fall, for example, it issued a widely
publicized warning to investors about a "marked deterioration in the credit
quality" of commercial mortgage issues.
   "We're much less concerned with market share than with assigning high-
quality ratings," said Tad Philipp, associate director of the agency's
structured finance group. "We're never going to have the market share of
some of the other rating agencies."
   Despite their frustrations with the agency, investment bankers would
love to see Moody's play a bigger role in the CMBS arena, because of its
powerful reputation in other segments of the bond market.
   For this reason, some are perplexed by the fact that Moody's has devoted
fewer resources to this market than its rivals. After losing some staffers
to Wall Street houses last year, Moody's at times found itself with as few
as four or five professionals in its commercial MBS area, down from its
full complement of seven. The agency is on the verge of filling two new
positions, but it is still out-manned by its rivals: S&P employs about 20
professionals, while D&P has 14 and Fitch has 13.
   Philipp said that Moody's is committed to the market and expects it to
grow. "But we don't feel the need to staff up to handle peak volumes."

How the Rankings Were Compiled

   Commercial Mortgage Alert used its new CMBS Database to calculate the
volume of business handled by each of the four rating agencies over the
last two years.
   The Database, which includes every transaction completed since the
market's inception, carries rating information for the vast majority of
deals in recent years. All told, there were 123 deals valued at $17.7
billion that closed in 1993. But of those, issues with a face amount of at
least $1.7 billion were not rated - $638.4 million in Fannie Mae deals and
$1.1 billion in private placements used to finance acquisitions by Goldman,
Sachs & Co.'s Whitehall Street Real Estate Fund.
   Of the remaining $16 billion in deals, rating information from at least
one agency was gathered for offerings totaling $14.7 billion.
   Because of confidentiality agreements, the rating agencies declined to
provide information about private placements, and in some cases this
information could not be learned independently. The agencies did provide
aggregate data. S&P, for example, said it rated 62 commercial MBS deals
last year totalling $8.2 billion. And Moody's said it rated a total of $7.2
billion in deals. However, the survey counted only ratings that could be
tied to specific transactions.
   Agencies were given full credit for the total principal amount of an MBS
issue, even if they rated only some classes in a deal.

What They Charge

   Commercial MBS underwriters say fees don't play much of a role in their
selection of a rating agency.
   The four agencies each charge about the same - and their compensation
pales in comparison to other issuance costs, such as legal fees. The rating
agencies are usually paid six to 10 basis points of the value of the rated
classes, or $60,000 to $100,000 for a $100 million transaction.
   However, the complexity of a deal is also factored in, as well as the
geographic diversity of the collateral. Those factors can push the fee to
20 basis points or more.
   Underwriters say that Fitch tends to charge more than its rivals, but
not materially so.

Freddie's Securitization Plan Fizzling

   If Freddie Mac heeds the advice of Lehman Brothers Inc., it will soon be
canceling its plans to securitize a $1 billion portfolio of performing
multi-family mortgages.
   Last week, Lehman, as financial adviser to Freddie, recommended against
the transaction - saying the issue did not make economic sense for the
agency. The purpose of the offering was to free up capital that Freddie
could recycle back into the mortgage market.
   Bear Stearns Cos., which would underwriting the offering, continues to
lobby hard in favor of the transaction.
   Considerable dissension has developed among senior executives at the
mortgage agency about whether to go forward with the offering. The
principals involved will air their differences at a pivotal meeting that is
scheduled for this Wednesday.
   Michael May, a Freddie vice president for structured transactions,
predicted a final decision would be made within two weeks.
   As envisioned, the transaction would have involved  Freddie selling
subordinate tranches and retaining the senior notes.

Multi-Family Paper Blows Out

   Strong investor demand enabled Natwest Markets to rapidly sell $50
million in fixed-rate securities backed by debt on apartment complexes
owned by Southwest Property Trust Inc., a Dallas REIT.
   The two-class offering, priced June 3, was oversubscribed, forcing
Natwest to scale back individual allotments in order to give all investors
a piece of the pie.
   The senior $50 million class, rated double-A, was priced at par to yield
7.824%, or 110 basis points over the seven-year Treasury. The offering also
included an interest-only strip, which was sold to an unnamed investor.
   The spread on the senior notes was 20 basis points tighter than the
spread on Southwest Property's similar $50 million transaction last
December - a time when many more deals were competing for investors'
attention. But for the REIT, which initiated the transactions to finance
the acquisition of multi-family properties, tighter spreads were small
consolation for the higher yield it must pay: 7.82% versus 6.54% in
December.
   Both transactions grew out of a $100 million line of credit that Natwest
Markets provided to Southwest Property last year.
   The REIT tapped half of the credit line in November to finance the
acquisition of six properties. The REIT paid back the bridge loan with the
proceeds of the first securitization, which was backed by new mortgages on
13 apartment complexes in Texas, Oklahoma and Arizona.
   Southwest Property drew down the rest of the credit line over the past
few months to finance other acquisitions. That bridge financing was paid
off with proceeds of the latest securitization, which was backed by new
mortgages on 12 garden-style properties in Texas, one in New Mexico and one
in Arizona.
   The offering carried attractive prepayment protections for bondholders.
If the REIT prepays the mortgages, it will have to pay bondholders the
difference between the coupon on the securities and the prevailing Treasury
rate. The yield-maintenance agreement is designed to protect investors
against declining interest rates by compensating them for having to re-
invest their funds at lower yields. Under these provisions, bondholders
usually receive the difference between the coupon and a rate equal to the
Treasury yield plus an additional spread. In the Southwest Property deal,
however, investors will receive the difference between their coupon and the
flat Treasury rate, making the potential compensation greater than normal.
   The class A notes mature in February 2001, but are extendable for two
years. If the notes are extended, their coupon rate, currently 7.72%, will
be increased to either 9.43% or 375 basis points over the seven-year
Treasury, whichever is higher at the time.
   The two Southwest Property transactions were the first commercial MBS
deals handled by Natwest Markets, the New York investment banking arm of
London-based National Westminster Bank PLC.

DLJ Conduit Targets Hotels

   The conduit operated by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and Equitable
Real Estate Investment Management Inc. is expanding into the hotel sector.
   The team, which already originates and securitizes multi-family and
retail credits, plans to extend up to $1 billion of hotel loans nationwide.
   Equitable believes that the time is right to get back into the
rebounding hotel sector, which it pulled out of five years ago. This time
around the company will employ more conservative underwriting standards.
For instance, it will base lending decisions on the properties' historic,
rather than projected, income.
   Under the program, Equitable will identify borrowers through its
national network of investment offices. The loans will be originated by
Column Financial Inc., an Atlanta-based joint venture between the conduit
partners. DLJ will then securitize the mortgages. Equitable Real Estate and
DLJ are subsidiaries of Equitable Companies Inc.
   The conduit will originate non-recourse loans with 10- to 20-year terms
for all types of lodging properties. Loans will range from $2 million to
about $25 million, with interest rates that are 325 to 450 basis points
over Treasuries, depending on the debt-service coverage. A 1.75 DSC ratio
would merit a 325 bp spread. But a 1.40 ratio - considered more likely for
hotel properties - would result in a 350 to 400 bp spread.

Greystone Hires Daiwa Pros

   Greystone & Co., an investment banking boutique, has started a
commercial MBS unit, staffing it with three veterans from the disbanded
mortgage operation of Daiwa Securities America Inc.
   The unit will originate and buy commercial and multi-family mortgages,
and may also form an alliance with another mortgage originator. Greystone
has applied to become a broker/dealer so it can underwrite securitizations.
   The former Daiwa officials, who were hired in the past few weeks, are
David Goodwin, Mark Jarrell and Thomas Lally. Goodwin will review the
underwriting of mortgages, while Jarrell will structure deals and get them
rated. Lally will trade commercial MBS. The three executives had similar
jobs at Daiwa, which shut down its 35-member mortgage unit at the end of
March.
   Greystone also hired two other former Daiwa pros, who will concentrate
on residential mortgage securities. Wayne King will trade complex single-
family derivatives, such as interest-only strips, while Michael Gough will
trade both residential and commercial MBS.
   Until now, Greystone has focused mostly on advising on the restructuring
of tax-exempt issues that have defaulted. It has also invested in FHA-
insured multi-family mortgages and Ginnie Mae MBS backed by multi-family
properties.
   In February, the seven-year-old company, which is solely owned by
Stephen Rosenberg, moved its headquarters to New York from Atlanta to take
better advantage of the capital markets. The hirings boosted Greystone's
staffing to 15.

Nomura Places Warehouse Paper

   Surprising its skeptics, Nomura Securities International Inc. last week
fetched the price it wanted for $122.5 million in securities backed by
mini-warehouses.
   When Nomura started shopping the double-A notes for Shurgard Storage
Centers Inc., a Seattle REIT, it discussed pricing them at a spread of 120
basis points over seven-year Treasuries. Some investors said the
transaction, backed by a collateral type still relatively new to
securitization, would never get done at spreads of less than 130 bp.
   But in the end, Nomura was able to slightly better its initial target,
pricing the single-class offering at 102% of par value for a 115 bp spread.
The offering was helped by its strong bondholder protections and the
scarcity of new issues in the market. Still, it took Nomura several weeks
to privately place the notes.
   The deal will allow Shurgard to refinance debt on 86 properties.

THE GRAPEVINE

   Andrew Stone's two former lieutenants at Daiwa Securities America Inc.
are working on freelance deals. Gregory Jacobs and Paul Nidenberg are
advising mobile-home park owners, who are former Daiwa clients, on how to
raise $100 million through a collateralized offering. The duo hooked up the
borrowers with Merrill Lynch & Co., which could float the issue next month.
Three other ex-customers of Daiwa are also talking to the securitization
specialists about a similar mobile-home park financing. Jacobs and
Nidenberg left Daiwa in March, when the mortgage unit was shut down.
                               *   *   *
   Ocwen Financial Corp. and Eichler Fayne & Associates have parted ways on
their multi-family conduit arrangement. Unspecified differences of opinion
led to the split, although sources described the parting as amicable.
Eichler originated some $400 million in mortgages in the past year for the
conduit. The San Francisco firm will continue to originate loans for Fannie
Mae as one of the agency's delegated underwriters/servicers. It may also
team up in a conduit with another funding source. For its part, Ocwen,
which is based in West Palm Beach, Fla., will now rely entirely on its
thrift subsidiary, Berkeley Federal Bank & Trust FSB, to originate
mortgages on apartment complexes.
                               *   *   *
   CS First Boston Group is on track to securitize about $1 billion of
FDIC's performing commercial mortgages within six weeks. The deal will be
the agency's first - and probably only - attempt at securitizing commercial
loans. Goldman, Sachs & Co. and Lehman Brothers Inc. are co-managing the
offering. To maximize returns from the issue, the agency will provide a
partial guarantee on the issue's underlying collateral. The offering is
expected to involve $800 million to $1.25 billion of securities.
                               *   *   *
   Goldman, Sachs & Co. is arranging to swap $265 million in multi-family
mortgages for Fannie Mae securities. The deal is likely to be similar to
the transaction the Wall Street firm handled last December for the owner of
the Lincoln Towers co-op complex on Manhattan's West Side. In that deal,
GMAC Mortgage Corp. of Elkins, Pa., originated mortgages on eight buildings
in the complex. The mortgages were funded by Goldman and exchanged for
Fannie MBS. Goldman then packaged the securities in a $112.5 million
offering. The transaction fell under Fannie Mae's old swap program, in
which subordination was not required to protect the agency against defaults
on the underlying mortgages.
                               *   *   *
   Meanwhile, Fannie Mae is about two weeks away from finalizing its
guidelines for swap transactions by conduits. Look for the agency to be
tougher than expected on requirements for debt-service coverage. Agency
officials have decided to charge higher guarantee fees and demand more
subordination than originally planned for deals that are judged to have
border-line debt-service coverage.
                               *   *   *
   Smith Barney Inc.'s pending $130 million nursing-home deal will be
backed by debt on 44 properties owned by Integrated Health Services of Hunt
Valley, Md. The fixed-rate securities, rated by S&P and D&P, are expected
to come to market in four classes. The offering was originally planned for
this month, but Smith Barney pushed it back to July. Integrated's deal is
one of several that the investment bank has been working on for some time.

Debtor's Counsel Pleads Guilty to Bankruptcy Fraud

Bernard J. Berry, a California bankruptcy attorney, pleaded guilty on
Dec. 11 to two counts of bankruptcy fraud. According to U.S. Attorney
Nora M. Manella, Berry, in anticipation of filing a bankruptcy for his
client, transferred the client's business assets away from her business
knowing that the assets were collateral for an SBA loan. This action was
taken with intent of concealing the assets from representatives of the
SBA and the bankruptcy trustee.
"This is a particularly egregious case because it involves an attorney
who attempted to use his knowledge of bankruptcy proceedings to profit
at the expenses of the U.S. Government," said Steve Marica, assistant
inspector general for investigations at the SBA.
Berry is scheduled to be sentenced on March 8, 1995. He faces a maximum
sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $500,000.

Melvin Belli Files Chapter 11

Melvin Belli is one of the most well-known lawyers in the country. His
fame was such in the '60s that he actually appeared on an episode of the
TV series "Star Trek," as "Gorgon," a creature who made the  children of
one planet visited by the starship "Enterprise" murder their own
parents.
As a lawyer, he brought personal injury lawsuits to the public
consciousness and was a role model for many law students.
Now his firm has filed Chapter 11 and Belli has hired San Francisco
bankruptcy lawyer Penn Butler to represent him.
"There are two culprits," Belli said. "One is Dow Chemical who went into
bankruptcy and reneged on the $4 billion they had set up to pay [tort
claimants]. I had put out $5 million to $10 million for doctor's
reports, etc. The bank was going to lend us $45 million based on the Dow
Chemical settlement."
But when Dow went into bankruptcy, that loan disappeared and Belli found
himself cash poor.
"The second [culprit] is the $15 million [I had to pay my wife] in the
divorce," Belli said.
Belli said the Chapter 11 is merely buying "the finest personal injury
firm in the country" some time until everyone can be paid off in full.
"I have $50 million to $75 million in big cases coming in," he said.
"The oil case in Alaska, the Marcos case, the implants -- they're all
coming in toward the end of this year and over into the next year. But
we had some current creditors who wouldn't wait. It was impossible to do
anything but go into a Chapter 11."
Belli is now an outspoken convert of the bankruptcy system.
"People don't realize what Chapter 11 really is for," he said. "I have
changed my former opinion of that. I didn't know the difference between
Chapter 11 and ordinary bankruptcy. [Now I say], thank God that we've
got Chapter 11."

Lenders Worry That Consumers Cannot Afford Increased Debt

For the first time in history, consumers owe more than $1 trillion on
their non-mortgage installment credit. The outstanding balance on their
credit cards is approaching $400 billion. The most recent statistics
from the Federal Reserve show that total outstanding consumer revolving
credit was 19 percent higher through the end of October 1995 than it was
at the end of October 1994. According to RAM Research's Bankcard
Barometer, credit card delinquency rates increased from 3.89 percent
during the first quarter of 1995 to 4.33 percent during the fourth
quarter of the year.
All these numbers have the people who lent the money more than a little
nervous that debtors will be unable to pay their bills.
"1996 will be a year when we see higher delinquency and loan losses as
the consumer becomes more overextended," predicted John Kirby, senior
vice president in charge of consumer lending for SouthTrust Bank of
Alabama, N.A., in Birmingham, Ala. "Credit cards have been highly
solicited during 1995, leading to a suspicion that a larger number of
customers will have more credit card debt than their income provides."
Kirby explained that this explosion in credit card availability was the
result of several new lenders entering the market. In order to establish
loan volumes these new lenders were very aggressive in the solicitation
of business and often offered very low rates. Lenders who did not lower
their underwriting standards or rates in response to this competition
lost business to the new lenders. Many of those customers who left were
better credit risks than those who stayed. As a result, all lenders have
an increased risk of loss on consumer loans regardless of whether they
extended credit to borrowers that they might have previously rejected.
W. Doug King, executive vice president of Wachovia Corp. in Winston-
Salem, N.C., agreed that consumers will have increased difficulty paying
their bills during 1996 and saw it as a continuation of a trend that
began during 1995.
"Over the past several years consumers have taken on a great deal of
debt. The strained ability to service indebtedness through income, which
is not growing at a rapid pace, makes it very difficult for consumers to
address unexpected expenses," King said. "In the household environment
of two incomes where one or both consumers have lost jobs due to
downsizing, consolidations, or mergers, many have had to take lower
paying jobs, or are still unemployed. This situation has, of course,
significantly impacted the debt repayment ability of those affected
consumers.
King also noted that increases in the prime rate, which went from 6
percent to 9 percent in less than a year, significantly impacted the
ability of consumers with adjustable rate mortgages to finance their
other installment debt.
The ease of filing for bankruptcy is another reason why King expects to
see higher consumer loan losses during 1996. "Filing is simple and
inexpensive, there is no longer a social stigma attached to bankruptcy,
and the judicial system, in many cases, appears to be encouraging the
'fresh start' concept of bankruptcy."
While these factors would be conditions causing loan losses at any time,
the lending practices of credit card issuers have created a fragile
economic environment for consumers.
"The credit card industry has flooded the market with a variety of
credit card offers, most with tempting teaser rates. These offers have
encouraged some consumers to accept higher credit availability than can
be serviced with their income. In addition, the teaser rates quickly
expire resulting in higher debt service obligations."
Credit card issuers offering incentives for credit card use have added
to the problem of consumers taking on more debt than they can handle.
While there is nothing inherently wrong with consumers using credit
cards that offer rewards, "many consumers are being shocked at how
quickly miscellaneous purchases can add up," King said. "For example, in
some cases consumers, who have purchased groceries with credit cards,
are finding that they do not have the ability to pay off those purchases
upon receipt of the credit card statement, and actually wind up paying
for those groceries over an extended period of time."
And King sees the trend of increased consumer loan losses resulting from
lowered credit standards continuing beyond 1996.
"From a realistic standpoint, due to 1996 budgetary and earnings
pressures, the possibility of some banks lowering credit standards to
maintain growth and earnings may exist. In the event some banks in the
industry did lower credit standards consumer delinquencies and losses
would clearly move to even higher levels."
So, are lowered standards for issuing credit cards going to bankrupt the
lenders along with the borrowers? Probably not.
"The good news is that credit card debt is but one segment of the
consumer debt," said William E. MacDonald III, the president and CEO of
National City Bank, Cleveland, in Cleveland, Ohio, and the chairman of
the Consumer Bankers Association.
"To fairly assess consumer debt you must also include loans from home
equity and personal and revolving credit lines. If you look at the debt
service burden from a macro perspective, including both mortgage and
installment loan payments, the debt level numbers are not as alarming,"
MacDonald said.

5th Circuit Judges May Prohibit Chapter 13 Plans Calling for Direct
Payment of Creditors

Bankruptcy judges may deny confirmation of Chapter 13 plans that call
for the debtor to make payments directly to creditors, the Fifth Circuit
ruled in William C. and Julie C. Reid v. Michael Gross (In the Matter of
William C. and Julie C. Reid), No. 95-40249 (December 11, 1995). The per
curiam decision was not released for publication.
"We write briefly today only to emphasize that In re Foster, 670 F.2d
478 (5th Cir. 1982), stands clearly for the principle that the
bankruptcy court has broad discretion in determining whether a debtor
may act as disbursing agent in place of the trustee, thereby avoiding
the Chapter 13 trustee's fees," the court said. "Although Foster
recognizes that the debtor should have flexibility in formulating
Chapter 13 plans . . . we find no error in the bankruptcy court's
rejection of the proposed, amended plan, which, in this instance,
included a modification of First Bank and Trust's original loan to the
debtors."

U.S. Trustees Respond to Chapter 13 Guideline Criticism

The December 21st issue of Consumer Bankruptcy News included an article
entitled "EOUST Hears from Tennessee Legislators." This article also
appeared in Bankruptcy Court Decisions News & Comment, where it included
a note that bankruptcy judges had also written to the Executive Office
for U.S. Trustees to express concern with the proposed revisions to the
Chapter 13 Trustees' Handbook and the proposed ethical guidelines. In
response to the BCD version of the article we heard from Linda Ekstrom
Stanley, the U.S. Trustee for Region 17 (E.D. and N.D. Cal. and D.
Nev.), the chair of the Standing Trustee Subcommittee and Ellen B.
Vergos, U.S. Trustee for Region 8 (Ky. and Tenn.).
"As United States Trustees, and as members of the subcommittee who
participated in the drafting of proposed Standards of Conduct for
Standing Trustees and proposed Handbook Revisions, we are particularly
concerned that Chapter 13 administration be ethical, efficient and
economical for all who come in contact with the system.  This is a goal
of all those in the U.S. Trustee Program who have been involved with
these proposals.
"We feel it necessary to correct some misconceptions circulating about
the proposed standards and handbook revisions.  Many of these
misunderstandings were contained in your recent article entitled
'Legislators/Judges Worry about EOUST's Proposed Rules.'
"Your article quoted a letter from four members of Tennessee's
congressional delegation who expressed a concern that 'these new
regulations would negatively impair the effectiveness of the trustees,
and result in major financial losses to the creditors . . .' We submit
that if one reads the proposed standards and handbook revisions, one
will see that this expressed concern is misplaced.
"The proposals are divided into two portions: the first establishes five
ethical standards; the second gives guidance in incurring expenses and
in determining what is reasonable and necessary.  The standards are
those which ought to guide the fiduciaries in the administration of an
important trust.  The standards are, in part, to address abuses.  For
example, there have been instances where standing trustees have hired
and paid substantial salaries to family members for little or no work.
There have been trustee family members who have received excessive
compensation with benefits packages far exceeding those available for
comparable positions in the public and private sectors. Other cases
involve self-dealing by trustees who have charged trust operations sums
far above market rates or for often unnecessary expenses. These are of
serious concern.  Every dollar spent on unnecessary expenses comes out
of the pockets of the debtors.
"The 21 U.S. Trustees in the country are charged by law with the duty to
supervise the Chapter 13 trustees in their respective regions. 28 U.S.C.
Section 586(b). While the U.S. Trustees have and will continue to deal
with abuses on a case-by-case basis, the U.S. Trustees will be aided in
their supervision by definitive standards of which the standing trustee
has received advance notice about expected conduct. Written standards
will protect against claims of arbitrary or disparate treatment and, in
part, are a response to standing trustees' requests for written
direction.
"The U.S. Trustee Program is also obligated by law to review and approve
the budgets of each trustee operation.  This duty arises from 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 586(a)(1) which expressly limits the use of percentage fees to pay
for compensation and the actual, necessary expenses of the trustee.
"It is up to the 21 U.S. Trustees to act as 'watchdogs' over expenses
and to approve only those which meet the actual and necessary test.  The
proposed handbook revisions are to serve as a guide for the regional
U.S. Trustees in determining whether an expense of the Chapter 13
trustee in their respective regions is actual and necessary.
"The proposed standards and handbook revisions are not being offered as
an attempt to 'federalize' Chapter 13 trustees' operations, as
characterized by the Tennessee congressional delegation whose letter was
quoted in your article.  Rather, they are to serve as standards for
those in the system which will remain largely unchanged.
"Another misconception in your article is that 'the bankruptcy bench
closely monitors the operations of the trustees. . .' While the
bankruptcy courts adjudicate the issues which come before it in Chapter
13, it is the U.S. Trustee who is charged by law with monitoring the
budget and office operations.
"When the standing trustee system is examined, it is clear why Congress
felt that supervision and oversight were necessary.  The standing
trustee is a statutory fiduciary whose rights and responsibilities are
defined by statute as well as by the terms of the confirmed plan.  The
trustee receives payments from the debtor and holds them in trust to
distribute according to the terms of the confirmed plan or as otherwise
provided by law or court order.  To fund the standing trustee operation,
the standing trustee receives a percentage of all moneys received under
plans.  These fees are held in trust to pay for the collective cost of
administering all chapter 13 plans.
"By virtue of appointment by the U.S. Trustee, the standing trustee is
assigned to his or her caseload. The standing trustee's compensation and
office overhead are funded by the moneys paid by debtors through the
Chapter 13 plans.  Eighty percent of the standing trustees in the
country are paid maximum compensation of $122,816 in addition to having
all their overhead paid. The overhead and compensation are paid cut of
the funds paid in by the debtors and not by the trustees.  The standing
trustee is not subject to the vagaries of the marketplace, but receives
his or her salary and overhead by virtue of the number of case filings
in the district.  Many of these trustee operations are quite large.  For
example, in the Western  District of Tennessee, the three standing
trustees disbursed over $100,000,000 in fiscal year 1995.  Each year
approximately $2 billion flows through the standing trustee operations.
Clearly, Congress intended that the use of these fiduciary funds be
supervised.
"Your article suggested that 'letters from bankruptcy judges . . . have
argued in favor of keeping the system as it is.'  The fact is that many
bankruptcy judges have written.  Some favor the proposals, some want to
keep the system as it is, and others favor some proposals and argue
against others.  The comments are across the board.
"Finally, your article, quoting from the congressional letter, cites as
an example of increased cost, that the regulations would require that
the West Tennessee trustees' operations to be split into two distinct
office requiring the purchase of new equipment and the hiring of new
staff. The actual proposals as written, do not require the splitting,
but would prohibit a co-trustee operation to enhance accountability of
the individual trustee.  There are other more cost effective methods by
which the same result could be accomplished.
"The writer of your article suggested that there is a lack of meaningful
dialogue between the U.S. Trustees and the standing trustees which could
'harm the system.' In fact there has been extensive dialogue.  Comments
and suggestions concerning the proposals have been sought and obtained
from standing trustees, judges, creditors and others in the system.
Many U.S. Trustees have held meetings with the standing trustees in
their respective regions to obtain comment and input.  This month the
subcommittee met directly with a cross section of standing trustees from
throughout the country. Many useful suggestions and comments have been
gathered from this process.  The dialogue is ongoing and will be
considered in revising the standards and guidelines early next year.
Additionally, all written comments will be reviewed by the members of
the Director's Advisory Board in the next few weeks.  The Board is
comprised of bankruptcy judges and United States Trustees.  The Board
will also hear oral presentations from some of the commentators,
including representatives of the NACTT.
"If your readers would like to receive a copy of the proposals, write
Linda E. Stanley, 250 Montgomery Street, Suite 910, San Francisco,
California 94104, telephone 415-705-3333; or Sandra S. Coleman,
Assistant Director, Executive Office for United States Trustees, Suite
742, 901 E Building, 901 E Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20530,

Farmer Must Repay Over $1 Million in Fraudulent Bankruptcy

District Judge Neal B. Biggers Jr. has ordered Lawyer Wheeler Sr., a
Mississippi delta farmer to repay more than $1.1 million to the
Department of Agriculture and the Bank of Webb as a result of his
conviction on an elaborate bankruptcy fraud scheme.
Wheeler borrowed about $1 million from the Farmers Home Administration
and nearly $150,000 from the Bank of Webb for "farming," according to
the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Mississippi. He then
declared bankruptcy and obtained a discharge of both of the above debts
by concealing approximately $800,000 in assets and income, the U.S.
Attorney said. The scheme was discovered by the Agriculture Department's
Inspector General.
In addition to repaying his loans, Wheeler must pay a $10,000 fine and
serve a sentence of two years and 10 months in prison without parole
followed by three years of supervised release.
At the sentencing, Judge Biggers told Wheeler that he would not show
leniency to an individual who had willfully committed his crimes and
refused to admit his wrongdoing.

Eleven New Bankruptcy Judgeships Requested

If you're interested in applying for a bankruptcy judgeship, your job
prospects are looking brighter. Because of the recent rise in bankruptcy
filings, Chief Judge Paul A. Magnuson (D. Minn.), chair of the Judicial
Conference's Committee on the Administration of the Bankruptcy System,
recently requested 11 new bankruptcy judgeships.
"The bankruptcy courts have made great strides in the efficient
processing of cases," Judge Magnuson told the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law. "Despite our quest
for efficiency...we need additional bankruptcy judges to provide for the
proper administration of the bankruptcy system now."
The Bankruptcy Judgeship Act of 1995 (H.R. 2604), introduced in Nov. by
Rep. George W. Gekas, R-Pa., would establish four permanent bankruptcy
judgeships in the Central District of California and one permanent
bankruptcy judgeship in the District of Maryland.
One temporary bankruptcy judgeship would be created in each of the
following districts: the Southern District of Florida, the Eastern
District of Michigan, the District of New Jersey, the Eastern District
of New York, the Northern District of New York, and the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania.
While there currently are 326 authorized bankruptcy judgeships, the
number of filings increased 8 percent during the first three quarters of
1995 compared to the first three quarters of 1994 -- a pattern that is
expected to continue.
"We are struggling with an overburdened system," Judge Magnuson told the
subcommittee. "We are not asking our bankruptcy judges to do more -- we
are requiring it. We will continue to seek ways to improve the
bankruptcy system's efficiency, but we critically need these 11
additional bankruptcy judgeships."
Also testifying in support of the legislation was Judge William E.
Anderson (Bankr. W.D. Va.), chair of the Legislative Committee of the
National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges, and Chief Judge Paul Mannes
(Bankr. D. Md.).

Thirteen Things Attorneys And Judges Wish They Could Tell Each Other

Judges and attorneys alike wanted a copy of the lists Judge Margaret
Mahoney (Bankr. S.D. Ala.) used during her presentation at the annual
meeting of the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges (NCBJ). Her
program was entitled "Whose Case Is It, Anyway: The Escalating Battle
Over Case Management" and, with the permission of the NCBJ, we are
reprinting the two lists!
Note: Also on this panel were former bankruptcy judge R. Guy Cole of
Vorys, Sater, Seymour & Pease in Columbus, Ohio, Malcolm M. Gaynor of
Schwartz, Cooper, Greenberger & Krauss in Chicago, District Judge Samuel
B. Kent of the Southern District of Texas and David A. Lander of
Thompson & Mitchell in St. Louis, Mo.

Top 13 Things Attorneys Wish They Could Tell Judges

1. Be prepared. We thought that the reason attorneys were required to
write prehearing memoranda and clear, detailed moving papers was to
allow the judge to read them before trial.
2. Be open and flexible. Not every relief from stay case is the same.
3. Standardize your rules. Appearing in a new court should not be like a
game of Battleships where you spend all of your time worrying about the
hidden mines.
4. Don't take appeals so personally. You're not infallible.
5. Remember what it was like to be an attorney. You didn't always have
the perfect client or perfect case either.
6. Be humble -- even if you're perfect.
7. Be consistent. Consistency encourages settlements and eliminates
having to quote yourself as contrary authority.
8. Rule promptly. Even if you're wrong it keeps the case moving.
9. Don't publish so many opinions. West Publishing does not give a cash
award for most opinions published by a bankruptcy judge in one year.
10. Give everyone a chance to have his or her complete say -- unless the
case is being televised and will last longer than three months.
11. Be decisive. It's your job.
12. Be prompt -- or approve compensation for counsel waiting time.
13. Be willing to speak to bar associations and civic groups. Attorneys
and the public need to see that you have a mind and a heart.

Top 13 Things Judges Wish They Could Tell Attorneys

1. Be prepared. It works for the Scouts. It will work for you.
2. Be flexible. If a hearing takes an unexpected turn, don't keep going
straight ahead.
3. Be honest and candid. The attorney's license you save may be your
own.
4. Call and ask the judge's clerk about procedural issues if you are
unsure. It beats making dumb mistakes.
5. Don't ask for emergercy relief in every case. Your courthouse
nickname may become "Chicken Little."
6. Be humble -- even if you're perfect.
7. Know your client inside and out -- within professional limits of
course.
8. Be more organized. The judge needs all the help she can get.
9. Have a sense of humor. The law can be funny. The facts can be
hilarious.
10. Kill the court and opposing parties with courtesy and respect. If
you don't, the court may kill you.
11. Losing happens. Prepare yourself and your client for it.
12. Keep cross-examination short and to the point. Boring the judge is
rarely productive.
13. Know the law -- not just the facts before trial. Otherwise, you may
be proving up your opponent's case.

Do You Recognize Your Marketing Program?

By Sally J. Schmidt of Schmidt Marketing Inc. in Burnsville, Minn.
As I travel from law firm to law firm, I often am amazed at the
similarities in how marketing programs are organized or not organized.
In fact, some of the most common marketing structures are downright
dysfunctional.
Whether a firm makes its marketing decisions in one of the ways listed
below is sometimes related to how long the firm has been engaged in
marketing. In other cases, it is a result of the firm's culture and the
degree of individuality that it allows.
Since many of these structures actually can produce negative results,
poor use of resources, internal competition, ill-designed strategies and
potential conflicts, I would like to use a few borrowed clichis to point
out the characteristics of six faulty marketing programs, and the
problems they may create for you, your marketing director, or your firm.
Six Dysfunctional Marketing Programs
1. The Squeaky Wheel Marketing Program
Defining Characteristics: The lawyers who demand the marketing resources
get them.
Discussion: Without a marketing plan or firm-wide goals, decisions about
allocating marketing resources are made on the basis of demand. So it's
possible that the firm is spending money on lawyers who are ineffective
marketers, and activities that will not produce results.
Result: The firm is not working toward any common objectives, and
individual attorneys use firm resources to build their own practices and
potentially portable books of business.
2. The Flavor of the Month Marketing Program
Defining characteristics: Something more "sexy" or interesting always
comes along to capture the attention of the marketing effort.
Discussion: In these programs, the attention span of the marketing
director, marketing committee or marketing partner is relatively short,
and new ideas always receive immediate endorsement. One month it might
be a client survey, the next month a home page, and the next an image
advertising program, with no real commitment to any direction or
strategy.
Result: The firm engages in scattershot initiatives instead of building
a foundation and conducting the follow-up necessary to achieve real
marketing success.
3. The Monkey See, Monkey Do Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: The firm imitates the marketing efforts of its
competitors or other law firms in its market.
Discussion: I can't tell you the number of law firms that have decided
to undertake an activity because another firm is doing it. From hiring
marketing directors to writing newsletters, their strategies simply
reflect those that their competitors employ. My advice is, if another
firm has already cornered the market on an activity, your firm should do
something else; the innovator firm almost always receives the greatest
rewards.
Result: Since these firms do not take time to determine what they are
trying to accomplish (their objectives), and the best ways to achieve
these objectives, their marketing efforts are usually ineffective.
4. The Pass the Buck Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Something or someone else is always holding
things up in marketing.
Discussion: I think lawyers in this type of marketing organization would
have a hard time selecting just one response to this multiple choice
question:
"I cannot do [whatever I was supposed to do] because:
a. The management committee never responded to my memo
b. The marketing director never set up a meeting
c. The brochure is hopelessly out of date
d. My contact never called me back."
Result: No one ever takes the initiative or implements marketing ideas.
5. The Grass Is Always Greener Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Other law firms' clients are a lot more
attractive than the ones the firm already has.
Discussion: Usually the result of a poorly designed compensation system
proving too many incentives for origination or not enough for client
retention, this type of program encourages lawyers to pursue new
relationships, sometimes at the expense of existing ones. Taken to the
extreme, some lawyers refuse to work on matters for the client of a
colleague, or to introduce other lawyers into their own client
relationships.
Result: Lawyers are chasing new business while existing (hard-earned)
clients slip away.
6. The Every Man/Woman for Himself/Herself Marketing Program
Defining Characteristic: Everyone in the firm gets equal time and
resources for marketing.
Discussion: Obviously, not every lawyer has the same skills or
opportunities with respect to marketing. While everyone should be
encouraged, not everyone warrants the same resources. The internal
competitiveness and lack of coordination usually found in this marketing
structure can be apparent even to prospects and clients, who may see
lawyers from the same firm call on them on consecutive days or notice a
lack of internal communication. Working together undoubtedly sees
greater marketing success.
Result: The lawyers are not taking advantage of their collective
contracts and ideas, and may even be pursuing conflicting opportunities.
Conclusion
There are some firms whose primary goal is just getting the lawyers to
undertake marketing activities -- any lawyers and any activities. And
the last thing a firm should do is construct what the lawyers perceive
to be barriers to marketing, such as processes, controls or approvals.
Still without a better system for making decisions about marketing
strategies and resources, many law firms will find their levels of
activity and expenses going up appreciably without corresponding
results.

DEPRECIATION PROPOSALS ALARM UK COMPANIES

UK STANDARD setters will face concerted opposition from the brewing and
hotel industries to proposed accounting changes which could slash 10
percent or more from the pre-tax profits of both sectors.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) wants to impose a general
requirement for companies to depreciate the value of their properties.
Current rules enable them to avoid this on the grounds that the
properties are either increasing in value or being regularly maintained
or refurbished.

Shares in the brewing industry fell recently in anticipation of the
change, even though it would have no impact on a company's cash flow.

The proposals are contained in a new ASB discussion paper on
measurement of tangible assets, which the board expects to lead to a
new accounting standard. The paper argues that it is normally
"uneconomic" to provide a limitless extension to the life of a property
through maintenance or refurbishment.

The board also wants all companies to have their properties
independently revalued every five years. About 60 percent of companies
revalue operating properties. These values should also be kept up to
date, the board says.

"Under the present arrangements, companies that revalued their
properties in the late-1980s at the height of the property boom have
since been able to leave these valuations in their accounts unchanged,"
pointed out ASB chairman David Tweedie. One exception to the new rules
would be so-called "trophy" properties, assets of historical
significance which have an unlimited useful economic life and need not
be depreciated. This category might include stores such as Harrods,
prime site city hotels or 16th century coaching inns.

The possible impact of the proposals is shown in the table, supplied by
analysts UBS Global Research. Scenario 1 is conservative, assuming 25
percent residual asset value (being freehold land and remaining bricks
and mortar) and a 50-year depreciation charge. Scenario 2 is more
optimistic at 33 percent residual value, 100-year depreciation on
freeholds and 50 years on long leaseholds.

The board has recommended that investment properties should continue to
be excluded from depreciation (assumed in the table). UBS points out
that this will be particularly welcomed at certain companies such as
P&O and GUS, where investment properties form by far the greatest
proportion of their portfolio. However, the analysts also stress that
this exemption may eventually be lost under EU accounting plans.

Another bright spot for the companies, says UBS, is the paper's
apparent suggestion that an element of repairs and maintenance spend
may be capitalised and depreciated along with the asset.

The majority of this spend is currently written off immediately to P&L,
UBS points out. Therefore earnings benefits could come via deferral of
a part of the expense, potentially offsetting any additional
depreciation hit.

The proposals have been put out to consultation and a draft standard is
likely some time next year. According to an ASB spokesman, a final
standard is unlikely before 1998"at the earliest".

SHARE ACCOUNTING CRACKDOWN

NEW PROPOSALS aimed at tightening up accounting for employee share
ownership schemes have been published in the UK. The Accounting
Standards Board's Urgent Issues Task Force (UITF) wants to see the real
value of shares - not merely their nominal amount - charged to the
profit and loss account.

The new proposals would apply to Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTIPs) as
well as more long-standing types of scheme. LTIPs, a new type of
executive share scheme which links rewards to performance, have become
popular since the Greenbury Committee on executive pay recommended they
should replace existing executive schemes last year.

Companies' use of LTIPs is an ongoing source of controversy. A recent
study by corporate governance analysts Pension Investment Research
Consultants found a host of top UK plcs were breaching good practice
guidelines on their use (see TA 5913).

Under the new proposals, adjustments would be made to the profit and
loss account charge to take account of such factors as: changes in the
probability of performance criteria being met; conditional awards
lapsing; or purchases of shares at different prices (either to hedge
the cost of conditional awards or meet the cost of final awards).

In cases where options are granted at a discount (ie the exercise price
is below the market value of the shares at the date of grant), the UITF
said, the discount should be recognised as an expense over the
appropriate period. One example is SAYE schemes, where the exercise
price is normally at a 20 percent discount.

Executive share options schemes are unlikely to be affected by the
proposals, as Greenbury recommended that executive share options should
never be issued at a discount.

The proposals have been sent to finance directors of listed companies
for comments.

A deadline of November 7 was set for responses.

SCOTS SEEK GUIDANCE ON PRELIMS

THE INSTITUTE of Chartered Accountants of Scotland (ICAS) has called
for new guidance on compiling preliminary results announcements, after
a survey found that companies currently publish a wide variety of
information. ICAS also wants the figures to be audited.

The institute analysed the prelims of 20 top 500 companies and compared
them with the information contained in the annual report. To its
surprise, the study revealed not all companies included a profit and
loss account, balance sheet and cash flow statement in prelims as a
matter of course.

Every company published a P&L but one omitted a balance sheet and four
failed to include a cash flow statement. Inclusion of the statement of
total recognised gains and losses (8), the reconciliation of movements
in shareholders funds (9), and the historical cost profit and loss
statement were found to be still more variable.

Analysis of narrative content showed that all but one company in each
case included a chairman's statement and financial highlights. But only
11 and 10 respectively published a financial review or chief
executive's statement.

ICAS has called on the Accounting Standards Board (ASB) to develop a
non-mandatory statement of best practice to improve consistency.

The Scots also argue that the market would be better served if the data
were audited.

"Using audited information would result in the preliminary announcement
being an extract of the annual report which provides a consistent level
of information across all companies," said Graeme Bissett, convener of
the institute's Accounting Standards Committee.

At present, Stock Exchange rules stipulate that prelim figures must
have been "agreed" with the auditors. Bissett claimed this requirement
had been"intepreted differently by different companies".

The ASB is expected to review the subject of prelims soon and ICAS's
comments are the latest contribution to an expanding debate.

The Big Six firm KPMG recently argued that prelims could be materially
curtailed if they were largely replaced by the immediate filing of
audited statutory results (see TA 5914).

GOVERNANCE POLICIES SHOWN TO BE UNRELATED TO PROFITS

A NEW STUDY has failed to identify any link between good corporate
governance and improved financial performance in the vast majority of
leading European companies. Only in the UK was a "slight correlation"
detected.

The finding comes in a survey of European corporate governance by
Deminor, a Brussels-based consultancy which advises minority
shareholders. The widespread absence of such a link, the company
speculates, suggests the relationship between corporate governance and
financial performance could only be proved "in the medium-term". Large
American pension funds have established a link on the basis of much
larger statistical data, the report points out. This explains why a
growing number of Anglo-Saxon and other institutional investors
"explicitly take corporate governance standards into account when
investing in European companies", Deminor adds.

Overall, the UK was furthest advanced in the field, ahead of (in order)
France, Germany and Belgium. Holland was placed last among the five
countries surveyed. A large majority of Dutch companies, the report
says, employs fiduciary mechanisms and structures unknown elsewhere
which produce "serious and significant distortions between ownership
and control".

Deminor analysed how shareholders were treated in main stock indices of
each country - FT-30 (UK), CAC-40 (France), DAX (Germany), AEX
(Holland) and BEL-20 (Belgium). Publicly available information from a
total of 140 companies was surveyed, including annual reports and
companies' bye-laws.

Scores were awarded against a range of criteria, such as use of board
committees and quality of information to shareholders. Final rankings
were then compared with financial performance based on EPS/Stock Price
ratio.

In addition to the rankings, three other main conclusions emerged. Some
corporate governance issues are neglected everywhere; countries differ
widely on certain criteria; and there remains much room for
improvement.

Few corporations provided information on directors' independence and
the internal working of the board. On director's remuneration and the
issue of board committees, however, a clear divergence emerged.

British companies complying with the Greenbury Code reveal much about
how they pay directors. But in most other countries, with the exception
of a few French companies, shareholders are given only an aggregate
amount of total remuneration. Other countries have also been slower
than the UK (and to a lesser extent France) to respond to the idea of
establishing specialised committees for tasks such as directors'
remuneration and selection.

The UK, Germany and Belgium were found to be the only countries that
largely adhere to the "one-share - one vote" principle. In France and
Holland, shareholders holding multiple voting rights are more common.

In most countries, Deminor says, voting at general meetings and filing
resolutions remain a problem. "Cumbersome" deposit requirements and
problematic proxy voting are identified as two areas where improvements
are needed. Companies incorporated in special forms (eg Societes en
Commandites par Actions in France, Stichting Administatiekantoor in the
Netherlands)"are often used to seal off management from shareholders",
the study alleges.

Despite the wide disparities in performance, Deminor believes across-
the-board reform is inevitable.

BACKING FOUND FOR DERIVATIVES STATUS QUO

NEW EVIDENCE has emerged which will lend useful ammunition to opponents
of a planned overhaul of derivative accounting rules in the United
States. A survey of 139 organisations which use derivatives has found a
high-level of consistency in their accounting for the four main types
of derivative instruments (futures, forwards, swaps and options).

Over 90 percent of respondents match the accounting with the economics
of the transaction, by recognising the effects of the derivative
instrument at the same time as the hedged item. The survey, by KPMG
Peat Marwick, was released on October 11, the deadline date for
comments on derivatives accounting proposals issued in the summer by
the Financial Accounting Standards Board. FASB wants derivatives to be
carried on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities at fair value, a
suggestion which has sparked controversy (see TA 5911).

Overall, 96 percent of respondents require correlation between the
effects of the derivative and the hedged item, while 91 percent require
the derivative to be linked to specific assets or liabilities or
homogenous pools.

Some 99 percent of those surveyed reported that they require
derivatives instruments to be designated and documented as relating to
a particular risk management strategy in order to qualify for risk
management accounting.

The vast majority of organisations require a specific assessment of the
risks being managed for derivative instruments to qualify for special
treatment, though practice varied in the criteria used to define and
evaluate risk. Just 18 percent of respondents believed FASB's proposals
would be an improvement on present practice - though there was
recognition that modifications were needed.

"The survey results indicate the respondents utilise a similar
accounting framework," commented Ken Russell, a partner in KPMG Peat
Marwick's professional practice department."Guidance from the FASB is
needed to establish specific details of how the existing framework is
to be applied."

DIRECTORS' PAY RETREAT BY AUSTRALIAN UIG

THE AUSTRALIAN Urgent Issues Group (UIG) has shied away from the issue
of forcing companies to decide how much of a director's pay is linked
to performance.

After several meetings considering the issue, UIG said in a statement
that the subject should be addressed through a full review of
disclosure requirements - something UIG made clear is beyond its remit.

`BLACK HOLE' FEARS PROMPT MD&A PLEA

THE AUSTRALIAN Society of CPAs says Australian companies should be
required to include management discussion and analysis (MD&A)-style
statements in their annual reports.

Potential investors are "faced with a black hole" when it comes to
obtaining a meaningful assessment of Australian businesss performance
or prospects, claimed ASCPA national president Professor Scott
Henderson.

Little known in Australia, but employed extensively in the US and the
UK, MD&A-type reports require company directors to explain current
results and comment on future performance.

"A handful of companies in Australia provide MD&A narratives, chiefly
subsidiaries of US companies and those listed on overseas exchanges.
But there is a long way to go before the practice becomes a standard
feature of good corporate governance," Henderson added.

CADBURY COMPLIANCE CONTINUES TO CLIMB

COMPLIANCE WITH the Cadbury Code on corporate governance increased in
1995, according to a survey of 100 top UK-listed companies. The study,
by Coopers & Lybrand, found that compliance among FT 100 companies has
reached 97 percent.

The main area of non-compliance is the code's recommendation of
appointing at least three non-executives. Among smaller listed
companies, 27 percent failed to adhere to this principle.

Elsewhere, the survey comments on the recommendation that directors
should report on the effectiveness of their systems of internal
financial control. This has focused the attention of boards on this
subject in a way that has never happened before, it says. However,
descriptions of internal financial control were found to vary in length
and quality, with better companies giving tangible examples of steps
taken.

Unsurprisingly, few companies are willing to indicate where there may
be weaknesses. And only a "handful" gave opinions on the effectiveness
of internal control systems.

BITTER PILL FOR SUGAR ON PLAYERS' TRANSFERS

ONE OF English soccer's top club owners has urged the industry to write
off player values over the life of their contracts to reflect the
impact of a European Court ruling expected to decimate the money-
spinning transfer system.

Alan Sugar, who owns 40 percent of Tottenham Hotspur, made the plea as
he announced a one-off player write-down of #7.29 million ($11 million)
that has sharply cut the club's profits. Under the so-called Bosman
ruling, clubs can no longer demand a fee for out-of-contract players
seeking to move between clubs in the European Community (see CA 5913).
The adjustment reflects Tottenham's assessment of the diminution of
player values this may cause.

The move reduced the club's net assets from #37.4 million to #25.3
million.

Tottenham was the only club in England's top division to capitalise
player values in 1994/95. The write-down reflects its decision to begin
amortising to residual values of zero.

Newcastle United, which valued players at #10.9 million in its 1993/94
accounts, reacted to Bosman by taking players off the balance sheet
altogether.

CHARITY GOVERNANCE LAPSES DISCOVERED

UK CHARITIES urgently need to improve key aspects of their financial
management in the wake of the Cadbury report, new evidence suggests.

A study of the financial governance of 18 charities by Birmingham
Business School found that few have independent audit committees
consisting of non-executives. Those which do rarely exclude executive
trustees and often include paid executives.

The authors, professors Trevor Gambling and Rowan Jones, ask whether
all charities should have an audit committee. They suggest such a
committee could meet a minimum of twice a year with only the external
auditor and non-executive trustees in attendance.

The report, sponsored by the Chartered Institute of Management
Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales and the Charities Aid Foundation, raises a number of issues.

Not one of the charities surveyed had a coherent policy on the
accumulation and disposal of reserves. Large proportions or even
multiples of annual expenditure are being either "taken out of thin
air" or small surpluses are squirreled away "against a rainy day".

The report asks if charities should spend the whole of their income
every year, subject to making provision for long-term liabilities and
properly calculated future reserves.

New arrangements for financial reporting by charities in England and
Wales came into force this year. These include a statutory requirement
for the financial statements of unincorporated charities, as well as
charities constituted as companies, to be audited by registered
auditors.

The new arrangements also impose a duty on charities' auditors to
report certain matters which may be found in the course of their work
to the watchdog Charity Commission. In October, the Auditing Practices
Board issued new guidance on the audit of charities which takes the new
requirements into account.

DATA SHORTFALL HIGHLIGHTED FOR ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVES

DERIVATIVES DISCLOSURES by UK companies do not generate enough
information for analysts and fail to meet "best practice" guidelines
laid down by the Accounting Standards Board. So concludes a new survey
by Edinburgh accounts monitor, Company Reporting.

The study found that those companies which include derivatives in their
accounts do so at nominal value. "From this measure alone an analyst
would find it very hard to formulate an idea of value and risk," the
survey concludes.

The ASB published new proposals on the disclosure and measurement of
financial instruments in the summer (see TA 5912). They contain interim
recommendations designed to improve current practice until new
standards appear.

The ASB's long-term aim of current valuation was used by only 5 percent
of relevant companies analysed."It is clear that present practice is
some distance from the ASB's `best practice' specifically in terms of
current value and risk measurement," the report concludes.

LIFE INSURANCE STANDARDS ARE OVERHAULED

A NEW series of actuarial standards will help investors and analysts
compare the results of Australian life insurance companies.

The first standard, released in mid-October, will force life companies
to revamp the way they calculate profits and their obligations to
policy holders.

Actuarial Standard 1.01 on Valuation of Policy Liabilities, produced by
the Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board (LIASB), overlaps with a
draft accounting standard released by the Australian Accounting
Standards Board (AASB) in August. But AS 1.01 differs in certain
details, in particular on how to calculate profit margins from life
policies.

When the AASB released its own draft standard, ED 73, some of the
details on the calculations - known as "premium splitting" - had not
been finalised and are not expected to be finalised for another three
years.

LIASB chairman Peter Vinson said the differences between the actuarial
and the accounting standard were at the"third level of detail". The
LIASB approach was the result of almost a decade of discussions in
which he had been involved, he added.

Vinson hopes the AASB's approach will eventually dovetail with the
LIASB's. He believed it is still quite possible for both sides to
adjust their version of how profits should be treated so they ensure
they eventually agree.

There had not been sufficient time to ensure the two standards were
identical where they overlapped, he stressed, as the LIASB had been
required to produce a standard to take effect from December 31 this
year.

The new actuarial standard requires profits from a life policy to be
recognised over the duration of the policy - rather than be brought to
account when the policy is signed or be recognised in any other way the
life group chooses. Practices have hitherto varied widely.

Known as the Margin on Services (MoS) approach, the method ensures that
the life groups can only declare profits as they actually deliver the
associated services, and those services are paid for by client
premiums.

The actuarial standard also sets out the method for calculating how
much money the life company is required to pay out on a policy - its
obligations to the policy holder - and requires that liability to be
shown on the books.

Vinson said the new standard allowed the performances of life groups to
be compared for the first time. The new standardised approach to
financial reporting would assist the anticipated future public floats
of several major life companies and add another measure of
competitiveness within the industry, he added.

Actuarial standards have the status of law in the same way as
accounting standards and actuaries will soon have to deal with a
succession of them. AS 1.01 will soon be followed by standards dealing
with solvency and capital adequacy.

BUTTE SPARED GROUND-BREAKING COURT ACTION

AN ELEVENTH-HOUR climb-down by the directors of listed excavation group
Butte Mining has spared the company the dubious honour of being the
first to be sued by UK accounting watchdog the Financial Reporting
Review Panel (FRRP).

Butte has reluctantly agreed to make a revision to its accounts for the
year to June 1995, turning a profit of #339,000 ($530,000) into a loss
of #628,000.

Formed in 1990, the panel has never yet used its ultimate sanction of
court action to force companies into line with accounting rules. But it
appears to have come close on this occasion.

"In view of [the directors'] undertaking, the panel has refrained from
undertaking proceedings under section 245B of the Companies Act 1985,"
the panel said in a statement. Butte responded by saying it was "not in
the interests of the shareholders to pursue this matter any further".

The affair concerns accounting for shares in mining company Gem River
Corporation. A Butte spokesman said the company had received a
"considerable sum" in shares in return for organising an exploration
programme for Gem River in Montana and helping to float the company.

Some shares were sold immediately on the Alberta Stock Exchange, but 70
percent were "escrowed" and could not be traded immediately because the
programme's success could not be guaranteed.

Despite this, Butte realised the escrowed shares as profits in its 1995
accounts. The panel maintained that profit should only have been
included on the shareholding that had been realised at the time the
accounts were completed.

"We knew exactly what was there and believed profit realisation was
reasonably certain," the Butte spokesman said. He also complained it
had taken "some considerable time" for Butte to get a "clear opinion"
from the panel on what the treatment should be.

The revision has led to a downward adjustment in 1995 profits of
#967,000. The spokesman refused to speculate on whether the profit
would be realised in 1996. Butte Mining, which collapsed in 1991 and is
now a litigation vehicle only, is no stranger to controversy. A number
of the company's original directors were later charged with conspiracy
to defraud. And in June this year the High Court threw out a #110
million-law suit which Butte brought against the Big Six firm Ernst &
Young.

Butte claimed E&Y predecessor firm Arthur Young had given negligent
advice when it was reporting accountant on Butte's 1987 flotation and
in connection with the company's acquisition of North Butte Mining in
1988. The company had unsuccessfully tried to pursue the case earlier
in the US state of Montana. But the suit was dismissed in 1995 when the
Montana District Court determined it had no jurisdiction to hear the
case.

Butte resurrected the claim in the UK in the form of a counterclaim to
an E&Y writ for unpaid fees. As well as claiming #110 million which the
company claimed its shareholders had lost as a result of the firm's
negligence, the company's new management claimed an extra #110 million
in what Butte calculated was the interest accrued on the damages.
However, Mr Justice Lightman ruled it was not"just or appropriate" for
Butte to be allowed to resurrect the claim.

GERMAN GOVERNANCE SHAKE-UP SET FOR 1998

GERMANY HAS moved one step closer to the reform of corporate governance
with a set of proposed changes which may become law in 1998.

A parliamentary committee headed by the ministers of justice and
economics wants stricter controls on statutory audits and heavier
responsibilities for supervisory board members at German companies. The
proposals stop short of any radical change, however, and may well be
diluted before they are presented to parliament.

On statutory audits, the committee's report is a summary of ideas which
have already gained broad acceptance with German corporations and are
welcomed by the accounting profession.

In future, the statutory auditor of a German company will be appointed
by the supervisory board rather than the board of managing directors.
That means the auditor's independence need not be reconciled with
business interests.

"It doesn't make sense for the management under scrutiny to decide what
aspects of the business should be audited," said a source at the
justice ministry in Bonn.

In addition, every member of the supervisory board will have the right
to an advance copy of the auditor's report and the auditor will be
obliged by law to attend the supervisory board meeting on the year-end
accounts. Big Six firms in Germany say they already do both
voluntarily.

According to the justice ministry, the committee is also considering
ways to make the auditor's certificate more detailed and meaningful.

The stock phrases of unqualified approval still used by practically all
auditors, including the Big Six firms, include neither comment nor
analysis. But no detailed suggestions will be made until discussions
have taken place with accounting profession lobbyists.

Other reforms show that the committee's approach is essentially
conservative. An official petition against the supervisory board will
still have to be backed by 5 percent of voting capital, compared with
10 percent before. "We don't want the supervisory board to be
undermined by gratuitous petitions," is the view from the justice
ministry.

The committee has also refused to bow to public opinion by reducing the
maximum number of supervisory board positions any individual may hold.
"It's very difficult to set fixed limits," said the justice ministry
source."It depends on the person's intellectual powers. For some
people, even one board position would be too many."

Only one of the proposals is not already standard in countries with
reformed systems of corporate governance. This is that banks which hold
a shareholding of more than 5 percent in a listed company may no longer
exercise their custody clients' voting rights in that company as well.

Even institutional investors in Germany typically allow their custodian
bank to decide how to use their voting rights, often giving the banks
an additional voting strength of several percent. This additional
voting power makes the banks even more powerful, say critics of the
current system.

But the government is concerned about the implications. It does not
want shareholder representation at companies' annual meetings to
decline, but knows it is unrealistic to expect all investors to do
their own voting, even by post.

One solution suggested by the justice ministry is to give an individual
executive responsibility for avoiding any conflicts of interest between
the bank's voting rights and those of its customers. From the banks
comes a suggestion to set up independent voting companies to handle
voting for custody clients.

None of these changes will occur quickly. After lobbying, the draft law
is expected to go to Helmut Kohl's cabinet at the beginning of next
year and will reach parliament a year later -at the earliest.

ASB PRODUCES `GENUINE' CASH FLOW STANDARD

UK COMPANIES will soon become the first in the world to produce "pure"
cash flow statements.

The Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has revised FRS 1, the cash flow
standard issued in 1991. Its aim is to improve communication of
information on liquidity, insolvency and financial adaptability.

The original FRS 1 brought the UK in line with international practice
by scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of
a cash flow statement. But its practical use convinced the board
further changes were needed.

Under the 1991 standard, the cash flow statement reported movements in
cash and cash equivalents (investments with maturities of up to three
months). But, because treasury management practices differ, the ASB
grew concerned that this may give rise to uncertainty about the
investments to be included as cash equivalents.

Under the revised version, only movements in actual cash (defined as
cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts) will be
shown as cash flows.

Proposals for reform of FRS 1 published last December in exposure draft
FRED 10 have survived with only minor refinements. Other main changes
include a new section providing expanded disclosures on the management
of liquid resources.

The orders and headings for cash flows have been changed to bring them
into line with those used in directors' commentaries (eg the operating
and financial review).

The cash flow statement has also been tied in more closely with the
balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flow on the widely used
financial indicator, net debt.

Cash inflows and outflows may now be shown net in certain restricted
conditions, for example, if they relate to a constantly renewed short-
term facility or a commercial paper programme.

The revised FRS1 becomes mandatory on March 23 next year.

As The Corporate Accountant went to press, the International Accounting
Standards Committee published proposals on accounting for pensions and
employee benefits which are out of step with current UK practice.

Exposure draft E54 recommends valuations of future benefit obligations
at each balance-sheet date (not every three years as is standard in the
UK). The draft says these should reflect market conditions at the year
end, in contrast with the UK practice of using longer term actuarial
estimates.

ANDERSEN REJECTS BLAME FOR WICKES

Big Six star performer Arthur Andersen is adamant it could not have
done any more to thwart a multi-million accounting cover-up at UK DIY
retailer Wickes. Paul Rogerson reports

ARTHUR ANDERSEN is refusing to accept any blame for failing to spot
accounting errors which led audit client Wickes, the DIY chain, to
overstate profits by #51 million ($80 million).

The firm responded defiantly to a letter to shareholders, despatched by
the company on October 16, which claimed Andersen "should have reacted
more effectively" to "warning signals" of false accounting.

"We were the victims of every auditor's nightmare - a skilfully
executed, collusive fraud which deceived everybody," risk management
partner Chris Nunn said.

The incident has once again focused attention on how much
responsibility auditors should bear for detecting deliberate deception.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is
conducting a campaign to alert firms to the threat of fraud in an
environment where financial scandals are increasingly likely to trigger
"deep-pocket" negligence claims (see TA 5913).

In this case Andersen appears to have escaped a lawsuit. After
consulting with its lawyers Wickes has decided to take no action. But
the company has reserved the right to do so "in the event that further
matters emerge".

Wickes shares have been suspended on the London Stock Exchange since
June, when it was first announced problems had been found in the timing
of the recognition of profits from suppliers' rebate schemes.

The irregularities resulted from discrepancies between the supply
contracts reported to senior management and those actually negotiated
by buying staff.

Under arrangements which are common in the retail industry, Wickes and
its suppliers negotiated incentive arrangements under which the chain
would be rewarded for achieving target levels of sales of particular
products with either a discount or a rebate.

It also took up-front payments from suppliers for marketing costs or in
return for shelf-space, often tied to a pledge to achieve a certain
volume of sales.

The letter to shareholders, from new chairman Michael von Brentano,
follows an investigation into the company's accounts by Price
Waterhouse and lawyers Linklaters & Paines.

The probe has confirmed there was "serious mismanagement" in certain
Wickes operations. Problems were centred on the company's buying
department, where investigators found "deliberate misrepresentation" of
certain deals with suppliers.

The rebates and contributions which senior management required the
department to obtain ran into tens of millions of pounds. They amounted
to #13 million in 1993 and rose to #30 million in 1994 and #57 million
in 1995.

In many cases these sums were booked as profit in the year the deals
were signed rather than spread over the period of the supply
agreements, the investigation found.

In some instances the rebates booked to profit were not actually
receivable or Wickes was required to meet unrealistic volume targets.
Some deals were also found to be uncommercial.

As a result of the deception, the group's 1994 and 1995 accounts
included significant levels of rebates and contributions which had not
been earned. The necessary adjustments announced by von Brentano have
slashed Wickes's consolidated shareholders' funds by #51 million.

The probe found' that "ultimate responsibility" for the debacle must be
borne by former chairman and chief executive Henry Sweetbaum. The
investigators found no evidence that he or any other directors were
aware of the deception.

But Sweetbaum and a number of other individuals agreed to repay
substantial sums in profit-linked bonuses. Wickes has agreed to take no
further action against them.

Andersen approved an accounting policy for supplier rebates and
contributions, but the "underlying substance of many deals did not
accord with it", the report said. Instances came to light in 1995 of
amounts being booked to profit earlier than was justified.

"The board believes that senior management and the auditors should have
reacted more effectively to these warning signals. These matters were
not brought to the attention of the Audit Committee, which was assured
by senior management and by Arthur Andersen that the rebates and the
contributions were shown properly in the group accounts."

Andersen is to resign as auditor when work on restating the 1995
accounts is finished but Nunn was adamant the firm could not reasonably
have been expected to do any more to uncover the deception. He pointed
to the letter's concession that "false or misleading documents produced
to the auditors misdescribed the nature of suppliers' payments and
concealed the true position. "Third party confirmations are the highest
quality verifications an auditor can receive," said Nunn.

If they are falsified, the auditor has little chance to discover what's
going on until the amounts become too big to conceal."

Under UK auditing standard SAS 110, auditors must plan and conduct
audit work to have a reasonable expectation of detecting a material
misstatement in the accounts caused by fraud.

"In 1995 the work that was done confirmed to the best of the evidence
available that there were no hidden agendas or conditionalities
attached to the supplier rebates," said Nunn.

"Even now, having focused on what we might have done differently, one
has to say the answer is `very little'. If every report points in a
certain direction it is difficult for auditors simply to say `you're
lying'. It will always be the case where one is fighting this kind of
thing, one cannot be 100 percent certain of detecting it."

It is reported that neither the UK's Serious Fraud Office nor the
Department of Trade and Industry is likely to take further action.
A"thorough review" of the group's controls and procedures is now under
way.

Disciplinary action has been taken against two ex-directors with
responsibility for the buying department and more is planned against
certain middle-ranking executives and junior employees.

NOT SUCH GREAT EXPECTATIONS

The Hampel committee on corporate governance is proceeding with
extreme caution. Paul Rogerson reports

IT WOULD be folly to expect anything too radical from the committee on
corporate governance led by Ronald Hampel. Or so it would seem, judging
by a recent speech by the ICI chairman to a conference attended by 100
senior figures from business, academia and the accounting profession.

Hampel rarely speculated on how his body might "carry the torch" handed
to it by the Cadbury and Greenbury bodies on corporate governance and
executive pay (respectively). Instead, he focused on what he viewed as
the damaging fall-out of the high profile lately attained by these
subjects in the UK. A "visitor from Mars" would believe that "a new
industry" had developed in corporate governance, said Hampel. It was
quite worrying, he said, that this had been attended "almost by
hysteria". In reviewing the landmark Cadbury code for listed companies,
his group seeks to provide an environment in which business can prosper
and grow, Hampel said.

"That is a fundamental behind all our deliberations. We must not
stifle, we must stimulate," he said. Responding to a question, Hampel
denied that the Cadbury code is stifling business. But the furore that
has grown up around corporate governance had "denigrated industry" he
alleged.

The Greenbury recommendations on executive pay were squarely in his
sights. "All the public debate has been about boardroom excesses and
99.9 percent of business has been dragged down with it. It needs to be
said all the time that business must prosper."

The Hampel committee has sponsored research into Cadbury and Greenbury.
However, Hampel said it would only have two sets of annual reports on
which to comment on the latter, so it would be "dangerous to be too
prescriptive".

The conference, at the London headquarters of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales on November 1, coincided
with the launch of a vast consultation exercise by Hampel. The
committee is seeking feedback from a wide range of bodies, including
some in Europe and North America, on different aspects of its remit.
The most important questions to which it is seeking answers are
paraphrased below. When responses have been assessed, Hampel aims to
issue a draft report in the middle of next year "to see if people think
our conclusions are appropriate". A final report will follow at the end
of 1997.

Given the political context of Hampel's deliberations, the subject of
corporate governance will continue to generate controversy. The
conference coincided with the publication of a report to the committee
by employer's body, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). The
CBI explicitly rejects the concept favoured by the opposition Labour
Party that "stakeholders" such as employees, customers and suppliers
should be represented in boardrooms. The interest of shareholders
should continue to be paramount, it says, dismissing the idea these
interests could be accommodated in German-style two-tier boards.

Hampel may have set a laissez-faire tone for the conference, but it was
not adopted by every speaker. Anne Simpson, joint managing director of
governance consultancy Pension Investment Research Consultants, had "no
sympathy" for those who think companies are over-regulated.
Shareholders are beginning to turn up at AGMs "to ask questions and not
just eat the sandwiches", she said.

Simpson demanded an end to the rubber-stamping of management decisions
in votes and the end of discretionary voting. Increasing shareholder
activity has led some companies to try and rewrite the rules, she
added. They included British Aerospace, which moved to get rid of
the"crucial" shareholders vote on its annual report and accounts.
Ronald Hampel is a non-executive director of British Aerospace.

GERMANY:  DOUBLE BOOK-KEEPING FOR DAIMLER AS REGULATORS REFUSE US GAAP

GERMANY'S BIGGEST industrial company, Daimler-Benz, has failed to
persuade domestic accounting regulators that they should accept its US
GAAP accounts. The result is that Daimler will have to continue
publishing earnings calculated in accordance with Germany's commercial
code alongside its US GAAP results.

The Justice Ministry's decision has serious implications for Deutsche
Telekom, which will face the same double book-keeping difficulties as
Daimler next year when its shares are listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.

Jurgen Funck, state secretary at the Justice Ministry, indicated early
in 1995 that a concession could be granted from the requirement to
publish group accounts that comply with German reporting standards
provided enough companies wanted to avail of it.

In recent weeks, however, the ministry indicated several times that
opponents of the reform had gained the upper hand. Now Herbert Biener,
head of accounting standards at the ministry, has made clear that the
proposed reform has been defeated."We're not going to make this change
just for the sake of two or three companies," he said.

First proposed in March 1995, the proposed concession would have
extricated Daimler-Benz from the double-accounting dilemma it has faced
since its shares were first listed in New York in 1993. Since then,
Daimler has been obliged to produce group accounts under both US GAAP
and the German commercial code and has come up with earnings figures
which are sometimes poles apart.

Led by Bayer and Schering, the opponents of reform were clearly
unwilling to assist Daimler-Benz and Deutsche Telekom in their quest
for foreign capital by agreeing that their US GAAP consolidated
accounts could be also acceptable for domestic regulatory purposes.
They believe that, rather than US GAAP, international accounting
standards (IASs) should become the benchmark for German companies
seeking to raise capital abroad.

While Biener believes that corporations and their accountants should
voluntarily adopt whatever reporting requirements are demanded by
overseas capital markets, he makes no bones about his preference for
IASs. Speaking at a recent accounting conference in Gottingen, Biener
repeatedly criticised Daimler's technique of double-accounting and the
fact that it can produce contradictory results.

IASC secretary-general Bryan Carsberg, who also spoke at the
conference, welcomed the Germans' support for IASs. But he acknowledged
the serious dilemma facing companies which will need a listing on the
New York Stock Exchange before IASs are endorsed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission - which will not happen until 1999 at the earliest.

Carsberg said that companies in that position would have no choice but
to produce US GAAP accounts, but he hoped that they would use options
most comparable with IAS so that it would be easy to change again to
IASs after 1999. Karel van Hulle, head of accounting at the European
Commission, said it is doubtful that companies would want to return to
IASs after adopting US GAAP standards, simply because of the upheaval
involved.

It remains to be seen how Daimler will respond, now that the company
faces the prospect of having to produce a US GAAP reconciliation for at
least the next four years.

UNITED KINGDOM:  ASB ANNOUNCES REVISION OF CASH FLOW STANDARD

THE UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) has announced proposals to
revise FRS 1, the standard it issued in September 1991 on cash flow
statements. The proposals are contained in exposure draft FRED 10 which
the standard-setter issued on December 7.

Although FRS 1 brought the UK into line with international practice by
scrapping the source and application of funds statement in favour of a
cash flow statement, ASB chairman David Tweedie acknowledged that the
time has come for more improvement.

"The cash flow statement introduced by FRS 1 itself broke new ground
and has proved both popular and valuable," Tweedie said. "We have now
gained sufficient experience in its practical use to be able to propose
significant improvements."

FRED 10's main features include a proposal to switch to a "pure" cash
flow statement, with the concept of cash equivalents being dropped. The
exposure draft also proposes that expanded disclosures be provided in a
new section dealing with the management of liquid resources. FRED 10
would change the order and headings for cash flow to bring them into
line with those used by directors in their commentaries on operations
and finances. It would also tie the cash flow statement more closely
into the balance sheet by focusing on the effect of cash flows on the
widely-used financial indicator, net debt.

"Our aim has been to make the cash flow statement simpler to understand
and more descriptive of the way business is conducted," Tweedie said.
"The board believes that the changes represent a significant step
forward, and will be of real benefit to preparers and users of
accounts. Not least of the improvements is the move to pure cash flow
statements."

Comments of the new exposure draft should be sent to the ASB before
March 8.

SMALL COMPANIES ACCOUNTING STANDARD

Separately, a "draft" exposure draft was published in December on
proposals that would abolish the requirement to comply with the ASB's
standards for 90 percent of UK companies.

The proposed standard, Financial Reporting Standard for Smaller
Enterprises, was published by the Working Party on Big GAAP/Little GAAP
and would affect 900,000 companies.

A key feature of the proposed standard is that small companies should
have a special reporting code of their own which would be much shorter
and less complex than the existing body of accounting standards.

It would apply to all companies currently defined as small by company
law - broadly those with a turnover of less than #2.8 million ($4.3
million). The working party expects to be able to link the proposed
standard with auditing rules, allowing the audit report to use the
words"true and fair . . . as applicable to small companies".

If the proposals find support, the aim is to pass the paper to the ASB
which has the power to turn the draft into a standard after the usual
process of seeking comments on an exposure draft. Comments should be
returned to the working party by March 29.

UNITED STATES:  70% OF BANK SECURITIES MAY NOW BE RECLASSIFIED

A RECENT decision by the US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
was expected to produce a major shift in bank securities portfolios by
the end of 1995. As many as 70 percent of securities could be
reclassified as "available for sale" as bankers seek to maintain
funding flexibility under the new rule, which is an effort to give
investors a more accurate picture of a bank's worth.

In November, FASB decided to allow banks to move securities from "held
to maturity" to"available for sale" before the end of the year. The one-
time adjustments can be accomplished without forcing the institution to
revalue all of the securities in its held-to-maturity category.

The action already is having an effect. For instance, the First State
Bank of Texas in Denton will use the new rule to make a larger share of
its securities available for sale, probably at a 70-30 split compared
with the previous even split between the two accounts. The 70-30 split
is expected to become common among banks large and small by the end of
the year.

FASB is moving toward making banks mark more of their assets to market
values. FASB has also formally issued a draft of a proposed rule
eliminating some of the advantages of securitisations and long-term
repurchase agreements. Under the proposal, a securitised borrowing that
extends over 90 days will be treated as a purchase and sale (see
report, p8).

It is all part of a continual, incremental effort to put more of the
balance sheet under mark-to-market rules. Some analysts expect the
board to consider marking liabilities to market sometime next year.

ACCOUNTANTS GIVEN ULTIMATUM ON SELF-REGULATION

THE GERMAN Government has served notice on the country's auditors that
they must improve self-regulation to avoid having practice rules
imposed on the profession by law.

Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingen
in early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting policy at
the Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputy
chairman of the professional body of German accountants, the Institut
der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).

Biener took issue with the profession's new quality standards,
introduced just a few days earlier (CAI 64). Even under the new rules,
he said, German accountants would still not be obliged to actively seek
out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts.

"The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said.
"Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The law
allows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obliged
to argue things out with the company."

Biener also criticised the IdW for its delay in dealing with
shortcomings in the 1994 switch by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger
Zements to international accounting standards. Gross countered that it
was not feasible for the IdW's main practice committee to intervene at
an earlier stage, but that the improvements it suggested would be
incorporated into the companies' 1995 accounts.

Biener acknowledged that Germany's leading accounting firms are world-
class, but expressed concern about the profession's rank- and-file
members. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise to
audits which are just average, rather they should allow accountants
with an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which is
up to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died out
because they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession has
grasped that message."

German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regain
public confidence. "Our audits have become suspect," Biener said.
"Sooner or later, German accounts will no longer be accepted by the
international community."

In turn, Biener himself is under pressure from the European Commission
to introduce an accounting regulatory regime along the lines of those
that exist in other EU member states. Addressing the Gottingen
conference, Karel van Hulle, the commission's head of accounting
policy, pointed out that most EU countries have already established
national standard-setting bodies that can further Europe's accounting
interests in the deliberations of the International Accounting
Standards Committee (IASC).

Biener argued that bodies whose agendas are dominated by accounting
interests are not in the best position for regulating the profession.
He said that since all accounting firms have their own commercial
interests, they may avoid making initiatives to change the status quo.
Biener, therefore, suggested that German, and in turn European
companies, set up a regulatory body modelled on the US Financial
Standards Accounting Board.

In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea."I
won't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] body
operates in a sensible fashion," he said. Gross of the IdW countered
that the main practice committee is already operating as a standard-
setter.

DAIMLER-BENZ'S US GAAP PIONEER FOUND DEAD

GERHARD LIENER, the man who revolutionised the German accounting world
by presiding over the publication of the first US GAAP accounts for a
German company, was found dead at his home near Munich in mid-December.
The former finance director of Daimler- Benz, who was 63, is believed
by police to have committed suicide.

Liener was regarded as a traitor by some elements of Germany's
financial establishment because he was instrumental in Daimler's
decision to switch to US GAAP accounts as a condition of listing its
shares in New York. This resulted in a confusing system of double
accounting, with the company's US GAAP results often differing
significantly from those calculated under German accounting
regulations.

Daimler's move is still resented by some of its corporate peers which
had hoped that by presenting a united front in negotiations with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) they could have won exemption
from the more rigorous requirements of US GAAP. Yet at the time of its
1993 Wall Street debut, Daimler had little choice; it needed access to
capital, and a New York listing - necessitating US GAAP accounts - was
the best way to raise it.

Liener was forced to resign from Daimler's management board in May 1995
and responded by blaming the former chief executive, Edzard Reuter, for
a policy of foolhardy expansion. Daimler-Benz is now in serious
financial difficulties and announced a loss of more than DM1 billion
($692 million) in the first half of 1995.

UNITED KINGDOM:  BINDER'S EX-PARTNERS ORDERED TO PAY RECORD SUM

FORMER PARTNERS in London-based accounting firm BDO Binder Hamlyn have
been stunned by a High Court ruling which holds them liable for
damages, interest and costs of #105 million ($166 million) arising from
the 1990 takeover of one of the firm's audit clients.

The damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest ever awarded
against a UK accounting firm and have added new urgency to auditors'
search for liability protection.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The suit related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989, which were
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found Binder had been negligent in its audit of
Britannia and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties, regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it will
succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparo
principles apply," a spokesman said.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm merged with Arthur Andersen. Other Binder offices merged with Stoy
Hayward, the current BDO representative in the UK, while some of the
partners joined other accounting firms or went into industry. Binder
Hamlyn is still trying to determine exactly how many partners are
liable in the Britannia case.

BANK AUSTRIA SEEKS RECOMPENSE FROM PW LONDON

THE LONDON office of Price Waterhouse is being sued for damages of #146
million ($220 million) by Bank Austria over its role in advising on a
UK acquisition that turned sour.

The suit relates to the purchase by Austria's biggest bank of a 51
percent stake in Sovereign Leasing in 1990. The Manchester- based
company, which was owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin
Harrison, was mainly involved in leasing cars, property and computer
equipment.

Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its
1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45
million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.

Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a due
diligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate finance
advice in connection with the transaction.

In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:
"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations and
advice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceed
with the acquisition.

"It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition
Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the way
it was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position been
revealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not have
proceeded with the acquisition."

In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions of
Sch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing, and in 1992 it forced
the resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of
its UK operations.

Bank Austria also alleges error in a report by PW which stated that
Sovereign made a profit of #3.4 million in 1991, when according to the
bank it actually made a #1.4 million loss.

However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted a
real due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said the
firm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisition
took place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuation
at the time of the purchase.

"We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defend
them," Hainsworth said."If it is being alleged that we valued the
company at between #30 million and #40 million for the purposes of the
transaction in June 1990, then emphatically we deny it."

The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The case
could take two years to be heard.

UNITED KINGDOM:  AUDITORS TO SEEK OFFSHORE LIMITED LIABILITY

UK ACCOUNTING firms are set to follow the lead of their US counterparts
by setting themselves up as limited liability partnerships (LLPs). The
move is designed to protect their partners' personal assets in the
event of being successfully sued for negligence.

Unlike the US Big Six, which took advantage of legislation introduced
in the state of Delaware to become LLPs, UK accounting firms would have
to register their businesses offshore because UK law restricts limited
liability protection for partnerships.

Attention is focused on the Channel Island of Jersey whose Parliament
is considering whether to recognise LLP status. While a dependency of
the British Crown, Jersey does not form part of the UK and has a
measure of administrative independence, including its own legal and tax
system.

In a statement issued on December 11, Jersey's Parliamentary Finance
and Economics Committee said it would propose a bill to the island's
Parliament permitting the creation of LLPs. Price Waterhouse and Ernst
& Young have announced that they would register their UK practices
offshore in Jersey if the island chooses to recognise LLP status.

Under the proposed law, an LLP would remain liable for its debts, but
individual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligent
act would have their personal assets protected from debts arising from
that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner, and
all LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP
would be required to provide a #5 million ($7.7 million) financial
provision - a sort of bond - for judgments against the partnership. The
draft law will be debated in Jersey's Parliament, the States of Jersey,
during the first quarter of 1996. If approved, it will then go to the
Privy Council for sanctioning and is expected to be operative by year-
end.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners has produced a very positive reaction."

The firms' partnership culture would continue within the UK and there
would be no change to their UK tax arrangements. The Jersey option is
claimed to be cheaper than incorporating as a limited liability
company, an option chosen by KPMG for parts of its UK audit practice in
1995 (CAI 62). A senior partner at one of the firms estimates the
saving could be as much as 10 percent of pre- tax profits, compared
with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the new law
in Jersey. Other professionals, including solicitors, architects and
surveyors, will be able to establish partnerships on the island.
Practices in other countries could also relocate to Jersey.

"At the moment, if you are found to be liable for negligence then you
are liable for everything, no matter what one's contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales to get the UK Government to change the
principle of joint and several liability contained in the Companies Act
of 1985. "This can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things
take time, and time is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime,
the firms need a way to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which dates from 1907, as"not relevant to modern times".
Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary legislation
would be needed to change it, he said.

UNITED STATES:  SEC OFFICIAL URGES SPEEDY ACTION ON DERIVATIVES

MICHAEL SUTTON, chief accountant of the US Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) is urging standard-setters to move more quickly to
resolve confusion over accounting for derivatives. Addressing a recent
conference in New York, Sutton said investors need help in
understanding the risks and complexities.

"Futures are accounted for differently than swaps. Swaps are accounted
for differently than foreign currency forwards. And foreign currency
forwards are accounted for differently than foreign currency options,"
he told the annual conference on current financial reporting issues
sponsored by the Financial Executives Institute.

Sutton indicated that businesses need a single, articulated set of
guidelines to use. "There's no guidance at all in many areas," he said,
adding that"the accounting literature for swaps is badly outdated". He
said the most recent guidance can be found only in a brief 60-word
consensus published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
more than ten years ago.

FASB is currently considering two other methods for accounting for
derivatives. One would require valuing derivatives at market and
charging value changes against income if the derivatives are actively
traded, or against equity if they are long-term holdings. The other
method would charge all changes in the values of derivatives against
income.

The SEC, meanwhile, is preparing a proposal that will mandate improved
disclosure about accounting policies, require quantified information
about market risk and make companies analyse and state their
derivatives strategies. Release of the document was expected before the
end of 1995 after receiving the approval of the SEC chairman.

Sutton said the new disclosure requirements would essentially codify
many existing practices. Most companies that report derivatives
exposure use one of three methods: value-at-risk; an interest rate
sensitivity analysis; or a table of raw data showing present and future
cash flows.

ACADEMICS CRITICISE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROPOSALS

TWO CANADIAN academics have told the federal government that many of
the traditional proposals aimed at improving corporate governance will
not work. They suggest alternative measures that run counter to recent
suggestions, including Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) recommendations
adopted in 1995.

Their report was commissioned by the federal government as background
for debate on the upcoming review of the Canada Business Corporations
Act, planned for 1997.

Ronald Daniels, dean of law at Toronto University, and Randall Morck, a
business professor at Alberta University, believe that issues such as
the size of boards of directors or the level of insider ownership of a
company are largely irrelevant.

The two professors say the government should neither encourage or
discourage insider ownership of companies because there is no evidence
that concentrated ownership leads to a poorer performance. They also
suggest that there is no point in separating the roles of chief
executive and chairman of the board and say governments should not try
to control the size of boards.

In contrast, the TSE has said that companies should not have large,
unwieldy boards, has called for the separation of the roles of chief
executive and chairman, and wants the board composed largely of outside
directors.

The professors would, however, like to see increased focus on what they
consider the root of one of the most important corporate governance
issues: non-arms'-length transactions between related companies, also
known as self-dealing. "This deals with the actual problem, not with
the symptoms of the problem," Morck said.

The professors recommend that all companies with a dominant shareholder
set up a special conduct committee of entirely independent outside
directors to review any proposed internal transactions.

While they do not see the need to change current laws requiring at
least two independent directors on every board, they want the
government to tighten the definition of independence. They point out
that many so-called outside directors are company lawyers, advertising
executives or senior managers of companies with close business
relationships. "Outside directors should be outsiders," Morck
said."They should have no relationship whatever with the company."

The professors also recommend that directors be paid only in stock or
stock options, because that would align their interests with those of
the shareholders. They also want directors to be held liable in class-
action suits by shareholders, but only after the government has clearly
defined the limits of that liability, which they say should not extend
beyond the change in value to a company measured by the value of the
decline in share price.

TWO TIE FOR `EXCELLENT' ANNUAL REPORTING AWARD

FOR THE first time in the 45-year history of the Financial Post annual
corporate reporting awards, two companies have tied for the top honour,
the Award of Excellence. The Bank of Montreal and manufacturer Nova
Corp were lauded for their "clear, effective" annual reports, described
by the judges as "shining and brilliant".

Awards are handed out in 13 categories, including various resource
groups, manufacturing, hi-tech, media, telecommunications, utilities,
merchandisers, financial institutions and conglomerates. As well, the
Post bestows annual environmental awards.

The tie seems to reflect the overall improvement in the quality of
annual reports, said Philip Creighton, co-ordinator of the judges who
represent the awards sponsors, the Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants, the Canadian Investor Relations Institute and the Toronto
Society of Financial Analysts.

"The field is getting better," Creighton said, adding that there is
still room for improvement. For example, in the hi-tech sector - a new
class this year - it was often difficult to tell what a particular
company was selling.

"I think it depends on how mature the industry is and how long it has
been worrying about these problems," Creighton said. "The basic
industries have made tremendous progress in being able to write about
their processes in a fashion that is understandable and in supplying
information. I can remember when all those industries were as bad as hi-
tech is now."

The Bank of Montreal was chosen as the winner in its category and for
the Award of Excellence because of its excellent separate financial
goals and measures section, which "provides insight into the bank's
performance . . . The only weakness noted is consistent with all the
bank reports reviewed - very limited revenue, cost and capital
segmentation information."

Nova Corp's report was praised as "a brilliant annual report loaded
with extensive disclosure and meaningful segmented information on all
operations".

The Award of Excellence in the environmental awards went to Northern
Telecom. "Not only has Nortel issued an interesting and informative
report, but it has distinguished itself from other companies through
continued efforts to improve the quality of its environmental
reporting," the judges said.

They particularly liked its"Lifecycle" approach, which looks at the
company's products from concept to consumption, and clearly describes
the potential impact those goods have on the environment. And the
judges were especially pleased with Nortel's decision to produce fewer
hard copies of the environmental report, making it available on the
company's World Wide Web site instead.

TORONTO PLANS HIGH PENALTIES FOR MISINFORMATION

A COMMITTEE of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) has proposed that
company directors, officers and advisers should each pay a minimum fine
of C$25,000 ($18,500) or 50 percent of their annual compensation if
they issue misleading information about their companies.

In an interim report released on December 7, the committee said
companies should be held accountable for the timeliness and accuracy of
their information. The committee was set up a year ago in response to
recommendations made by the TSE's corporate governance study.

"Although [Canadian] disclosure requirements are currently high, there
is enough non-compliance to cause concern," said Thomas Allen, a
corporate lawyer and chairman of the committee. "The remedies to
parties who are injured by lack of disclosure are clearly inadequate."

Allen said his committee's recommendations would give those suffering
losses as a result of inadequate or misleading disclosure reasonable
opportunities to recover those losses.

The committee also suggested that companies pay a minimum fine of C$1
million or 5 percent of their market capitalisation - whichever is
higher - for misinformation. As well, major shareholders would be
liable for unlimited sanctions if they knowingly influence company
officials to release inaccurate information.

Another recommendation was to broaden civil liability to include so-
called continuous disclosure documents, such as quarterly financial
reports and press releases. Currently, companies and directors are
liable only for incorrect information in a prospects or takeover
circular.

Moreover, investors would be able to seek damages from experts, such as
consultants, if their advice leads to misinformation. The liability
ceiling for experts would be the greater of C$1 million or three times
the annual fees they receive from the company.

"We think [the penalties] are enough to get corporate Canada's
attention but not so much that it risks dramatically injuring corporate
Canada," Allen said.

He acknowledged that the recommendations will force companies to spend
more money to ensure that corporate documents are accurate. "We think
that the cost, whatever it is, is more than offset by the benefit to
Canadian markets of the repute in which they will be held by virtue of
enhanced disclosure."

Although Edward Waitzer, chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission,
hailed the report as "an outstanding piece of work", one of the TSE
committee members thinks it does not go far enough. According to
Toronto lawyer Philip Anisman, C$25,000 "would not provide a level of
compensation for investors that would warrant a class, or even an
individual, action".

In a dissenting statement on the report, Anisman wrote:"It is also
questionable whether it would provide adequate deterrence. The ceiling
on directors' or officers' liability should be the greater of at least
C$100,000 or their total compensation during the year preceding the
disclosure violation."

Anisman also pointed out that the committee's recommendations contain
several loopholes that lessen the impact of the sanctions. For example,
they exclude professional advisers, such as accountants and lawyers,
from liability.

The public has until March to comment on the proposals.

AUDITORS' MEETING TO FOCUS ON INTERNET SECURITY

THE FLORIDA-based Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), a leader in
auditing technology and research, will give auditors a hands- on
opportunity to navigate the Internet at a February conference in St
Petersburg. The conference will also address the Internet's many
security issues and concerns.

"The Internet is an open system and wasn't designed to be secure," said
Jim Kates, the consultant in charge of conference activities. "People
using the system usually aren't thinking about whether the data they
are transmitting is confidential or sensitive or not," he said, adding
that there are few products on the market today that can help keep a
system secure.

Kates said this is especially problematic when the Internet is used for
electronic commerce. A system still needs to be devised for the sale of
securities and the transmission of confidential information that relies
on mutual integrity and mutual authentication of buyer and seller and
where the integrity of the data remains authentic, he said.

"There are some security products on the market, but they can be
illegally accessed," he said. "It's useless to perform a transaction if
at any point in time it can be intercepted and changed."

Kates said that, as for now, an auditor's best use of the Internet is
as a reference source or marketing tool. "An auditor completing an
environmental audit can find information on how to dispose of waste
more easily," he said. "Or a firm can search the net to find out how
its new product stacks up against potential competition.

"There's a bulletin board where auditors can discuss audit issues.
There are search utilities an accountant can use that will seek out
information for him, by using key words, like `bank securities fraud'."

IIA, like all major accounting bodies, has its own on-line base for
sending pictures and text to members and other interested parties.

FASB SEEKS STANDARDISATION

James R Peterson reports on FASB's efforts to develop accounting rules
for the booming market in financial assets

THE US Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) is close to
completing a major effort to standardise accounting for transfers of
financial assets. A preliminary draft of the proposal has been
available for comment since October, and the board is encouraging
participation at a hearing on the proposal scheduled for late February.

"The proposal breaks new ground in resolving long-standing questions
about whether transactions should be accounted for as secured
borrowings or as sales," said FASB project manager Halsey Bullen. "The
board wanted to develop an approach that would be responsive to
developments in the financial markets and have some consistency and
rigour to it," he told CAI.

"There are any number of financial assets traded in today's booming
financial markets," he said. "This proposal will enable people to find
sound answers to questions on how to account for new kinds of
transfers, such as securitisations, where you take a set of assets and
tailor them to an investor's desire for a certain predictability in
cashflows and control over risk."

The proposal covers transactions which until now were treated
separately in accounting, such as securitisations, sales of partial
interests, repurchase agreements, securities lending, loan syndications
and participations, sales of receivables with recourse, and servicing
of mortgages and other loans.

The document states that "the new standards would provide accounting
and reporting standards for transfers and servicing of financial assets
and extinguishments of financial assets." Those standards would be
based on consistent application of the accounting method known as the
"financial components approach", which has to do with the issue of
control, a word that is central to any understanding of the new
proposal.

If a company has surrendered control over the transferred assets, the
transaction would be considered a sale. Otherwise, it would be
accounted for as a secured borrowing.

A company would have to recognise all financial assets and servicing it
controls and the liabilities it has incurred after a transfer of
financial assets. It would also have to remove from the balance sheet
those assets it no longer controls and those liabilities that it has
satisfied.

In FASB's proposal, a lender has surrendered control only if all of the
following conditions are met:

* The transferred assets have been isolated from the lender beyond its
reach and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or other receivership.

* The lender obtains the right to pledge or exchange the transferred
assets.

* Any agreement to repurchase the assets can be satisfied by delivery
of assets that are readily obtainable.

* The transfer is not temporary.

The plan would require that liabilities entered into as part of a
transfer of financial assets initially be measured at fair value, if
practical. It would require servicing assets to be measured by
allocating the previous carrying amount between the assets sold and
retained interests based on their relative fair values on the transfer
date.

The FASB proposal also addresses the issue of loan impairment. After a
transfer, servicing assets and liabilities would be subsequently
measured by amortisation over the period of estimated net servicing
income, with impairment to be recognised if the carrying amount of
unamortised servicing assets at risk exceeds their fair value.

The proposal would allow elimination of a liability from the balance
sheet only if a debtor pays the creditor and is relieved of its
obligation for the liability, or if a debtor is legally released from
primary obligation for the liability by the creditor or by the courts.

Bullen expects the proposal to spark some controversy. He said
companies that find they must report as a sale what they've been
reporting as borrowing will not like it because they may have to
recognise a loss.

The proposal could also dampen the use of "repos", or repurchase
agreements by banks. FASB wants to reclassify all repurchase agreements
more than three months long as sales. At present, repos, in which one
party sells securities to another and agrees to buy them back at a
specified price at a specified time, are treated as collateralised
loans.

Banks are currently able to classify repos as "held to maturity" and do
not have to mark them to market prices on a regular basis. If repos are
classified as sales, banks would have to mark the securities they sell
to market and account for any gains or losses.

Bullen, meanwhile, expects some heated discussion about FASB's plan to
eliminate the distinction between normal servicing and excess servicing
of mortgages. This change might allow an inefficient mortgage servicer
incurring costs exceeding receivables to account for the transaction in
the same way as a more efficient servicer.

While constructing its new approach, FASB looked closely at the
International Accounting Standards Committee's proposed international
account standard on Financial Instruments, which would permit
derecognition of financial assets and liabilities upon transfer of
"substantially" all underlying risks and rewards.

FASB found this standard insufficiently consistent because it is open
to varied interpretations.

When approved, the proposal will supersede a number of FASB standards,
including Statement 76, Extinguishment of Debt, and Statement 77,
Reporting by Transferor for Transfers of Receivables with Recourse.

It would also amend Statement No. 115, Accounting for Certain
Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, to clarify that a security
may not be classified as held-to-maturity if it can be prepaid or
settled so that the holder of the security would not recover
substantially all of its investment.

OIL GIANTS HIT BY NEW FASB RULE

A new standard dealing with impairment of long-lived assets is set to
take its toll on the fourth-quarter earnings of US oil companies. James
R Peterson reports

SHAREHOLDERS WILL see their dividends from US oil and gas stocks
reduced as companies come to grips with a new standard, Accounting for
Impairment of Long-Lived Assets, from the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB).

The move is unlikely to cause unusual concern, however, because the
effect on dividends will be temporary, affecting earnings in a single
quarter, and because the new accounting rule ultimately will allow
shareholders to better predict a company's future earnings.

Texaco is taking a fourth-quarter charge of $640 million, which
analysts say will swing the company's quarterly results into a loss.
Earlier this year, Burlington Resources, Ashland and Phillips Petroleum
respectively took $304 million, $90 million and $49 million in charges.
Besides Texaco, at least two other oil giants, Mobil and Chevron,
expect to take big charges related to the new FASB rule.

The new rule, Standard 121, was implemented so that investors could
better assess the true worth of a company's assets. The new rule calls
for all US companies to compare the future expected values of assets
against current book value. If the future values are less than book,
the company must write down the value of that asset.

Oil and gas companies are particularly affected by the rule change
because it is the first time they have had to assess each of their
producing fields on a case-by-case basis. Under a previous informal
Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rule, oil fields were
evaluated on a nationwide or worldwide basis. The SEC allowed the firms
to offset those fields that had a value less than book against others
with higher values.

"Aside from the SEC rule for the oil and gas industries, there was no
standard for impairment of fixed assets until FASB adopted the current
standard last spring," according to FASB project manager Carmen Bailey,
who said it is hard to predict which other industries are facing large
write-downs.

George Batavick, Texaco's assistant comptroller, emphasised that the
company's fourth-quarter write-down is a one-time-only, non- cash event
and that the assets in question are only technically impaired. "The
assets are producing positive earnings and positive cash flow," he
said. "But since the cash flow on an undiscounted basis would not
recover the investment that is on our books, the FASB rule necessitated
a write-down."

"Under the old SEC rule, we looked at our producing oil fields in the
aggregate," Batavick explained. "In the aggregate, we had high
investment fields being paired with low investment fields and the cash
flows exceeded the total investment. However, on a field-by-field
basis, the individual cashflows of particular high investment fields
were not recovered by the cashflows."

The write-down was based on Texaco's estimate of the current and future
value of each of its oil fields. "If you have acquired a property when
its price was high, and today's prices are lower, the carrying value of
the asset must be reduced to come into line with today's prices and
what we expect the value of the property will be in the future."

Batavick said the question of valuing assets becomes a problem when a
company acquires a large firm with highly valued assets. Key to
Texaco's write-down is its recent acquisition of Getty Oil Company.
"Investors ought to feel more secure," he said, "because the write-down
would otherwise have been reported as a depreciation expense in future
years."

The new rule establishes standards for "impairment of long- lived
assets, certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those
assets to be held and used", and also for"long-lived assets and certain
identifiable intangibles to be disposed of".

The original scope of the FASB project was limited to accounting for
the impairment of long-lived assets and identifiable intangibles. The
board decided to include goodwill related to impaired assets after
deciding that long-lived assets could not be tested for impairment
without also considering the goodwill arising from the acquisition of
those assets.

The board also decided to include depreciation in the scope of its
project because it found that the choice of depreciation method and
estimates of useful life of an asset could have an impact on whether an
impairment exists. FASB suggests that an asset's depreciation method
should be reviewed periodically and changed if current estimates of the
asset's value differ significantly from previous estimates.

The history of Standard 121 extends to July 1980 when the Accounting
Standards Executive Committee of the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) urged FASB to provide more accounting
guidance for the impairment of fixed assets. No action was taken until
the mid-1980s when FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) took up the
issue. EITF members, noting a significant increase in the size and
frequency of write-downs of long-lived assets, suggested there was a
need for a single rule.

In 1989, a report by the Institute of Management Accountants revealed a
continuing steady increase in write-downs and called for more
authoritative guidance on accounting for impairment of long-lived
assets.

As a result of these recommendations, FASB added a project to its
agenda in 1988 and issued for comment a discussion memorandum,
Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Identifiable
Intangibles. The final exposure draft, Impairment of Long-Lived Assets,
was issued last year and the new standard was adopted last March.

Standard 121 is effective for financial statements for fiscal years
beginning after December 15 1995. However, some firms, like Texaco,
have chosen early application of the rule.

A FORCE TO BE RECKONED WITH

Following publication of an extensive study of international accounting
practices, Gerry Acher, KPMG's head of audit and accounting in the UK,
traces the background to the IASC's new- found prominence

IT IS increasingly recognised that international accounting standards
are a force to be reckoned with - as demonstrated by the publication in
December of TRANSACC: Transnational Accounting - and the man who
ignores them risks being left by the wayside while others set the pace.

In essence, their importance arises because international standards are
needed and international accounting standards (IASs) fit the bill,
having been markedly improved in recent years.

When the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) was
founded in 1973, part of the dream was that a single set of standards
would allow a company to raise finance anywhere in the world. That
dream has become a pressing need. Companies around the world grapple
with other people's standards in order to tap foreign capital markets.

In particular, entry to US capital markets is open only to those who
prepare their financial statements in accordance with US accounting
principles, or who reconcile their domestic financial statements to
these principles. There are a few exemptions from this for specific
areas of accounting.

What irks companies is not so much the differences in the rules
themselves as the fact that they are another country's rules; the firms
have had no input to the development of these rules, and there is a
little bit of national pride at work. For example, some European
countries feel particularly aggrieved when they are required to use US
GAAP.

With the world as its constituency, the IASC does not have this
problem. Almost everyone has reached this conclusion. The German
Government has let it be known that it will tolerate the use of IASs
for domestic purposes. The issue is also under consideration in France.
The European Commission has also softened its stance. There were early
mutterings of a Euro-ASB, but in the end, reason triumphed over bad
habit. The commission wants to work with the IASC and to allow European
companies to prepare their consolidated accounts under IASs.

Most significantly, however, capital market regulators across the
world, in the form of the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO), have reached a milestone agreement with the IASC.
IOSCO agrees that the current list of IASs contains a nucleus of
acceptable standards. Moreover, it will work with the IASC to try to
ensure that 15 new or revised IASs, to be issued by 1999, will also be
acceptable to IOSCO. If that can be achieved, IOSCO will endorse the
IASs for use in listings anywhere in the world. In theory this includes
New York, and the achievement of this is a prime goal of the exercise.
London already accepts IASs.

Improvement

That IASs have reached this position is a testament to their
improvement in recent years. At one time they were thought of as the
lowest common denominator. But during almost ten years in office, David
Cairns, former IASC secretary-general, steered the organisation through
a major revisions project, cutting out many of the optional treatments,
and bringing it to the top table among the standard-setters.

Cairns's successor, Sir Bryan Carsberg, who brings to his role
considerable authority and experience in the accounting and political
fields, now talks on equal terms with his counterparts at, for example,
the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) and the American Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB). In the list of five bodies
collaborating on recent international studies on future events, hedging
and provisioning, you will find the IASC.

National standard-setters want international convergence as far as
possible, and not purely from a theoretical viewpoint; convergence has
strong practical attractions too.

First, there are obvious advantages in borrowing, or participating in,
others' research. Countries such as Singapore and Hong Kong take this
approach to its ultimate conclusion and base their accounting systems
directly on IASs.

And second, there are real benefits for preparers and users. It would
be a genuine convenience for international groups to have the same set
of accounting principles for local and group reporting. When companies
do cross-border mergers and acquisitions they become users of
accounting information. If the two parties spoke the same accounting
language it would be one less obstacle to deal-making. And it would be
good economics. The better everyone understands the information, the
better the resource-allocation decisions will be.

How are standard-setters pursuing this goal? They now look to the
IASC's work as the reference point. The UK's ASB does this. Most of its
proposals regard developments at the IASC. For example, the draft
Statement of Principles owes much to the IASC's Framework. In addition,
the appendices to FRS 4 and FRS 7 go to the trouble of explaining why
it was felt necessary to depart from IASs in those standards. But we do
not just respond to the IASC; with Sir David Tweedie newly appointed to
the IASC board, the UK's standard-setting body is strongly represented
in the process.

Principles

I am particularly pleased that principles rather than rules are the
basis of the international standards. We must fight to retain this
general approach, and not allow the standards to drift towards a cook-
book approach. The differences from our own standards are limited,
although sometimes significant.

For example, the IAS definition of a merger is very similar to the
UK's. And like FRS 6, merger accounting must be adopted if the
definition is met; acquisition accounting applies in other cases.
Acquisition accounting itself is very similar but, crucially, it would
accommodate the acquirer's intentions, such as reorganisations, in the
fair value exercise. The end product of this is goodwill. Here a major
difference crops up.

Under IAS 22, positive goodwill must be capitalised and amortised over
up to 20 years. Negative goodwill is used to reduce the values assigned
to the non-monetary acquired assets and any remaining amount treated as
deferred income, to be spread over up to 20 years. Alternatively, the
whole amount may be dealt with as deferred income.

The UK approach is largely to write off goodwill directly to reserves.
While this is under review, it seems likely that even if the UK
requires goodwill to be capitalised, the amortisation requirement will
differ significantly from that of IAS 22.

It is important to be aware of such differences and of the future
direction of the international standard-setters. If convergence of
standards - or at least an acceptable set of international standards -
is to be achieved, more interest in their development is necessary than
has been shown hitherto.

Staying with intangible assets for a moment, development costs are
another area of difference. Under IAS 9, if certain conditions are met,
then development costs must be capitalised (and subsequently
amortised). For those who think that the IASC takes its lead from the
US this is a salutary lesson; under US GAAP, development costs are
never capitalised.

Like the UK, IAS 16 permits fixed assets to be revalued. Unlike the UK,
it requires revaluations to be done on a class-by-class basis and to be
kept up to date. If such a requirement was in force in the UK then many
of the anomalies of its present mixed system would be alleviated.

Accounting for financial instruments - including derivatives - is a
problem for everyone. At present, the IASC has a standard covering
disclosure and presentation (IAS 32). No standard-setter yet has a
comprehensive measurement standard. The IASC aims to have one by June
1997. In the meantime, IAS 32 should keep preparers, auditors and users
occupied. Its disclosures of credit risk, fair values and hedges are
demanding and informative. Its presentation rules are innovative.

Freed from the constraints of a legal framework, the IASC is able to
require companies to report preference shares that contain an
obligation as debt. On top of that, hybrid instruments, such as
convertible debt, are to be split into debt and equity elements and
separately accounted for.

Some of the other differences from UK standards are as follows:

* Jointly-controlled entities may be proportionately consolidated;
jointly-controlled assets must be proportionately consolidated. (Only
unincorporated joint ventures may use this treatment in the UK).

* The cumulative exchange differences on the net investment in a
foreign entity are presented as a component of equity. They are
subsequently taken into the calculation of profit or loss on any
disposal of the foreign entity. There are no such requirements in the
UK.

* When translating the financial statements of a foreign entity, the
profit and loss account should be translated at the actual or average
rates. The UK also permits the closing rate to be used.

* The minority interest in a subsidiary may be based on the relevant
share of the pre-acquisition book values of the subsidiary, as opposed
to the fair value as mandated in the UK.

* The current portion of long-term debt may be excluded from current
liabilities where the company can and intends to refinance it on a long-
term basis. This is not generally possible under the UK's FRS 4.

* Only a major line of business could qualify as a discontinued
operation. The UK definition refers to a material effect on the nature
and focus of operations. Moreover, the discontinued operation's profit
on ordinary activities - that is, before extraordinary items and thus
after interest and tax - must be disclosed. Discontinued interest and
tax need not be disclosed in the UK.

* Extraordinary items are more possible. IAS 8 cites earthquakes and
expropriation of assets as examples. Such events would be within
ordinary activity under the UK's FRS 3.

As mentioned earlier, 15 new or revised standards are expected from the
IASC by 1999. In part these will fill gaps in the portfolio - for
example, at present there are no comprehensive standards on
presentation (i.e. the form of accounts) or on earnings per share. But
there are also some contentious issues in the pipeline. In addition to
a measurement standard for financial instruments, a revised standard on
deferred tax (due soon) and a new standard on intangibles (due in June
1996) are on the way. These last two present difficulties of
harmonisation.

Fundamental

The UK and the US use fundamentally different bases for both
recognition and measurement of deferred tax. The UK recognition basis
is the well known timing differences approach, whereas the US seeks to
recognise the tax that would arise on a realisation of all of the
assets and liabilities at their book values, known as the temporary
differences approach. The UK, increasingly the international odd-man-
out, provides only partially for timing differences; the US provides in
full for its temporary differences.

There is no synthesis of these two systems; whichever way the IASC's
judgment goes - and the indications are that they will find in favour
of the US bases - discord will be the result.

With intangibles, the issue is the extent to which they can be
separated from goodwill. In the UK, the current proposal would allow,
for example, an acquired brand to be separated out where its fair value
could be reliably measured. The IASC's proposal (E50) agrees in
principle. However, it does not regard a measurement based on
discounted future revenues - as is typically the case for brands - as
sufficiently distinct from the measurement of goodwill to merit
separate recognition.

The IASC has come a long way. In the field of accounting developments
it has moved, unnoticed by many, from the rearguard to the van. But the
campaign is not over yet. If the world is to move forward we must
achieve the goal of listing on a US exchange under IAS. This is what
the IASC is fighting for; it deserves our attention, co-operation and
support.

LONG TRIAL LIKELY FOR PW

One of the biggest-ever auditor lawsuits in Germany opened at the end
of November. But, as CAI reports, an early resolution of the  complex
issues involved seems unlikely

MORE THAN a year after a group of creditor banks announced a DM255
million ($180 million) lawsuit against Price Waterhouse over its audits
of two German companies brought to the brink of bankruptcy by alleged
fraud, the court case opened in Frankfurt at the end of November.

But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, the
judge quickly proposed an adjournment until after former executives of
the two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat, have been tried
on charges of criminal fraud.

The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for several
years because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes to
prove that the former executives of credit factoring company, Procedo,
and its biggest customer, sports-surface manufacturer Balsam, engaged
in fraudulent transactions that led to the collapse of both companies.
Muscat, who advised both companies, is accused of "deliberate
involvement" with the alleged frauds.

Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his case
against PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partners
acted with the intention to defraud, rather than just negligently. But
he is unwilling to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a
prolonged adjournment. After both sides had consulted with their
clients, the court planned to reconvene on December 19 to make a final
decision on the adjournment.

The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of "intentional misconduct"
in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approving
the accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added a
new claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval without
actually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.

The alleged fraud centres on Procedo's factoring transactions with
Balsam which led it to advance cash to the manufacturing company in
return for collecting its trade receivables. Prosecutors claim the
factored invoices were doctored to make Balsam's turnover look bigger
than it was. Balsam filed for bankruptcy in June 1994 after its top
management was arrested on suspicion of fraud, a move that precipitated
Procedo's petition for protection from its creditors. The biggest
casualties were the companies' bankers which claim to be owed DM2.3
billion.

PW's involvement stems from its audits of Balsam, which it undertook
jointly with a Dusseldorf-based subsidiary, FMP. Muscat, a partner in
both PW and FMP, audited Procedo in an individual capacity. He was
arrested in August 1994 on charges of fraud.

In an interview with CAI, PW's senior partner in Germany, Wolfgang
Krause, said his firm may have to be bailed out by PW's European firm
if the creditor banks are awarded the legal damages they are seeking.

Krause said PW Europe would "naturally" provide financial support since
the German practice has no funds to pay an out-of- court settlement,
let alone the full sum of DM255 million for which it is being sued. "We
don't have any possibility to build reserves," he said, citing the high
cost of personnel, information technology, training and liability
insurance in Germany.

That insurance, however, is unlikely to cover the millions PW could end
up paying as a result of the Balsam/Procedo lawsuit. In remarks about
the German accounting profession in general, Ulf Pohl, managing
director of Wirtschaftliche Versicherungsstellethe, the leading
provider of professional indemnity insurance cover for accountants in
Germany, said firms invariably take up "substantially less" than the
maximum cover of DM70 million that he offers.

Moreover, Pohl said German corporate law makes it impossible for
accountancy firms to insure against "intentional misconduct" by their
partners. In the Balsam/Procedo suit, PW and six of its partners are
accused of precisely that misdemeanour.

While the court action is now under way, PW still hopes it can reach
agreement out of court. "Our legal counsel is strongly urging us to see
the case through, but we don't want this business to go for another ten
years," Krause said.

Meanwhile, there is little evidence that PW has been damaged by the
unfavourable publicity generated by the lawsuit. Only six partners have
left or retired (including Muscat and Gerd Frielingsdorf, two of those
named in the suit), and fee income continues to rise.

Provisional figures for the year to the end of last June showed gross
revenues of DM253 million, up 5.4 percent from the previous year.
Revenues for 1995/96 are projected at DM275 million.

Those figures make PW the smallest of the Big Six in Germany, but
Krause explained that the firm's approach to the market differs from
that of its larger competitors. Its share of statutory audit work is
probably smaller than that of any other major German firm; instead it
focuses on audit-related projects such as due diligence, treasury
management, internal audit consulting and balance sheet planning for
companies which are not statutory audit clients.

Like PW firms in other markets, the German firm likes to regard all its
professionals as"consultants". Many assignments are awarded in
connection with mergers and acquisitions where PW's corporate finance
subsidiary has acted as a consultant. In fiscal 1995, audit work
accounted for 40 percent of fee income compared with 43 percent the
year before. At other Big Six firms in Germany, the figure is around 60
percent.

TRYING TO AGREE ON GLOBAL STANDARDS

Niall Brady reviews the financial reporting developments that hit the
headlines in 1995

IN THE tortured history of the search for a global accounting language,
1995 will be remembered as something of a watershed. After years of
dancing round the issue, the world's stock market regulators finally
came to an agreement with the International Accounting Standards
Committee (IASC) on a timetable for a set of core standards that would
be acceptable for cross-border listings and capital raising.

Having been dismissed for years as a well-intentioned but ineffectual
standard-setter, the IASC could not conceal its delight. Australian
Michael Sharpe, who took over the role of IASC chairman on July 1,
hailed the agreement with the International Organisation of Securities
Commissions (IOSCO) as an "historic moment".

"Companies should now feel confident that the IASC and IOSCO are fully
committed to developing IASs that will be acceptable everywhere in the
world and recognise the efficiencies that may be obtained from using
IASs," he said. "At the moment, companies using IAS standards can raise
capital on many global stock exchanges. Now they know that they will be
able to access all of them in the not-too-distant future. Not just
whole companies, but whole countries will now move to IAS rules."

Amid the jubilation, however, the huge task facing the IASC between now
and the end of the decade must not be underestimated. Included in the
15 standards that the IASC has agreed to issue or revise at IOSCO's
behest are some of accounting's most controversial issues, such as
financial instruments, intangible assets and leasing.

Even if the IASC manages to stick with its ambitious timetable, its new
and revised standards would still have to be endorsed by IOSCO's
technical committee before they can be recognised as acceptable for
cross-border listings in all capital markets. The final hurdle will be
getting the national securities regulators to recognise IASs in their
rule books.

The stance adopted by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
which regulates entry to the world's biggest capital market, will be
especially important. Domestic US companies are determined that they
should not have to compete head-on for the same capital with foreign
registrants that are not subject to the full rigours of US GAAP.

Research unveiled in the spring of 1995 suggests, however, that the gap
between IASs and US GAAP may not be as wide as is generally thought.
According to Trevor Harris, the accounting professor at New York's
Columbia University, who undertook the study: "We found that at least
for firms utilising the IASC's revised International Accounting
Standards there are few instances, especially from an investor's
perspective as opposed to a technical accounting perspective, where the
companies' compliance with IASs would not meet US GAAP."

Harris also noted that endorsement of IASs would not necessarily weaken
the SEC's hand. "If the SEC believes a company is hurting investors by
obfuscating the information, despite apparent compliance with IASs,
then it can still impose its regulatory control if the company is
registered," he said.

With so much attention to keeping the Americans on side, some of the
IASC's other power brokers are concerned that their interests are being
pushed to one side. Those concerns have been heightened with the
realisation that political squabbles about the future direction of IASs
are being overtaken by events on the ground, as more multinational
companies switch to US GAAP in return for entry to the New York Stock
Exchange.

The hegemony of US GAAP led the European Commission, in particular, to
signal that it might intervene to halt the slide. Addressing a meeting
of European accountants at the end of 1994, John Mogg, the commission's
director general for the internal market and financial services, said:
"We must recognise that Europe cannot escape its own responsibility to
shape accounting standards. We cannot be merely reactive to the
solutions put forward by others."

Mogg's sentiments were amplified by Karel van Hulle, head of the
commission's accounting standards unit. After acknowledging the
shortcomings of the commission's existing accounting directives during
an address to the European Accounting Association in May, van Hulle
added: "We have to change our approach in the area of financial
reporting or the European input into the debate will diminish. I
disagree with those who argue that this is a good thing. Something has
to be done to prevent the directives becoming a burden on progress."

Such talk raised fears inside and outside Europe that Brussels was
preparing to go it alone in harmonising the accounting practices of the
EU's 15 member states. Those fears, however, were eventually put to
rest at IOSCO's annual conference in July, when Mario Monti, the
commissioner responsible for accounting policy, signalled that Brussels
would seek to work through the IASC as the best way to harmonise
accounting practices both within the EU's member states and with the
outside world.

"Agreement on IASs would enable us to enter negotiations with other
regions aimed at securing mutual recognition of public offer and
listing prospectuses based on these same IASs," Monti said. "We believe
companies should only be required to prepare one set of consolidated
accounts, and we plan to examine the possibility for European companies
with an international vocation to prepare their consolidated accounts
on the basis of IASs."

Brussels' embrace of IASs is also mirrored by a realisation among some
heavyweight EU member states that, rather than fretting from the
sidelines about the IASC's perceived Anglo-Saxon bias, it is better to
make their voices heard by playing a more active role in the
deliberations of the global standard-setter. Most European countries,
however, are hampered by the fact that they do not have strong standard-
setting bodies, such as the UK's Accounting Standards Board (ASB) or
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in the US, which could
fly their flags at the IASC.

France, for one, is set to remedy that situation with the announcement
by economy minister Jean Arthuis that he plans to set up a state body
with the power to issue binding pronouncements on financial reporting.
Addressing the 50th congress of the country's professional accountancy
body, the Ordre des Experts Comptables, Arthuis warned that France's
existing accounting regime, which is based on legislation rather than
private-sector standards, "is threatened with sclerosis".

A key feature of Arthuis's proposed Comite de la Reglementation
Comptable (CRC) is that its pronouncements would draw heavily on IASs.
That could remove a big obstacle facing capital-hungry European
companies: the need to prepare multiple, and often contradictory,
accounts to satisfy the needs of both domestic regulators and overseas
stock markets. "I would like to say that I find this ambiguous
situation unacceptable," Arthuis said. "It leads to questions about the
truthfulness of the accounts of large French companies and is
detrimental to their credibility."

The half-year results of Pechiney provided a prime example of what
Arthuis was referring to. In the run-up to its planned November
privatisation, the aluminium and packaging group switched to US GAAP
and reported a Fr658 million ($130 million) profit for the six months
to the end of June.

But France's stock market regulator, the Commission des Operations de
Bourse (COB), took exception to Pechiney's new accounting policies,
highlighting the fact that if it had stuck with local reporting
requirements it would have reported a small loss for the period. The
uncharacteristically public rebuke from the COB came at a bad time for
Pechiney, as its shares were already facing general indifference from
investors.

Pechiney's predicament is familiar to companies in neighbouring
Germany. Because its accounting traditions are so out of step with what
is demanded by international investors, Germany has been forced to
undertake a fundamental rethink of its approach to financial reporting.

A radical solution emerged from Bonn in the spring of 1995 when justice
ministry official Herbert Biener proposed that German companies with
global ambitions could be allowed to use IASs or US GAAP for their
consolidated financial statements and would only have to respect
domestic accounting requirements in individual company financial
statements.

Biener's proposals come at a time when another German company - this
time the state-owned telecommunications monopoly, Deutsche Telekom - is
preparing to follow the lead of Daimler-Benz and list its shares in New
York. Unless Biener's proposal finds its way onto the statute books by
early next year, however, Telekom will find itself in the same
predicament as Daimler: having to issue two different sets of group
results, one that complies with German accounting regulations, the
other with US GAAP.

For both companies, a crucial aspect of Biener's proposal is that US
GAAP would be an equally-acceptable alternative to IASs as a basis for
drafting consolidated accounts. Their interest lies in removing
obstacles to listing their shares in New York, and the SEC will not
accept accounts drawn up on the basis of IASs.

Such a radical solution, however, is causing unease in some quarters of
Germany's corporate establishment. Companies like Bayer and Hoechst
have never accepted what they see as Daimler's capitulation to the
excessive demands of the SEC in terms of disclosure. Instead, they
favour IASs (Bayer adopted IASs for its 1994 accounts; Hoechst planned
to do so for its 1995 financial statements) because, unlike the
formulation of US GAAP, Germany has an input into IASs and
representation on the board of the IASC.

Sharpe summed up their fears in an address to the Federation of Euro-
Asian Stock Exchanges at the beginning of October. "I believe that it
is unacceptable that a sovereign state de facto delegates to another
state the drawing up of their accounting standards," he said.
"Delegating to an international institution in which many sovereign
states have their say is one thing, whereas delegating to another state
is quite another."

Germany is also divided on the need for a national standard- setting
body along the lines of France's proposed CRC. According to Johannes
Maret, Arthur Andersen's senior partner in Frankfurt: "A standard-
setting body would be responsible for exacting greater influence in the
formulation of IASs and checking whether these were compatible with
German law."

On the other hand, Dietrich Dorner, outgoing president of the
professional body for German accountants, the Institut der
Wirtschaftsprufer, believes the need for a consensus approach in
standard-setting would weaken the standard of financial reporting in
Germany.

"I'm not optimistic that [a standard-setting body] would be any better
than what we have at the moment," he told CAI in November. "It would
pronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effect
would be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."

Whatever route German companies eventually take to make their accounts
more useful to international investors, it is clear that the existing
practice of making generous provisions for a wide variety of possible
liabilities and losses will have to be curbed. While billed as an
example of German accounting's conservative bent, over-generous
provisions are also a classic devise for smoothing earnings by
depressing profits in good years and bumping up the bottom lines when
times are bad.

The IASC took aim at that practice at the end of November with a
discussion paper which proposes that provisions for future operating
losses should be banned except where they result from contractual
commitments. A similar line was taken in separate documents issued by
standard-setters in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US, which had
worked with the IASC on the provisions issue.

Unveiling the UK discussion paper, ASB chairman David Tweedie said:
"Some will say the restriction on provisions is imprudent but we don't
want phoney liabilities . . . with forecast future losses we sometimes
get into psychoanalytic accounting; it's like trying to read your mind.
If you want to recognise [future losses] let's have a detailed plan
first. You can't smack in phoney liabilities because you intend to
reorganise."

Such thinking goes against the current trend in the British banking
industry, which took advantage of record profits in 1995 to bump up bad-
debt provisions. Such efforts to iron out the cyclical swings that
characterise bank earnings have the blessing of regulators. "It seems
to me preferable to recognise that expected losses, particularly if
they can be predicted with reasonable accuracy, have been incurred when
a loan is written rather than waiting until the loss materialises,"
according to Bank of England executive director Brian Quinn.

And awash with profits, the banks have been more than willing to heed
Quinn's advice. Barclays Bank introduced so-called default
provisioning, involving up-front provisions based on expected losses
over the life of a loan; Lloyds Bank opted for a once-off #120 million
($200 million) boost to its general provision for bad debts based on
fears that higher inflation would hasten another economic downturn and
a desire to avoid having to raise provisions sharply in the future.

Financial instruments are an accounting issue guaranteed to dictate the
pace for both banks and their large corporate clients for some time to
come. Following explosive growth in the use of derivatives in recent
years, calls for tighter regulation of the market have been matched by
greater urgency in the push to develop accounting standards that can
deal with the complexity of financial instruments.

Even before the dramatic collapse of Barings Bank in February, the IASC
had declared that its financial instruments project "remains the
board's single highest priority for 1995 and beyond". That culminated
in the May publication of IAS 32, which deals with disclosure and
presentation issues. The fact that the standard had been in the
pipeline for six years, and that measurement and disclosure of
financial instruments remain to be tackled, demonstrate the complex and
contentious nature of the issues involved.

"Both investors and lenders need to have a much better idea of whether
risky derivatives are being used," said IASC technical director Liesel
Knorr when the standard was unveiled. "The disclosures which we are now
asking for will make it much easier to assess the risks that companies
run when they use financial instruments such as derivatives."

Meanwhile, progress on the second phase of the financial instruments
project, dealing with recognition and measurement, continues slowly,
with the next milestone expected to be a discussion paper to be issued
by the end of 1996.

That perennial bugbear of the accounting industry - goodwill and
intangible assets - continued to grab the headlines in 1995. The year
kicked off with drugs company Wellcome using the UK's lenient goodwill
requirements as part of an unsuccessful challenge to a hostile takeover
bid from pharmaceuticals giant Glaxo. Wellcome charged that Glaxo's bid
could prejudice rival bidders from overseas because they would have to
amortise the ensuing goodwill against future profits, whereas Glaxo, as
a UK company, could choose to write-off the goodwill immediately
against reserves.

Australia's Pacific Dunlop also pointed to what it perceives as the
UK's unfair advantage in goodwill amortisation in a row with regulators
during 1995. With the Australian Accounting Standards Board expected to
issue an exposure draft by year's end that requires goodwill to be
amortised on a straight-line basis over 20 years, PacDun noted that
this is more onerous than the treatment permitted in the UK or in the
US and Canada, which allows goodwill to be written off over 40 years.

PacDun's concerns, however, could prove short-lived, at least as
regards the UK. In June, the ASB issued a working paper that proposes
the abolition of reserve accounting for goodwill. Tweedie outlined the
proposals as follows: "For companies wanting to take the
straightforward option, intangible assets and goodwill may be
capitalised and depreciated over a maximum of 20 years with only a
minimal annual recoverability review. On the other hand, for companies
wishing to show the critical value to their businesses of intangible
assets and goodwill, there will be no need to make an arbitrary
amortisation charge each year. Instead, continuing value can be
demonstrated by a review of future cash-flow forecasts."

That approach differs from exposure draft E50, issued by the IASC in
June, which rejected the ASB's view that some intangibles need never be
amortised. The eventual shape of a revised UK goodwill standard,
however, remains anyone's guess.

As part of a lengthy process to ensure broad-based support, the ASB
held its first-ever public hearing at the beginning of October at which
its goodwill proposals were put to the floor. With little consensus on
the specifics of the standard-setter's proposals - most disagreement
centred on the ASB's proposed impairment tests to determine if goodwill
should be subject to a once-off write down - a standard remains some
time away.

GROWTH IN CORPORATE IMAGING TOP STORY OF 1995

     Plan to offer image-based cash management applications this year
if corporate customers make up a significant part of your business.
     Interest in applications such as image archive and retrieval,
image positive pay and CD-ROM delivery will continue to skyrocket,
predicts David Medeiros, a consulting analyst with The Tower Group,
based in Wellesley, Mass.
     The coming year also could bring wider acceptance of the Internet
for transmitting sensitive data; the long-awaited introduction of
Rapid*EDI; less interest in electronic data interchange (EDI); and
more banks using electronic check presentment (ECP), say consultants
in assessing last year's trends. 

Banks Offer Image Processing

     "As soon as enough large banks have installed image-based cash
management, corporate banking customers will come to expect it.  If
your bank's not offering it, they'll find [a bank] that is," Medeiros
noted.
     Indeed, Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, Bank of Boston and
Chemical Banking Corp.'s New York-based Geoserve division came to
market in recent weeks offering check images on CD-ROM (CORP, Dec. 27,
p. 7).
     Chemical also announced plans last year to integrate imaging into
all phases of its check operations, including proof-of-deposit and
archiving.
     The technology allows firms to use search and retrieval software
to pull up a check image on a personal computer screen, as opposed to
finding the image on microfilm or pulling a paper check out of a
storage box, the banks say.  
     "Many [banks] anticipate that they will be able to resolve
telephone inquiries while the payee or customer is still on the
phone," added Mary Ann Hardy, an image product manager at Bank of
Boston.
     Similarly, many banks began offering image-enabled wholesale
lockbox processing last year, including Harris Bank, based in Chicago
(CORP, Dec. 27, p. 7).  
     The bank says the technology will streamline its operations and
provide customers with reduced storage needs and immediate access to
check and remittance images for faster accounts receivable-posting and
reconcilement.
     Using the lessons of history, here's a look at the major stories
of 1995 and how they'll relate to the decisions you'll be making this
year:     

     *  Best Marriage of Technologies:  Interbank check imaging.  By
combining check imaging and electronic check presentment (ECP), the
Financial Services Technology Consortium (FSTC) developed a paperless
check clearing process to reduce check fraud and provide faster access
to funds (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 1).  Banks also will benefit from faster,
cheaper check clearing, FSTC says.
     Huntington Bancshares of Columbus, Ohio, Bank of Boston, Citibank
of New York and Chemical, exchanged digitized check images across
dissimilar systems as part of a pilot sponsored by FSTC.  "The
ultimate aim of interbank check imaging is check truncation," notes
one FSTC member. 
     The next steps for interbank check imaging involve adding
security features, anticipated industry standards, and remote storage
capabilities.

     *  Biggest Development in Electronic Commerce:  The multiple new
products promising hardware-based encryption and back-end support for
Internet commerce.
     "There has been a lot of hype about the potential for break-ins,
but now with recent [product] developments, the Internet is viable,"
explains Iang Jeon, senior analyst with Forrester Research,
headquartered in Cambridge, Mass.
     For example, the Templar Certification Program, introduced last
year by Premenos Technology Corp. of Concord, Calif., allows
electronic data interchange (EDI) vendors to incorporate Templar with
their translation software to offer secure Internet EDI.  Similarly,
the Internet Services Roadmap from Digital Equipment Corp., based in
Maynard, Mass., offers a set of secure Internet services for users and
service providers.
     Other companies that introduced new products last year for
sensitive data transmission over the Internet include RSA Data
Security and Netscape Communications Corp., both of Redwood City,
Calif., and Atalla Corp. in San Jose, Calif. (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 1).
     *  Most Talked About Product:  Rapid*EDI.  The low-cost financial
data interchange system was scheduled to pilot in July but hit a snag
when Sterling Software of Dallas pulled out of the project (CORP, May
31, p. 1). MCI Communications Corp. of Arlington, Va., then chose
CertiSoft Solutions of Englewood, Colo., to produce the software
(CORP, Oct. 18, p. 8). 
     The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) had
awarded MCI the contract for this project in 1994 to provide a cheap,
Windows-based EDI service in hopes of boosting financial EDI volumes
on the automated clearing house network (CORP, Dec. 14, p. 1). 
Regardless of the delay, NACHA believes it has achieved part of its
goal of encouraging the development of financial EDI:  There are now
at least five low-cost financial EDI packages on the market.

     *  Most Surprising Trend of 1995:  Only a handful of banks rushed
to take advantage of newly loosened interstate banking rules.  Since
October, bank holding companies have been allowed to unify multistate
operations on a single platform.  But "I don't see [many] banks doing
it," notes Connie Beck, executive vice president with NationsBank,
headquartered in Charlotte, N.C.  "We see it as one of our key
competitive advantages for [the next three years]."
     Indeed, banks have claimed for years that putting their corporate
products on a single platform would allow them to slash costs, reduce
errors and add new technologies more quickly.  But Cynthia Glassman,
managing director with Furash & Co. in Washington, D.C., speculates
that some large banks may be tied to the strategies they developed in
the era of restrictive geographic boundaries -- emphasizing local
service, granting local bank presidents autonomy to react to regional
conditions, and encouraging internal competition to push down costs.
      Glassman warns that this may not be a viable strategy in 1996. 
"Entrepreneurs like to deal with the president of the bank, and
they're not going to do that with a big, nationwide bank," she said.

     *  Sign of Things To Come:  The EBT Council held its inaugural
meeting in 1995 (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 1).  The group was organized by
NACHA to help facilitate the Federal EBT Task Force's plan for a
nationwide infrastructure that will enable EBT processors to handle
transactions across the country, allowing for the portability of
benefits.  The EBT Council also will take up the continuing
controversy over bidding procedures used to award EBT contracts.

     *  Biggest Bank Merger of the Year:  Chemical and Chase.  The $10
billion merger, due to be finalized this summer, will create a titan
in the fields of transaction processing and funds transfer services,
industry watchers predict.  
     The "new" Chase will have a strong international presence,
greater role in electronic funds transfer and more resources to
bankroll bold technological experiments.  In the New York area alone,
the combined banks will account for 35 percent to 40 percent of the
wholesale banking markets, estimated one analyst who asked not to be
identified (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 1).
     In addition, Yun Jae Chung, a banking analyst with NatWest
Securities Corp. in New York, says the banks generated about $1.9
billion in 1994 from their transactions processing businesses alone. 

     *  Most Daring Prediction for 1996:  EDI is dead.  "Not only have
EDI implementations flattened, they've trailed off," notes Mike
Alfonsi, who manages the treasury consulting practice at CoreStates
Bank, based in Philadelphia.  Alfonsi anticipates little growth in EDI
at the current price of implementation.  "We've a hit a wall with
cost," he claimed.
     Another consultant, who asked not to be named, added that EDI is
taking on another form.  Moving transaction data electronically is
available through procurement cards, lockbox imaging and E-mail, says
this consultant, who claims:  "Over the short run, no one is going to
make a lot of money on EDI." 
     Beck counters that "more and more companies have the systems in
place to really leverage EDI, some of them are increasingly making it
mandatory."

     *  Top Advice for 1996:  Get your feet wet with ECP if you
haven't already, recommends Steve Takahashi, group senior vice
president for ABN-AMRO Services Company Inc., in Chicago.  Takahashi
believes more banks will develop ECP systems this year and begin to
exchange items electronically to slash check fraud, boost
productivity, develop new return item products, and take advantage of
ECP-related discounts offered by some Federal Reserve banks.  
     "Many banks have developed ECP systems, but they haven't gone
live," he noted.  The problem is, most banks only are set up to send
but not receive ECP transmissions.  ABN-AMRO hopes to begin exchanging
ECP items early this year.  (Dave Medeiros, The Tower Group, 617/235-
5777; Steve Takahashi, ABN-AMRO Services Company, 312/904-7477; Bank
of Boston, 617/434-6883.)

NACHA, EDIBANX DISCUSS LINK TO SPUR EDI IMPLEMENTATION  

     The National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) and the
EDI Bank Alliance Network Exchange (EDIBANX) are considering ways to
tie the two networks together to facilitate more widespread use of
financial electronic data interchange (EDI).  
     "One of the problems with financial EDI right now is that not
enough people are doing it," observes Scott Lang, staff director for
NACHA's Bankers EDI Council.  Both groups hope that by interconnecting
the networks they'll be able to boost bank revenues and lower costs by
increasing financial EDI volume.   
     The Bankers EDI Council moved last October to create the EDI
Integration Task Force to formally take up the issue.  Comprised of
representatives from NACHA, EDIBANX, the Federal Reserve System, New
York Automated Clearing House (NYACH), VisaNet and the leading EDI-
capable banks, the task force was scheduled to hold its first meeting
as we were going to press, at the NACHA/Treasury Management
Association Financial EDI Conference in Nashville.  
     EDIBANX and NACHA representatives, however, have been meeting
informally since June.  The early NACHA model to emerge from those
talks has certain ACH operators acting as ambidextrous "gateways,"
able to handle both the native X12 format from the EDIBANX network and
NACHA's CTX.  These gateway operators would wrap an incoming EDIBANX
transmission in the CTX envelope for delivery on the ACH network, and
would similarly unwrap any outgoing transmission for delivery on the
EDIBANX network.  
     Establishing the technical infrastructure, value-added features
and protocols may prove the easiest issues of this partnership.  The
tougher call will be whether EDIBANX will retain its franchise.
     EDIBANX "wants the traffic to go one way.  If that's something
they insist upon we'll probably never get anywhere with these
discussions," says George Thomas, senior vice president with the
NYACH.  But EDIBANX will lose its exclusivity, and possibly its
members, if the network has to accept EDI transmissions originated on
the ACH system. 

EDI Implementation Moving Slower Than Expected

     The EDIBANX network, which is operated by the Chicago Clearing
House Association, went on-line in October 1994 but quickly lost
momentum due to the slow pace of EDI implementation.  By summer 1995,
EDIBANX and NACHA had begun informal talks to explore the possibility
of working together to boost corporate-to-corporate electronic
payments.  
     "I'm not sure I can put my finger on any one reason why it's
moving slowly," says Mark Stuparich, vice president of New York-based
Chase Manhattan Bank, which has put off its EDIBANX implementation due
to weak customer demand.  "The volume has not been growing as rapidly
on the EDIBANX network as we had hoped, and so the incentive for us to
move has not been as great," he explains.  
     One incentive that has failed to materialize is cheaper pricing. 
EDIBANX had assumed there would be sufficient network volume to
justify fixed prices. Chase, and other banks with large-scale
transactions, anticipated significant savings over CTX pricing which
varies depending on the addenda size.  But Stuparich says "the volumes
aren't there yet in the EDIBANX network, so it's probably not even
fair to try to make a comparison."
     "To the extent that implementation of the EDIBANX product is
slower than anybody expected, it's probably pretty much in line with
the slowness of the rest of corporate electronic trade payments, says
Richard Bort of Richard Bort & Assocs., a consulting firm in Sherman
Oaks, Calif.
     "I got involved in financial EDI in 1986 and from that time
through today, we've been saying:  'It's coming!  It's coming!'  But
the implementation of corporate electronic trade payments has been
much slower than anybody had ever thought it would be," he says. 
     NACHA's Lang suggests it has been difficult, if not impossible,
to achieve a critical mass of EDI trading partners because not enough
financial institutions are EDI-capable.  The Chicago Clearing House
thought it had the answer with EDIBANX, which got rid of the NACHA CTX
envelope to simplify the EDI format and provided a guide to EDI-
capable trading partners.  But companies have apparently not rushed to
take advantage of the value-added features.                 "You're
not going to get companies to switch banks just so they can get  
EDI," says NYACH's Thomas.  "What you have to do," he says, "is
something NACHA is doing with the Rapid*EDI program:  Provide a low-
cost vehicle to make virtually every financial institution EDI-
capable."
     The Rapid*EDI software is a scaled-down, turnkey package, which
enables small-to-medium-sized financial institutions to receive EDI.  
     Today EDI is a risky business on the ACH network as fewer than 10
percent of NACHA-member banks claim to be EDI-capable, says Chase's
Stuparich.  By contrast, EDIBANX provides a guarantee that the
receiving bank will be able to properly handle a transaction.  
     In addition, the EDIBANX network provides syntax editing,
validation and acknowledgements, all of which NACHA has been pushed by
members to provide.  
     "They both have something to gain by having a partnership," says
Stuparich.  "What NACHA has to gain is some of the enhanced
capabilities that were built into the EDIBANX network.  I think what
EDIBANX has to gain is rapid access to a large volume of
transactions." 

Is There Sufficient Demand for EDI?

     While the obvious synergies  prompted creation of the EDI
Integration Task Force, it remains an open question whether the two
networks together will generate any more EDI traffic than they've been
able to achieve separately.  
     Though less elegant than the native X12 format used on the
EDIBANX network, NACHA's CTX envelope provides the essential EDI
capability.  And even though the CTX is limited to 9,999 addenda
records, "that hasn't been a major stumbling block in the typical
accounts payable world," says Stuparich.
     "There are a number of reasons why EDI is difficult; financial
EDI is yet a little bit more difficult," says Bort, who suggests
corporate treasurers and chief financial officers are still not
convinced they need to bother with electronic trade payments.  It will
come, says Bort, if reengineering catches up with corporate
downsizing.
     "Companies that do it right reengineer.  They find better ways to
get from point A to point B," and that includes implementing
electronic corporate trade payments, says Bort.  But, he adds, "that's
not the way corporate America has done it.  They chop the people
first.  Then they haven't got enough people to figure out how do we do
this thing called 'EDI.'" 
     NACHA and EDIBANX have the people to figure it out, but are
having some trouble figuring out how to do it together.   (Richard

CHECKFREE, SERVANTIS COMBINE TO LEAD ELECTRONIC COMMERCE

Checkfree Corporation gave electronic commerce a boost when the
Columbus, Ohio company agreed to acquire software developer Servantis
Systems Holdings Inc., says one analyst.  The deal makes "Checkfree a
more effective player, and whenever you have more than a couple of
players that are capable it pushes things more quickly," observes
David Weisman, senior analyst with Cambridge, Mass.-based Forrester
Research.
     The acquisition of Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis provides the
third leg of the triad that Checkfree has been methodically
constructing, says Michael Sapienza, Checkfree vice president for
marketing.  That triad consists of electronic consumer-, business- and
banking-services.  But until recently, Checkfree was a little wobbly
on both the banking and the business legs.  

Checkfree Alliances Corral the Market

     In a matter of months, Checkfree has gone from a consumer bill
payment service to the dominant presence in electronic commerce,
according to one financial analyst who says, "nobody is even remotely
close to them." 
     Prior to acquiring Servantis, Checkfree's focus was electronic
bill payment and invoicing.  Missing from that strategy were front-
and back-office banking capabilities.  "You need to do all those
transactions between the bank and its customers.  Checkfree never had
a very good solution for that, which is part of the reason that
MasterCard moved on," says Weisman (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 8).
     For almost three years, Checkfree and MasterCard were connected
at the hip.  "We were their exclusive electronic banking and bill
payment service provider and they were our exclusive distribution
channel to financial institutions," explains Sapienza.  But neither
partner was satisfied with the arrangement.
     Since the expiration of the MasterCard deal a year ago, Checkfree
has been aggressively signing up partners.  Milwaukee-based Fiserv
Inc., Automatic Data Processing Inc. of Roseland, N.J., Plano, Texas-
based EDS and Cybercash of Reston, Va., have tightened Checkfree's
hold on electronic bill payments and invoicing.  
     "The amount of resources it takes to do hundreds of thousands or
millions of bill payments makes this an economies of scale game.  And
Checkfree has a lot pumping through it," says Forrester's Weisman, but
he adds the company was still missing a good home banking platform.
     With Servantis, Checkfree not only gets home banking and
corporate cash management products, it also gets MasterCard back.  The
card association aligned with Servantis earlier this year to
facilitate MasterCard's wholesale banking product, MasterBanking.
     "We view the Servantis ... banking transaction processing
business, and its software and mainframe hardware, as being a superior
technical solution to that at Checkfree," says A. Christian Frederick,
Mastercard's senior vice president of remote banking and strategic
planning.  "It is quite evident that Checkfree has validated that
[opinion with this purchase.]"
     How effective Checkfree will be in leveraging its purchase of
Servantis is still an open question.  "How to best integrate the two
companies is something that is not 100 percent figured out yet," says
Checkfree's Sapienza.  Who stays and who goes, for example, will be
decided over the next 30- to 60-days, says Sapienza.  
     Another concern is the role Servantis majority owner Welsh,
Carson, Anderson & Stowe will play at Checkfree.  Because the purchase
deal is being done with both stock and cash, the New York-based
venture capital fund will end up owning more than 20 percent of
Checkfree.  (A. Christian Frederick, MasterCard, 914/249-5525, Michael
Sapienza, Checkfree, 614/825-3026; David Weisman, Forrester Research,
617/520-5791.)

ELECTRONIC COMMERCE PRODUCTS FREQUENT VENDOR RELEASES IN '95

     Electronic commerce and on-line security dominated new product
offerings in 1995 as vendors raced to cash in on growing demand from
banks and corporations for the developing technologies. 
     For instance, Sterling Software of Dallas, and VeriFone of
Redwood City, Calif., joined Visa International of San Francisco and
MasterCard of Purchase, N.Y., in releasing electronic commerce
products last year.  
     Sterling announced COMMERCE:Connection, a suite of products that
includes Windows-based electronic data interchange (EDI) and
translation software (CORP, Dec. 27, p. 8).  Visa and MasterCard
joined forces to support a single, secure specification for bank card
purchases on the Internet (CORP, July, 12, p. 4).  And VeriFone said
it was readying Virtual Terminal software that would replace a
retailer's "grey box" from VeriFone (CORP, Nov. 29, p. 6).  

     Other new product releases in 1995 included:

     *  More Choices for International Clients.  Cut-throat
competition in the states forced many vendors to expand their
marketing efforts overseas.  For instance, Citibank introduced a
European lockbox service that offers multi-currency, multi-country
collections from a centralized facility (CORP, Nov. 15, p. 4). 
Servantis Systems Inc. of Atlanta, installed Spanish language versions
of its PEP and Micro ACH (automated clearing house) applications in
Colombia (CORP, Sept. 20, p. 6).  Also, Chase Manhattan Bank of New
York, teamed with Eurogiro Network to provide Eurogiro customers in
Japan and Europe with cross-border U.S.-dollar checking and ACH
services (CORP, June 28, p. 8).

     *  Automated Wire Transfer Services.  PNC Bank Corp. of
Pittsburgh unveiled a service that allows companies to make payments
to trading partners by transmitting a single file detailing
disbursements and payment method (CORP, Oct. 18, p. 7).  The
Regulatory Assistance Center (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 8) and Western Union
Financial Services International (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 6) of Paramus,
N.J., also introduced enhanced wire transfer services.

     *  Electronic Banking Products.  Many vendors rolled out
electronic banking products in 1995 to tap into growing demand among
banks for the technology.  For instance, Servantis unveiled Bank
Street, a suite of products including Windows- and Macintosh-based
home banking software (CORP, Aug. 23, p. 7).  And US Order of Atlanta
introduced Electronic Merchant Center, which enables merchants to
present monthly bills to customers using the World Wide Web on the
Internet (CORP, Dec. 13, p. 7).  Sprint Corp. (CORP, Sept. 6, p. 5),
Union Bank of San Francisco (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 7), and Visa
Interactive, a subsidiary of Visa (CORP, Nov. 1, p. 7) also introduced
home banking products last year.

Trade Secrets vs. Freedom of Movement


People's willingness to change jobs for greener pastures is headhunters' stock
in trade, so the recent spread of non-compete and confidentiality agreements
for card professionals is cause for their concern.

"I can understand a non-compete agreement for senior executives, but it's
becoming more common for lower-level employees, and you didn't see that a few
years ago," observes Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc.  "It is
even occurring with entry-level jobs, and that is pretty scary."

Providian Corp., Capital One, and AT&T Universal Card Services are the only
major issuers that have gone this route for positions below top portfolio
jobs, but recruiters worry the practice may spread.  "Providian is extremely
litigious, and they have sued a manager two years after he left, and a junior
person was threatened with a suit," says a recruiter who requests anonymity.
She frets those kinds of actions will have a "chilling" effect on job-changing
in the industry.

A Providian spokesperson won't comment on any legal actions taken by the
company, but adds, "We don't require non-compete agreements, and we never
have."  However, all employees are required to sign a confidentiality
agreement as a condition of employment.

Confidentiality and proprietary agreements usually are sufficient to protect a
company's interests, notes Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human
resources at Capital One Financial Corp., but there are some extremely
sensitive areas such as modeling that rate special treatment.  "As competitive
pressure increases, non-compete contracts have the potential to become fairly
common," he says.  "Companies in trouble will make outrageous salary offers to
get trade secrets if they feel they need them for survival."

Card Executives' Platinum Paychecks


In the not-too-distant past, before the shareholder- rights movement began and
corporate directors found themselves staring down the barrel of
multi-million-dollar lawsuits over executive compensation, corporations had a
free hand to reward senior executives as the board saw fit, sometimes in spite
of company performance.  Shareholder militancy and Internal Revenue Service
rule changes have changed all that, and boards of directors go to great pains
to justify the pay they grant to upper management.  Bonuses and long-term
incentive payments are playing a bigger role than ever before, much to the
chagrin of executives at floundering companies.  But for the fortunate few in
America's growth industries, the rewards have never been greater, and few
industries in the 1990s can match the growth record of the credit card
business.

In the coming months, compensation committees will be reviewing 1995
performance and determining how to reward the officers who produced those
results.  If last year is any indication, that will mean hefty paychecks for
credit card executives, both those who manage portfolios and those in related
service companies.

Performance-based pay is resulting in a windfall, as proxy statements make
clear, with many of the industry's top executives clearing more in bonus pay
than base salary.  And bonuses tell only part of the story:  between
restricted stock grants, options, and assorted perks, card bosses find
themselves in a position that Jay Gatsby could appreciate.

And why not?  Industry growth continues apace, and the competition that occurs
at the account level carries over to the executive suite.  If corporations
want to keep dancing with the guy they brought in-and almost all of the top 20
card executives are men-they had better be willing to match or exceed what the
captains of their ships could command elsewhere.

The same reasoning is being applied at second and third levels of management,
and even below.  Pay for performance, skill-based pay, and related
compensation approaches are translating into fatter paychecks for more people.
By the same token, employees at under-performing firms are faced with static
base pay and a bonus cupboard that's fairly bare.

Meanwhile, democracy is coming to card shops in that more employees are
getting bonuses and stock options.  But that also means that many employees
now face new financial risks.

Compensation Pacesetters

To get a measure of the current state of the card industry's paychecks, Credit
Card Management reviewed 1995 proxy statements issued by more than 30 publicly
held card issuers, bank holding companies, and card-related service firms.

Those reports dramatize the increasing importance of bonuses based on
corporate performance.  Last year, a third of the card industry's top
executives received more money in bonuses than base pay; on average, bonuses
equaled 89% of salary.  Two years earlier, only 11% of those officers received
more in bonuses than salaries, and the average bonus was only 60% of base.
Those who successfully enhance shareholder value stand to reap substantial
rewards.

Executives from so-called pure-play card companies dominate the list, in part
because of the enormous growth experienced by firms such as MBNA Corp.  and
First USA Inc., but also because of the nature of proxy statements.  Only the
five highest-paid officers are presented in those reports, and very few credit
card executives number in those ranks at bank holding companies.  Citicorp's
Roberta Arena may direct a $35 billion asset, but unless one's title includes
the word "chairman" at Citi, an individual will not be in that group.  As
executive vice president of bank cards, Arena rates an honorable mention in
Citi's proxy, along with a score of other execs, but that only means her
salary and bonus were somewhere south of $1.7 million in 1994.

Multi-Tiered Rewards

Since taking over American Express Co.  in the wake of 1991's Optima debacle,
Harvey Golub has engineered a noteworthy turnaround at the
travel-and-entertainment card king, refocusing attention on the core business
while tripling net income over 1992's level.  A bonus that's 255% of base pay
vaults Golub to the top of the card pack in terms of 1994 income, and two of
his lieutenants join him on the list of the industry's 10 best-paid
executives.  In contrast, the failure of Golub's predecessor, James D.
Robinson III, to achieve financial objectives in 1992 cost him a substantial
part of his bonus and, ultimately, his job.

Salary and bonus alone ignore substantial additional pay, including long-term
incentive payouts to Golub of $1.8 million in 1994, vesting in restricted
stock grants, and stock options that have boosted his stake in AmEx to 227,162
shares with an option for 752,500 more.

Not far behind was Charles M.  Cawley, whose salary and bonus more than
doubled to $2 million.  Not coincidentally, corporate net income increased
$58.8 million to $266.6 million.  Cawley was rewarded with an additional
$1,025,000 in restricted stock.

Paychecks for card issuers are fatter than their vendor counterparts, with one
exception:  Pat Thomas, chairman of the recently-merged First Financial
Management Corp., stands head and shoulders above the field, with bonuses
accounting for the bulk of his $6.8 million package for 1994.  That's
significantly above the chairman of First Data Corp., the firm that acquired
FFMC, parent of National Bancard Corp.  (NaBanco), Telecheck, Nationwide
Credit, and other payment-industry companies.

Besides its richness, Thomas's deal with FFMC was an anachronism in an era
when the compensation committees of corporate boards set executive wage
packages.  Thomas enjoyed a personal-service contract that stipulated a bonus
of the lesser of 2.5% of corporate income before taxes or the market value of
94,500 shares, with a minimum bonus of $1.8 million.  He also received options
on 500,000 shares, participation in incentive plans, and various perks,
including payment of premiums on $5 million worth of life insurance and
personal use of the corporate jet, a $59,073 value in 1994.

FFMC had 1994 revenues of $2.2 billion, up 25% from the prior year and
consistent with a 29% compounded growth record over the previous five years.

Bonuses at Risk

In contrast to Thomas's bonus, Henry C.  Duques, chairman of First Data,
technically received no bonus, but that's deceptive.  Duques's package
reflects a growing management trend toward risk-based rewards for managers.
Some corporations, including Household International, are requiring senior
executives to purchase stock, and others are granting all rewards in the form
of stock and other instruments whose value is determined by company
performance.

In Duques's case, a 1994 performance grant worth $3 million was granted.  Half
of that amount was in the form of options on 372,088 shares at $40.31; in
mid-1995, shares were trading at $63, a nifty $8.4 million gain if the option
was executed.  The other $1.5 million is dependent on First Data's return on
equity in 1995 and 1996.

A similar calculated gamble is being taken by Capital One Financial Corp.'s
top executives, Chief Executive Richard D.  Fairbank and President Nigel W.
Morris.  In September, the two agreed to forego cash bonuses and stock options
until the turn of the century in exchange for a one-time grant of 1.5 million
and 1 million shares, respectively, at $29.19 per share.  Half the option
vests only if the share price reaches $37.50; the balance vests in increments
up to $50.

Their potential $52 million windfall in five years comes at the cost of
generous bonuses in the past.  In 1994, when Capital One was spun off by
Signet Banking Corp., Fairbank netted $8.08 million and Morris $4.35 million
in cash and restricted stock.

Golden Handcuffs

Stock performance is a major factor in most executives' incentive plans.
Typically, a hypothetical investment of $100 in the corporation's stock is
compared over time to a similar investment in a peer group's stock or a
general index.  If target prices are exceeded, the pool of incentive pay goes
up accordingly; if objectives are not reached, some or all of the pool is in
jeopardy.

Earnings per share or net profits often determine to what extent executives'
incentive pool will be funded.  Often, disbursements are in the form of
restricted stock that vests in three to five years.  "It's more of a golden
handcuff than a lucrative element of the compensation package," says Donald M.
Cunningham, principal of Tulsa, Okla., recruitment firm BankSearch Inc.

A 25% gain in stock value in 1994 was sufficient cause for rejoicing by
marketer Ideon Group Inc.'s directors to boost bonuses beyond the maximums set
in 1993.  Maximum incentives of 30% to 120% of base pay had been set from the
manager to the chief-executive level, but the compensation committee was so
pleased with the organizing work for the cobranded PGA Tour Partners card that
it awarded bonuses of 160% of base, and 190% in the case of Chief Executive
Paul G.  Kahn.

Unfortunately for Ideon, the PGA card has not lived up to expectations, and
the firm has had a shaky 1995.  Top management shares the down-side risk,
which was not the case under former Chief Executive Steven J.  Halmos, who
resigned in late 1992, when the stock lost 13% of its value.  Halmos received
$2.65 million in salary and no bonus in 1991 and 1992, but that compensation
approach ended with a 1993 amendment to the federal tax code.  The amendment
restricts the deductibility of compensation over $1 million unless
pre-established performance goals are met.  That's why corporate boards now go
to considerable lengths to justify executive pay in proxy statements.

Top executives who derive all of their compensation from base salary are a
rarity, and the same is becoming true of lower-level managers.  Restricted
stock seldom is part of compensation at the second and third tiers, but stock
options and other perks are beginning to filter down.  Signing bonuses and
generous relocation packages are becoming more prevalent, recruiters report,
particularly for positions with highly valued skill sets.  BankSearch's
Cunningham cites the case of a collections supervisor who received perquisites
with little or no relation to the job.  "An auto came into play even though it
was apparent he was desk-bound," Cunningham recalls.

Comparative Pay Scales

With the vast majority of management jobs in the $50,000 to $150,000 range,
credit card recruiters focus their energies filling those posts.  Wide
disparities exist for comparable positions in different geographic areas and
between banks, but generally managers at the low end are garnering bonuses of
5% to 7% of base, vice presidents and assistant vice presidents typically fall
in the 10% to 15% range, and higher-level executives can realize up to 30% of
base in annual bonuses, recruiters say.

A risk analyst probably will enjoy slightly higher pay by working in a card
program as opposed to mortgage lending, auto loans, or some other area of a
bank, but the main distinction is demand.  While he predicts "tremendous
growth both in terms of the number of jobs and the compensation" for debit
card marketers in the next five years, headhunter George C.  Genel concedes
debit counterparts "are probably paid a little less" than their opposite
numbers in credit.

Even in customer service and collections, "credit card people tend to be paid
better than their retail-banking counterparts because they're recognized as
more crucial to the success of the card business," suggests John D.  Walp, who
recently left CoreStates to become director of compensation and human resource
systems at Advanta Corp.  "Customer-service staffers do double duty because
they also act as salespeople, whereas their counterparts in a branch may only
answer questions."  Collections on unsecured loans also are more sensitive
than an auto loan for which the bank has recourse, Walp adds.

Nonbanks and pure card issuers such as Advanta rate an edge in pay over their
bank counterparts, recruiters indicate.  GE Capital Corp.  is consistently
cited as a leader.  "They want the best people, and they live in an expensive
market (Connecticut)," explains New York recruiter Nancy Griffiths.

Marketers in Demand

With competition heated for new accounts, card marketing specialists are one
of the industry's hottest commodities, with top people almost finding
themselves in a bidding war for their services, Cunningham notes.  Salary
spikes in the 30% range have occurred over the last two years for
product-management and marketing jobs, he says.  One prospect he was wooing
was offered a 25% pay hike to $93,500 in a less-expensive market, but turned
it down, believing an even more attractive offer will soon come his way.

Recruiter Donald D.  Duggan of Westminster, Colo., says that prospect may be
right.  A marketing manager he recently recruited also received a 25% raise, a
$10,000 signing bonus, a guaranteed bonus of $10,000 the first year, and a
relocation package "that will put $4,000 to $5,000 extra in his pocket," says
Duggan.

"The business has gotten more sophisticated, and complexity has made the
second- and third-level managers more valuable," agrees recruiter Judy Collins
of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest.  Ten years ago, she was placing
credit policy and risk managers in $45,000 jobs; today, the same positions
command $70,000 to $80,000.

Equity Positions

Signing bonuses are becoming quite common, according to Genel of Thousand
Oaks, Calif.  "Most companies will purchase the old home of a person who has
to relocate after 60 to 90 days, and perhaps pay the points and fees to close
on the new house," he adds.  "Bonus programs that used to top out at 10% now
are at 12% to 15%, and people are reaching those caps."

The biggest potential bonus is equity in the card portfolio itself.  Companies
like Capital One have a distinct advantage over banks in tendering that bonus
to the rank and file.  Once its initial public offer was complete and its fate
was no longer tied to Signet's, where poor performance in other business lines
could mitigate sterling card results, Capital One had the latitude to reward
risk-taking that boosts the bottom line in a way banks cannot, Dennis H.
Liberson, vice president of human resources, says.  It began last March by
unveiling a stock option plan called OneGrant that extends all the way down to
the mail room.

OneGrant entitles every full-time worker to buy up to 200 shares at the
then-current price of $19.31 per share.  Half the options vest after two years
and the balance in March 1998.  And while many option offers expire in three
to five years, Capital One employees have 10 years to exercise them.

OneGrant "whetted associates' appetite" for the employee stock-purchase plan
that came next, according to Liberson.  All staff members can now designate up
to a 15% payroll deduction for the purchase of Capital One stock at 15% below
the market price.  By year-end, participation had climbed to more than 800
employees, almost a quarter of the work force.

At one point last year, employees had realized paper profits of about $2,000
apiece on their options.  A subsequent price dip all but wiped out that gain.
Management recognizes the need to balance the goal of building an
entrepreneurial spirit with the demoralizing effect plummeting stock prices
can have, particularly on young staffers inexperienced in the ways of the
market.  "We knew a correction would come, but that long-term we could drive
stock appreciation," Liberson says.  That's why the company limited the amount
that employees could invest, even in the case of middle- and upper-level
managers.

Non-Financial Goals

A third program dubbed Entrepreneur Grant rolled out in September.  The 50 top
managers, excluding Morris and Fairbank, could swap up to 25% of their base
pay and bonuses over the next three years in exchange for stock options; 43
took advantage of the offer and eventually will own about 286,000 shares.

Participation was unanimous at the senior level, Liberson reports, though some
managers with less disposable income elected not to enroll (the program
included managers in the $50,000 to $60,000 range).  "A mandatory stock-option
approach would not work very well because it could create financial stress for
some associates," Liberson explains.  Likewise, granting restricted stock to
executives would not motivate them as much to drive up stock prices as an
option plan in which their own cash is at risk.

Bonuses can be paid to virtually every AT&T Universal Card Services Corp.
employee, though they have less to do with financial performance than how well
customer service is delivered.  "We can measure 100 different processes daily,
from telephone response time to the accuracy of invoices, and every
measurement has a defect standard," says Ira S.  Walter, UCS's director of
human resources development.  A bonus is paid quarterly based on the number of
days the standard was met; bonuses typically are in the 8% to 10% range for
customer-service operators.

Financial performance comes into play in management ranks, but even there
customer service impacts pocketbooks.  "Every single employee, including the
CEO, has an element of their bonus that depends on customer delight," says
Walter.  "What determines long-term success is customer loyalty, and we want
to engage everyone in that focus."

Bonuses of 30% for senior-level positions at AT&T are common, recruiters
indicate.  Walter declines to comment on specifics, but says, "we are willing
to pay significantly more than the competition if they earn it.  We
participate in salary surveys to determine compensation rates, so we know
we're competitive."

Downside of Risk

Although Advanta has several lines of business, three-quarters of revenues
derive from credit cards, so performance in that arena dictates overall
performance and share value.  Employees at every level are invited to take an
ownership position through a stock purchase plan and a 401-k plan that
includes Advanta stock as an investment option.  The stock purchase provides a
15% price discount and is limited to 15% of compensation.  "The trend
definitely is to be more inclusive in making bonuses an integral part of the
compensation package, so that pay has some risk involved, based on company
performance," Walp says.

Jack B.  Hofmann, Advanta vice president of human resources, willingly accepts
the risk of staff angst if the stock takes a bath.  "We're not the kind of
place that attracts people looking for security," he says.  "We generally
attract people who are willing to put their pay at risk.  That makes for a
more highly motivated work force."

The danger is that employees may end up sharing risks in market forces over
which they have no control.  A case in point is the collections area, where
consolidation is occurring at a rate significantly above that of card
issuance.  Smaller firms are ill-equipped to compete, and shareholder value is
plummeting for some.  A $100 investment in Payco American Corp.  in 1990 was
worth $59.14 at the end of 1994, and that drop is reflected in the pay of top
executives.

Top managers at Payco saw their bonuses slashed 10% last year, resulting in 4%
declines in total compensation for the two top executives.  Stock options
haven't been a factor in their packages since 1992.  And while there's
justification in holding a president and chairman accountable for a decline in
corporate profitability, the connection becomes more tenuous when people have
a limited impact on strategic success.

That may have been part of the thinking of Hatim A.  Tyabji, president and
chief executive of terminal maker VeriFone Inc., who asked his board to forgo
cash bonuses for himself and other executives after earnings and stock prices
dipped in 1993.

Though VeriFone's performance improved in 1994, Tyabji made the same request
last year.  Instead, he asked that cash bonuses be used for a cash and
time-off bonus program for all employees.  The board agreed and also granted
stock options to the executive officers.

VeriFone's balancing act is instructive for all corporations as incentive pay
continues to get pushed further down the line.  Everyone enjoys sharing the
rewards, but there's a limit to the amount of risk that can be imposed on the
rank and file.

Sweeter Deals for Entry-Level Workers


Compensation that reflects shareholder value is a given for occupants of the
executive suite, but the same philosophy is being extended all the way down to
entry-level service workers at some card shops.

Performance bonuses are most common in collections and recoveries, an area
where the cost-effectiveness of rewarding top performers is easily measured.
"It's easy to create incentives to make sure your top performers get the most
pay in that area, but it's more of a challenge to incent strict
customer-service jobs," says Kathy A.  O'Doherty, human resources manager for
First Chicago Corp.'s First Card operation.

Advanta Corp.'s Jack B.  Hofmann isn't so sure.  "There are all kinds of ways
to make call-center jobs fun while linking them to clearly defined outcomes,"
the vice president of human resources believes.  Trips and prizes, in addition
to cash, are all part of the incentive mix for hourly employees at Advanta.
"People are motivated by more than money," Hofmann says.  "They want to be
challenged and recognized."

Customer service and other hourly positions are pegged to the going wage rate
in a geographic market, not to any prevailing industry rate, points out Jo
Anne R.  Moeller, who oversees compensation for Banc One Corp.'s 50,000
employees.  But being competitive isn't enough when full-tilt expansion is on
the agenda, and that's the challenge faced by Capital One Financial Corp.,
which intends to add 1,000 entry-level jobs in the Richmond, Va., market alone
this year.

To increase the desirability of Capital One over other local firms, the
company is rolling out a benefits package that includes health insurance for
all associates working 20 hours or more per week, and three weeks vacation
after a year.  "We're competing for people in a very tight labor market,"
explains Dennis H.  Liberson, vice president of human resources.

Thus, Capital One decided to reallocate resources to reward people more in the
earlier stages of their careers rather than on the basis of seniority and
position.  By slashing employee attrition and going to more of a managed
health-care approach, Liberson expects the new benefits package to end up
costing the same as the program it replaces.

Liberson also expects retention of longer-term employees to be aided by the
stock-option plan Capital One introduced in March.  Besides giving employees a
very real stake in the company's performance, that program is creating
stock-ticker watchers out of 20-something workers with no investment
experience.

The change is reflected in the types of questions top executives hear at
monthly "town meetings" for employees at various Capital One facilities.
"They're fielding fewer questions on mundane, trivial personnel stuff, and
more on the company's business strategy and stock price," reports Liberson.
"The climate is different."

Number-Crunchers Are a Hot Commodity


For young people interested in a career in credit cards, here's a word of
advise:  buy a calculator, get a pocket protector, and master the art of
mathematical model-building.  The credit card industry wants numbers people,
and it's bidding up the price for good ones.

"The competition this year for credit policy and risk specialists is tougher
than I've ever seen it," one frazzled card recruiter reports.

With one eye on rising delinquencies and the other on analysts' resumes,
portfolio managers are trying to hire the experts who can minimize losses and,
hopefully, boost profits.  Helping to make these skills white-hot is
competition for those experts from new quarters.  Long-distance telephone
companies and utilities are discovering a need for risk-management help, and
they are bidding for the services of the banking industry's stars in risk
scoring, credit policy, and modeling.

"Data is data, and if you can leverage it into a model that reduces losses or
increases profitability for an issuer, that can mean millions of dollars to a
company," says Rita Raz, principal of Analytic Recruiting Inc., a New York
firm specializing in placing people in analytical functions.  "An analyst with
one year's experience can pretty much move anywhere in the country."

Recruiter Judy Collins of Sales Consultants of Chicago Southwest points to the
work of Fair, Isaac and Company and CCN-MDS in modeling for sparking the job
boom.  "The tools became available for this business, and that is creating the
demand for people with backgrounds in math, computer science, or some other
numbers-type of degree," she says.

On the other hand, people with general management backgrounds may find the
going rough in the coming years.  "It's a soft market for people-to-people
skills," Collins notes.

The Nine Lives of Dale Browning


You might say, card industry utility man D.  Dale Browning can't resist a
challenge.

When asked by friends to evaluate Golden, Colo.-based ProCard Inc., a
struggling procurement card company they were thinking about investing in,
Browning quickly accepted.  After weeks of review of the ProCard operation and
its strengths and weaknesses, Browning returned to his friends with a 30-page
report, a two-hour presentation, and the conviction that ProCard had
potential.  "The more I studied the company, the more I concluded that it has
a very, very good product," he says.  "But it had not been marketed properly
and not enough money had been put behind it."

So, when his friends asked Browning to invest in the 6-year-old privately held
company, "I thought about it for a week," Browning says.  "Then I said I
wouldn't make an investment unless I could manage the company.  They agreed."
Once again, the industry veteran found himself in the middle of an emerging
market:  the corporate purchasing card arena.

Indeed, it came as no surprise to friends and industry observers that Browning
jumped at the chance to pump new life into ProCard.  Browning has decades-long
experience in all facets of the card business, is familiar with procurement
card programs, and has a track record of operating successful card programs,
says Denny D.  Dumler, president of Visa Plus, Visa's on-line global
automated-teller-machine network.  Dumler worked closely with Browning for
nearly 25 years, first at Rocky Mountain Bankcard System and later at Plus.
"I can't think of anyone better equipped" to run ProCard, Dumler says.  "He's
a real giant in the industry."

A Pioneer

Browning's professional life has been one of breaking new ground, first in
bank cards-in 1969, he participated in the creation of BankAmericard, the
forerunner of Visa-and later in electronic banking and debit cards-he served
on a committee that designed the first off-line debit card, which evolved into
the Visa check card.

And Browning's accomplishments didn't stop there.  During his 25-year tenure
at Colorado National Bank, he made the Denver-based bank a force to be
reckoned with in both consumer credit cards and electronic banking.  In 1968,
he founded Rocky Mountain BankCard System, the card issuing subsidiary of
Colorado National Bank, and one of the largest bank card processors in the
western United States.  While there, he helped develop a card program for the
U.S.  government, a prototype for what is now known as a procurement card.

Browning followed that in 1982 with the creation of Plus System Inc., a
regional electronic banking network which later evolved into the first
national automated-teller network in the U.S.  And he served as president of
CNB and Rocky Mountain from 1986 until November 1993.  He continued as chief
executive of Plus until 1993 when Visa took over that company.

At that time, Browning became senior consultant to Visa International.  And
when offered the opportunity to take over ProCard, he couldn't refuse.  "The
more time I spent at (ProCard), the more intrigued I was with the software,"
he says.  "The software was quite flexible.  The enhancements they were
working on would greatly increase their ability to compete and handle
additional volume."  ProCard's PC-based software provides an integrated
purchasing card management system designed to reduce the administrative costs
of procurement card programs.

In addition, Browning says, "I was impressed with the people who worked
there."

To be sure, ProCard-which provides backroom support for banks offering
corporate card products and services-has a lot going for it.  An early entrant
in the corporate purchasing card arena, it serves four banks nationwide-First
National Bank of Chicago, National City Bank, NationsBank, and Cass Bank, the
nation's largest freight-payment provider.  In September, when Browning took
over as president and chief executive, some 420 corporations, including 100
Fortune 500 companies, used ProCard services.  During the first few months
under Browning, ProCard added about 120 new corporations and was in
discussions with about a dozen others.

Different Direction

But ProCard was a victim of its own success:  It had trouble keeping pace with
the demand for its services.  In early September, the company had a backlog of
80 corporate users waiting for software to link the ProCard system to their
general ledgers, Browning says.  And that slowed system growth in both volume
and number of customers.

Despite these problems, however, ProCard is the right product for the right
time, Browning says.  "The timing is right," he says.  "Within the last year,
there have been more banks committed to procurement or purchasing card
programs than in all the years prior.  It's going to be like a snowball going
downhill."  Indeed, the volume on ProCard cards alone is increasing by 20% a
month compared to a year ago, Browning adds.

But before ProCard can reach its potential, it needs to head in a different
direction, Browning says.  Under the strategy mapped out by ousted founder and
former chief executive Stanley Anderson, client banks had to conform to
ProCard's requirements.  For example, ProCard worked exclusively with
MasterCard International.  "This company is no different than other software
companies," Browning says.  "It should support all products irrespective of
how they're branded in the marketplace."  ProCard now works with both the Visa
and MasterCard associations.

Anderson says he planned to make ProCard brand neutral, but was initially
limited to MasterCard because ProCard was using software from Columbus,
Ga.-based processor Total System Services Inc.  that was compatible only with
MasterCard's system.

ProCard also used to work exclusively with a single processor-Total System,
another fundamental mistake in Browning's eyes.  "A company should be
responsive to the needs of the banks, not make the banks go with its
processors," he says.  ProCard is negotiating agreements that enable it to
link up with any processor.

What's more, ProCard formerly required clients to buy the entire procurement
card package, from software to training to client services, Browning says.
"We debundled all that," he says.  "A bank can select and choose what services
it wants to buy.  It doesn't have to buy the whole package."

The ProCard package enables banks and their corporate clients to review, edit,
audit, and reconcile bank card transactions on a daily basis and
electronically post the purchases to the companies' general ledger systems.

European Retreat

After assuming control of ProCard, Browning also shut down the company's
European office.  "In my view, we hadn't capitalized on the opportunities in
the U.S.  For this company to take on the responsibility (of the European
market) meant we'd have to expand at the expense of the U.S."  Ownership of
the European operation-Ireland-based ProCard Inc.  Ltd.-was awarded to
Anderson when he left the company in July.

But even this shift in underlying philosophy isn't enough to guarantee success
for ProCard.  In its rush to meet customer demands for specialized information
reporting, ProCard "spent quite a bit of money putting in fixes to systems"
rather than looking at what enhancements the program might need in the long
term, Browning says.  "Now we're reallocating resources on working on a
completely new system with all the enhancements," he says.

ProCard is expanding beyond transaction processing to providing value-enhanced
functions, for example, breaking out information for corporations required to
report on transactions with minority vendors.  Those enhancements are
scheduled for release in mid-1996.

Already, ProCard has corrected many of the problems resulting from its rapid
growth.  Since taking over at ProCard, Browning has funneled more resources to
upgrading software and hardware to cope with the expected growth in volume.
The new product system-expected to be in place by the middle of this
month-will handle four times the volume and do it in half the time, Browning
says.

And the company also has eliminated the 3 1/2 month backlog of some 90
corporate clients waiting to come up on the ProCard system by hiring 10
additional computer programmers.  "Now we have a backlog of 30 companies,
which is super.  That's as fast as we can do it," Browning says.  "The
turnaround from the time the corporation signs and the custom programming is
less than four weeks."

ProCard has also added new staff to go out to the corporate clients and train
their employees.  And the company is setting up a customer-service center that
will take calls directly from the banks' procurement card customers, rather
than having the corporate customers call the bank first.  "The bank won't have
to build its own infrastructure," Browning says.  "The bank tells us how they
want the calls handled.  And the (corporate) customer will think he's dealing
with the bank."

With all these changes, Browning says he believes ProCard will be able to
capture a large share of the procurement card market.  But he concedes that it
will take time to get ProCard back on track.  "In a couple of years, we'll get
the company going down the right path," he says.

If that happens, Browning will have yet another success story to add to his
list of accomplishments

Catch-Up Time At MasterCard


In an exploding U.S.  debit card market, the contest for bank card association
supremacy is turning into more of a rout than a race.  For while MasterCard
International and Visa U.S.A.  offer similar products and both have
implemented aggressive marketing strategies, Visa has solid control of the
off-line card market, and is processing millions more on-line point-of-sale
transactions monthly.  Now MasterCard, with new leaders at its debit helm, is
trying to pull something out of its hat that will cut into Visa's lead.

Through the first half of 1995, 5.8 million MasterMoney off-line cards had
been issued by 665 financial institutions, compared to 25.1 million Visa check
cards by 1,808 issuers.  MasterCard refuses to release transactions figures
for its Maestro on-line debit product, but analysts believe it is low.  Visa's
Interlink, meanwhile, is the largest on-line POS network, processing more than
15.8 million monthly transactions.

It's against this background of Visa dominance that Purchase, N.Y.-based
MasterCard is launching different marketing projects while simultaneously
adjusting to management changes.  Last summer it was announced that G.  Henry
Mundt III, president of MasterCard's Cirrus System Inc.  global automated
teller machine network, would become executive vice president of MasterCard's
Global Debit Services Group, replacing John O.  Smith who planned to retire at
year end.  Steven L.  Van Fleet is replacing Smith as general manager of
Maestro International.

And in October, Arthur Kranzley, who headed Maestro in the U.S.  since its
formation in 1993, left to become senior vice president for Horsham, Pa.-based
Advanta Corp., a non-bank financial-services provider and a major credit card
issuer that employs former MasterCard chief Alex W.  "Pete" Hart.  Kranzley's
replacement has not been named.

Hard Press

Though Mundt emphasizes that the personnel moves will not affect MasterCard's
strategies and that most of the MasterMoney and Maestro management teams are
unchanged, analysts still expect it to be years before MasterCard is able to
significantly reduce Visa's debit lead in the U.S.  Observers attribute
MasterCard's position to its previous debit strategy that emphasized Maestro's
international expansion, rather than MasterMoney's or Maestro's domestic
growth.  Most U.S.  card issuers give off-line cards marketing priority
because the products generate much larger interchange revenues ("The Debit
Card Balancing Act," December, 1995).

"When MasterCard was building up Maestro, Visa was putting the hard press on
the Visa check card," says D.  Mark Jackson, vice president of St.
Louis-based Boatmen's Bancshares, a leading MasterMoney issuer.  "After
MasterCard redirected it focus, Visa check card already had a huge lead.  And
once a bank is issuing cards, it is hard to get them to change brands."

Visa gained its off-line advantage in spite of MasterMoney's interchange fee
schedule that generates higher transaction revenues for issuers than does the
Visa check card.  On a $100 non-supermarket purchase, MasterMoney acquirers
pay card issuers between $1.31 and $1.69 for electronic transactions, compared
to $1.08 when a Visa check card is used.

Among the strategies used by Visa to expand Visa check card issuance are
market launches in specific cities that feature month-long advertising
campaigns utilizing such vehicles as newspapers and radio.

Assisting Issuers

With Visa dominating the off-line market, MasterCard finds itself working
harder to expand its presence.  The association is running television
commercials that explain how MasterMoney operates.  And MasterCard's 1996
focus will be to assist issuers in broadening their card bases, and triggering
more activity.  Initiatives will include regional and local advertising,
including direct mail.

"The bottom line is that Visa and MasterCard have good off-line debit products
and there is a still huge, uncommitted, market out there," Mundt says.  About
65% of financial institutions are not yet issuing off-line cards.

But while MasterMoney is gaining strength domestically, Maestro's strongest
impact has been overseas.  Though only about 13 million Maestro cards have
been issued in the U.S., 100 million cards are committed worldwide.  Maestro
is particularly strong in Latin America, where 5.5 million cards have been
issued in the last two years in such countries as Argentina, Chile, Ecuador,
Colombia, Mexico, Panama, and Venezuela.

This strong international activity eventually will spread to the U.S., Maestro
executives believe.  Mundt projects Maestro's growth rate will exceed that of
Cirrus.  The ATM network, which had volume of just 60,000 transactions during
its first year in 1983, is expected to have processed more than 300 million
transactions in 1995.  Maestro has more than 55,000 merchant locations,
compared to more than 64,000 for Interlink.

Shifting Emphasis

To stimulate Maestro expansion in the U.S., MasterCard is shifting its
emphasis from issuers to signing merchant acquirers.  The association's goal
is to have the nation's top 50 credit card acquirers processing Maestro
transactions this year, up from 36 in 1995, and it is aggressively lobbying
independent sales organizations to sell Maestro to merchants.  Maestro also
teamed with terminal vendor VeriFone Inc.  in 1995 for a so-called Travel
Destination Program.  In that program, acquirers in key traveler locations
that sign merchants to accept Maestro receive such awards as VeriFone
terminals and personal-identification-number pads.

MasterCard expects 5,500 PIN pads and 400 terminals sets will be distributed
in the program.  Analysts estimate more than $200,000 worth of hardware will
be awarded.

Merchants also will receive price breaks on terminals as an incentive to
upgrade or trade in devices so they can support such products as debit cards
and smart cards, and electronic-purse and cardholder- loyalty programs.
Merchants and acquirers that move from paper-based systems to electronics also
will receive processing discounts.  Furthermore, Maestro is targeting
merchants that traditionally have shunned debit cards, including such chain
retailers as apparel and shoe stores, lower-cost hotels and motels, and
car-rental agencies.  MasterCard is launching a pilot with its St.
Louis-based BankMate shared regional network and Enterprise Rent-A-Car for
debit card acceptance in 20 Midwest locations.  "There is a huge market for
merchants where the customer has to pay in advance," says Carl Stefanelli,
Maestro vice president.

Momentum

By getting more merchants on board, Maestro is trying to ride an expansion
wave created in 1995 when San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, a founding
member of Interlink, left the Visa-owned network for Maestro.  Wells is the
third-largest on-line card issuer as well as the third-largest debit acquiring
institution.  Factors that prompted the move included MasterCard's long-term
strategies, pricing, service levels, and partnerships.

"MasterCard is very focused on the on-line product, which is what Wells Fargo
needed for our customers," says Debra B.  Rossi, Wells Fargo senior vice
president, adding that the association doesn't short the MasterMoney card,
either.  "They don't rob Paul to pay Peter," she says.

Yet, even with its initiatives, Maestro still has a long road to travel before
it matches Interlink's activity.  When both networks went national in 1992,
Interlink already was the largest regional POS network in the United States,
with strong name recognition and activity on the West Coast.  Maestro started
from scratch.

"Maestro's problem is that it lacks the visibility of Interlink," says an
industry consultant familiar with MasterCard who insists on anonymity.  "It
will be more difficult for them to expand in the U.S.  than even for the
regional networks, which already have a solid market penetration."

But with its strong international presence and new domestic tactics,
MasterCard's debit movement could just be starting to hit stride.  "Our
strategy is the right strategy for a global basis," Mundt says.  "On-line,
PIN-based debit is where people want us to go."

Throwing Down The Gauntlet


The foreign invasion of the burgeoning point-of-sale market in the United
States is getting stronger with the entry of another international powerhouse.
Scotland-based De La Rue Fortronic, which controls a large chunk of the
European terminal market, has begun a North American operation in Hartland,
Wis., with a strategy of opening additional U.S.  offices and creating a
national sales force.

De La Rue is joining the stream of international vendors positioning for the
expansion of smart card programs.  While the company has shipped more than
400,000 terminals overseas and controls 45% of the United Kingdom market, 35%
of the German market, 60% of the Norwegian, and 70% of the POS terminal market
in the Netherlands, De La Rue's U.S.  presence is slight, with its terminals
just being used in small pilots.  But the company could soon become a North
American fixture.

More than 50% of De La Rue's revenues are projected to be generated from the
U.S.  within five years.  It expects to open offices on the East and West
Coasts, with a sales force situated throughout the continent.  "We're not a
flash in the pan," says Phillip Johnston, De La Rue Fortronic president.  "We
have the money and backing to make a big impact."

Laying a Foundation

De La Rue already has started laying the foundation for its North American
push.  Currently, it is the only supplier of devices for London-based Mondex's
electronic purse program, and Wells Fargo Bank is using De La Rue terminals
for its employee test of the Mondex system in Wells' San Francisco
headquarters ("Mondex Leaves the Station," October, 1995).  Guelph, Ontario,
will launch a city-wide Mondex pilot next year.  De La Rue also expects to
supply at least half the terminals for Visa's stored-value program that will
be launched in Atlanta in July in conjunction with the 1996 Summer Olympics.
More than 5,000 merchant locations are expected to accept smart cards in the
Atlanta area.

Yet, in addition to smart card tests, De La Rue is moving into more mainstream
markets.  It is selling an unspecified number of its F95 POS devices and
software to Atlanta-based processor Nova Information Systems for deployment in
hotels and motels.  Nova recently combined its merchant bank card business
with First Union Corp.'s and First Fidelity Bancorporation's, creating the
nation's eighth-largest merchant-processing operation servicing more than
90,000 retailers.

Nova selected the De La Rue devices because the terminals have memory that is
several times greater than other vendors' devices that sell for a similar
price, says Joseph P.  Cohane, Nova vice president.  The enhanced capacity
will permit Nova to support a variety of applications on a single device, such
as frequent-user programs and check-guarantee services.

The processor also wants to support smart card programs, and De La Rue devices
are successfully operating in European chip card programs, such as Mondex in
England, Cohane says.

Starting from Scratch

But while De La Rue is the latest in a growing list of foreign-based vendors
pushing into the North American market, the company is following a
less-traveled path by starting its operation from scratch instead of
purchasing an established American company.

Before setting up shop in the U.S., De La Rue's terminals were distributed
domestically by Hartland-based Direct Data.  When Direct Data ceased
operations last September, De La Rue created its own U.S.  operation to have
stronger control over the sales and marketing of its devices.  Its Hartland
headquarters will handle sales and marketing, software development, product
management, distribution, and customer service.  Terminals will be
manufactured near De La Rue's Dunfermline, Scotland, world headquarters.

Even as De La Rue gets its house in order, executives say the company already
is well equipped to take market share away from the U.S.' two largest and
better-known terminal vendors, Redwood City, Calif.-based VeriFone Inc., and
Phoenix-based Hypercom Inc., in addition to other players that have increased
their marketing efforts in the last year, such as Minneapolis-based DataCard
and Redwood City-based Atalla.  The company has deep pockets, a strong product
line, and international success.  Its parent company, The De La Rue Group, had
operating revenues of $1.2 billion last year with a profit of $230.4 million.
De La Rue Fortronic generated $45 million in revenues.

The company also can leverage a 600-person service organization situated
across the U.S.  that currently services the The De La Rue Group's other
banking products, such as coin counters.  Johnston says De La Rue will
emphasize its full range of offerings to prospective customers, including
smart card applications; open architecture, which permits terminal users to
create their own software programs; and loyalty programs that can be tailored
to support individual retailers.  "We're the experts in smart card technology,
and if we didn't think we could gain major footing in the U.S., we wouldn't be
here," Johnston says.

Despite De La Rue's aggressive push into the U.S.  market, some of its more
established U.S.  competitors do not expect to change strategies to compete
with the upstart.  "I don't think (De La Rue) brings much to the party in
terms of technology," says Albert Irato, Hypercom president.  "It will have no
impact on us whatsoever."

The Line-Up

De La Rue's main products include the F95 terminal, which features 640
kilobytes of memory, an integrated printer, two-line display, and an optional
smart card reader.  Most terminals shipped over the last few years have only
32 or 64 kilobytes of memory.  Devices with greater memory can support more
complex and a greater number of applications, such as frequent-shopper and
smart card programs, in addition to standard debit and credit.  The terminal
sells for under $400.

The F105 product, which is being used in the Mondex program, features a
display which permits consumers to view the balance remaining on their
stored-value cards.  The device is priced at approximately $500.

In addition to supporting Mondex, which has 8,000 cardholders and 750
merchants participating in an electronic-purse program in Swindon, England, De
La Rue has supplied more than 2,000 F95 devices to Shell Oil Co.  that are
being used in a British customer-loyalty program.  De La Rue also will supply
terminals for Visa smart card pilots this year in Australia and Canada.

But while De La Rue is active internationally, its key aim is to import that
success to the U.S., and some analysts believe the company has the ability to
gain a domestic toehold.  "It will be an uphill battle for De La Rue, but they
have the resources and a good track record in Europe," says Jerome Svigals, a
Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.  "There is a big market and
De La Rue could very well be a successful contender."

Some More Elbow Grease, Please


Faced with fiercer competition than ever, credit card marketers returned to
the basics when they advertised their products in 1995.  The mind-numbing
onslaught in 1994 of ill-conceived television commercials featuring big-budget
special effects and print ads narrowly focused on price ("The Best of a Bad
Lot," December, 1994) were replaced by higher-quality work that deftly put
brand image first and product information second.

That's not to say card marketers have abandoned playing up key selling points,
such as interest rates and rebates, in their ads.  On the contrary, that
nuts-and-bolts technique flourishes in direct mail, where introductory
interest rates and other cardholder perks routinely appear on the front of
envelopes to draw consumers into the offer.

While the entries submitted for this year's Credit Card Management Card
Industry Marketing Awards earned higher marks from the marketing experts the
magazine assembled to judge them, the overall quality of the entries fell
short of winning the judges' highest praise.  Card marketers have plenty of
room for improvement, the judges say.

Judging the television commercials and print ads was Richard Kimmel, president
of Chicago-based Kimmel & Co.  J.  Randy Howell, vice president and senior art
director for Chicago-based DraftDirect Worldwide, judged the direct-mail
pieces.

The ads submitted in the print and television categories that failed to earn a
thumbs up were sunk by story lines irrelevant to selling credit cards,
non-distinctive brand positioning, and poor execution.  "Consumers simply
won't take time to unravel the message of a poorly constructed ad," Kimmel
argues.

At the same time, many of the direct-mail entries were weakened by verbose
copy and one-size-fits-all product positioning.  "There are really no rules
when it comes to the creative side, but successful direct marketers know their
target audience and don't make the package threatening or difficult to
understand," says Howell.

Given the shortcomings of this year's contestants, only four entries earned
recognition in the television and print categories, rather than the usual
five.  Nonetheless, our judges, both professional marketers, still found
several gems that clearly stated the brand image of the card and which were
supported by lucid copy points.

"Effective advertising takes a unique position in the marketplace," says
Kimmel.  "Unique positions can be successfully defended because they are
unlike those taken by competitors.  Consumers remember uniquely positioned
campaigns."

The surprise of this year's judging is that for the first time in the
seven-year history of the competition, neither American Express Co.,
MasterCard International, nor Visa U.S.A.  earned first-place honors in the
television category.  That distinction went to Citibank, which also netted top
honors in the print category.  Stern's, a division of Federated Department
Stores Inc., finished atop the heap in direct mail.  All observations are
based on our judges' comments.

Category:  Television Commercials

Television is one of the most power advertising mediums available because it
can use emotion and information to seize, define, and fortify a product's
position in the marketplace like no other medium, says Kimmel.  This year's
winning television ads do just that.  "Establishing a unique position is the
most important task of any ad campaign," says Kimmel.

First Place:  "Tuxedo,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.

After years of being a bridesmaid, Citibank finally gets to the awards altar
with this story of a T-shirt and jeans guy who doesn't spend a lot of money on
clothes, but who decides to go all out for his wedding day by purchasing a
tuxedo.  He pays for the tux with, you guessed it, his Citibank card.  Why
should viewers care?  Because Citibank was conscientious enough to call the
young man to make certain that the charge for an expensive tuxedo, an atypical
purchase for him, wasn't fraudulent.  It's the kind of service people don't
expect from a card issuer, but which makes the bridegroom very happy.

"This is the type of ad that takes a position in the market and builds a brand
image," says Kimmel.  "Citibank not only says it has a good product, it does a
wonderful job of telling people they give them something more than a credit
card-they serve the customer.  It's a well-executed commercial."

Second Place:  Toys 'R Us Visa,Bank of New York.  BBDO New York.

Ad agency BBDO uses clever camera angles and a play on words to bring a
fun-and-games perspective to a credit card that earns cardholders discounts on
toys based on their spending.  The slick-looking sports car the narrator is
sitting in as he informs prospective customers they can earn discounts toward
a new car when they buy a set of tires turns out to be an optical illusion.
The auto actually is a toy photographed to look like the real thing.  So, too,
is the boat hitched to the car, which the narrator says also can be bought at
a discounted price.

After dazzling viewers with this photographic hocus-pocus, the narrator
succinctly explains the card's benefits-discounts earned on Toys 'R Us
purchases for each transaction.  "The photographic sleight of hand is very
appropriate and doesn't divert viewer's attention from the sales message,"
says Kimmel.  "The benefits of the card are clearly spelled out.  It's a
charming piece of work."

Third Place:  "Vacation,"Citibank.  Lowe & Partners.

This story of a dad doing his job as a father is the follow-up to Citibank's
top-ranked "Tuxedo."  There's Dad talking about a recent family getaway.  One
day the wife informs him the family needs a vacation, the next day Dad is
packing everyone up for a road trip-it's his job.  Once on the road, the
family spends "a gazillion dollars" buying cheap souvenirs that will wind up
collecting dust in the closet.  Dad begrudgingly pays for it all because it's
his job.  Soon afterward, the family car breaks down.  Dad gripes and moans,
calls a tow truck and pays for the repairs-it's his job.  Dad's choice of
currency?  His Citibank card, which takes care of all his credit needs-that's
Citibank's job.

While this commercial effectively builds on the brand positioning in "Tuxedo,"
it could have more clearly explained the benefit of packing a Citi card when
mishaps occur, says Kimmel.  "You're guessing at the what the benefit is," he
explains.  "It's not clearly explained how Citibank solved the problem in a
way no other issuer can.  But it's still a good piece of work."

Fourth Place:  "Locked Out,"American Express.  Ogilvy & Mather.

Celebrities make effective product endorsers, because the sight of them
instantly grabs viewers' attention.  In this spot, comedian Jerry Seinfeld
engages in a ridiculous romp after locking himself out of his apartment while
preparing for a date.  Dressed only in a bathrobe and with just minutes before
his date arrives, Seinfeld, who just happens to have his AmEx card, dashes
across the street to buy a suit.  Emerging moments later in his dapper duds,
Seinfeld pulls together all the pieces he needs for a magical evening.  In
whirlwind fashion he tracks down a locksmith to open the door to his
apartment, purchases a bouquet of flowers and hires a quartet.  He even buys
an umbrella when an unexpected rain shower kicks up.  All the purchases are
made possible by his AmEx card.  His apartment door unlocked moments before
his date arrives, Jerry has enough time to ice the champagne for his big
night.  Too bad the door lock jammed, and he can't let his date in.

While this ad scores high marks for clearly telling viewers in a creative way
that having an AmEx card can get them out of tight situations when they have
no cash, Seinfeld's trials are too far-fetched to convincingly support that
idea, Kimmel argues.  This ad has the ingredients to have placed higher, but
in its current state it is not in the same league as the top three finishers.

Category:  Print Advertising

Critics who argue print advertisers need to shift their focus away from image
toward price may want to rethink their case.  Consumers don't respond to the
hard sell from print ads.  Instead, they expect print ads to tell a visual
story that establishes a brand image.  "You can't shout numbers at people when
they aren't listening," says Kimmel.  This year's print ad winners do nothing
of the sort.

First Place:  Citibank.  Lowe and Partners/SMS.

Citibank strikes gold again with this clever play on the old adage that people
can't judge a book by its cover.  Two photos, one of a menacing motorcycle
rider and the other of a nerdy looking fellow, are juxtapositioned to make a
strong point about the value of Citibank's photocard.  The headline next to
the biker's photo says, "This is you."  The photo next to the nerd says, "This
is the creep who stole your wallet."  The copy at the bottom of the ad
explains that a Citibank photocard provides cardholders with the security of
knowing that if their card is ever lost or stolen, con artists will have a
tough time using it.  "The ad gets to the point, explains the value of the
product, and does so with a sense a humor," says Kimmel.

Second Place:  F&M Bank, Winchester, Va.  Barber Martin & Associates,
Richmond, Va.

The strength of this ad is its headline, "The Credit Card For People Who
Thought They Couldn't Get One."  It quickly grabs the reader's attention and
draws him into the copy points, where the value of the product is clearly
explained.  A brief description of how a secured card works is also included.
Since the only graphic elements are a photograph of an F&M card and the bank's
logo, the art direction doesn't get in the the way of the message.  "This ad
is clear and distinctly positions the product," says Kimmel.  "The headline
addresses the target audience.  It's not the most charming or personable ad,
but it is effective."

Third Place:  The Associates National Bank.  Parrish Wickersham & Partners,
Dallas.

This ad targeted at the coveted college-student market uses flippant MTV-style
graphics and a pointed headline, "Are You Ready for the Real World?"  to grab
the reader's attention.  The centerpiece is a picture of the Earth, over which
several statements about the everyday financial problems facing college
students are pasted.  Smack dab in the middle, in bold type, is the headline.
Succinct copy explains why students can benefit from an Associates credit
card, which sets up the tag line, "Real Plastic for the Real World."

"This ad is irreverent enough to spark the curiosity of college students,"
says Kimmel.  "It is pointed and makes the product sound useful enough to meet
their needs."

Fourth Place:  Old Kent Bank.  Felder Communications Group, Grand Rapids,
Mich.

This ad hawking Old Kent's Card Miles program, through which cardholders can
earn discounts on airline tickets, gets right to the point.  Key selling
points are summarized in bullet fashion-free airline tickets for all U.S.
airlines can be earned with 20,000 Card Miles, and there are no blackout
periods restricting the use of the tickets.  Copy points that explain
cardholders earn Card Miles points for all transactions, even for everyday
purchases such as gas, groceries, or dry cleaning, rescue a headline that is
too pointed-"Turn groceries into free plane tickets."  A winning effort, but
plenty of room for improvement, says Kimmel.

Category:  Direct Mail

Direct mail is the medium for the hard-sell, because consumers expect to be
bombarded with special deals through the mail.  The key, however, is not to
create a piece that makes consumers feel unimportant by using transparent
flattery or pitching an offer that they may feel is unaffordable, which in
turn makes them feel inadequate.  "Effective pieces address who their
customers are and what they want," says DraftDirect's Howell.  "Know your
market."

First Place:  Stern's (a division of Federated Department Stores Inc.)
Heinrich Marketing.

What puts this piece above the competition is the simplicity of its message.
The oversized envelope displays part of a $20 bill in a window, which
immediately implies the offer brings savings.  To the left of the window is a
green border-the color of money-with the headline, "What You See Is What You
Get."  At the bottom of the envelope is a tag line, "Extra Cash the Next Time
You Shop."

Inside, the letter features a $20 coupon good toward Stern's charge card
purchases.  The letter clearly lays out the benefits of accepting Stern's
preapproved credit offer:  a $20 coupon, and an additional 20% off purchases
the first day the card is used.  A postscript at the bottom of the page lists
the location of the Stern's store nearest the prospect.  The back side of the
letter displays a map listing the addresses of the 27 Stern's stores in New
York and New Jersey.  "This offers implies real value without talking down to
the customer, and summarizes the key points," says Howell.  "There is no
guessing as to what the offer is about."

Second Place:  Bank of New York.  Gillespie Advertising Inc.

This entry for Bank of New York's Toys 'R Us Visa earns high marks for its use
of four-color printing and the continuity of its marketing message throughout
the entire package-"Turn everyday spending into free toys."  The message is
repeated on both sides of the envelope.  Inside, a four-color, tri-fold flier
featuring silhouettes of children playing and the Toys 'R Us logo explains how
cardholders earn a 3% rebate on Toys 'R Us purchases and a 1% rebate on all
other purchases.  The rebates are redeemable toward discounts on future
purchases at Toys 'R Us as well as Kids 'R Us clothing stores.

The flier also mentions a program to earn discounts on family vacations
through Toys 'R Us.  The letter features the added caveat of a $10 Toys 'R Us
coupon for accepting the preapproved offer.  "It's a gorgeous package," says
Howell.  "There is continuity to the message in all the elements, and the
offer gets right to the point."

Third Place:  REI/SeaFirst Bank.  Hunt Marketing Group.

Using a plain, brown envelope with forest-green lettering and brown paper for
the letter gives this piece an understated look that plays to the austerity of
its target audience-outdoorsmen.  The envelope succinctly highlights the key
features of the offer:  no-annual fee, a 9.9% introductory interest rate, a 1%
rebate on purchases, and preapproved credit.

Inside, the brown-toned flier talks about Jack, a customer who earns 1%
rebates for purchases charged to his REI (Recreational Equipment Inc.)  gold
MasterCard, in addition to the rebates he earns as a member of REI's dividend
program.  These perks enabled Jack to not only buy a new parka for his wife,
but for himself, which makes Jack a "very happy camper."  "The color of this
package is not atypical, which helps it overcome initial consumer resistance,"
praises Howell.  "It has a simple, responsible look that appeals to its
audience."

Fourth Place:  Marine Midland Bank.  Marketing Resources.

This piece for Marine Midland's Humane Society Visa earns high marks for its
unconventional envelope headline, "The Visa Card Most Preferred by Everyone
From Alligators to Zebras."  Supplementing the idea are pictures of the
aforementioned animals.  A teaser rate of 9.9% and preapproved credit also are
highlighted.  Additional selling points, such as emergency card replacement
and a 24-hour toll-free customer-service number, are bulleted.  Inside, a
tri-fold flier and letter explain the card's services, and how the Humane
Society benefits from the card's use.  "The package has a little fun with the
idea of helping protect animals, and plays with the idea of covering
everything from A to Z with its envelope message," observes Howell.

Fifth Place:  Humane Society/PNC Bank.  Marketing Resources.

Unlike television and print advertising, where brand image is more critical,
numbers can still make the biggest impression in direct mail.  The strength of
this entry is its envelope, across the top of which are emblazoned three
figures, 8.75%, $0 and $5,000.  The numbers are designated, respectively, as
the introductory interest rate, annual fee, and maximum credit limit for the
card being pitched.  Underneath these figures is the headline, "Sometimes the
numbers speak for themselves."  Inside, a tri-fold flier, featuring a
question-and-answer section, addresses pertinent information about the card.
The letter includes a chart comparing interest rate charges paid on higher
rate cards to those on the PNC card for the same balances.  "This is an
easy-to-read piece that telegraphs the sales message and gets people inside
the package," says Howell.  "The flier tackles marketing points about the card
that may have fallen through the cracks, but the numbers say it all."

CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Love Letters From Wall Street


Despite the continued growth of major credit card issuers, Wall Street is
keeping one ear cocked for the first sounds of retrenchment in the extremely
competitive card issuing market, which explains the lukewarm reception to some
of the issuers' stocks.  But the same apprehension doesn't apply to
transaction processors, who are emerging as favorites of the investment
community.  Analysts have awakened to the realization that no matter whose
card consumers decide to carry and whether or not they pay balances off every
month or heap on more revolving debt, processors stand to gain from electronic
payment's growing share of consumer spending.

Though some processors are heavily dependent on a few large customers, buy
recommendations far outweigh hold positions, and nobody is urging investors to
sell.  As a consequence, stock prices for these firms are posting some
impressive gains, and analysts are bullish about the long-term outlook for
card processors.

From Wall Street's perspective, these are computer-services firms, and in that
category they are stars.  Recurring revenues are part of the appeal:  whereas
a software firm starts off each quarter with zero revenues, processors can
count on a steady income stream from merchants locked into multi-year
contracts.  Those revenues will only go up, too, as plastic increases its 7%
share of consumer discretionary spending.  And processors are positioning
themselves as turn-key payment solutions, with check-verification and
guarantee services, debit card acceptance, and any other non-cash payment
option that surfaces, such as corporate purchasing cards and stored-value
cards.

The processing business has fundamental strengths that appeal to many
investors.  The consolidation that is occurring among processors means a
bigger slice of an expanding pie for those that remain.  New competitors face
huge barriers to entry, and the economies of scale keep getting better.

The 800-Pound Gorilla

That said, observers nonetheless are keeping an eye on firms such as AT&T Co.
and Microsoft Inc.  that might try to make a name for themselves in card
processing.  MCI Telecommunications Corp.  gained a stake in 1993 when it
bought BT North America's processing operation.  More recently it acquired SHL
Systemshouse Ltd., a Canadian systems integrator, says Patrick M.  Burton,
information processing analyst at Lehman Brothers.  Still, new entrants are
almost obliged to find a strategic partner to compete, and the business's high
capitalization costs primarily benefits leading processor First Data Corp., he
says.

Indeed, the arrival of processing's proverbial 800-pound gorilla didn't dampen
investors' enthusiasm.  In the wake of Hackensack, N.J.-based First Data's
purchase of First Financial Management Corp., analysts retained their upbeat
prognostications for the other players.  And why not?  The only processors
they expect to take it in the neck, at least in the short term, are merchant
banks such as First National Bank of Omaha and Bank of America that compete
with FDC in the merchant end of the business.

Analyst Steven S.  Birer of Hambrecht & Quist, San Francisco, has buy
recommendations for First Data and Riverwoods, Ill.-based SPS Transaction
Services Inc., noting the latter has been priced as an issuer since its
acquisition a year ago of electronic giant Tandy Corp.'s card portfolio, and
those price-earnings multiples typically are half the ratios of processors.

Value-Added Services

Meanwhile, FDC's versatility as both a merchant and cardholder processor has
captured investors' imaginations.  A wide range of value-added services can
now be promoted, including cash management and others that traditionally have
been the province of banks.  By virtue of its position as the largest merchant
and cardholder processor, FDC is in a position to offer services that other
acquirers have shied away from because of consumer privacy concerns, says
analyst Gregory M.  Gould of Goldman Sachs & Co.  For example, a deal could be
struck with a department store whereby cardholders invoiced by FDC would
receive on-the-spot discounts at those stores' cash registers, assuming FDC
drove them.

Since its spin-off in April 1992 from American Express Co., FDC has made five
significant purchases in the processing field:  NationalCard/NationalCheck
Processing Systems, TeleMoney Services, Envoy Corp.'s card business, Card
Establishment Services, and First Financial, parent of National Bancard Corp.
(NaBanco), the nation's largest merchant acquirer.  Between NaBanco, CES, and
its own in-house merchant-procession operation, "they must be approaching 30%
of the market," estimates Richard Robida, vice president and merchant
processing specialist with Speer and Associates.

For the time being, the situation at FDC is chaotic, with customers frustrated
and confused about which subsidiary is doing what, Robida says.  "For the most
part, the FDC/FFMC merger activities are happening behind-the-scene and our
clients' daily operation and service are not affected," a First Data
Spokesperson responds.  "Also, we're working hard to keep our clients,
employees, and shareholders informed about merger activities throughout the
transition."

But, once the latest merger is digested, banks that compete with FDC will face
a tough choice:  "Either they can become a low-cost provider and slug it out
for share, or adopt an exit strategy," he says.

Hambrecht & Quist's Birer altered his rating on National Data Corp.  to hold
after the FDC-First Financial merger was announced, reasoning that corporate
marriage "significantly changed the playing field."

Banker Exodus?

It's not just the analysts who have such opinions.  "The merger of First Data
and First Financial is going to create a significant amount of introspection
from the true bank card acquirers," suggests Richardson M.  Roberts, founder
and chairman of PMT Services Inc., who predicts many of them will conclude
card processing is divorced from their core business.  "This is more a
telecommunications business than a banking business.  It's not about making
loans, it's not just credit cards, it's a lot of other payment settlement."

If and when the major bank-owned merchant portfolios come into play, "I assure
you we'll be looking at them," says Roberts, who has been building a war chest
to make such a bid.

PMT, a Nashville-based independent sales organization that does business as
U.S.  Bankcard Center, received a warm reception last year when it became the
first ISO to make a public stock offering.  It priced at $8 a share in August
1994.  A second offering of 1.875 million shares in mid-September of 1995 sold
at $22.50 per share.  Six weeks later, the stock was hovering around $26.

Leveraged Growth

While allowing that quasi-processors like PMT inhabit a risky market niche
susceptible to high merchant turnover, analysts like their short-term
prospects.  Smith Barney rates PMT as a high-risk stock that will outperform
the market; Montgomery Securities rates it a solid buy.

Capital raised in its two stock sales gives PMT the ability to buy out more
competitors, something the firm has done 20 times in recent years.  The only
difference is, now it is able to buy bigger firms that cater to higher-volume
merchants than PMT traditionally has served.  That should give PMT more
leverage to drive down transaction costs while it improves service levels to
reduce merchant attrition.

Although most merchants are authorizing transactions electronically now, "a
third of them are still paper-based, so there is still great room for growth,"
Roberts says.  He estimates 800,000 to 1 million U.S.  merchants remain to be
converted.

With so many merchants likely to go electronic in the near future, Roberts
expects volume gains over and above the 15% to 20% annual transaction growth
forecast through the end of the century.  "At that point, credit cards will
only represent 17% of consumer payments," leaving room for considerable
growth, he points out.

Roberts was left with paper wealth of almost $18 million after selling
$675,000 worth of stock in September's offer.  He started the company in 1984
at age 26.  "Our success has convinced others that this is a great
opportunity," he says.

Uneasy Acquisition

Among the independent sales organizations eying a public stock sales, analysts
say, are Nova Information Systems Inc., which backed away from an initial
public offering last spring, and Gensar, which acquired the processing
operations of TransNet Inc.  three years ago.  Nova in November took over
First Union Corp.'s merchant portfolio, which had $2.8 billion in charge
volume in 1994, in return for First Union taking a 35% equity stake in the
processor.

One of the few processor sour notes in 1995 was sounded by retail card
specialist SPS Transaction Services, and that occurred through no fault of its
processing business.  Analysts fingered the recently acquired, $920 million
Tandy credit card portfolio for the blame.  That situation only fortified
investors' reservations about the card-issuing business:  even as the market
in general and the pure card issuers in particular continue to defy
predictions of a slowdown and post huge gains, issuing's inherent risk makes
them skittish.  The stock prices of issuers often take nose dives when reports
about higher delinquencies, chargeoffs, and bankruptcies come out-and such
reports may increase in the coming months.

By comparison, processors' predictable earnings are a safe haven for anyone
interested in investing in the card industry.  "SPS's stock had gone to $30,
but they had a little bit of a stumble with the Tandy portfolio and they
failed to hit their earnings projections," points out Burton of Lehman
Brothers.  "They need to regain their earnings momentum."  SPS had been
selling at about $26 a share in November, the same price it was at 12 months
earlier when it split two for one.

Among the current crop of publicly traded processors, Atlanta-based National
Data Corp.  is the only one that isn't drawing raves from Wall Street.
Montgomery Securities' Richard K.  Weingarten rates NDC a buy, but others in
the investment community are more reserved.  "It's not that there's a
particular problem," says Interstate Johnson Lane's Sandra Barker, who picked
up NDC two years ago and has rated it a hold ever since.  "It's more a
valuation comment than anything."  With the stock's price up about 40% in
1995, the P/E ratio is down to about 22 times 1996's projected earnings,
Goldman Sachs' Gould says.

NDC has slipped to a second-tier player in the front-end terminal driving
segment of the processing business, Speer's Robida says, with only Visa's
Merchant Bank Services and MasterCard's MAPP still able to challenge FDC for
supremacy.  Visa is aligning itself with Total System Services Inc.  as the
bankers' alternative to FDC.  NDC used to have a similar strategic alliance
with Total.  NDC also has been slow to move from a voice-authorization network
to an electronic authorizer, he adds, and that has hurt it, along with
business decisions in the past that alienated many bankers.

"That's absurd," responds a NDC spokesman, adding "the bulk" of NDC's
processing volume is electronic.  "You have to have some voice authorization
because your customers want it," he adds.

The richest processor stock is Columbus, Ga.-based Total, which trades at
about 50 times earnings.  Twelve years after its IPO, Total's parent, Synovus
Corp., still owns 81% of the stock.  Its high valuation makes Total the only
processor that Weingarten rates a hold.

Bullish Outlook

Weingarten forecasts 20% to 30% earnings growth for all of the half-dozen
processors he follows.  He characterizes the category as the new breed of
stock leaders, able to outperform the market year after year.  "Incentive
cards have helped processors gain tremendous share, but the real driver is
wider merchant acceptance," he says.  "When credit card growth slows, other
businesses like health care, stored-value cards, and electronic commerce will
start to feed in.  Twenty percent growth will continue for years."

Lehman's Burton is a little more restrained in his prognosis, but he too is
upbeat.  "The shift from cash and checks is continuing, and it could be
accelerating," he says.  He gives First Data and Check Free strong buy
recommendations, expects SPS to outperform the market, and rates St.  Paul,
Minn.-based Deluxe Corp.  (which acquired Financial Alliance Processing
Service, an ISO and processor) a hold.

Analysts fret about the impact on a processor if a large account should bolt.
Montgomery already has factored in the eventual loss by SPS of Lechmere, a
northeastern retailer that was acquired by Montgomery Ward a year ago and is
expected to take its processing business to GE Capital after court proceedings
are settled.

No other client danger flags are being raised, however.  Total relies on the
AT&T Universal card for a large share of its processing volume, but a
long-term extension last year gives the analysts comfort.  "It would concern
me more if the contract was coming up for renewal," notes Larry Hickey of
First Analysis Corp.  With NationsBank and Bank of America now working with
Total, the company isn't overly dependent on any single client, he points out.

The riskiness of credit granting keeps investors up at night and makes them
skittish about the pure card stocks like Advanta Corp., MBNA Corp., First USA
Inc., and Capital One Financial Corp.  The processors, on the other hand, are
a safe harbor and a good way to cash in on plastic's transformation to a major
transaction device.  As one analyst observes, "Boring is beautiful."

Indeed, the boring predictability of card processors' growth rates and margins
of 20% for the foreseeable future make this one of the most appealing classes
of stock on Wall Street.

CREDIT CARD MANAGEMENT via NewsNet
JANUARY, 1996

Detente for Lawyers And Collectors?


Three years ago, they were the new kids on the block.  But now, electronic
attorney collection networks are proving themselves by boosting recoveries of
charged-off credit card debt and relieving card issuers of some of their legal
burdens.  And collections agencies, many of which vehemently opposed the
lawyer networks muscling their way onto collectors' turf, now are beginning to
accept the newcomers.

In fact, it's going beyond mere begrudging acceptance.  Some collections
agencies themselves have already formed or are planning alliances with
attorney networks.  And at least one agency might even create its own attorney
network.  "They're not mutually exclusive anymore," says Warren S.  Rosenfeld,
managing partner of McNeily, Rosenfeld & Associates, a Washington, D.C., law
firm that operates the Rosenfeld-Net.

Equifax Inc., the big credit-reporting agency that also owns a major
collections company, Equifax Risk Management Services, crystallized the new
attitude last October when it formed a venture with Rosenfeld's firm called
Litigation Access Web.  "The backdrop is the collection agencies have felt
this was our turf and were very reluctant to send any accounts out, or refer
to attorneys," says Lyle F.  Herrmann, Litigation Access Web product manager.
"And the attorneys were saying, 'why use collectors?' There was some finger
pointing and bragging rights-me, me, mine, mine, mine.  But there is an
effective place and role for the agency-type collector, and there is an
effective role for litigation."

Moving Closer

The folks who give the collections agencies and lawyers their business are
voicing similar opinions.  "Both sides are moving closer to each other," says
Eugene V.  Brugger, recovery manager for Columbus, Ohio-based Bank One
Columbus, which uses the National Attorney Network for part of its recovery
work.  "I think there's a realization that there's money to be made by
collaboration."

Besides NAN and Rosenfeld-Net, there are now several other attorney networks
(box, page 52).  They include the National Association of Retail Collection
Attorneys' NARCA-Net; Dozier Legal Network, a subsidiary of the Richmond,
Va.-based Dozier and Associates P.C.; and the network run by the American
Association of Collector Attorneys.

While the networks vary in the range of services they offer and technological
capabilities, the common thread is that they allow card issuers to place
charged-off accounts and supporting documents with law firms electronically.
That reduces the paper burden, and some networks make it easy for issuers,
using computers and software linked to the networks, to keep track of
litigation and the performance of each firm.

The networks also can quickly place accounts with their law-firm members,
which means issuers' lawyers can devote most of their attention to monitoring
what the firms acting on their behalf are doing rather than hunting for
competent attorneys wherever they have deadbeat customers.  "We're dealing
with one attorney instead of 50 attorneys in 50 different states," says Edward
J.  Casey, collection and recovery manager for Bridgeport, Conn.-based
People's Bank, which uses Rosenfeld-Net.  "It takes a big burden off of us."

Growth Industry

Sensing a growing need for such tracking and oversight services, the attorney
who founded the Dozier Legal Network, John W.  Dozier Jr., stopped doing
actual collections work last year when he founded his namesake network.  "We
came to the conclusion that in order for this to work, we (shouldn't be) a law
firm trying to run a computer network, we needed to be a technology company
providing a legal application," says Dozier, who hopes to have more than 400
law firms affiliated with his network by year's end, compared with 70 at the
end of 1995.

Indeed, the attorney networks almost unanimously are reporting strong growth.
AACA's network placed 16,000 accounts worth about $70 million last year, but
President Raymond J.  Cook projects 30,000 accounts and $140 million in
placements this year.  "Credit grantors want to try something different than
the traditional 'we'll place it with a collection agency approach,'" Cook
says.

Despite the networks' growth, one factor reducing tensions between the lawyers
and the collectors is the overall growth of the card industry.
General-purpose card receivables grew 20% in 1993 and 19% in 1994, and 1995's
growth will probably come close.  Such huge growth means lots of charged-off
debt even though credit quality, while showing some signs of fraying, still is
high.  In fact, card issuers probably can expect to recover about $2 billion
this year.

Thus, even some collectors who expressed deep skepticism about the new
attorney networks ("This Is No Lawyer Joke," April, 1994) profess today that
they're not too worried.  "From my personal perspective, they've not taken
anything at all (from us)," says Craig J.  Costanzo, chairman and chief
executive of Management Adjustment Bureau, a Buffalo, N.Y., agency that
handles about $100 million in charged-off card debt annually.  "There's just
so much business out there, it's unbelievable."

Doubling Recoveries

While a majority of the attorney networks have only brief track records, some
are starting to rack up impressive numbers-and thus forcing collection
agencies to take notice.  GE Capital Corp., the nation's largest third-party
retail card issuer, started placing accounts for legal action through
Atlanta-based NAN in 1994.  For the first nine months of 1995, recoveries
through NAN were 106% higher than they were for accounts placed for
conventional legal action in the same 1994 period.

The reason?  The electronic network makes it easy to monitor each account's
status, and to compare the performance of the approximately 70 law firms GE
Capital uses nationwide.  With more than 300,000 charged-off store card
accounts being placed for legal action yearly, fewer cases are getting lost in
the shuffle, says Mary K.  Kinsey, senior vice president of collections
services for GE Capital Credit Services.  "It really forces them (law firms)
to look at every single account," she says.

Money on the Table

While there are wide variations among individual issuers, collections experts
estimate that less than 5% of charged-off accounts-perhaps even as low as
2%-result in litigation.  But some observers say that as many as 10% of
deadbeat accounts should be litigated-a goal that's hard for national issuers
to hit as they struggle to manage dozens of law firms handling thousands of
cases.

The attorney networks say they can get the cases into court that should be in
court.  NAN's president, attorney Douglas W.  Wallace, says his network is
aiming for $1 billion in placements this year, compared with 300,000 credit
card claims for just over $500 million in 1995 and 120,000 claims for $240
million in 1994, the network's first year.  He estimates about 70% of the
cases referred to the 165 law firms in the network result in lawsuits.  "It's
a given that legal action is more effective than any other form of recovery,"
says Wallace.

Adds St.  Louis collections attorney Donald B.  Kramer, president of Kramer &
Frank P.C.  and founder of NARCA:  "Credit card issuers are used to getting a
6% recovery from collections agencies.  Attorneys can double or triple that as
long as they give the attorney enough time.  The agencies pour out the
pressure in the first 60 days, but if you look at the end of two years, they
attorneys absolutely kill the agencies."

Collection agencies, meanwhile, disagree with the practice by some issuers to
send certain deadbeat accounts directly to lawyers, even though agencies might
produce as good or better recovery rates.  "I think clients are making a poor
decision in sending straight to a network," says one collections executive who
insists on anonymity.

Though collections agencies may disagree with the attorneys' bluster, growing
numbers are acknowledging that lawyers have an increasingly important role in
recovering bad debt.  "I do believe that agencies, by not aligning themselves
with attorneys, are leaving a lot of money on the table," says Douglas B.
Schultz, chief executive officer of United Recovery Systems Inc., a Houston
collections agency which does work for seven of the 10 largest card issuers.
"I do see attorney-agency alliances in the future."

With that in mind, Schultz is considering a partnership with one of the
networks, though he hasn't decided on which one.  He might even form his own
network.

Profit Issue

And while Schultz can get along with lawyers, he nonetheless has some
misgivings about a formal business partnership because of the profit question.
If the issuer-client lets his agency keep 35% of the recovered debt, but the
lawyers take 25%, "that leaves only 10% for me," Schultz says.  And that thin
margin could be reduced even further depending on which party has to absorb
the court costs, he adds.

Still, Schultz thinks allying with attorney networks at the very least makes
sending paperwork back and forth easier-and thus makes clients happier.  And
if he can show card issuers that his recovery rates are going up because of
more legal action, so much the better, because it will bring more volume to
the agency.  "I don't think there's that much profit for the agencies, but
it's another option," he says.

Equifax retains an average of 33% of recoveries and hopes to make its new
Litigation Access Web service profitable by asking clients to absorb the court
costs.  As of early December, some 800 accounts had been referred to the legal
service, but Equifax's Herrmann says it's still too soon to quote recovery
rates.

Clearly, however, Equifax is looking to feather its already large collections
nest-$3 billion a year in placements, about a third of which is card debt-by
adding the legal network to its roster of services.  "We wanted to prove to
the industry that we could take the high road to have our collection-agency
business work hand-in-hand with an attorney network," says Herrmann.

Equifax's basic criteria for referral to the network hinges on the account
balance (less than $1,000 is less likely to be litigated), the span of time
since a payment, and whether the debtor has a valid address and is employed.
Debtors with jobs and assets upon which a court can slap a lien, such as a
house, are most likely to be sued.

Issuers and attorneys still have to be very careful about which consumers they
intend to sue.  Management Adjustment Bureau's Costanzo, who still remains
wary of the attorney networks, notes that the federal Fair Debt Collection
Practices Act makes it illegal to threaten lawsuits unless the threat is
followed by action.

But Banc One's Brugger says that his bank, for one, is scrupulous about what
it tells debtors.  "The only time we'll tell customers we're going to sue them
is if we have the intent," he says.

Ironically, the number of Bank One's lawsuits against cardholders has gone
down recently, according to Brugger who did not cite specific figures.  He
attributes that to more diligent work by the attorneys early in the process.

Even Costanzo concedes that correspondence from an attorney can scare payments
out of recalcitrant debtors.  "The fact that they send a letter out on an
attorney letterhead is very helpful," he says.

And as that notion gains more and more currency among issuers' collections
managers, the future looks increasingly bright for the attorney networks.

Send In the Repairmen


It's been well over a year since major amendments to the federal Bankruptcy
Code took effect.  The amendments were hailed by many creditors, including
credit card issuers, as important changes which would both curb bankruptcy
filings and significantly enhance bankruptcy recoveries.  To date, neither
benefit has materialized, although some of the amendments have had positive
results.

Indeed, bankruptcy filings have been on a 12-month increase.  When the final
1995 numbers are made official, total filings for the past year will likely be
in the neighborhood of 920,000, which would be the third-highest yearly total
ever.  The rate of increased bankruptcy filings for the past four quarters
echoes the bankruptcy explosion of the mid-1980s.

The 1994 Bankruptcy Code amendments also have yet to significantly increase
per-case recoveries.  As a result, card issuers are becoming more vocal in
demands for a further tightening of bankruptcy laws.

The Good News

One of the several positive changes made in 1994 was the raising of the
Chapter 13 debt ceiling to $250,000 of unsecured debt and $750,000 of secured
debt.  This allows more consumers to seek relief through reorganization of
personal debts under Chapter 13, as opposed to filings under Chapter 7, in
which the debtor's assets are liquidated, or Chapter 11, in which business and
personal debts are reorganized.  In the later two cases, recoveries to card
issuers have always been lower.  In some of the areas of the country, Chapter
11 filings have declined, while Chapter 13 filings have increased, although
only marginally.

Another positive change which holds promise for the long term was the
streamlining of the reaffirmation process by eliminating the need for court
approval.  By signing a reaffirmation agreement before a bankruptcy discharge
is entered, a debtor agrees to continued liability after bankruptcy.  Those
debtors who sign such agreements usually do so to avoid a creditor's complaint
contesting the discharge where the account was loaded up with charges before
the bankruptcy filing, or where an issuer has offered to let the debtor
continue to use the card account after bankruptcy.  The latter group includes
a growing number of issuers who see reaffirmation as a good way to cut
bankruptcy losses.

A third positive change was extending the so-called pre-bankruptcy presumption
period, during which the charges are presumed to be nondischargeable, to 60
days.  The presumption applies to both cash advances and luxury goods and
services where either exceeds $1,000.  This change is reported to have
effectively enhanced issuers' ability to quickly settle potential
dischargeability claims for relatively large sums.  Because so few accounts,
relative to total bankruptcy filings, have activity which rises to the level
of fraud required under the present bankruptcy code standard, actual increased
recoveries from this change, while significant, have not been dramatic.

Finally, the 1994 amendments created the National Bankruptcy Review
Commission, comprised of nine appointed members who have begun their two-year
mission to review the bankruptcy laws, take testimony from affected parties,
and make recommendations to Congress regarding future amendments.  While it is
a positive development to have a focal point for change, the obvious downside
would be congressional reluctance to consider changes before the commission
has weighed in with its report almost two years from now.  Issuers should,
therefore, consider a dual approach to reform:  long-term advocacy through the
commission and, hopefully, faster-track changes by seeking direct legislative
input into needed amendments.

Exemptions

A negative change in the 1994 law was the increase in the dollar value of
property debtors are allowed to protect from sale by a bankruptcy trustee.
The so-called federal-exemption amounts were doubled across the board.
Examples include the homestead exemption which was increased from $7,500 to
$15,000 ($30,000 for a married couple), and the household-goods exemption
which was doubled to $8,000 ($16,000 for a married couple).  Although the
federal exemptions only apply in 15 states, at least two of the 35 other
states have recently increased their exemption amounts.  One was California,
which doubled the exemptions available to its residents, citing the federal
increase as a basis.

Because so-called asset Chapter 7 cases can take two years or longer to
liquidate, it is still too early to tell the effect of the exemption change.
But because every exemption dollar comes directly out of funds which would
have otherwise gone to unsecured creditors, the negative effect will certainly
be significant.

Much of the past and present volume of bankruptcy filings is attributable to
the marketing of bankruptcy, both direct and indirect.  Indirect marketing
includes word of mouth (with almost 1 million filings per year, there are a
lot of voices out there), newspaper coverage (it is virtually impossible to
find an issue of any major-market newspaper that does not include an article
about a well-known company's or celebrity's bankruptcy filing), and how-to
books about bankruptcy.

All of these indirect marketing aspects have resulted in the almost complete
erosion of the stigma once attached to filing bankruptcy.  Yes, bankruptcy
still is an extreme emotional hardship for most people, but the reluctance to
file is much easier to overcome in an environment where famous individuals and
companies are often perceived (usually incorrectly) to be using bankruptcy
relief as a mere financial-planning device.

By far the most effective bankruptcy marketing, however, has been what is in
effect direct marketing by debtors' attorneys.  They have done an excellent
job of making consumers aware of the bankruptcy option through advertisements
in the Yellow Pages, newspapers and on television, and through targeted mail
sent directly to persons facing lawsuits for defaults.  It is no coincidence
that the bankruptcy explosion of the 1980s came on the heels of the Supreme
Court's relaxation of advertising restrictions upon attorneys.

Countering the Messages

In the face of this successful marketing of bankruptcy, major issuers have
been attempting for some time to communicate the negative aspects of a
bankruptcy filing to customers, most importantly a bankruptcy's negative
affect upon obtaining future credit.  Many issuers have also been actively
referring delinquent customers to local branches of the Consumer Credit
Counseling Service as an alternative to bankruptcy.  Some issuers have
advocated placing national newspaper ads explaining non-bankruptcy options.

Just as important as combating bankruptcy marketing is the need to focus upon
improving recoveries from the increasing number of bankruptcies.  In this
regard, it is useful to look at the big picture which shows that, nationally,
almost 70% of consumer cases are filed under Chapter 7.  Of these, only about
5% result in any recovery to card issuers.  Issuers' main bankruptcy
recoveries have always come from Chapter 13 repayment plan cases which,
unfortunately, are less than a third of all filings.

The main avenue to a dramatic increase in bankruptcy recoveries, then, is to
shift as many Chapter 7 cases as possible into Chapter 13.  This has been
tried repeatedly by suggesting amendments to Congress which would eliminate
Chapter 7 or greatly restrict its usage.  The only such change ever actually
to survive the political process and become enacted was the largely
ineffective substantial-abuse provision, added in 1984.  That provision allows
the court to dismiss a Chapter 7 filing if the judge determines the case
constitutes an abuse of the law.  It was intended to directly force those
debtors with sufficient income to fund a repayment plan into Chapter 13.  But
because of procedural and substantive problems inherent in the wording of the
statute, the provision has never had the desired effect, and is ripe for
further amendment.

Rather than focusing solely upon tightening the availability of Chapter 7
relief, however, issuers should consider ways in which Chapter 13 can be
enhanced and thereby made more attractive to consumers.  A common complaint
among debtors' attorneys and Chapter 13 trustees is that debtors have no
incentive to repay unsecured creditors under Chapter 13.  This is because,
they argue, a Chapter 13 bankruptcy is just as likely to result in the denial
of future credit as is a Chapter 7 filing, and both types of filings are
reportable for up to 10 years.

The Reporting Issue

One way to enhance Chapter 13 would be to roll back the credit-reporting
period for a Chapter 13 filing while leaving Chapter 7 at 10 years.  If, for
example, Chapter 13 filings could only be reported up to six months after
discharge, it might be anticipated that many debtors would opt for Chapter 13
as the best way of rebuilding their credit.

The Chapter 13 option would be further enhanced if issuers were to adjust
their records upon receiving a Chapter 13 discharge to reflect a favorable
settlement.  They could also alter lending policies to provided that customers
who complete meaningful Chapter 13 plans would be considered for future credit
according to their individual circumstances, and not be denied credit
automatically because of a past Chapter 13 filing which affected the issuer.

With regard to post-bankruptcy credit, Chapter 13 trustees in Texas and Ohio
have had debtor-rehabilitation programs in effect for several years.  Under
these programs, debtors who successfully complete larger-percentage repayment
plans are considered on their merits for new credit by participating lenders.
The lenders do not promise new credit, but do agree to disregard the Chapter
13 filing, or to consider it as a favorable indicator of a debtor's
rehabilitation in evaluating a credit application.  The trustees report that
the program has successfully encouraged debtors to choose Chapter 13 over
Chapter 7.

A strong advantage of focusing upon enhancing Chapter 13 relief is that
legislative opposition presumably would be minimal because the proposals are
not restrictive, but rather offer debtors incentives to rehabilitate through
Chapter 13 on a voluntary basis.  This approach reflects compassion for those
who got in over their heads with credit, sometimes for reasons beyond their
control, but often due to an unsuccessful adjustment to the relatively new age
of convenient credit.  Surviving in this era requires self-discipline and
credit education, the lack of which is a problem that is societal in scope.

A Favorable Argument

In addition, as a foundation upon which to argue for legislative action, a
favorable argument can be made that the historically high ratio of Chapter 13
to Chapter 7 cases in most of the Southeast should be possible in the rest of
the country.  The Southeast, with the exception of Florida, traditionally has
had a larger ratio of Chapter 13 filings because, according to some area
bankruptcy professionals, conservative attitudes prevail in the largely rural
areas, and Chapter 7 exemptions in those states have been generally more
restrictive.

This does not mean that a tightening of Chapter 7 should be ignored.  On the
contrary, removing the subjective standard in many dischargeability contests
(the so-called intent to repay) with a more objective (reasonable ability to
repay) standard, would ease the difficult burden of proof now facing issuers
in many jurisdictions.

Going further, although strong opposition could be expected from the consumer
lobby, it could be proposed that all principal from debts incurred 90 days
before bankruptcy be automatically nondischargeable without the need to file a
dischargeability complaint.  Such an approach would have a foundation in other
Western countries' bankruptcy laws, which are generally far more conservative.

In sum, issuers' goals of decreased bankruptcy filings and enhanced recoveries
could be met, in part, through making Chapter 13 more attractive, which would
likely encounter little opposition, while also proposing tighter Chapter 7
dischargeability standards.

A Plan to Improve The Bankruptcy Law


* Make Chapter 13 more attractive to consumers by shortening the time negative
bankruptcy information will stay on their credit reports.  * Issuers should
consider more favorable treatment for debtors who choose Chapter 13 compared
with those who use Chapter 7.  * Change the subjective "intent to repay"
dischargeability standard in Chapter 7 cases to an objective "reasonable
ability to repay" standard.  * Make principal debts incurred within 90 days of
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing nondischargeable-in other words, the consumer
cannot escape responsibility for repayment.

Sorting Out the Mail


The mountain of mail coming from credit card issuers keeps rising to new
heights.  Card mailings are projected to have totaled 2.8 billion pieces in
1995, an 18.5% increase from a year earlier, according Tarrytown, N.Y.-based
Behavioral Analysis Inc.

In order to get a better read on which issuers are mailing the most and the
types of cards most frequently mailed, Faulkner & Gray Inc., publisher of
Credit Card Management, began tracking in April 1994 mailings to staffers in
its Chicago, New York, and Washington D.C.  offices.  Details from the
solicitations were published monthly in CCM's sister publication, Credit Card
News.  Mailings collected through November 1995 totaled 1,077.

While the results of such a survey are not a statistically representative
sample of the entire industry, they do provide a road map of which issuers are
dominating mailings and the types of pricing strategies in play.

Top Mailers

Though issuers are mailing more than ever, the bulk of those mailings are
coming from a handful of issuers.  The top 10 issuers tracked in the survey
accounted for 56% of all offers received.  To no one's surprise, Citibank was
the top mailer with an 11.5% share, followed by Capital One Financial Corp.
with a 6.8% share, and First USA, at 6.5%.  Unexpectedly checking in fourth is
San Francisco-based Providian Bankcorp (formerly First Deposit), which ranks
22nd in receivables, with a 6.1% share.  MBNA rounds out the top five, with
4.9% share.

On the pricing side, annual fees remain alive, though they continue to lose
ground.  Overall, 27% of solicitations received had an annual fee.  A
breakdown of solicitations received for 1995 reveals that issuers are mailing
fewer solicitations with annual fees.  Just 26% of solicitations received in
1995 had annual fees, down from 29% in 1994.  And nearly all gold card offers
are promoted as non-fee cards, according to BAI.

Fixed interest rates are also disappearing from the landscape.  Variable rates
are now king.  Of the general purpose card offers received, 78% promoted a
permanent variable rate, and 29% offered a variable teaser rate pegged to the
prime rate, LIBOR, or some other floating measure.

Teaser rates virtually have become a prerequisite for card mailings, as 82% of
solicitations offered either a fixed-rate or variable rate teaser.  The split
on the duration of the teasers was fairly even:  48% pitched teasers for six
months or less, while 52% offered teasers for more than six months.

As for the types of cards being mailed, gold cards were the dominant subset,
netting 52% of bank card mailings received.  BAI reports that gold cards
represented 48% of bank card mailings during the second quarter of 1995.
Cobranded cards accounted for 15% of all CCN's bank card mailings.  Cobranded
cards totaled 20% of bank card mailings during the second quarter, according
to BAI.

MasterCard International still leads the cobranding derby.  Cobranded
MasterCards represented 65% of cobranded card mailings that did not offer
consumers a choice of brand, compared with 35% for Visa.

Among cobranded partners, AT&T's Universal Card lead the way, accounting for
22% of cobranded card mailings.  American Airlines' AAdvantage card was second
with a 17% share of mailings, and the Shell MasterCard placed third with a 12%
share.

Given the volume of mail, Faulkner & Gray intends to monitor card offers even
more closely in the future.  Which issuers will be the biggest mailers in 1996
and what types of offers will consumers see?  Stay tuned.

An End Run By Fraudsters


When it comes to the war on fraud, the credit card industry has been so
focused on developing new technologies, such as smart cards, to foil con
artists that they may have forgotten to scrutinize the legal loopholes and
their own business practices for potential weaknesses that swindlers can
exploit.

Indeed, the indictment last month by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles of 20
Vietnamese immigrants for bank fraud has exposed a serious flaw in the
Expedited Funds Availability Act of 1988, in addition to possible flaws in how
card issuers govern their own organizations.

The type of fraud perpetrated is a so-called booster-check scheme in which the
suspects allegedly wrote checks from accounts with insufficient funds to boost
their credit limits, then made cash advances and expensive purchases with the
cards before the checks were rejected by the banks.  After the credit burden
became too great, the defendants allegedly declared bankruptcy.

The scheme defrauded issuers nationwide of more than $40 million, and more
arrests are expected.  Similar ploys could cost issuers as much as $100
million, says Assistant U.S.  Attorney Marc R.  Greenberg.  That's about 14%
of the $734 million in bank card fraud in 1994.  Investigators have subpoenaed
the records from 150 credit card issuers, including Chase Manhattan Corp.,
AT&T Universal Card Services, Banc One, and Bank of America.

The case raises concerns that changes need to be made to the Expedited Funds
Availability Act of 1988, which requires banks and issuers to post a check and
credit the funds as soon as the check is received, rather than waiting for it
to clear.

Prosecutors claim loopholes in the law enabled the suspects to withdraw large
cash advances or buy big-ticket items with the cards after mailing to their
card issuing banks bogus checks to boost their credit limits.  Some defendants
allegedly sent five checks of $5,000 each to one issuer in a week, then spent
the entire amount before the first check was cleared or rejected by the bank,
Greenberg says.

After the defendants depleted all available credit on their cards, they would
file bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy court records reveal each cardholder has from
$100,000 to $685,000 in unsecured credit card debt.  "The law requires issuers
to open the line of credit as soon as the check is received," says Joel S.
Lisker, MasterCard International Senior Vice President of Security and Risk
Management.  "This is a foolish thing to do."

Sharing the Blame

Responding to fraud concerns, the Federal Reserve Board plans to survey banks
on the extent of check fraud losses caused by the Expedited Funds Availability
Act.  The six-page survey should begin arriving at financial institutions
around mid-February.

But the case is also drawing attention to card issuers own short- comings in
the fraud battle.  Fraud experts argue that competition and complacency have
prompted issuers to write off booster check fraud as a collection issue
instead of fraud, overlook red flags that suggest fraud, and make cards too
easy to obtain.  One suspect had five MasterCards from one bank, each one with
a maxed out credit limit, says Greenberg.

Adds Everett Whatley, president of Raleigh, N.C.-based Card Risk Management
Global:  "Competition makes issuers less sensitive to fraud and
creditworthiness.  They should not allow checks to boost a credit line.  If a
large check is received, they should ensure the funds are in the bank account
the check is written from before posting it."

That's a logical solution, but will issuers heed the advice?

I'll Trade You My Portfolio...


Card executives who were savvy traders of baseball cards during their youth
may want to brush up those skills.  The concept of acquiring credit card
accounts via a straight-up trade for accounts of equal value is being
considered as a low-cost alternative to buying portfolios.

Indeed, with fewer portfolios on the block and escalating premiums, portfolio
trading makes good sense.  After all, issuers can rid themselves of accounts
that don't fit the makeup of their portfolio, such as affinity cards that were
acquired via a merger, by trading for accounts more in line with their
business, such as those in their home market.

Confused?  Don't be.  "The idea is to trade away accounts that are more
valuable to another issuer in exchange for accounts that are more valuable to
you," explains Michael J.  Auriemma, president of Auriemma Consulting Group,
Westbury, N.Y., which is broaching the idea to clients.

Let's Make a Deal

That's certainly an attractive proposition in an era when banks are under
increasing pressure to grow assets.  But completing an equitable trade is not
an easy task, warns to Robert K.  Hammer, chairman of R.K.  Hammer Co., a
Newbury Park, Calif.-based consulting firm specializing in portfolio sales.
"I was involved in two attempted trades back in the 1980s, and both times the
deal fell through because one side always felt their portfolio was worth more
than the other portfolio," Hammer recalls.

Just how feasible is portfolio trading?  Auriemma argues that with banks being
pushed by investors to grow assets, issuers will start to give serious
consideration to the concept because the money saved by not paying a premium
to buy a coveted block of accounts can be put toward card marketing.

But before issuers rush off to make the trade of a lifetime, they had best
check with their accounting departments about the cost of adding those
accounts to the portfolio.  Issuers thinking of trading portfolios ought to
ask themselves the following questions before pulling the trigger on a trade,
cautions one Wall Street analyst:  Can the acquisition costs associated with
those accounts still be be amortized?  Will the accounts acquired in a trade
be more expensive to service than those traded away?  And will the acquired
accounts be more profitable than those traded away?  "There are a lot
accounting issues that must be addressed," the analyst adds.

Card experts agree that portfolio trading can be pulled off if the parties
involved price their portfolios equitably.  "Portfolio trading is such an
attractive option, any prudent issuer will look at it," says Hammer.  Who
knows, maybe one day credit card executives may trade card portfolios as
easily as they traded, when they were kids, a baseball card of Mickey Mantle
for one of Willie Mays.

Cutting Up Commercial Cards


For years, card marketers have successfully sliced and diced the consumer card
market into thinner segments by creating products that cater to specific
cardholder needs.  But when it comes to commercial cards, there has been
little segmentation.

Sure, issuers have created purchasing cards and cards targeted at small
businesses that offer a revolving line of credit, but those are basic
segmentation techniques, much like standard and gold cards.  Consequently, few
of the high-powered segmentation techniques learned in the consumer market
have been applied to commercial cards.

That's because corporations and businesses have historically looked to card
programs to lower their operating expenses first.  Cardholder perks are
considered a frivolous expense that raise the cost of the card program.

But that attitude is changing.  American Express Co.'s launch of a platinum
corporate card last October signals that small-business executives, at which
the card is targeted, are demanding more consumer card perks from commercial
card issuers.

Catering to Needs

The reason:  small-business executives tend to be less sensitive to the cost
of a commercial card program than large corporations, says Fred O.  Gumbel,
president of the electronic commerce division for Electronic Data Systems.
"Small businesses are more willing to accept perks on commercial cards than
large corporations even though those benefits may be built in to the price of
the card," says Gumbel, who headed First Bank Systems' corporate card
portfolio before moving to EDS in 1994.

AmEx, which says its small-business customers asked for more perks, answered
the call with its platinum corporate card.  The card charges a $300 annual fee
and $150 for additional cards.  Cardholders receive free companion tickets
when they buy a full-fare, first-class or business-class airline ticket; free
enrollment in AmEx's Membership Rewards program; free room upgrades,
continental breakfast for two, and late checkout at participating hotels; and
confirmed restaurant reservations.

Now that AmEx is applying segmentation techniques learned in the consumer
market to commercial cards, will bank card issuers follow?  The answer is yes.
"There are bank card issuers interested in marketing a cobranded commercial
card," declares Peter L.  Williamson, managing director of Stamford,
Conn.-based Salestrac USA Inc.

So coveted are some consumer card perks that small-business owners are paying
for business expenses with consumer cards.  "The right rewards are a big plus
for small businesses," says Williamson.  Perks small-business commercial card
holders may see are frequent-flier miles, car-rental and gasoline discounts.
"Segmentation is becoming more important in corporate card marketing," says
Dorsey R.  Grant, AmEx's vice president of customer loyalty, small-business
services.  "Whether it's data reporting or cardholder perks, commercial
cardholders have specialized needs."

Risk-Based Repricing Draws Flak


On cyberspace chat lines and consumer-rights phone lines, Capital One
Financial Corp.  is drawing heat for the policy it calls risk-based repricing
and consumer advocates say is just unfair.

Since last spring, a couple of dozen consumers have contacted Bankcard Holders
of America to complain about Capital One's strategy of altering interest rates
on existing customers' credit lines when periodic credit-report reviews reveal
customers have been issued other credit cards, have assumed new debt, or have
otherwise altered their credit profile.

"That's not a huge number, but the ones we hear from are irate," reports Ruth
Susswein, BHA's executive director.  "They're being bumped from 12.9% to
24.9%.  If they're a poor credit risk, I don't see how a rate hike is solving
the problem."

Syndicated columnist Jane Bryant Quinn also took Capital One to task for
sharply higher rate hikes and the "gobbledygook" explanations given to
consumers for the adverse action.  Quinn cited the case of a fireman whose
interest rate went from 13.9% to 24.96% despite timely payments.  She
suggested bank regulators should scrutinize the practice.

BHA also has been critical of other issuers for what it terms penalty rates,
citing Citibank and AT&T Universal for higher late fees and rates for
cardholders who fail to uphold their credit agreement.  But Susswein notes the
concept of increasing rates for existing customers on the basis of credit
reviews of other trade lines is different, and she suspects Capital One isn't
the only issuer doing it.

Capital One President Nigel W.  Morris defends the strategy and predicts most
issuers will eventually follow suit.  He says the practice of both raising and
lowering rates "on a selective basis" has been done by the former Signet card
center since 1989.

"Down the road, the credit card business will look more like the insurance
business, with pricing based on likely outcomes instead of one price for
everybody," Morris says.  "Knowing who to do it to and when to do it is
critical."

Whether a trend will develop toward risk-based instead of performance-based
repricing is open to debate.  One issuer who requested anonymity says higher
rates based on poor credit behavior "makes good business sense," but changing
rates or fees for existing customers because they are assuming debt with
another lender amounts to "preying on the laziness of the American public,"
cardholders who stick with higher-rate cards simply because they don't bother
to find better deals.

Tapping the Ethnic Market


Card issuers looking to tap the expanding Hispanic market ought to keep an eye
on Key Federal Savings Bank's new secured Hispanic affinity card.

Key Federal, which is partnering with Texas-based SER, a renowned and
respected national nonprofit organization dedicated to creating education,
literacy, employment, and job-skills programs for Hispanics, is betting the
card will be a hit in a market in which affinity cards tend to flop.  "We
think SER will give us an edge in attracting the uncarded Hispanics," says
Robert M.  Bouza, Havre de Grace, Md.-based Key Federal chief credit officer.
"SER's programs reach a large portion of our target audience."

But some Hispanic affinity card issuers argue Key Federal faces a tough sell.
"Many Hispanics without cards prefer cash," says Patti D.W.  McCoy, a senior
vice president with First Consumers National Bank, issuer of Adelante affinity
card for Hispanics.  "There is a huge difference between potential and
reality."

Time will tell.

It's Takeoff Time For Two Powerful Airline Cards


The fleet of airline cobranded cards got two new members this month that
promise to raise the stakes in a high-flying market.  On Jan.  4, American
Express Co.'s Centurion Bank and Delta Air Lines released details of their
much-anticipated Delta SkyMiles Optima frequent-flyer program.  Then, on Jan.
9, American Airlines and the Air Travel Card, the airline industry's
60-year-old travel payment system, announced the launch of the American
Airlines AAsset Card.  It is a cobranded MasterCard that can be used both as a
corporate air travel card and multi-purpose travel-and-entertainment card.  It
is being issued under a partnership between Air Travel Card and GE Capital
Financial Inc.

Just what impact these new cards will have on the business
travel-and-entertainment market is unknown.  But they bring major new players
into an already fiercely competitive game.

"Folks realize there's a lot of money being spent on business travel," says
Michele Turkel, president of Spectrum International Consulting Corp.,
Scarsdale, N.Y.  "There's going to be a lot of new travel products."

Both new cobranded airline cards face an uphill battle.  The Delta SkyMiles
Optima card is a late entrant in the frequent-flyer arena, and must offer a
unique rewards package to make it stand out from other products already
well-established in the marketplace, observers say.  Indeed, American Express
makes no secret it is trying to lure away cardholders from Visa and MasterCard
cobranded frequent-flyer card programs by offering incentives for
Delta-related purchases, points that never expire and bonus points for
carrying balances.  "This is the credit card product our customers have been
asking us for," says Brian Kleinberg, AmEx's senior vice president of new
product development.  It is the first ever cobranded card for Delta, although
the airline has long participated in AmEx's Membership Rewards loyalty program
(CCN, Sept.  1, 1995).

Delta and AmEx expect the card to bring in more than 500,000 new members to
the SkyMiles program over the next five years, says Paul Matsen, Delta's vice
president of advertising and consumer marketing.  SkyMiles currently has 18
million members.

The SkyMiles card offers 1.5 SkyMiles for every dollar spent on Delta Air
Lines and Delta Connection tickets as well as Delta Dream vacations, and one
mile per dollar on all other purchases.  The card also differs from other
frequent-flyer cards in that there is no expiration date on using the points
as long as the cardholder travels on a Delta or Delta Connection Flight every
three years.  American Express will issue a gold version of the SkyMiles
Optima later this year.

The Delta SkyMiles card also rewards cardholders for carrying a balance-0.2
SkyMiles for each dollar spent on new purchases.  This could give an AmEx a
profitability edge in a market whose customers are notorious for their
reluctance to revolve balances.

The SkyMiles card carries an introductory interest rate of 8.9% for the first
six months and then converts to the prime rate (currently 8.5%) plus 9.4%.
The card carries a $55 annual fee which is waived for all primary AmEx green,
gold and platinum card holders.  The annual cap on SkyMiles accumulation is
$60,000 in charges.  Bonuses for Delta purchases are exempt from the limit.

"This card was really developed for people who fly Delta, want to earn
frequent-flyer miles and like the financial flexibility of being able to carry
a balance from time to time," says Mary Miller, AmEx's senior vice president
of partnership sales and relationships.  She says extra SkyMiles are awarded
to revolvers not to encourage cardholders to carry a balance but to compensate
revolvers because "they are carrying a heavier financial load" because of
interest payments.  "We thought we'd give back something," she says.  "We
don't think it encourages anybody to revolve if they weren't revolving
otherwise."

But some observers say most non-revolvers wouldn't be interested in the Delta
SkyMiles card because they can earn points on AmEx's other charge cards
through its Membership Rewards program.  "If I already have Membership
Rewards, what's the added benefit for convenience users?"  asks Anne Morgan
Moore, president of Synergistics Research Corp., an Atlanta-based consulting
firm.

However, American Express views the Delta SkyMiles card as a complementary
product to its charge cards, Miller adds.  "Our research tells us people like
to segregate their spending, particularly business travelers, our core target
group," she says.

And though charge card holders who participate in Membership Rewards also can
accumulate frequent-flyer miles on Delta, Miller says the SkyMiles Optima
isn't expected to harm that program.  "They're different value propositions,"
she says, noting that Membership Rewards is aimed at cardholders who don't
revolve balances.

There are mixed reviews on the SkyMiles Optima, with some observers saying
AmEx missed the opportunity to develop a truly unique frequent-flyer product.
"I think it's terribly disappointing," Turkel says.  "They waited 10 years to
come out with this product and they come out with something that won't break
through the clutter."

But others disagree.  "American Express definitely pulled off a coup," says
James L.  Accomando, president of Fairfield, Conn.-based Accomando Consulting
Inc.  He notes that the Delta SkyMiles Optima is "very rich" in benefits
compared to other frequent-flyer cards.  For example, most other programs
offer only one point for every dollar spent and put a three-year-limit for
redeeming frequent-flyer miles.

In addition, the $55 annual fee is comparable to those on other AmEx products
while it falls in the middle range of what other issuers charge for their
frequent-flyer cards, Accomando says.  But the richness of the benefits could
prove to be an Achilles' Heel in the long run, he adds, saying, "a program
like this is very expensive to manage.  The users are transactors-they're not
necessarily people who roll over balances."

The Delta SkyMiles card is one more step in American Express' goal of reaching
$30 billion in outstandings by the year 2000.

The SkyMiles Optima is one of two cobranded offerings from American Express.
Last October, AmEx introduced the no-fee Hilton Optima card (CCN, Sept.  15,
1995).  Miller says there may be some overlap between the two cards' bases
since both target frequent travelers.

The SkyMiles Optima card was officially launched Jan.  5 with a television,
print and outdoor advertising as well as a direct-mail campaign.  Delta and
Delta Connection carriers operate more than 4,800 flights daily to 297 cities
in 48 states and 29 countries around the world.  American Express in late
August announced it would launch a cobranded card with Delta, but didn't
release details of the program until a Jan.  4 press conference.

But frequent-flyer card programs are only one area seeing increased
competition.  Corporate air card programs-in which a corporation is billed
centrally for all it airline expenses-also are facing some new competition.
Through an agreement with GE Capital Financial Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of GE Capital Services, Air Travel Card will be able provides its seven major
U.S.  airlines that issue the card with the banking, billing and reporting
services needed to offer a comprehensive cobranded card for
travel-and-entertainment expenses, says Charles B.  Fischer, Air Travel Card
managing director.  American Airlines-which also offers the AAdvantage
frequent-flyer card issued by Citibank-is the first air carrier to offer the
card.

More than 100,000 corporations, including half of the Fortune 500, use the Air
Travel Card.  More than 200 airlines accept it.

Air Travel Card sought a partnership with GE Capital because of airlines'
requests for a multi-purpose card that could serve as a corporate air, T&E and
calling card, Fischer says.

Under the program, the participating airline will do central billing for the
air charges while GE Capital will handle billing for all non-air expenditures,
says Mark Meythaler, American Airlines manager of credit card marketing.
Billing services can be customized if corporations prefer to have all charges
on one bill.  The cobranded T&E market is likely to get more crowded before
the year is out.  A recent Synergistics' report notes that more and more
issuers are looking to frequent-flyer programs as a means of enhancing cards
to compete with the proliferation of value-added cards on the market.

"I think we're going to see many more cobranded cards," says Randy Petersen,
editor and publisher of InsideFlyer.  "The Delta program is only the second of
at least two to three more cobranded card to be launched by the end of 1996."

Worsening Credit Quality Casts a Pall Over the New Year


Analysts predicted a decline in consumer credit quality most of last year.
Now for a not-so-happy New Year's gift:  Those predictions are coming true.
Example:  Moody's Investors Service's most recent index of securities backed
by card receivables shows U.S.  consumer credit quality in the third quarter
of 1995 slipping, the first quarterly dip in three years.

According to Moody's, chargeoffs in the pool of securities it rates rose to
4.14% of outstandings in the third quarter from 3.99% in the third quarter of
1994.  For September, the chargeoff rate increased to 4.27% of outstandings
from 3.83% in September 1994, the sharpest year-over-year increase since
January 1992.  Moody's tracks $109 billion in securitized outstandings from 74
issuers.

Moody's Vice President and Senior Analyst Edward O.  Bankole blames the boost
on the recent upturn in consumer bankruptcy filings.  Nonbusiness bankruptcy
filings in the third quarter rose for the second consecutive quarter, to
220,945, from 195,308 in the third quarter of 1994, a 13.1% increase,
according to the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts.  Some observers
say personal bankruptcy filings could hit or pass 900,000 when figures for
1995 are tallied.  That would be the most since 1992, when there were 900,874
filings.

Delinquencies in Moody's pool of securitized receivables averaged 4.08% in the
third quarter of 1995, compared with 4.37% a year earlier, Moody's says.  But
Bankole says the rate is distorted by the continuing rapid growth in credit
card loans, which reached $299 billion in June 1995, up 28% from June 1994,
according to the data from Visa, MasterCard and Discover.

The trend is being noticed by other observers.  According to the American
Bankers Association, total delinquent dollars outstanding rose to 4.21% of
outstandings in the third quarter, from 3.58% in the second quarter and from
2.90% in the third quarter of 1994.

Some industry observers blame the increase in delinquencies on the surge in
bankruptcies as well as the continued aggressive marketing of credit card
offers.

The number of personal bankruptcy filings for 1995 will near historic levels,
Stuart Feldstein, president of Budd Lake, N.J.-based SMR Research Inc..  This
is troubling to issuers because bankruptcies account for roughly 40% of
chargeoffs.  According to the latest figures from the Administrative Office of
the U.S.  Courts, there were 832,415 filings between Oct.  1, 1994 and Sept.
30, 1995.

Some point to increasing consumer debt loads at a time of slow wage growth as
another factor in rising delinquencies.  The amount of revolving credit alone
rose 19.1% in the third quarter over the year-earlier period, according to
Federal Reserve figures.  Meanwhile, wage growth, and thus the ability to pay
off some of that debt, rose only 5.1% during the same period.

Intense competition among issuers also has been driving down credit quality as
they scrape to get their cards in the hands of as many consumers as possible.
In the push to keep portfolios humming, some issuers are relaxing their
standards and issuing cards to riskier customers, observers say..

Other observers say the continuing decline in credit quality is a correction
for the rapid growth of card portfolios in the early 1990s.  Chargeoff rates
"are seeking their proper levels," says Michael E.  Staten, director of Purdue
University's Credit Research Center.

The Strange Phenomenon Of Overpaying Credit Card Bills


The practice of overpayment of credit card bills came under scrutiny recently
when fraudsters allegedly used the tactic to defraud 120 issuers out of about
$40 million(CCN, Dec.  15, 1995).  Issuers say the practice is longstanding
but rare, and they say there are legitimate reasons cardholders would make
payments in excess of their credit limits.

Overpayment can expose an issuer to fraud.  Because of banking laws, issuers
are required to post the checks and credit the funds as soon as they are
received.  This allows the crooks to take large cash advances and go on
spending sprees before the checks are returned as insufficient.

But there is a small percentage of cardholders who occasionally will make a
payment over their credit limits, issuers say.  This is usually to prevent
getting behind on payments or to anticipate purchases that might exceed credit
limits while traveling over extended periods.

Industry sources have no figures on how many legitimate customers pay their
accounts above the credit limit.  "It's very rare," says a spokesperson for
Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T Universal Card Services.

But is there really a need for customers to increase their credit limits by
overpaying?  No, says Chris N.  Theoharides, principal of Theoharides
Consulting, Massapequa, N.Y.  Banks have made it easy to get credit line
increases thanks to toll-free numbers.  And risk scores allow banks to quickly
judge if the cardholder is worthy of an increase.  Adds Bill Dobbins, vice
president of fraud operations at Chase Manhattan Bank:  "Why give an issuer
money that's not collecting interest?  You can pay while you're away through
fund transfers or have someone handle your affairs."

Issuers interviewed say they will accept an overpayment-but with caution.
Cincinnati-based Star Banc Corp.  allows cardholders to overpay and have a
balance, says Senior Vice President Collin G.  McKenny.

"But we watch that because that's one of the tricks of the bad guys," McKenny
says.

AT&T says it handles overpayments on a case-by-case basis.  "If a cardholder
won't be where their mail is and will be doing some spending, we ask them to
let us know ahead of time," the spokesperson says.

One indication that a prepayment is legitimate is that a bill coupon
accompanies it, says the AT&T spokesperson.  But depending on how far over the
credit limit the check is, Chase, AT&T and Advanta say they may call the
cardholder's bank ahead of time before posting the funds.

If a check is received above a credit limit, Key Federal Savings Bank will
post the check but hold some of the money from availability until the bank is
"reasonably certain" the check will clear the bank from which it is written,
says Robert M.  Bouza, president of operations.  The move is done only in
certain cases where the customer is believed to be high-risk and is not
against banking laws.  "If a check bounces, you've given away the available
balance-plus," he says.  "You're out of a heck of a lot of money."

Chase's Dobbins says the bank will credit the account, but also will call the
bank the check is issued from to check the validity of the payment, he says.

Overpayment is not always a prelude to fraud, but it should set off warning
bells, depending on how far over a customer's credit limit a check is, Dobbins
says.  Fraud experts say a sure warning sign is a check that is mailed with no
coupon in an overnight mail envelope.

"Someone with a $5,000 credit limit that owes us $1,000 and pays us $1,000
isn't unusual," Dobbins says.  "But someone who owes us $1,000, but pays us
$10,000 causes a lot of bells to go off," Dobbins says.

Behind the Growth of Penalties For Rental Car No-Shows


Visa U.S.A., American Express Travel Related Services Co.  and Dean Witter,
Discover & Co.  all are now offering guaranteed car-rental reservation and
no-show penalties for rental companies during peak periods.  Problem:  These
appear to be services no one needs.

Visa and AmEx rolled out their services in December.  A Discover spokesperson
says the issuer has offered similar services since last May.  But no major
rental companies have signed on to any of the three companies' plans, though
spokespersons from Alamo, Value and Thrifty car-rental agencies say they are
considering them.

Ironically, Visa and AmEx say the services are in response to requests from
the car-rental industry trying to combat a chronic no-show problem.  Some
industry estimates peg no-shows at as much as 70% of reservations in some
cities during peak periods, such as three-day holiday weekends.

Anticipation

However, executives from Visa and AmEx say they are confident that companies
will climb on board soon.

Participation in the programs is voluntary.  Under the services, car-rental
companies first must agree to offer guaranteed reservations to customers along
with penalty fees.  Customers then would be offered the choice of making a
standard reservation as they currently do, or guaranteeing a reservation under
the new guidelines.  If a customer accepts the guaranteed reservation, he then
agrees to authorize Visa, AmEx or Discover to charge penalty fees if he fails
to show up or call to cancel within a specified time period.  It is the rental
company's responsibility to charge the fee.

Under Visa's program, cardholders who guarantee their car rentals during peak
periods with a Visa card, are guaranteed a car will be waiting at their
destination for up to eight hours from their expected arrival time.  In the
event of an overbooking, the rental agency is required to rent a comparable
vehicle from another agency and deliver it to the cardholder.  Customers must
cancel eight hours prior to pick-up to avoid a charge for up to a one-day
rental.  In case of a flight cancellation, cardholders have up to one hour
prior to the scheduled pick-up time to cancel.

American Express offers its customers similar guarantees..  Cardholders will
be assured a car will be held for them for at least 12 hours from their
scheduled arrival time.  If the agency overbooks, the rental agency must
provide a comparable vehicle from another firm.

AmEx cardholders must cancel within 48 hours prior to their scheduled pickup
time to avoid as much as a two-day rental charge.  If the customer's flight is
canceled, the penalty is waived.

Discover officials would not discuss their services, except to say a car would
be guaranteed for 24 hours and that a customer would be charged up to a
24-hour rental fee if he didn't show up without a cancellation.

Bad Feelings

But a major obstacle to car-rental agencies implementing the new services is
that penalties may create ill will with customers.  "If a business traveler
gets a flight canceled, they have to make a lot more calls than to just the
rental agencies," says Hertz Corp.  Vice President of Governmental Affairs
Joseph N.  Russo.  Rental agencies currently do not impose penalty fees for
no-shows who reserve conventional cars.  Hertz is not opposed to penalty fees
but objects to the idea of having such fees mandated by credit card companies,
Russo says.  Hertz and Garden City, N.Y.-based Avis impose no-show penalties
for so-called special equipment, such as convertibles or four-wheel-drive
vehicles that are high in demand.

A Post-Holiday Lull in Direct-Mail Campaigns


Most issuers stayed on the sidelines in the waning days of 1995 and the
opening days of 1996.  Faulkner & Gray researchers in New York, Chicago and
Washington received only 38 solicitations in the weeks following the Christmas
and New Year holidays.

Among the most active mailers was MBNA America Bank, which hit the mails with
a wide variety of offers for everyone from wine aficionados to veterinarians
and physical therapists.  It also used the Northwestern University football
team's trip to the Rose Bowl as an opportunity to boost the university's
alumni group affinity card.

Bank of Boston, which re-entered the card business after a five-year absence,
also was promoting its Visa Gold card carrying an APR of prime plus 3.756% and
a $28 annual fee.

Diners Club Guns for AmEx in New Ad Campaign


Stiff competition in the travel-and-entertainment arena is causing normally
tame Citicorp Diners Club to bare its teeth.  And in public.  Last month,
Diners took a swipe at T&E giant American Express Co.'s revamped Membership
Rewards program in ads that ran in major newspapers.

The ad headline boasts, "If your rewards program is missing two major
airlines, it's probably still green," and bears a facsimile of an AmEx green
charge card.  Though not naming the carriers, the ad refers to American and
United airlines, which participate in Diners Club's loyalty mileage program,
but not in AmEx's.

"The renamed American Express rewards program promises the frequent business
traveler 'a world of choices," the ad reads.  "The truth is, it doesn't even
cover the continent."

Standing Up

Diners executives say the ad is part of a more aggressive marketing campaign
the issuer is launching.  Additionally, they say the new name AmEx chose for
its loyalty program last year-Membership Rewards-is a little too close in name
to their Club Rewards program.  And they want everyone to know it.  "When AmEx
comes out and copies our name, we have to stand up and be counted," a Diners
spokesperson says.  "We wanted to remind readers that AmEx has an inferior
program."

Diners Club finished the year with about seven million cardholders and charge
volume around $25 billion.  That pales in comparison to the 37 million AmEx
cardholders and charge volume of roughly $150 billion.

The Best?

AmEx executives defend their loyalty program, saying it offers cardholders
much more variety and utility.  The program has been honored as the best
international program for flexibility and variety by InsideFlyer, a Colorado
Springs, Colo.-based travel magazine.  "We're confident our program is the
best," an AmEx spokesperson says.  "The fact that it is recognized by premier
travel publications speaks for itself."

The Diners Club ad and its aggressive stance is unusual, but laudable for the
issuer, says Randy Petersen, InsideFlyer's editor and publisher.  "There have
been some changes in attitude and they are for the better," he says of Diners'
new ad campaign.  "I'm a big fan of AmEx, but Diners' comparison is true."

While Diners' ad makes a legitimate product distinction, it could backfire,
says Richard N.  Kimmel, principal of Kimmel & Co., a Chicago-based
advertising firm.  The ad makes Diners appear petty , "and being petty does
not look good," he says.

"If I had an American Express Card, I might be interested in the airlines that
aren't participating, but the ad doesn't tell me," Kimmel says.  "I don't
think this ad does them a lot of good.  It sounds desperate because it is
strident, untrustworthy and irritating."

Won't Back Down

The Diners spokesperson denies the ad is an act of desperation.  "Not at all,"
the spokesperson says.  But Diners will not back down from American Express
even though it has a fraction of AmEx's advertising budget.  "Our pockets are
not as deep as theirs so we have to muster up," the spokesperson says.

The chances of AmEx bringing American and United into its fold may be slim.
American has a long-standing contractual relationship for the purchase of the
airline miles offered through Diners Club cards and the Citi-American Airlines
cobranded card.  United has a similar cobranding arrangement with First
Chicago, but could join AmEx when the current contract expires, Petersen says.

Carlson, Household Become Traveling Companions


Since 1991, Salinas, Calif.-based Household Credit Services, the card-issuing
arm of Household International, has steadily cultivated its corporate bank
card portfolio.  The program has grown to more than 126,000 cards at the
beginning of 1995, making it the second largest corporate bank card file, from
a paltry 4,200 at the end of 1991.  Now Household has taken another step some
observers say will give its program a major boost and make a splash on the
travel-and-entertainment scene:  the issuing of a cobranded corporate card
with Carlson Wagonlit Travel, the Minneapolis-based travel agency giant.

The card, appropriately dubbed The Business Card, is the first corporate card
offered by a travel agency, and one of the first cobranded corporate travel
cards, Household executives say.  Initially, it will be marketed to companies
with commercial travel accounts of $1 million or more.  A version for smaller
corporate accounts will be rolled out in mid- to late-1996.

Tracking Expenses

The Business Card will be a general-purpose bank card, available as a
MasterCard or Visa.  It will offer a variety of spending limits and travel
insurance packages.  Companies can either use computer modules to compile
expense reports from the card in-house or outsource it to Carlson.  The fee
for each card and interest rate will be announced later.

As part of the venture, Household and Carlson Wagonlit will produce a joint
proprietary management information system (MIS) data base that they claim will
offer companies more detailed information than other corporate cards about
airlines, hotels and car rentals employees use.  Like traditional expense
reports, it will allow companies to track costs as well as identify the most
frequently used travel vendors, says Ron Muratore, director of planning and
communications for Household's credit card group.  "It is a management tool
that captures more data and presents businesses with a bigger and better
picture on how their money is spent," he says.

Carlson Wagonlit executives say the new card will offer more information and
better integration with a cli-ent's expense reporting system than competitors,
but would not discuss specifics.  "Our whole plan is smooth integration with
other corporate travel systems as well as providing the information that's
needed to manage the travel expense activity," says Terry L.  Thelemann,
Carlson Wagonlit director of marketing product services.  "We don't want our
customers to jump through a lot of hoops to get the advantage of the card."

But executives from Citicorp Diners Club and American Express Co.  say there
is nothing new about the Household-Carlson venture.  Spokespersons from both
companies say they provide detailed, yet easy-to-interpret MIS reports and
software allowing companies to receive the reports on-line.

Major Player

Some observers say the new card could swiftly be a major player in the T&E
arena.  "Anytime two giants like Household and Carlson join, it will draw
attention," says Donald J.  Auriemma, chairman of the Westbury, N.Y.-based
Auriemma Consulting Group.  "They are both leaders in their respective
fields."

The fee per card will vary on how the customer wants to structure its expense
reports, Muratore says.

The program will be launched in the U.S.  and Canada during the first quarter.
It subsequently will be expanded to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region later
this year.

Carlson Wagonlit is one of the world's largest travel agencies with annual
sales of $12 billion, and 4,000 locations in 125 countries.

First Bank and Target Aim For A Cobranded Bull's Eye


Dayton Hudson Corp.'s discount chain Target Stores Inc.  and First Bank System
Inc.  will launch a cobranded card later this month.  The Target Rewards Visa,
believed to be the first issued by a major discount retailer, will have no
annual fee and will offer rebates at Target stores.  Details on the rewards
program and interest rates won't be disclosed until the card's launch near the
end of this month.

Target, which last January began issuing the Target Guest private-label card
in selected markets (CCN, Oct.  1, 1995), decided to start a cobranded program
to give its customers a "more utilitarian card," a spokesperson says.  "It
allows people who are pretty loyal to Target to use the card at other
merchants.  It's a unique opportunity to build Target loyalty."

The cobranded card isn't expected to draw customers away from Target's
private-label portfolio, the Target spokesperson says.  The Guest Card is
issued by Dayton Hudson's Retailers National Bank, Sioux Falls, S.D., which
issues only private-label cards.

Initially, the card will be issued only in Florida and Indiana, where the
chain has a total of 83 stores.  The program will be rolled out gradually to
other states over the next year, the spokesperson says.  Target has 673 stores
in 33 states.  The discount retailer serves over 1 million shoppers per day.

The Target Rewards Visa is expected to generate about $2 billion in
receivables and a return on assets in excess of 2% by 1998, says Philip G.
Heasley, vice chairman of First Bank System.  First Bank, which also issues
cobranded cards with Northwest Airlines and AmWay.

Merger Mania Spreads To Issuers on The East Coast


Merger mania shows no sign of slowing down as banks continue buying one
another, perhaps to avoid being swallowed up themselves.  Toward the end of
last year, the trend swept up the East Coast.  Last month, Bank of Boston
announced it will buy Boston-based BayBanks, while Providence, R.I.-based
Fleet Financial Group announced it will buy the U.S.  operations of
British-based National Westminster (NatWest) Bank.

The Bank of Boston/BayBanks merger will mean a major boost to Bank of Boston's
reborn credit card program.  After re-entering the card business last
September after selling its portfolio to Chase Manhattan five years ago, Bank
of Boston ended 1995 with 102,000 accounts and $124 million in receivables,
says Bank of Boston Director of Credit Cards Services Jeff Slawsky.
Acquisition of BayBanks' portfolio will add 278,000 accounts and $300 million
in receivables.  "This will make us bigger, quicker," he says.

Pending completion of the Bank of Boston/BayBanks merger, Bank of Boston plans
to begin issuing nationally, Slawsky says.  BayBanks' card program has a
strong presence in New England.  "We plan on being a pretty aggressive
issuer," he says.  Details on how the two portfolios will be merged have not
been determined.

Farther south, NatWest's U.S.  Group had been for sale since last September.
Fleet reported 1.1 million accounts and $1.5 billion in receivables at
year-end 1994, while NatWest reported 826,590 accounts and $1.1 billion in
receivables, according to Faulkner & Gray's 1996 Card Industry Directory.

DEMAND FOR SCORING PREDICTED FOR 1996

     More complex uses of scoring are expected to emerge in 1996 as
the tool becomes more widely-used by credit managers for marketing and
predicting loan profitability.  
     Expect scoring models to be used as customer and total
relationship management tools rather than just as risk assessment
methods, experts say.  
     Scoring also will gain acceptance in previously unchartered
waters, such as the mortgage lending market.  
     But industry experts tell us you need to be prepared for
legislative and implementational obstacles related to scoring.
     Concern over consumer privacy also may prompt more patrolling of
this technology by regulators.  Creditors and scoring vendors should
pursue consumer education programs to ease fears over scoring tools
and to ensure that new legislation will not restrict their business
practices. 

Evolving Scoring Methods

     Creditors can expect a change in business focus in 1996 from
credit risk management to customer relationship management, according
to John Coffman of Credit Strategy Management (CSM) of Atlanta.  For
example, many creditors now  are starting to use data and predictive
models to manage the entire customer relationship, including
retention, relationship optimization, product design and targeting.
     Creditors need to understand that risk management by itself is
not sufficient to ensure optimal profitability, and that the
management of risk must be integrated with the management of other
aspects of customer behavior, according to Coffman.  
     Scoring's use is being encouraged by the Washington, D.C.-based
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac).  Freddie Mac issued a
four-page letter last summer supporting scoring practices by lenders
for residential mortgages. 
     A few months later, Fannie Mae, formerly known as the Federal
National Mortgage Association, put out an eight-page letter that
encouraged lenders to use credit scores in the application process.  
     The moves by both organizations have prompted new entrants into
the scoring arena -- the technology no longer will be used by only
credit card companies, but also by mortgage lenders and various other
players in that market, said Marty Abrams, director of privacy and
consumer policy at TRW of Orange, Calif.
     "It really has changed the way mortgage [lending] has been
conducted, because now we have an endorsement of scoring by a quasi-
governmental agency," said Chet Wiermanski, vice president of
acquisition and risk management services for Chicago-based Trans 
Union.

More Work Needed To Educate Consumers, Regulators

     Abrams believes increased use of automated processing throughout
the marketplace -- not just credit models, but response and
profitability models as well -- will create greater interest on how
those models work.  "I think that this is the first in what will be a
fairly broad discussion into the whole sense of how models work, and
how they affect consumers," he said.
     Wiermanski also sees a need for stepped-up consumer education to
offset critics' fears that scores will be used to reject low scorers.
     Score developers and users will need to do more than educate
consumers on how they determine scores -- they'll need to educate
businesses also.  "There is going to be an incredible use of
statistical modeling of data to determine who it makes sense to do
business with, and who it doesn't.  And that is going to create a lot
of controversy," Abrams said.
     If the industry isn't proactive in educating consumers,
regulators may force it to be with new rules or legislation.  
     The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, was
considering last year whether to require creditors and bureaus to
disclose risk scores as part of a consumer's credit report file. 
After much industry feedback, the FTC decided
against mandating a score disclosure.  "That, to me, was a key
decision, considering the complexity of risk scores and proprietary
score cards on the part of credit marketers and credit grantors,"
Abrams said.

Consumer Education Issues

    The decision may create some key consumer education dilemmas in
the coming year.  "We still have to find a way to help consumers
understand how they can better prepare themselves to be good credit
consumers," Abrams said. In addition, creditors and scoring vendors
likely will struggle with regulators' concern over "disparate
treatment" and its relation to scoring, said Fran Lyons, principal or
Scoring Solutions Inc. in Atlanta.  
    Regulators fear that consumers in protected categories will be
turned down for mortgage loans because they are scored based on their
credit history, causing the disparate treatment of a protected group.

Total Relationship Management

    The industry will have to educate regulators that scores do not
result in disparate treatment.  The evidence overwhelmingly suggests
that automated decision-making is much fairer to consumers than
judgmental decision-making, Abrams said.  
    Coffman thinks the industry as a whole will continue to move in
the direction of total relationship management:  "It has caught on
quite quickly."  
    He cited recent articles on AT&T Universal Card as an example of
this trend.  "You're seeing more and more companies recognizing that
they need to integrate the management of these two functions:  risk
management and customer management [see related story, p. 8]," Coffman
said.

Success Strategies

    One key to success in the credit management arena will be the
creation of a comprehensive and easily accessed customer database. 
Many creditors already have begun creating customer databases for this
purpose, and the trend will continue, Coffman said.  
    Using a comprehensive customer database, along with modeling
tools, will allow the creditor to manage all customer relationships.  
    The database might include current and historical financial data
as well as transaction data.  It also should include external data
about customers, such as credit history and other demographic or
lifestyle data.  (Marty Abrams, TRW, 214/390-3659; John Coffman, CSM,
404/266-1242; Fran Lyons, Scoring Solutions, 770/988-264; Chet
Wiermanski, Trans Union, 312/466-7794.) 

Scoring 101

     More and more creditors and scoring vendors will be forced to
educate consumers as to the ABC's of scoring, experts tell us.  
     But what should you focus on when developing a consumer education
program?  TRW instructs its representatives to focus on five "fair
information values" when interacting with consumers:
   *  partnership between TRW and its customers;
   *  fairness;
   *  balance; 
   *  education; and
   *  dialogue. 

Advances in Scoring

     Consider these latest scoring and credit management tools from
industry vendors:

*  TRW and Fair, Isaac are working together to offer small business
lenders a way to download and score TRW business credit reports with
Fair, Isaac's Small Business Scoring Service (SBSS).  SBSS, a
combination of software and pooled-data scorecards for evaluating
small business credit applications, provides an automated interface to
TRW Business Information Services' database of business credit
reports.     (Fair, Isaac, 800/999-2955; TRW, 800/854-7201.) 

*  Equifax offers RE-APPEAR, an automated notification delivery
service for the collections industry.  Users of the service select
criteria so that credit files of consumers who have collections
pending with the user and have disappeared or "skipped" are flagged. 
When new or different address or inquiry activity is posted to the
file, RE-APPEAR automatically notifies the customer of the name,
address and phone number of the credit grantor who queried the file
and who can then provide updated information on the consumer. 
(Equifax, 800/879-1025.) 

*  Trans Union's Revenue Projection Model (RPM), a two-year model
typically used to predict likely revenue to be generated from
prescreened solicitation prospects, now can be used to make inactive
accounts, low-balance revolving accounts and seasonal accounts more
profitable, according to Trans Union officials.  Research conducted by
Fair, Isaac, the developer of the model, shows that RPM also can be
used to rank order existing customers based on likely revenue 
generation in the 12 months following scoring.  (Trans Union, 312/466-
7730.)

TIPS FOR MANAGING YOUR NEXT BANKRUPTCY COLLECTION AUDIT

    A careful audit of your outside bankruptcy collection agent can
help improve bankruptcy accounts management and increase profits.  To
aide in this endeavor, CRMR elicited advice from one independent
consultant, Raymond Bell Jr. of Abington, Pa.
     Bell spent many years managing a bankruptcy department for a
major credit card company and has audited both collection and
bankruptcy accounts.  He directed the handling of consumer bankruptcy
cases at a national law firm and now is a full-time, independent
consultant.
     If you do nothing else when auditing your outside bankruptcy
collection agency, your time will be well-spent reviewing the final
trustee accounting reports to ensure that your claims have been paid,
Bell said.
     "The final trustee accounting report is the most important audit
tool in ensuring that you have received correct disbursements from the
bankruptcy estate," he explained.
     This report will indicate whether accounts have been transferred
to a different bankruptcy type, if payments were recorded improperly,
or if the trustee made a mistake, he added.
     Require your agent to provide a complete account listings for
Chapter 7, 11 and 13 cases that are active, with data fields for the
following:

*  Account assignment date;
*  Date account information was placed in the agent's system;
*  Date the request for notice was sent;
*  Date the proof of claim was sent;
*  Date the proof of claim was received by the court of the trustee;
*  Date of court adversary proceeding;  
*  Chapter 13 planned percent payback;
*  Claim balance filed with the court;
*  Last payment date, payment amount and accumulative amount of
       total payment received.

     You should review the rationale used to generate the reports, and
ask that the agent retain the account listing in an extract computer
until your audit is completed.  This will allow you to subsort
information as needed quickly and your requests will not slow down the
agent's system during business hours, Bell said.

     Bell had other suggestions to follow during an audit:

*   Establish a pattern of follow-up frequency and criteria for cases.
For xample, how many missed payments should trigger a follow-up call
or isit for Chapter 13 cases of a certain amount of credit?

*   Internally select segments of cases from each type of bankruptcy
for random spot checking.

*   Using at least three remittance reports within a 12-month period,
test for payments on at least 50 percent of the accounts.

*   Review your contract provisions and take a copy with you for
reference during your audit.

*   Review your prior audit commentary and the agents response.  Take
copies to the audit with you for reference purposes.

On-site Review

    Bell said the first place he visits during an on-site review is
the lunch- and meeting-room bulletin boards.  These tell a lot about
how the agency communicates and whether it is up-to-date on issues, he
added.
    While at the agency, perform audit functions without interruption
and do not leave notes unattended.  If you need to ask questions,
which can intimidate agency staff, make a concise list and be sure a
manager is present at this stage in the review, Bell advised. 
    While on-site Bell suggests reviewing the following:

*   Licenses.  Are they current and do they apply to state provisions
governing an agency?  In cases of an attorney, has this person passed
the bar in the state in which he/she is working?  Additionally, the
attorney must have renewed the license in each state of practice and
must meet the state's continuing legal education requirements.

*   Written procedures.  The policy guidelines that pertain to your
account should be up to date.

*   Staffing.  Additions, deletions or administrative promotions as
they relate to relate to your account should be explained thoroughly.

*   Training.  In-house training, organizational structure and
frequency of internal case reviews by management should be adequate.

Post Review

    After the on-site review, be sure to provide the client with an
overview highlighting the negative and positive aspects of your report
before you leave.  This discussion should be private, Bell said.  
    Provide the agency with your audit summary.  This ensures there
is agreement to proceed with any corrective action and the
implementation and completion time of desired action.  "The agency
should be required to respond, in writing, by a pre-agreed time," Bell
said.  
    Common problems that may affect agency turnaround include
unorganized agency files, unreceived documents and payments, Bell
added.
    To keep bankruptcy proceedings running smoothly, Bell suggested
several in-house tweaks.  For example, establish tracking abilities
for electronic and paper referrals to the agency and require the agent
acknowledge referrals.  Additionally, time and date stamp all
bankruptcy correspondence before sending it to the agency.  This will
aid in auditing the agency's procedures, he said.
    Also, establish computer models to predict cash flow and
projected return on Chapter 13 cases that can be compared to actual
in-coming, Bell said.
    Internally track agent support requests listing the nature an
type of request every quarter.  This will help you be more proactive
with this information in the future, Bell said.
    Lastly, implement a training program for your bankruptcy and
audit staffs to ensure future audits run smoothly, Bell said. 
(Raymond P. Bell, private consultant, 800/735-0481.) 

Agency Reports You Need

*   Final trustee accounting reports.
*   A monthly tally of Chapter 7, 11 and 13 claims filed.  Reconcile
          this with internal records.
*   A monthly summary of post-petition asset Chapter 7 cases filed. 
          Reconcile this with internal records.
*   A monthly summary on any claim that will not be paid with
          explanations.
*   Notification of balances that differ from the account balance
          referred to the agent.

          of the objection, and the final disposition of the
          objection.
*   A quarterly submission of Chapter 13 cases where no payment was 
received for 24 months or more without explanation from the court of
the trustee handling the cases.

          explanation.
*   Monthly status of unresolved litigation cases that were filed more
          than 90 days ago.
*   A monthly random selection of at least 5 or  more litigation cases
          with related court pleadings and correspondence.

VIDEOCONFERENCING HELPING INCREASE LOAN APPLICATIONS

    Videoconferencing is helping Hempstead, N.Y.-based NatWest Bank
to nearly double the rate at which applicants fill out their loan
forms by bringing the process directly to the model-home site.
    Prospective condominium buyers in a 700-unit development in Park
Place, N.J., now can access NatWest loan officers via
videoconferencing directly from the model home.  However, consumers
must finish the paperwork at the branch.
    "Typically 25 percent [of people inquiring about mortgages] will
fill out the application.  We are running over 50 percent when they go
fill out the application at the model home," said Andrew Demeo,
director of interactive marketing for NatWest.
    Videoconferencing allows consumers to see NatWest loan
representatives and view information on the television screen while
talking on the phone.
    "It is a remote delivery and they are not pressured by being in
the room with an individual," said Demeo.  "They feel in total control
and that seems to be important to the consumers.  It gets to our
culture as Americans.  When a salesperson comes and talks to us in
person, we let them finish their sales pitch.  However, the
socialization of how we deal with telemarketers is different.  Most
people tend not to stay on the line.  If you can offer that type of
control to the customer, yet offer as much personal contact as a face
to face [conversation] and make it fun, it works."

How it Works

    Once consumers have toured the model home, they can enter the
living room, turn on a television set there and place a call
simultaneously to a NatWest representative.  The consumer can see a
still graphic of the representative in the top one-fifth of the screen
on a proprietary pay-per-view channel.
    The remaining four-fifths of the tv screen is reserved for moving
graphics.  For example, customers may want to see in graphic form how
payments for a 15-year adjustable mortgage compare to a 15-year fixed
mortgage.  The NatWest representative can input the necessary
information on the screen and a graphical presentation will appear at
the model home.
    NatWest is testing full-motion video for the service and plans
soon to offer standard personal computer (PC)-to-PC modem
communication.  The bank also is preparing a videoconferencing service
over the Internet.
    Demeo would not reveal the cost of the product, but said it "is a
lot less than you think."  He explained that is a matter of deploying
a pc and television set in a cabinet.  
    Demeo advises lenders to think of videoconferencing as an
opportunity help consumers find products which are appropriate for
their specific needs.  "The key element is presenting concise
information as well as [having the consumers] feel like they are
meeting somebody," Demeo said.
    After the homebuyers decide which loans are right for them, the
NatWest representatives will transmit a closing bill and title right
on the tv screen.  In addition, NatWest can estimate the closing and
tax costs for the consumers.  The application cannot be completed on-
line.  However, consumers are taken line-by-line down the application
so that they will have all the necessary information when they visit a
NatWest branch to complete the application.
    NatWest launched the service in the first quarter of 1995 after
Demeo's marketing staff worked closely with officials at the QVC home
shopping channel to learn how to concisely present complicated
information via video.
    For example, QVC warned Demeo that customers need to be
entertained more in a videoconferencing presentation as they are less

LESSONS FROM GOVERNMENT WORKERS.  

    Creditors should establish written policies on handling
delinquent payments from certain consumer segments, credit consultants
tell CRMR.  This is especially true for creditors that service
government employees, in light of the recent lengthy federal
government shutdown which left many employees without paychecks for
weeks. Consider these strategies, offered by some industry
consultants, when developing a government employee policy:

  *  Review on a case-by-case basis. Examine each case for unusual
circumstances before penalizing an account or initiating collection
efforts.  

  *  Instruct customers to contact you. Consumers may assume you are
aware of their situation.  Statements and bills should advise
consumers to contact a credit department and explain any payment
difficulties. 

  *  Consider special programs. Lenders can establish special
unsecured loan programs with no- or low interest rates for federal
workers affected by a government shutdown.  These programs may not 
be very lucrative, however, they will inspire long-term customer
loyalty, experts say.

MOVER AND SHAKER EMERGING. 

    U.S. appraisal automation vendors beware:  one provider of
appraisal reports and services is pushing to become a significant
player in the industry.  Premier Appraisals of Atlanta recently
purchased H.A. Yeargin & Associates, a residential real estate
appraisal company.  Premier officials said the company plans to
aggressively acquire other independent appraisal firms and market
these services in housing markets throughout the United States. 
Several investors are funding Premier's acquisition program, including
Chrysalis Ventures of Louisville, Ky., Windcrest Partners of New York
and David A. Jones, chairman and CEO of Humana Corp.  (Michael Mattox,
Premier, 770/998-0031.)

HUD OKAY MEANS MORE AUTOMATION.  

    Look for the new year to bring an uptick in automated
underwriting (see related story, p. 1).  The U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD), for example, recently approved
the use of an automated underwriting program by Collateral Mortgage
Ltd. of Birmingham, Ala.  The program, pmiAURA system, offered by PMI
Mortgage Services Co. of San Francisco, will be used to underwrite
Federal Housing Authority (FHA)-insured mortgages.  Collateral
Mortgage is the second pmiAURA system licensee, and only the third
lender nationally, to receive HUD approval to use an automated
underwriting system for FHA loans.  The system predicts the relative
likelihood of loan default by combining a risk-based, computerized
statistical model with a database drawing on the experience of more
than 1 million loans.  The pmiAURA system uses a rules-based
technology to check an application's conformance with conventional or
government underwriting guidelines.  (Brad German, PMI Mortgage,

FIRM REORGANIZES DIVISIONS.  

    Creditors and vendors should watch for new developments from
Atlanta-based Equifax as it reorganizes its corporation.  Equifax
announced last week that its Financial Services Group has assumed
international responsibility for all its products and services. 
Thomas F. Chapman will assume responsibility for international
operations.  Chapman, the executive vice president and group executive
in charge of Financial Services, also will oversee the developing and
deploying of new products and services in the United States.  "This
change ... is going to maximize our international development and
customer service while improving product innovation and technological
enhancement," Chapman said.  Equifax's international revenues now
exceed $210 million a year.  (Norman Black, Equifax, 404/888-5040.)

RISK MANAGERS NEEDED, REGARDLESS OF LAYOFFS

    You could fare better in the churning financial services
marketplace by becoming skilled in implementing leading-edge credit
technologies.  That's the lesson evident in the business' latest major
downsizing, AT&T Corp.'s plan to lay off 40,000 employees as part of
its efforts to reorganize by 1997.
    More than 200 of the people already accepting AT&T's voluntary
severance    packages work in the Jacksonville, Fla.-based AT&T
Universal Card division, a spokesperson confirmed.  He would not say
how many are from the risk management department nor give details on
the severance packages offered.
    But CRMR has learned that risk management executives are among
the total.  Several of them already have been approached by other 
issuers, says one credit executive who asked not to be named.  

High Demand

    These executives are in such high demand because of their ability
to implement leading-edge technologies, such as statistical analysis,
behavior scoring and neural networks, the source said. 
    A recent survey by Allard Associates of San Francisco, an
executive recruiter in the credit card and banking industries,
indicated that 75 percent of issuers surveyed would be adding staff in
1996.  Respondents said many of these people would be in the risk
management area.  These issuers also reported the shortage of
qualified executives is so acute that card companies are prepared to
sponsor non-U.S. citizens for the jobs.  (Mitch Montagna, AT&T
Universal, 904/954-7571; Kathy Trott, Allard Associates, 415/433-
0500.)

CUS RELIEVED BY IRS' RULE OVER DEBT REPORTS

The Internal Revenue Service's final rule on reporting of discharge
of indebtedness is much more acceptable to the lending industry than the
proposed regulation, which ran into a firestorm when published for comment
in 1993.
        Tim Pryor, director of NAFCU's regulatory compliance office, told
Credit Union Accountant the IRS' rule is significant for credit unions
because it eases the paperwork burden in two areas: when bankruptcies are
filed and when a debt is discharged by state law.
        The amount of debt written off isn't the most important aspect, the
debt loss will be the same despite this rule, Pryor said. The rule is most
significant because it reduces the amount the paperwork, he said.
        The regulations, published in the Jan. 4 Federal Register, require
financial institutions to disclose to the agency on Form 1099-C information
returns when borrowers negotiate a cut in principal on indebtedness of $600
or more. The issue has been a contentious one for mortgage lenders because
they say that the need for borrowers to pay taxes on the amount forgiven in
excess of $600 only exacerbates a borrower's problems.
        Lenders and borrowers were unable to win legislation mitigating the
need to pay taxes on forgiven debt, and have negotiated with the IRS for
several years on ways to least reduce the burden imposed by the need to
forgive debt.
        Pryor said the final rule is "a very big issue for credit unions
because the previous rule would have required a credit union to file a 1099
when a debtor went bankrupt." And since bankruptcies are on the rise and
expected to increase, credit unions would have been inundated with
paperwork. (See related story page 4).
        According to Wayne Winegarden, a NAFCU staff economist, "a rise in
bankruptcies since December 1994 is evident in the call report data, and
other preliminary data supports the idea that the December 1995
bankruptcies will increase even further."
        The previous rule, Pryor said, would also have required a credit
union to file a 1099 whenever a debt was discharge by state law--something
he said is next to impossible for a credit union to assess. He said it's
difficult for a credit union to figure out the statute of limitations on
each debt and the actual date the debt was discharged. "Operation of state
law only applies when it is raised as a defense," he said.
        The final regulation says that disclosure to the IRS of debt
forgiveness will be required only when one of the following "identifiable
events" occur:
         The failure of the borrower to make any payments on a debt for
three years with no significant collection activity by the financial
institution.
         A contractual modification or discharge between the financial
institution and the borrower.
         Discharges in bankruptcy of business loans, but not for consumer
loans.
         The successful assertion in court by the borrower of the statute
of limitations as a bar to collection.
         The cancellation of a debt by receivership, foreclosure, or
probate proceedings.
         The expiration of the statutory period for commencing a proceeding
on a judgment.
        Credit unions must comply with these requirements for discharges
occurring on or after Dec. 22, 1996.
        It's important for credit unions to note, however, that the IRS has
provided several exceptions to the list of "identifiable events," said
Cornelia Schneider, the National Association of Federal Credit Union's
associate director of taxation and accounting.
        "Specifically, discharges in bankruptcy are not reportable unless
the credit union knows that the member incurred the indebtedness for
business or investment purposes," Schneider said. "A credit union will not
have to report a discharge of indebtedness upon the expiration of the
statute of limitations if a member's affirmative defense is upheld in a
financial judgment or decision of a judicial proceeding and the period for
appealing has expired. In addition, the final regulations do not require
interest to be included in the reporting of amounts discharged."

SAR, CTR EXEMPTION LIST MIGHT EMERGE MARCH 1

The new Suspicious Activity Report form, reported by sources last
week to be due out by Feb. 1, will most likely come out March 1 at the
earliest, and might contain a threshold for money laundering, a Treasury
official told Credit Union Accountant.
        Banks will begin using the forms when the final regulation becomes
effective.
        The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) also hopes to
release a preliminary Currency Transaction Reporting exemption process in
conjunction with the SAR.
        As proposed, the SAR had no threshold for suspicious activities
involving money laundering. As a final rule, a FinCEN source said on Jan.
17 that, in response to comments received from the industry, Treasury may
include an as-yet unspecified threshold for money laundering. This is the
only threshold the regulators say will possibly change from what has been
previously proposed.
        The SAR, to be administered by FinCEN and federal regulators, is
proposed to be used to report suspicious transactions of bank fraud,
insider abuse, etc. involving a specific customer if $5,000 or more is
involved. If no particular individual can be identified, the threshold will
increase to $25,000.
        The form replaces the old Criminal Referral Form and a box on the
Currency Transaction Report. The form will be required to be filed with
FinCEN only rather than with a number of agencies.
        "It is unlikely that the new SAR will be out by Feb. 1," said a
FinCEN official. "Each of the agencies has to finalize its own regulation,
the database which accepts the suspicious transactions has to be up and
running, and the form has to be ready. FinCEN's reg is in the clearance
process, as well as are the other agencies' regs, I believe. The form
itself is close to being final and the database is operational.
        "The instructions on the form, telling you when and what to file
are subject to change, since the instructions are driven by the reg itself,
which has still to be issued as final."
        A preliminary exemption list for Currency Transaction Reporting is
also expected to be released in conjunction with the SAR release, said an
agency official.
        "There is a two phase approach," said the source. "The easy stuff
will be a (not-specified-yet) existing list--something like the stock
exchange list that people can refer to by opening up a newspaper and lists
businesses that are already exemptible under current regulation. Phase two,
the rest of the exemptions of local places, we are still working out. My
guess is that the second list will come as a proposed rulemaking, up for
comment."
        "Law enforcement, regulators and the industry all agree that there
are too many CTRs, but we need to finalize the process, which will reduce
burden, without impeding law enforcement." --Lisa Troshinsky

EXAMINERS GET LIBERTY IN CUSO LIMITS

NCUA has said that for purposes of CUSO loan and investment
limitations, an examiner can decide on a case-by-case basis to value a CUSO
either at original cash investment or by an equity method of accounting.
        The regulator said even though these limitations are statutorily
derived, it gives its examiners leeway because statutory and regulatory
history provide no clear answers.
        Michael L. Miller, assistant vice president for compliance at
Indiana FCU, Indianapolis, wrote to NCUA Sept. 11 and asked several
questions concerning the loan and investment limitations for CUSOs in
Region IV.
        Miller first asked if the 1% investment limit in a CUSO is based on
the original cash investment or the equity method. He explained that in
January 1994, Indiana FCU invested $100,000 in Indiana Members Financial
Services Inc., a wholly owned CUSO that is the sole owner of three other
CUSOs--a mortgage company, a vehicle leasing company and a collection
company. During the first year, Miller said, IMFS lost $36,000. He asked if
IFCU's CUSO should use the original investment of $100,000 or the equity
method balance of $64,000 to calculate the investment for the 1% limit.
        In legal opinion letter No. 95-0930, dated Dec. 13, Richard
Schulman, NCUA's associate general counsel, told Miller that IFCU should
use the aggregate cash outlay figure of the original investment of $100,000
to calculate the CUSO investment limitation. Schulman noted, however, that
for measuring a credit union's investment to a CUSO in financial
statements, GAAP should be followed. GAAP uses a cost method, equity method
or consolidated financial statements as measurements.
        Miller also asked if IFCU's original cash investment in the IMFS
subsidiary companies be included in the calculation or should it use the
equity method's balance.
        Schulman replied that IFCU's original cash investment, being the
aggregate cash outlay, in the other CUSO's should also be included in the
calculation. He said this is what is meant by "aggregate" limitation.
        Miller then inquired whether IFCU's lines of credit to the mortgage
CUSO and leasing CUSO were considered a loan to a CUSO for the 1% limit
since these organizations are not directly owned by the credit union. He
explained that when IFCU owned the second tier CUSO directly, lines of
credit to the mortgage CUSO and leasing CUSO were established. The lines of
credit are to fund loans and leases until the underlying loan or lease
instrument is sold back to IFCU or another investor. --Melanie Waddell

BRIEFS


Fed To Issue Study
On Check Fraud
        The Federal Reserve Board has asked financial institutions to
comment on a proposed one-time check fraud survey that will help it fulfill
the congressional mandate to report on the advisability of modifying the
Expedited Funds Availability Act.
        The changes to the EFAA, which is implemented through Regulation
CC, would extend the maximum permissible hold period for local checks as a
way to decrease losses related to check fraud.
        Comments are due to the Fed by Feb. 20. Data collected from the
survey will cover the period Jan. 1 through Dec. 31, 1995.
        Congress has also directed the Fed to study:
         Whether a pattern of significant increases in losses related to
check fraud at depository institutions attributable to the provisions of
the EFAA exists.
         Whether an extension by one day of the period between the deposit
of a local check and the availability of funds for withdrawal would be
effective in reducing the volume of losses related to check fraud.
         Whether to make recommendations for legislative actions.
        The survey will gather information about the relationship of all
funds availability schedules mandated in the EFAA to check-fraud losses as
well as specific information about the types of check fraud and the causes
of check fraud losses at depository institutions.
        A copy of the proposed survey and instructions, the Paperwork
Reduction Act Submission (OMB 83-1), supporting statement, and other
documents may be requested from Mary M. McLaughlin, Federal Reserve Board
clearance officer at (202) 452-3829, Division of Research and Statistics,
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Washington, DC 20551.

Hawaii Auditing Firm
Acquired by Big-Sixer
        A Honolulu-based accounting firm that specializes in credit unions
was acquired by a CPA giant earlier this month, creating an extended
auditing base on the West Coast and Hawaii.
         Kwock & Co. CPA Inc., in the Aloha State, was taken over by KPMG
Peat Marwick LLP Jan.1. The move allows KPMG to provide services for the
first time in Hawaii.
        "They absorbed me," said Steven Kwock, said head of the CPA firm
that bears his name.
        Kwock added the merger allows for more resources in the future.
        "I'm looking to the year 2000. I'm also looking ahead technology
wise as well including the Internet. Credit unions are moving from on-line
services to in-house (operations)," Kwock told Credit Union Accountant.
        Kwock said he works exclusively as a credit union auditor, and
since the merger, his position becomes the director of credit union
accounts in Hawaii and the Pacific Southwest region for KPMG Peat Marwick.
        Kwock said he audits 65% of the credit union audit market in
Hawaii, which totals $3.1 billion. Until now, KPMG had no share of that
market. Before the merger, the Big Six firm served 69 credit unions
totaling $17 million in assets.

NAFCU's Tech '96 Show
Set for San Jose, Calif.
        At a time when many institutions are trying to beat the ever-
ticking technology clock, NAFCU has chimed in with a conference and trade
show in Silicon Valley to showcase the latest in high-tech creature
features for credit unions.
        Credit unions of the 21st century, new financial systems and
technology issues will be featured Feb. 8-9 in San Jose, Calif., as CU
executives and vendors gather for NAFCU's Tech '96 trade show and
educational program.
        "We want to have a forum to provide technology to those who have
already implemented technology," said Ken Robinson, president of the
National Association of Federal Credit Unions.
        Robinson added the conference has an added value because the
technology experts can point to some of the pitfalls technological services
occasionally bring to the marketplace.
        Highlighting the show will be Keynote Speaker Richard Stroth, the
executive director of CSC Vanguard, the research and advisory arm of
Computer Sciences Corp. Stroth is a strategist on the application of
emerging information technologies.
        For conference registration information, call (703) 276-2772.

CU Auditing Firm
Acquired by Insurance Co.
        A credit union auditing firm has been acquired by an insurance
company--a move the auditing firm hopes will help it break into the
insurance business.
        American Indemnity Co. Ltd., a firm based in the British West
Indies, acquired a 54% controlling interest in International Standards
Group Ltd., a Florida-based company that specializes in supervisory audits
for more than 300 credit unions through agreements with several leagues.
        "This is the first step in our overall plan to expand into the
insurance business," said Joseph Lents, president and founder of ISG, in a
recent statement. Lents said ISG will continue to focus on credit union
services.
        A source within the industry told Credit Union Accountant that ISG
is attempting to expand into insurance because it's not making any money
from supervisory committee audits.
        Attempts to reach ISG were unsuccessful.

COURT: MEMBERS CAN'T SHIRK STUDENT LOAN DEBTS

An important legal ruling handed down in Massachusetts could calm
fears of credit union CFOs and strengthen the long arm of debt collection.
        In the case, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said CU members
can't use bankruptcy as a method to avoid paying off student loans. The
December ruling also is significant because, for the first time, a court
said that federal credit unions are "government units" for purposes of
having educational loans nondischargeable.
        Certain educational loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy
proceedings if they are either a government agency or unit, or a nonprofit
organization.
        The ruling stemmed from a suit brought by T.I. Federal Credit Union
in Attleboro, Mass., against one of its members, John Carl DelBonis.
DelBonis owed more than $32,000 in educational loans when the case went
before the bench. T.I. took the position that it fell under the definition
of both a nonprofit and a government unit and wanted payment for these
loans.
        DelBonis' counsel, Theodore J. Koban, argued otherwise.
        "We argued T.I was not a nonprofit organization because bylaws
provided that shareholders get a dividend," Koban said. He won this point
in bankruptcy court.
        T.I., however, appealed this lower court ruling and took its case
to U.S. district court, which ruled that T.I. was a nonprofit.
        The district court, however, didn't take a position on the
"government unit" status, so the case was appealed. The 1st Circuit said
federal credit unions are, in fact, government units, so it didn't see the
need to address whether it was also a nonprofit.
        In its ruling, the 1st Circuit set out to clarify the meaning of
this section of the bankruptcy code. In doing so, it said Section 523(a)(8)
offers two alternatives for adjudicating educational loans issued by a FCU.
        "First, it provides that educational loans or benefit overpayments
are nondischargeable, if issued in whole or in part by an agency qualifying
as a nonprofit organization. Second, the statute also makes loans issued,
insured or guaranteed by governmental units nondischargeable. A debtor's
loans, thus, are non dischargeable if they fall within the parameters of
either provision," the 1st Circuit said.
        Koban, reached by Credit Union Accountant, asked rhetorically
whether this ruling now means that every federal credit union, S&L or bank
is a "government unit" for purposes of educational loans. He suggested the
law should simply state that "student loans are nondischargeable. Period.
This ruling is counter intuitive."
        T.I. Federal Credit Union's attorney, Paul Lorincz, wouldn't
address the rhetorical question raised by Koban, but did say Congress is
the only body that can rule student loans shouldn't be dischargeable, not
the courts.
        "Congress hasn't further stated any banking institutions'
educational loans are nondischargeable," Lorincz said.
        T.I has $76 million in assets and roughly 13,000 members.
        According to the brief of the case, T.I. federal credit union
advanced loans as part of its special educational loan program. This
program differs from standard loan programs in that it allows for lower
interest rates, gives borrowers longer repayment periods and allows loans
to be aggregated in maximum amounts greater than those permitted under
personal loan programs. The program also enables borrowers to
simultaneously borrow additional funds and refinance outstanding balances
on previous loans.
        The brief added that DelBonis turned to T.I. 16 times for
assistance and was given permission to consolidate these loans into a
single promissory note payable over 10 years. Currently, DelBonis owes
$32,618.
        His only avenue of appeal now lies with the Supreme Court, but his
lawyer said a petition to the high court is unlikely. --Ken Reed

CREDIT UNIONS AND STUDENT LOANS, A YEAR-END BREAKDOWN

One-third of all credit unions that give student loans offer only
Guaranteed Student Loans (FFELs), one-third offer only other types of
student loans and a third offer both, year-end 1994 CUNA data show.
        The significance of this is reflected in the overall percentage of
credit union members who belong to credit unions offering these services.
Almost half--45.3%--of all CU members belong to a credit union that lends
FFELs, and 37.6% are members who are a part of a credit union that lends
other types of student loans, CUNA said.
        FFELs are generally preferred because a larger portion of the risk
is shared with the government.
        A study by the National Association of Federal Credit Unions found
that, of the 336 member CUs responding to its survey, the average credit
union offering student loans has $240 million in assets while the average
credit union not offering such loans has $103 million in assets.

FOCUS ON FASB


AcSEC To Explore
Balance Sheet
        The Accounting Standards Executive Committee, a committee of the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, is considering a new
project to determine when various types of securities transactions should
be recorded on the balance sheet.
        Currently, these transactions can be settled in regular ways, in
accordance with normal market practice, or with delayed delivery, where the
counterparties agree on a settlement date. There are also more contingent
transactions, such as those in the mortgage market, which are referred to
as "to-be-announced" trades.
        The issue AcSEC will consider is whether each of these types of
transactions should be recorded on the balance sheet on the trade date or
on the settlement date. Until now, there has been diversity in practice as
to when these transactions are recorded, which has raised questions among
users of the instruments.

FASB Extracts Leases
From Hedging Project
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board narrowed significantly the
scope of the hedging and derivatives project Dec. 21 when it decided that
leases would not be included.
        The project, in its current form, provides the option of marking
derivative instruments or all financial instruments to market. While other
financial instruments may suffer this fate, the current method to account
for leases will not be affected by the outcome of the project.
        "One reason the Board decided not to include leases was that it
would expand the scope of the project considerably," said Jennifer Clark, a
FASB staffer. "The Board decided to remain narrower and deal with the
issues that most concern hedging and derivatives."
        Robert Conklin, one of the three FASB staffers in charge of the
project, said in the meeting that the Board previously had decided not to
include leases in the scope of two other FASB statements due to the
difficulty in separating the value of the monetary portion of the lease
from the nonmonetary portion. The same reasoning applies to the hedging
project, he said.
        He also noted that the staff was concerned about the lack of
valuation methodologies for leases, another one of the numerous complicated
issues relating to leases. So instead of including leases in the
derivatives project, the staff recommended considering a new project on the
capitalization or valuation of all leases.
        The Board also agreed that the interest component of a change in
the value of a derivative financial instrument, other than an option,
should be recognized in earnings in the period the change occurs, and that
the interest rate to be used would be the current market rate.
        In addition, the initial premium, or the time value component,
related to written or purchased options should be amortized into earnings
on a straight-line basis over the life of the option. Further, any gain on
a purchased option should be recognized in earnings to the extent that
expense has been recognized for the option premium paid.

Comprehensive Income
Takes Tiny Step Forward
        The Financial Accounting Standards Board debated Dec. 22 how to
report accounting adjustments, comprising prior-period adjustments and
cumulative-effective adjustments, and concluded that they should be
reported in the same place. Which place, however, remains unclear.
        The decision represents at least another minor step forward in
FASB's comprehensive income project, which began deliberations in late fall
and seeks to define a new location for items currently not reported in the
income statement. The board began discussing the project on Nov. 29 when it
tentatively decided that all recognized items of comprehensive income
should be reported in one or more statements of income for financial
performance.
        The Board began discussing precisely what those items are by
examining prior-period adjustments and cumulative-effect adjustments, of
which only the latter is currently included in net income. The matter
becomes complicated because some changes in principle are reported as
cumulative effect adjustments in certain situations and prior-period
adjustments in others.
        To clarify the matter, the Board requested the staff to develop
examples illustrating the three different approaches for reporting
accounting adjustments, which the staff has already outlined. The first one
is the "comprehensive income approach," which would interpret comprehensive
income strictly and exclude accounting adjustments. The second approach,
referred to as "all-inclusive income," would interpret comprehensive income
broadly, equating it with the all-inclusive income concept, and excluding
accounting adjustments. The final "compromise" approach would report both
comprehensive income and all-inclusive income, with accounting adjustments
being displayed as the difference between the two.
        The staff, headed up by project manager Todd Johnson, said that any
of these three approaches would be workable if they were applied
consistently over time. The staff also said that the current status quo
approach not be adopted as an official standard, as it is not consistent
with either a strict interpretation of comprehensive income or the all-
inclusive concept.

Network Marketers Give POS Center Stage


Having been given center stage by many shared regional electronic funds
transfer networks, point of sale is on track to become one of EFT's greatest
marketing hits.  Looking to further spur transaction volume, which has
increased by more than 77% over the last two years, networks are expanding
their direct debit marketing budgets while incorporating non-traditional
vehicles to expand their geographic reach.

More regional networks are offering incentives and developing education
programs to generate activity, while minimizing use of the more expensive
television, radio and newspaper advertising.  "The cost for television
advertising is way over our budget for effectively communicating in a
seven-state region," says Cindy Ballard, senior vice president of
Houston-based Pulse, the sixth-largest network.  "Instead, we're working with
banks to help them market to their merchant customers in all areas."

Pulse is focusing on the acquirer side by holding retailer workshops and
making joint sales calls with independent sales organizations to sign new
merchants to accept on-line cards.  The network switched strategies following
a 1994 TV campaign in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, which increased network
awareness but did not change consumer usage habits.

Also moving away from media advertising is Chicago-based Cash Station, the
10th-largest POS network, which aired television commercials after launching
direct debit in 1992, but now is working more closely with merchants and
members to spur activity.

Cash Station expects to expand an incentive program it tested at an Illinois
Kmart Superstore last year, in which coupons were distributed to consumers for
discounts when the Cash Station card was used for purchases.  Clerks also were
given prizes if they prompted customers to pay with the Cash Station card.
"Television is very effective when a new product is introduced, but awareness
of POS debit in our area already is high," says Cathy Alexander, Cash Station
senior vice president.  "But there still is an absence of knowledge on the
part of members and merchants."

Indeed, even with network POS transaction volumes soaring, hundreds of
thousands of retailers still do not accept debit cards for payment.  Many
merchants that acquire debit transactions, meanwhile, do not adequately market
the products to customers.  Thus, networks are devising methods to spur
retailers to promote debit.

Louisiana-based GulfNet, the 14th-largest network, has devoted more than half
of its 1996 marketing budget to POS, up 10% from last year, with most of the
funds being used to expand merchant debit acceptance.  The network wants to
expand distribution of incentive coupons at the point of sale to consumers who
paid for purchases with a check or credit card.  The coupons give cardholders
$2 off their next purchase with a GulfNet card.  Schwegmann Giant Supermarkets
ran the promotion for a month last year and $15,000 worth of coupons were
cashed in, says Del Tonguette, GulfNet president.

"Offering incentives is key because studies show that if you can get people to
use the card twice you, might create habitual users," says Ronald Rawson,
president of San Francisco-based R.  C.  Rawson Co., a consulting firm
specializing in EFT awareness, education and usage.  GulfNet also will focus
on expanding network signage at the point of sale and assisting independent
sales organizations in signing retailers.  All but four of GulfNet's 2,000
retailers were recruited by ISOs.

But while many networks have devised strategies for marketing POS at the local
level, some still expect to use the media to reach specific markets.
Virginia-based Most, the fifth-largest network, which attributes much of its
60% increase in POS volume last year to radio and billboard advertisements,
will again use the vehicles to emphasize the different applications tied to
the Most card.  "Television is too costly," says Mary Kilby, Most senior vice
president.  "We believe in supporting a brand across a broad region, but we
can only support TV in one or two markets."

Multiple Methods

Most also expects to work with a product manufacturer in distributing savings
coupons to consumers if they buy a specific product with the Most card.  Last
year more than 5 million coupons were distributed between September and
December for savings on Haagan Daz ice cream.  The network, which advertised
in a minor league baseball park last year, also is considering expanding its
sports marketing activities.  "We have 94% total awareness and 80% POS
awareness, but we still have to look at increasing POS usage, which is only
40%," Kilby says.

Yet, while many networks have diminished their media advertising, some still
have not abandoned the airways as a prime marketing source.  Florida-based
Honor, the fourth-largest network, will advertise from August to December on
such cable stations as Cable News Network, ESPN, A&E, TNT, USA and The Weather
Channel.  Honor is concentrating on cable because it is less costly than
network television and many viewers have the same demographics as active EFT
users, such as being upwardly mobile and early adopters of new technology.

The network will use 85% of its marketing budget for POS this year, up from
50% in 1995.  Honor's activities are being financed by the network's 6-cent
acquirer-paid POS interchange fee.  While 3 cents of the fee is passed on to
card issuers, the network maintains 3 cents for POS promotions.  "POS has the
greatest potential for growth so we promote it more than ATMs," says Elizabeth
Storm, Honor director of marketing.

Also using television in its POS marketing mix is Michigan-based Magic Line,
the 7th-largest network.  Magic Line will run POS TV commercials this spring
and fall in Michigan and Indiana.  The network also will hold seminars to
educate merchants on direct debit, and is considering reinstating an incentive
program that ran for eight weeks last year in which merchant acquirers
received cash awards for each new POS device they deployed.  Of Magic Line's
$1.1 million marketing budget, $400,000 will be spent on POS in 1996.

Some networks, meanwhile, are distributing their marketing dollars in
accordance with the volume generated by the different applications.  San
Diego-based Star System, the largest regional network, will use 30% of its
advertising budget for POS.  Star switched more than 25 million ATM
transactions in December and over 12 million POS transactions.

Star will promote POS on cable television and radio this year, and expand its
marketing in Oregon and Washington.  The majority of Star's marketing will
focus on the network itself and not a specific application.

Another major player incorporating radio advertising is New Jersey-based NYCE,
the second-largest network, which plans to run two 60-second spots for an
eight week period across its entire Northeast region.  NYCE also is devising a
co-op program with merchants which could include electronic coupons or a
loyalty program.

NYCE expanded its market when it merged with Connecticut-based Yankee 24 in
1994 "Radio reaches our target audience, which is typically younger people on
the move," says Scott Strug, NYCE director of marketing.

Other major networks, such as Washington-based The Exchange, Delaware-based
MAC and Massachusetts-based X-Press 24 still are finalizing their marketing
plans.  L

AT&T Disconnects Itself From The Busy Smart Card Lines


While foreign and domestic vendors are flooding the U.S.  smart card market to
position for an expected chip card boom, a major player is departing.  Debit
Card News has learned that AT&T Corp.  is selling its smart card business
unit, which develops and markets contactless card systems.

AT&T is reportedly looking for a buyer because the unit did not fit into the
company's recent reorganization and was not profitable, sources say.  AT&T
reportedly will finish its existing smart card contracts, but will not take on
new customers.  An AT&T spokesperson would not confirm the planned sale.

The move to sell the smart card unit follows AT&T's 1995 announcement that the
global telecommunications and technology company is streamlining its operation
for greater efficiencies.  AT&T is creating three distinct companies for long
distance services, technology and systems, and computer hardware
manufacturing.  The AT&T Smart Cards business unit was created in 1982.

Companies using AT&T contactless smart cards include Delta Airlines, which has
a ticketless boarding program for its Northeast shuttle, and New York-based
Chemical Bank, which is running an in-house contactless card pilot with 300
employees.  Both projects are expected to continue.  Drew University in
Madison, N.J., suspended an AT&T contactless card pilot last year, but is
considering reinstating it.

While most payments industry players are gravitating to a contact card system
in which a smart card is swiped through a card reader, AT&T is marketing
contactless smart cards that must be passed in front of, or near, a card
reader.  While contactless cards are best suited for applications where
transaction speed is crucial, such as persons going through turnstiles in a
train station, the systems are more expensive to implement.  Contactless cards
and terminals are estimated to cost more than twice that of contact cards.
Cards range from $10 to $20, and terminals from $200 to $1,000.

Change Of Plans

AT&T's reported plan to sell its smart card unit follows its announcement last
spring that it would license its contactless technology in hopes of making it
the world's standard for cashless wallets and electronic commerce.  At that
time, AT&T said it was negotiating with three companies in the U.S.  and
abroad.  However, Italy-based Olivetti Co.  reportedly was the only company to
license AT&T's technology, which it used to pilot contactless cards on the
Autostrada, Italy's main freeway.

"When AT&T decided to license its technology to other companies, that was a
signal that they were looking for the way out," says an industry observer
familiar with AT&T.

Indeed, a lack of payments industry interest in contactless technology could
have led to AT&T's decision to sell its operation.  Most observers say AT&T's
system was too expensive for widespread use in supporting stored-value card
programs, which are typically positioned to replace low-value cash
transactions.

In addition, more efficient contactless systems already are being marketed.
For instance, while AT&T's design requires cards to be brought within inches
of a reader, radio frequency-based contactless systems only require cards to
come within a few feet of a reader.  Analysts believe AT&T's design is too
similar to swipe technology.  "Contactless smart card technology is great, but
AT&T never got any real applicable products off the ground," says Jerome
Svigals, a Redwood City, Calif.-based smart card consultant.

A Brighter Future

But while AT&T had problems expanding its smart card business, analysts say
there still is a future for contactless cards.  Indeed, some players that have
encountered difficulties with contactless cards still are planning to utilize
the technology.  Drew University discontinued an AT&T contactless campus card
program that was being used by about 2,500 students and faculty after a year
because the cards were too weak to support high usage.  However, Drew is
considering reinstating the technology with more resilient cards.

Drew's cards were used for identification, stored value and to pay for meals,
but problems stemmed from cardholders' mistreatment of the plastic.  "The
technology worked fine, but students shove their cards in their book bags and
jeans pockets and if it doesn't work, then a student doesn't get a meal," says
Harry Scarpa, Drew University director of purchasing.  Drew is currently using
a mag-stripe campus card.

Still, Drew was impressed with the potential for supporting multiple functions
on the AT&T contactless card.  Drew's chip cards 3 kilobytes of memory,
compared to the one kilobyte of memory in most contact cards.

In addition to cost and reliability issues, contactless card acceptance also
is hindered by a smart card industry that still is evolving.  New applications
that generate additional fee revenue are needed to support a more expensive
card product,such as contactless cards, says Timothy McNaughton, manager of
pilots and implementation at Royal Bank of Canada.  Royal Bank will issue
contact smart cards for the Mondex electronic purse program that will be
launched in Canada later this year.

But while the payments industry is not ready to embrace contactless cards, the
technology is still expected to find a niche in the transportation sector.
The San Diego-based Cubic Automatic Revenue Collection Group, which designs
and implements contactless systems, reports that contactless cards permit more
than 72 persons to move through turnstiles in two minutes, compared to about
60 with contact cards.

Indeed, a number of metropolitan transit authorities, including those in New
York and San Francisco, are reportedly considering implementing contactless
systems.  Washington, D.C.'s Metropolitan Area Transit Authority already is
testing contactless smart cards for rail, bus and parking services.  More than
1,000 employees are involved in the one-year pilot.  The Washington's transit
authority also is negotiating with North Carolina-based First Union for the
cards to be used in an open contact environment (Debit Card News, 11/30/95).

Easier Access

Meanwhile, enhancements to contact smart card systems are expected to make it
easier for card issuers to upgrade their products for contactless smart card
applications.  One method under study would be to place card jackets with
contactless capability over contact cards.

"One reason why the industry decided on contact cards was because it is much
easier to make a contact card contactless than vice versa," says David Lott,
senior associate at Dove Associates, an Atlanta-based payments consulting
firm.

And Visa and MasterCard, which are supporting contact smart card programs, say
market demand could result in hybrid products.

Visa Leads The Canadian Prepaid Push


When the SmartCash stored-value venture was announced last summer, a major
payments participant was conspicuously absent from its proposed ownership
list:  Visa International.  But while SmartCash and its participants, such as
MasterCard International, Electronic Payment Services and Chemical Bank, still
are cementing the business plans for their nationwide stored-value business,
Visa has taken a lead role in expanding smart card activity in North America.

The California-based bank card association recently signed four Canadian
institutions to pilot its Visa Cash stored-value product.  And with its
sponsorship of a smart card program that will be launched in conjunction with
the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Visa has become the instrumental player
in generating prepaid card activity in the region.

But the North American programs are just one piece of Visa's worldwide smart
card initiative.  Visa already is piloting Visa Cash in Australia, and plans
to have the product issued in markets around the globe.  Indeed, Visa expects
its chip card activities to expand in six regions this year.  "Visa Cash not
only will grow in various parts of Canada, but it will expand over time in
each of our operating regions," says Gaylon Howe, Visa senior vice president
of stored value products.

However, the most recent Visa activity is occurring in Canada, where Toronto
Dominion Bank, Scotiabank, Vancouver City Savings Credit Union and Les
casisses Desjardins, will be piloting Visa Cash.  Toronto Dominion and
Vancouver City Savings went live in December.

Toronto Dominion is issuing 10,000 disposable Visa Cash cards to 5,000
employees in Toronto, who can purchase cards through a card dispensing machine
at bank headquarters for use in a cafeteria.  Up to 15 card readers are
expected to be installed at retail locations over the next several months,
including Michel's Baguette, MMMarvelous MMMuffins, and The UCS Group
convenience stores.

Adding Income

In addition, Toronto Dominion expects to eventually add other retailers, pilot
a rechargeable Visa Cash card, add smart card features to existing debit and
credit cards and support a loyalty program.  "We see the stored-value product
creating a new revenue stream for the bank," says Steve Phillips, Toronto
Dominion manager of access cards and smart card development.  "Visa research
shows consumers are willing to pay a fee to obtain cards, so we wanted to get
our feet wet and generate technical and business expertise with a pilot."  The
test is expected to last six to 10 months.  The bank expects to eventually
roll out the card to other provinces, Phillips says.

Stored-value card activity also is under way at Vancouver City Savings, which
is issuing 1,200 Visa Cash cards in $20 denominations to its employees in the
Vancouver area.  The cards can be used for purchases at a local McDonald's, a
Subway shop, a bank cafeteria, a gift shop at the Science World children's
museum, and a Starbucks coffee shop.

Vancouver City Savings is one of Canada's largest credit unions with 250,000
members.  "We compete with larger banks and feel we can get ahead in the
market with stored value," a spokesperson says.  Vancouver City's pilot will
run through the spring.  The credit union plans to eventually roll out Visa
Cash throughout British Columbia.

Still developing its chip card program is Toronto-based Scotiabank, which
plans to launch a six-month in-house pilot in early February at two bank sites
in Toronto with 5,000 employees.  Employees can use the cards at the bank
cafeteria, MMMarvelous MMMuffins and Starbucks Coffee shops.  "We want to be
ready when the market moves," says Bob Lounsbury, Scotiabank vice president of
card products and marketing.  "But we don't yet see stored-value cards as
providing an opportunity to steal customers away from other banks."

Quebec's largest credit union, Les caisses Desjardins, will launch a Visa Cash
pilot by March in a yet to be determined location.  The credit union is
scouting for an area with a high concentration of stores that deal in
small-value transactions, such as in an office complex.  Program details are
expected to be finalized by the end of the month.

Acquirer-paid interchange pricing for Visa Cash in Canada has not yet been
determined, though each bank will set its own fees, participants say.
Consumer pricing has not been set, but employees will not pay extra card fees
during the test.

The Canadian financial institutions are positioning to garner a piece of the
large market for low-value transactions.  Visa estimates that transactions of
under $10 account for $75 billion annually in Canada.

Bank executives believe Canadians will embrace stored-value cards because many
consumers already are active debit users.  For instance, Toronto-based
Interac, the national on-line point-of-sale network that was launched in 1990,
has doubled its POS transaction volume in the last year.

More than 7 million Interac cards have been issued up, from 5 million in 1994.
Interac had 50 million POS transactions in December, up from 25 million a year
earlier.  Yet, Interac executives do not expect stored-value activity to cut
into on-line volume because stored value is designed to replace cash or
low-ticket transactions.  The average Interac purchase is about $47.

Competitive Pressures

But while Visa Cash is expected to operate alongside Interac, the stored-value
product could still face strong competition from the London-based Mondex
electronic purse program.  Mondex has signed Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce-two of the largest institutions in the country-and
Hongkong Bank, to issue cards.  Mondex plans to test its product in Guelph,
Ontario, during the second half of 1996.  Guelph has 100,000 residents and
1,200 merchants (Debit Card News, 11/15).

Mondex is positioned as a cash replacement and cards can be loaded with value
at ATMs, bank counters and telephones.  Consumers also can transfer value
among cards, and send value electronically from the point of sale to the bank.

"We are looking to get practical experience from an actual market test, which
shows we are moving faster to bring smart cards to the marketplace," says
Timothy N.  McNaughton, Royal Bank of Canada's manager of pilots and
implementation.

Though some observers believe Visa Cash has an advantage with name awareness,
analysts say both companies face the challenge of getting consumers to try a
new stored-value product.  "Visa's brand recognition gives it an edge, but
both products are starting from scratch," says David Lott, senior of Dove
Associates, a payments consulting firm.  "There is ample room in Canada for
both products."

Another President Departs From Debit Processor Deluxe Data


For the second time in less than three years, one of the debit industry's most
renown processors, Deluxe Data Systems, is working to keep its course in the
midst of a leadership upheaval.  Milwaukee-based Deluxe has named John B.
Benton as interim president, replacing James E.  McGowan.  Benton is chairman
and chief executive officer of Benton International Corp., a Torrance,
Calif.-based consulting firm which develops processing systems.

McGowan exits his position just 28 months after being named president.
McGowan replaced Alan G.  Brown, who reportedly was forced out in 1993.  In a
statement released by Deluxe, Gus Blanchard, president and chief executive
officer of parent company Deluxe Corp., said that a number major changes and
additions to product offerings are planned, and "I felt this major expansion
required new leadership to move us to a higher plane."

Deluxe's new growth strategy, which was developed after a six-month analysis,
features four major initiatives including enhancing the company's payments
protection capabilities and creating larger information data bases.  The aim
is for Deluxe to function as a technology partner and act as a link between
financial institutions and their customers.  Client institutions would be able
to electronically hook their customers to a variety of banking application,
such as being able to check balances from a home computer.

Other initiatives involve restructuring the company's catalog and direct
marketing units, and a major cost reduction and asset redeployment program to
help finance Deluxe's expansion plans.

This development of new initiatives and the replacement of McGowan follows a
rough period for Deluxe.  The company has faced difficult times in recent
years as EFT networks, Deluxe's Data's major clients, have taken their
processing in-house.  For instance, New Jersey-based NYCE, the second-largest
shared network and a former Deluxe client, began processing its own
transactions in 1992

Deluxe also lost a major processing customers in 1990 when Brown Deer,
Wis.-based Tyme, the 22nd--largest network, switched from Deluxe to M&I Data
Services.  Tyme, however, still is a software customer of Deluxe.

Some analysts also say that Deluxe has made some questionable business
decisions in recent years.  In 1994, the company purchased Louisville-based
Financial Alliance Processing Services, one of the industry's fastest growing
credit card processors that offers credit and debit services to about 150
financial institutions.  Some observers believe Deluxe overpaid for Financial
Alliance.

Other observers attribute Deluxe's situation to McGowan's inexperience in EFT.
Though McGowan spent 18 years with IBM and was an executive with three
software and technology firms, he was new to the electronic payments industry
when hired by Deluxe.  McGowan has has been placed on special assignment,
reporting to Blanchard.

"I'm not surprised by this because McGowan was in over his head," says Donald
Atkinson, president of Atkinson & Associates, an Irving, Texas-based data
processing consultant.  Some observers also were surprised by the suddenness
of McGowan's departure and the naming of Benton as interim president.

NACHA Adds More Pieces To The Nationwide EBT Puzzle


Seven months after stating plans to develop national electronic benefits
transfer operating rules, the National Automated Clearinghouse Associ-ation's
electronic benefits transfer council is moving forward.  The council has
developed a set of preliminary rules to clarify the roles of such EBT players
as banks, processors and state governments.  NACHA also has started
negotiations to acquire a logo for a national EBT network.

The EBT council, which is working to create a nationwide EBT system, expects
to release the final version of the rules in March.  State EBT consortiums,
such as the seven-state Northeast Coalition and the eight-state Southern
Alliance of States, plan to incorporate the NACHA rules in their operating
procedures.

"We are trying to create an interoperable environment for EBT so it makes
sense to incorporate these standards," says Daniel Berry, EBT coordinator for
New York State, which is part of the Northeast Coalition.

NACHA's EBT Council consists of representatives from state governments, banks,
processing companies and shared regional EFT networks.  The council is working
with the U.S.  Treasury and the Federal EBT task force to create
specifications for a national EBT program.

The NACHA rules are designed to clarify a wide range of EBT issues.  They
state, for instance, that scrip machines in retail locations can be used to
dispense benefits as long as the device is treated as point-of-sale terminals
and not ATMs.  Scrip machines dispense vouchers that are redeemed for cash by
a store clerk.  Networks have different fee schedules for ATM and POS
transactions.

While some observers say the EBT Council's operating rules will duplicate
existing EFT operating rules, participants say the NACHA group is helping to
simplify procedures.

In addition to developing rules, the EBT council is negotiating with directors
of the defunct Quest shared regional EFT network to use the Quest logo for a
national EBT mark.  The deal is expected to be completed within several weeks.

Kentucky-based Quest was merged into Delaware-based MAC, the third largest
shared regional EFT network last July, but the Quest name is still owned by
Transaction Services Co., which represents seven Kentucky-area financial
institutions.

Blockbuster Has A Casting Call For Its Corporate Prepaid Card


One of The Blockbuster Entertainment Group's newest releases, a prepaid debit
card for consumers, has been re-edited.  Blockbuster has shelved plans to
issue cards to consumers and is concentrating on signing corporate customers
to distribute the stored-value products.

Blockbuster is aggressively working to sign product manufacturers, restaurants
and other merchants to purchase and disperse the prepaid cards to their
customers as a marketing incentive.  Already, Planet Hollywood and publisher
Simon and Schuster have formed alliances with Blockbuster.  Simon and Schuster
is including the disposable magnetic-stripe cards in books sold at college
bookstores.  The co-branded cards can be used for purchases at 3,300
Blockbuster Video, 520 Blockbuster Music and 330 Discovery Zone children's
play-area locations in the U.S.

By targeting the corporate customer, Florida-based Blockbuster has turned its
attention from the consumer market.  Blockbuster began testing its disposable
Value Card in Salt Lake City last summer at 25 Blockbuster Video, Blockbuster
Music and Discovery Zone locations (Debit Card News, 9/7).  The company
reportedly invested more than $1 million in hardware and software for the
program.  Consumers paid $15 for cards that held $20 of value.

Yet, despite strong consumer interest in the cards, Blockbuster did not expand
the program outside of Utah.  More than 100,000 Blockbuster Value Cards were
sold in three weeks and Blockbuster said last fall that the company was
encouraged by the test.  The card was expected to cut transaction times at the
checkout, increase the average ticket size and generate interest income on
unspent funds that are held by Blockbuster.

A Blockbuster spokesperson now says the Salt Lake City program was primarily
designed to test the stored-value operating system and that the company now is
putting all its efforts "into the corporate direction."

In addition to signing product manufacturers and service companies,
Blockbuster is marketing its stored-value GiftCard as a vehicle through which
companies can distribute bonuses to their employees.  Blockbuster also is
positioning the cards as a collectible, which can feature designs depicting a
wide range of themes, such as pictures of hit movies when the films are
released on video.

Most recently, Blockbuster sold GiftCards to consumers during the holiday
season to use as gift certificates.  The Blockbuster spokesperson says using a
mag-stripe card as an electronic gift certificate cut the company's processing
costs and the vehicle is expected to be used again this year.  The GiftCard is
expected to be marketed internationally.

Blockbuster stored-value transactions are processed by Omaha-based First Data
Corp.'s Card Establishment Services/NaBANCO unit, the company's credit card
processor.  During a transaction, the cards are swiped through the stores'
credit card devices and sent to CES/NaBanco for authorization and processing.
Cardholders can check remaining account balances at the point of sale.

The move to market a stored-value product is just Blockbuster's latest
activity in the card market.  Last spring Blockbuster rolled out a co-branded
Visa credit card with NationsBank.

California Surchargers Survive A State Sales Tax Scare


The threatened extinction of the surcharge in California has subsided for the
time being.  The state has backed away from a plan to collect sales tax on
consumer fees that are attached to on-line point-of-sale and automated teller
machine transactions.

The measure, which was proposed last summer by the California Board of
Equalization after an audit of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s Prestige Stations
Inc.  subsidiary, could have cost companies that surcharge millions of dollars
in back taxes.  The regulation also could have resulted in a decrease in
merchant surchargers, and hefty consumer fee increases to compensate for the
taxes, analysts believe.

California determined last year that it was owed taxes from consumer
surcharges on transactions generated at 280 Arco service stations in
California.  Prestige Stations Inc.  operates Arco's 400 company-owned
stations in California, Oregon, Nevada, Washington and Arizona.  Arco charges
consumers 25 cents to initiate on-line debit POS transactions.  While Arco and
California officials would not state the amount of taxes that were in
question, which date back several years, observer believes it was in the
millions of dollars.

The Board of Equalization last month ruled that Arco and other surcharges
should not be subjected to a sales tax because the consumer fee is more of a
financing charge than the sales price of an item, says Dennis Fox, supervisor
of audit planning for the California Board of Equalization.

The board recently published regulations for EFT fees which state that vendors
could be taxed on surcharges if, for instance, the extra fee is not stated
separately; if the consumer could not purchase the property at a price which
does not include the amount of the fee; or if the fee is calculated as a
percentage of the sales price.  The provision is expected to become law in
about four months, following public hearings and a comment period.

By excluding surcharges from the tax code, California has kept a strong
merchant revenue pipeline in place.  Anaheim-based Carl's Jr., for instance,
one of the U.S.'s largest on-line POS merchants with close to 2,000 terminals
in more than 500 outlets, surcharges consumers 50 cents a transaction on
purchases.  Indeed, Fox said the fast-food industry lobbied the state to drop
its plan to tax surchargers.

While Carl's Jr.  reportedly implemented the fee to discourage consumers from
initiating small purchases just to get $40 or more in cash back, analysts
believe the fast-food outlet, as well as Arco, is generating strong income
from the fee.

"This removed a significant barrier to the imposition of surcharges in
California," says Eric Bell, vice president of Los Angeles-based First
Interstate, a leading merchant acquiring institution.  "Most of the surcharge
revenue was pure gravy."

But while California point-of-sale surchargers might have dodged a major tax
bullet, the merchants could be facing another obstacle later this year when
California-based Visa's Interlink national POS network is expected to ban all
merchants from surcharging transactions.

Though the network outlawed surcharging as of November 1993, retailers that
were surcharging prior to that date are allowed to continue the practice until
this November.  The Visa board could address the issue this year, analysts
believe.

Debit-Conscious Australia Says G'Day To Prepaid Cards


While Australia may be best known for its kangaroos and koala bears, some
North American payment players might also be equating the country with guinea
pigs.  For Australia has become a major test site for new and advanced debit
products that eventually will be employed in the U.S., including smart cards.

A stored-value card test is under way on the Gold Coast, a tourist area on the
east coast of Australia, by Visa International.  MasterCard International will
launch a pilot in Canberra, Australia's capital, in March.  The smart card
pilots will help determine how stored-value programs will be designed and
promoted in the U.S.  and other regions.

"The Australia pilot will help us leverage what we learn from consumers,
merchants and member banks about product positioning and marketing," says
Walter Greenberg, MasterCard senior vice president and stored-value project
manager.

Debit Savvy

The bank card associations are using Australia as a test site because research
found that the majority of Australian consumers are willing to use
stored-value smart cards in lieu of cash.  Australians already have embraced
on-line debit cards, with 17 million debit cards issued to the population of
17 million.  Last year, Australian taxis began accepting MasterCard's Maestro
global POS network cards for payment in Sydney.

But while both associations are expanding into Australia, they are following
different routes.  Visa's Visa Cash product currently is just distributed as a
disposable stored-value card, but a reloadable application is expected to be
rolled out in February.

Meanwhile, MasterCard will offer a rechargeable MasterCard Cash card when it
rolls out a stored-value program in March.  "We started with the disposable
card to gain critical mass," says Bruce Mansfield, Visa's head of chip cards
in Australia.  "Because reloadable cards feature bank logos, we didn't want
our banks to compete against each other at the beginning of the pilot."

MasterCard, which is marketing its MasterCard Cash product to consumers this
month via direct mail, will link its stored-value smart card to existing
credit and debit accounts.  MasterCard is not issuing disposable cards for the
Australian pilot.  "Our research shows that consumers want enhancements to
existing cards, rather than have more cards in their wallet," Greenberg says.

Targeting Tourists

Australian stored-value activity was kicked off by Visa in mid-November on the
Gold Coast, an area that attracts nearly 3 million visitors per year.  The
smart cards are being issued by five major financial institutions:  Australia
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Credit Union
Services Corp.  Australia Ltd., National Australia Bank and Westpac Banking
Corp.

The banks have issued more than 10,000 cards and installed 250 card-reading
terminals at an estimated 100 retail locations.  Visa is implementing a
marketing campaign which includes print advertisements and billboards.
Approximately 150,000 cards will be issued during the year-long pilot.

The Visa Cash cards are being sold at about 50 locations, including movie
theaters, theme parks, hotels and financial institution branches.  Reloadable
cards will be added in February and cardholders will be able to add value
through automated teller machines and at the point of sale.

Visa also expects to have 1,000 smart card terminals installed by February.
Most merchants, which include Kmart, Target, McDonald's, 7-Eleven, Shell Oil
and Bond University's book and coffee shop, are situated near two major
shopping centers.  Three theme parks, including Sea World, will accept cards
at about 150 terminals and are expected to go live this month.

About a half-dozen card dispensing kiosks also will be tested and the pilot
might incorporate home-based telephones to add value.  An upgrade to allow
cardholders to store multiple currencies at sites around the world is planned
for 1997.  Pricing for reloadable cards could range from 50 cents per
transaction to $10 annually.

While Mansfield will not disclose current Visa Cash volume, he projects that
activity will reach 25,000 transactions per week in March.  Acquirer-paid
interchange pricing will be determined by each bank.

Meanwhile, MasterCard is just as aggressive in expanding its Australian
program.  MasterCard has been signing merchants since October and expects more
than 200 retailers and 300 smart card terminals to be involved in its pilot in
Belcommen, a suburb of Canberra.  Retailers are paying for terminal
installations.

Gauging Interest

MasterCard Cash issuers-Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, Commonwealth
Bank of Australia, Westpac Banking Corp.  and Standard Charter Bank-will run
month-long, in-house tests with up to 500 employees to strengthen employee
understanding of the product and to test the stored-value operating system.
The employee pilots also will test different consumer pricing.  The banks
expect to issue up to 10,000 cards for the nine-month consumer pilot.
MasterCard banks began a direct mail campaign this month for MasterCard Cash.

Final pricing schedules will be completed by March.  While Australian
regulations restrict banks from publicly disclosing consumer and merchant
pricing, research shows that customers prefer monthly or annual fees, rather
than per-transaction fees.

MasterCard Cash cards will be distributed through bank branches and
cardholders can reload value onto the card's computer chip by transferring
funds from bank accounts at ATMs and at the point of sale.  Future
enhancements could include loading value through home-based telephones.
Full-function kiosks also will be installed, where customers can check
balances and transaction information.

In addition to their Australian effort, Visa and MasterCard also expect to
sign issuers in New Zealand.  L

Visa Stored Value Hits South America

Visa International is expanding into South America with its Visa Cash
stored-value product.  Thirteen Burger King restaurants in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, are accepting the smart cards as part of a six-month test thatbegan
last week.  Visa also is testing Visa Cash in an unspecified number of
McDonald's restaurants in Colombia.

The Buenos Aires project includes 52 merchants, including drug stores,
newspaper stands and taxis.

Debit Puts A Tiny Dent In Bank Branch Activity

Despite expanding debit card activity, bank branches still are capturing the
bulk of retail transactions.  Tampa-based Payment Systems Inc.  reports that
in 1995, 52% of all retail transactions were initiated at financial
institution branches, down just 2% from 1994.  The total volume of
transactions conducted at a traditional branch increased by 6% between 1994
and 1995.

Meanwhile, the share of all transactions conducted at automated teller
machines increased from 22% to 26%, with ATM volumes increasing by 32%, PSI
reports.  Phone banking's share of total transactions increased from 12% to
15%, with a 39% volume increase from 1994 to 1995.

Payment Systems Inc.  determined that active ATM users also use phone banking
systems to transfer funds between accounts or inquire about cleared checks,
and use bank branches to initiate deposits.  ATMs account for 47% of
transactions made by consumers to obtain cash, up from 39% in 1994.
Traditional financial institution branches account for 49% of cash
transactions, down from 54% in 1994, PSI reports.

Paypoint Network Gets A New President

Steve Minihan has been named president of the Atlantic Richfield Co.'s
PayPoint subsidiary.  Minihan replaces John K.  Lannan, who reportedly left
Paypoint because of disagreements with its directors on the future direction
of the operation.  Lannan was responsible for turning Los Angeles-based
Paypoint from a proprietary switch into a major third-party debit and credit
card processor.

In another personnel move, MasterCard International name Sheila Scarry senior
vice president in charge of U.S.  debit products.  Scarry replaces Arthur
Kranzley, who left MasterCard last year to become senior vice president for
Pennsylvania-based Advanta Corp.

CREDIT SUISSE OFFERS PHONE LINK TO GERMAN INVESTORS

CREDIT SUISSE has become the first Swiss bank to launch a telephone
sales service in Germany. The service is called CS-Direct Invest and
follows the May 1995 launch of CS-Direct Invest in Switzerland.

German clients will be able to carry out investment business via an
"account/safekeeping account" in Switzerland. With a minimum investment
of DM10,000 ($7,000), German clients can use CS-Direct Invest to build
up a portfolio from Credit Suisse's Credis Investment Funds.

A Credit Suisse spokeswoman confirmed that because the accounts are
based in Switzerland, German customers are covered by Swiss banking
secrecy laws. Recent years have seen a number of clamp-downs by the
German authorities on banks for allegedly facilitating customers in
avoiding tax through Luxembourg-based funds.

Credit Suisse priced its Swiss product high - mainly to avoid losing
too much business from other areas of its banking service. But the
approach in Germany has been different: "CS-Direct Invest has a
competitive price structure in Germany, but there is a clear
differentiation from discount banks such as Direkt Anlage, Comdirect
and Bank 24," said a bank spokeswoman."Our selling point is not so much
price as service."

The product comes with investment advice and a personal adviser, unlike
German competitors Direkt Anlage, which pared costs to the bone by not
including advice, though it provides information.

The German funds market has grown 25 percent a year since 1990, and
Credit Suisse expects it to grow at least 15 percent a year until 2000.
A spokesman for rival Swiss Bank Corporation said that while it had no
plans to launch a similar product in Germany it was closely observing
the market.

The project will not involve any co-operation with the Winterthur
insurance company, which CS has linked up with in Switzerland.

There are no plans at the moment for PC banking with CS-Direct Invest,
but the bank is watching developments, especially in relation to
improving security.

UNITED STATES:  SIGNET MAIL LOANS MEET LOSSES

AN INNOVATIVE direct loan programme by US regional bank Signet of
Richmond, Virginia has encountered high loan loss rates and sparked
concern among bank analysts. But Signet says the high loan losses are
part of its statistically-driven "cell testing" method and are no cause
for alarm.

Signet's "loan by cheque" programme is one of the most daring
experiments yet in "branchless" banking. The programme uses databased
marketing and advanced computer models to generate pre-approved
consumer loans of up to $10,000. For each pre-approved loan, the bank
simply mails out a cheque to the targeted consumer, who can then cash
it at his local bank.

The new programme relies on the statistical science of "information
discovery", an approach first developed by the US credit card industry
and used to great effect by Signet's highly successful credit card
operation, which the bank spun off into Capital One in early 1995.
Capital One, which uses information discovery to generate customised
new card offers, increased its accounts by 22 percent and its
receivables by 42 percent in 1995.

Information discovery studies each customer's behaviour and calculates
the "net present value" of each customer relationship. It then
continuously analyses customer data to isolate behavioural clusters
that permit the bank to generate customised card or consumer loan
offers. Once these offers are tested and retested among the bank's
existing customers, the resulting models, or "hypotheses", are used to
generate new offers to non-customers taken from external lists.

Signet's cheque-by-mail programme is part of an ambitious bid to
transform the mid-sized regional bank, which has $10 billion in assets
and some 250 branches, into a national consumer bank. Since 1993, the
bank has used statistical modelling and bought lists to mail out offers
for consumer credits, student loans, home equity products and mutual
funds to tens of thousands of prospective customers, who have only to
phone a toll-free telephone number to accept the terms offered.

The bank's declared strategy is to take the statistical methods
pioneered by the credit card industry and extend them into consumer
lending and direct banking. A number of large US banks, including First
Bank and Wells Fargo are using similar methods for national marketing
drives in small business lending and home equity loans, for example,
but Signet's effort is the most aggressive and broadly-based.

"Signet is turning into a cross between a consumer finance company and
a regional bank. It could turn into a huge national company," said Tom
McCandless, an analyst at PaineWebber in New York. "Many banks are
trying to emulate what they're doing."

But the experimental nature of Signet's marketing methods have lately
become a cause for concern among analysts. Signet's programme ran into
trouble in the third quarter of 1995, when its gross charge-offs rose
to $9.3 million, up 63 percent from the previous quarter. As a result,
Signet was forced to double its loan loss provisions to $8.7 million,
and redoubled them again in the fourth quarter to $18.6 million. The
bank's total net charge-offs jumped 20 percent from the third quarter
to $15.6 million.

Signet explained that the higher loan losses were the result of two
mailings the company made in late 1994 to test how lower acceptance
criteria would affect response and profitability. The two mailings
generated $175 million in new loans, but three quarters later they had
created an annualised loss rate of 11.23 percent.

Signet has responded that the third-quarter losses were the result of
mailings the bank deliberately made to higher-risk segments. "In order
to build more effective models, we had to have some losses, and in
order to get some losses, we had to mail to higher risk segments,"
Signet chief operating officer Malcolm McDonald told American Banker.

While the bank was expecting a higher loss rate for these mailings, it
did not expect the high response level - and resulting loss levels -
that the mailings produced. Earlier mailings, he said, did not produce
enough losses to build statistically robust models. McDonald explained
that each mailing has expected losses built into it, and that Signet's
cheque-by-mail programme could sustain higher loan losses and still
generate a"positive net present value".

But fourth-quarter losses have further highlighted the problems of the
loan-by-cheque programme. The loan loss ratio of the programme's two
high-risk mailings reached a miserable 19.5 percent in the fourth
quarter, against 2 percent for the rest of the programme. But Signet
stands by the programme, whose loans its hopes to double in 1996. It
expects high losses to continue in the coming quarters, as high-risk
loans decline as a percentage of the total loan-by-cheque portfolio.

WINTHERTHUR GOES DIRECT WITH SWISSLINE

WINTERTHUR, the Swiss insurance company, has launched a direct
insurance subsidary called Swissline. The company says the opportunity
exists because of the deregulation of the mandatory motor insurance
market.

Balz Hoesly, chief operations officer of Swissline, expects volume to
grow to between 10 percent and 15 percent of the non-life insurance
market by 2000, and expects to make a profit in four to six years.
Swissline will initially offer motor insurance and linked products like
legal help and breakdown recovery, but it is hoped that it will expand
into other forms of insurance "fairly soon".

Swissline is a stand-alone company, and is legally the underwriting
agent for Wintherthur Insurance and Wintherthur Life. It employs 70
people.

"We are aiming to gain lasting competitive advantage in the entire
value-added process," said Hoesly. He cited motivated staff,
first-class service, cost advantages for customers, rigorous cost
management and a high-tech infrastructure as the basics needed for the
success of the direct operation.

Swissline says it deliberately waited for the deregulation moves to
start operations.

BANC ONE RETHINKS SCREENPHONE

A SCREENPHONE pilot launched by US super-regional Banc One has stumbled
badly after three months, forcing the bank to rethink its commitment to
screen telephony. Banc One's poor results highlight the screenphone's
failure to achieve any success in the US market in 1995. Several large
institutions, including Citibank, withdrew from screenphone pilots last
year, and many other banks chose to focus on PC banking instead.

Banc One launched the pilot in the Dallas-Fort Worth area in September,
in partnership with hardware vendor GTE and processor Visa Interactive.
GTE's screenphone was priced at $150, perhaps the lowest price on offer
in the US, where some high-end models have sold for $700. GTE hoped to
sell 2,000 units by the end of 1995, but it sold only several hundred.
Most of the buyers were blue-collar men who were older and less
affluent than expected.

Banc One mailed 150,000 screenphone offers to its customers in Texas,
but the promotion generated far more inquiries about the bank's PC
banking programme than its screenphone service. (Banc One currently
offers PC banking in Ohio through on-line service Prodigy, a programme
it plans to extend to other markets this year.)

In its 1996 Home Banking Report, Jupiter Communications in New York
estimated that PC home banking accounts in the US at 750,000 in 1995
and predicted they would grow to 13 million by the year 2000. But for
screenphones, Jupiter Communications offered a less sanguine view - the
19,000 US households using screenphones for remote banking in 1995
would grow to 600,000 by the year 2000. Since screenphones, unlike PCs,
bear the enormous marketing and hardware risks involved in launching a
new consumer device, Jupiter's screenphone projection should be enough
to dissuade most large banks from trying.

While the screenphone was widely discussed at the 1994 Retail Delivery
Systems conference, it received no attention at all at the 1995 RDS
show, where speeches on PC and Internet banking drew huge crowds. Asked
at one 1995 RDS session to name his greatest marketing failure, Keycorp
marketing chief Steven Cone replied,"At Citibank, my biggest mistake
was backing the screenphone, a wonderful device that no one uses."

BARNETT TESTS CABLE NETWORK

AFTER NEARLY a year of delays, Barnett Banks of Jacksonville, Florida
will offer home banking over Time Warner's Full Service Network (FSN),
an interactive cable service which the entertainment group launched in
December 1994. Time Warner's FSN, the first interactive cable pilot in
the US, has signed up 3,500 customers in Orlando, Florida and now
offers customers local phone service as well as broadband data
transfer.

Barnett's programme, the first US home banking pilot that uses
full-motion interactive television (ITV), will allow FSN subscribers to
combine remote banking with such interactive services as video on
demand, home shopping and video games.

Barnett's home banking package, which is free for all FSN customers who
also bank at Barnett, allows users to check their balances, view
statements and transfer funds by manipulating displays on their TVs
with the help of cable set box. All customer information resides with
Barnett, which encrypts and secures transaction information on its own
proprietary operating system.

Once the holy grail of remote delivery, interactive cable in the US was
completely eclipsed last year by the phenomenal growth and popularity
of the Internet. Only two operators have introduced interactive cable
pilots - Time Warner and regional telco Bell Atlantic, which launched
its service in New Jersey last month.

The expense of upgrading infrastructure has delayed the progress of
both projects and cast doubt on their commercial viability. Bell
Atlantic, for example, said its current cost for telephone and
interactive video service installation is $17,000 per household.

AMEX TESTS IN GERMANY

AMERICAN EXPRESS says its pilot direct bank in Germany is performing
well, though it is "too early" to give figures on the number of new
customers.

The bank offers a Eurocheque card which allows cash withdrawals, cheque
deposits, direct debit functions, and ATM access to thousands of ATMs
across Europe and the world. The service - Giro Direkt - was launched
in October.

The number of accounts in American Express Bank in Germany rose 30
percent between April and October 1995. Of new customers, 50 percent
were not holders of American Express cards.

"Amex Bank has been successfully selling a similar product to its card
members since 1991. We saw that there was growing interest outside the
card member base to offer a similar product.

"We are waiting to see the results of that test, and will then review
the situation," said a spokesman.

Giro Direkt will be evaluated on, among other criteria, the number of
customers and their profiles and usage patterns.

It is possible that the company will open a similar operation in the UK
or elsewhere, if the German operation is a success. American Express
has direct banking operations for card holders only in Paris,
Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

But a spokesman warned: "There are no plans to do anything in the UK at
this stage. We will look at the banking environment, what consumer
interest there is and then move from there."

The project started in Berlin and Hamburg, where the bank says there is
a clear reflection of its current customer profile.

Giro Direkt customers can bank by phone, fax or letter from anywhere in
the world. The bank is hoping to have PC banking by the summer "at the
latest".

Amex declined to say how many staff work on the direct bank, but
American Express Bank employs 220 people from its Frankfurt
headquarters.

DUTCH COURAGE

The Netherlands was one of the first countries to embrace direct
delivery. Yet the country's major institutions show marked differences
in their approach. Diarmuid MacConville reports

DUTCH FINANCIAL institutions were among the pioneers of direct
delivery, and the Dutch are among the world's keenest users of direct
services. At present, about 8.5 percent of retail bank customers use
the telephone, and UK market research company Datamonitor believes that
by the year 2000 almost a quarter of the Dutch population will be
banking by phone.

Direct banking in Holland started in 1978, 15 years before banks
elsewhere realised that customers wanted more flexibility in banking.
Postbank, before its privatisation and absorption into NMB Bank, and
ultimately ING Group, coined the phrase "Thuisbankieren", which is now
used generically for all home banking.

Only cash withdrawals and lodgements required a visit to the post
office; all other transactions could be carried out at home, usually
over the phone. Postbank prospered with direct banking: market share of
savings rose to 17 percent in 1989 from 13 percent in 1978.

Three players - Rabobank, Postbank, and ABN AMRO - dominate the Dutch
market, and account for 80 percent to 90 percent of most types of
banking business. But smaller players, including insurance companies
like Achmea and Aegon, are starting to nibble at the edges of the
direct banking market. Postbank has been by far the quickest into the
direct market; the other big banks are only slowly starting to add
direct banking services to the main offering.

A spokesman for a rival bank said: "That is because for us, direct
banking is only one channel of distribution, not the main one, like it
is for Postbank."

Postbank, part of the ING group, is basically a stand-alone direct
bank, though it does have dedicated counters in post office branches
around the country. It started experimenting with alternative
distribution channels in the 1960s, while it was still state-owned.
Today, the telephone is its main distribution channel. It claims a
banking relationship with one-third of Dutch households, about 6
million people.

Postbank has 500 staff at four processing centres, all dealing with
customer queries. The bank generates most of its customer credit
inquiries from the post offices (60 percent) compared to 27 percent
from mailed material, which is also used extensively.

Some 800 customer service agents at 11 Postbank call centres deal with
8.5 million inquiries. This has been supplemented by Girofoon, an
Automatic Voice Response (AVR) unit launched in 1993. But Postbank
managers are sceptical about customer acceptance. "We are convinced
that many of our best customers do not yet appreciate it," said Herman
Huizinga, Postbank's head of telephone banking. "Because we are not yet
convinced of the full acceptance of the medium, we are not forcing
customers to use voice response."

The bank also has AVR units to reply to questions about share prices
and its mortgage products.

ABN AMRO, which also has an AVR unit, started its pilot human operator
phone banking service early in 1996. Clients of 33 branches can use it,
allowing them to buy and sell stocks and shares and obtain market
information. From February 19, a service line will be available,
allowing account transfers and other banking services.

An ABN AMRO spokeswoman said that the continuation of manned phone
banking depends on the results of the pilot. The bank wants to focus
the direct banking as an add-on service for branch-based customers
rather than as a stand-alone operation. Now employing about 50 people,
the call centre is expected to expand to several hundred if the manned
telephone banking operation goes ahead.

Achmea Group came from the merger of Avero Central Beheer Group (AVCB)
and Zilveren Kruis Group and started operating at the start of 1995. A
Salomon Brothers study put the market penetration of its Dutch direct
car insurance service (Centraal Beheer, set up in 1975) on a par with
Direct Line, the UK's largest motor insurer.

Direct banking, run by AVCB Bank, was started as part of the Central
Beheer direct insurance operation in 1988. It offered consumer credit
and started operating as a stand-alone bank in 1992 when it got a
banking licence allowing it to offer savings accounts. It now also
offers credit cards.

The bank makes use of the insurance operation's call centre, mostly for
non-clients who call to get information about the bank, often after a
mail-shot. Existing clients phone the front offices direct to transact
business, and staff at the front offices spend most of their time
dealing with client calls. Product manager Cobi Weddepohl said very few
clients feel the need to call in person to the bank offices.

All banking activities are being reorganised within Achmea; there are
currently three banks with AVCB Bank selling products under four
different labels. The aim is to have one bank holding company with one
back office and several front offices.

Co-operative Rabobank Nederland, which has about 4.9 million retail
customers, has an AVR unit. This was only set up in late 1994 and
allows balance inquiry, funds transfer and information on personal
loans.

A Rabobank spokesman said its priority is "advisory banking", and that
any telephone services are additional. "Meeting customers face-to-face
is a very important part of the relationship." But the spokesman added:
"That could change if the there's a need in the market. For example,
our order line for share buying came in due to competition from
others."

Generale Bank Nederland (formerly Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland),
while much smaller than its rivals, has dipped into the direct banking
market with Direktbank. It offers a limited range of banking services,
and its main distribution channel is through a network of independent
intermediaries. Sources in Generale have indicated it could turn more
to direct banking to increase market share without the expense of
creating more branches.

VSB Telebank, part of the financial conglomerate Fortis, was started in
1990 as a result of an efficiency drive in the VSB Bank. It started
with five staff and now has 30. Some 18 telemarketing staff man the
lines 24 hours a day, 365 days a year
- the first Dutch bank to offer this service.

Calls doubled after the first year and have grown linearly since then.
At the same time, branches are being closed or are reducing their
opening hours.

An AVR unit deals with simple queries and standard calculations. When
more detail is required on a particular item, telesales staff will
arrange a meeting with staff in the nearest branch.

The bank strongly believes in tying most customers to their branches,
thus overcoming the resentment often felt by established branches from
the development of a direct banking operation. Branches are credited
with sales made by telemarketing staff who take commission on it.

The bank is careful to point out that it also has stand-alone customers
in niche markets; this relates generally to the "upscale market
segment" where it operates with financial advisers Finles, a company
specialising in advising professional associations.

VSB said that the conversion rate - the number of contacts that lead to
a direct sale - is substantially higher for VSB Telebank than for
branch contacts, and said that 70 percent of VSB Telebank sales are
settled on the phone rather than through the post or branch visits.

Spaarbeleg, the banking subsidiary of insurer Aegon, believes its low
overheads allow it to offer some of the most competitive interest rates
on the market. Customer numbers have doubled since 1993 to 700,000.
Revenues increased by two-thirds to DFL488.5 million ($268.4 million)
over the same period. It positions itself as a simple, high-interest
alternative in the savings market.

One of its two products is a savings account for employees of
corporations which allow employers to offer their employees a fixed sum
of money in a tax-efficient manner at an attractive rate of interest.
Aegon thinks that the savings market will continue to grow in response
to the government's policy of encouraging citizens to provide for
themselves.

Heinie Hakker, banking analyst at BZW, said that of the insurance
companies nibbling the edges of the market, Aegon's Spaarbeleg has been
the most successful, because it offers better interest rates than the
banks and also uses direct marketing techniques.

A Postbank spokesman, commenting on the high interest rates offered by
Spaarbeleg, admitted it would not be able to compete with this rate on
all its accounts, but said Postbank has the huge advantage of a very
strong position in the payments system.

The next development in direct banking in the Netherlands is the
October 1996 launch of a multifunctional chip card. PTT Telecom, the
Dutch telecom company, has joined forces with ING to create a card
which can be used in shops, phone booths and banks. They can be loaded
with money at post offices, telephone booths, and eventually at home
with a special attachment to existing phones. The money added to the
card will be debited from a customer's account.

Between them, the phone company and the bank have "access to
practically every household in the Netherlands", according to Ben
Verwaayen, president of PTT Telecom.

The system is especially designed to be an open one, and the designers
hope other retail groups will take part in it. The Dutch partners say a
project on this scale has never been tried before in Europe and
possibly beyond.

They did not wait for the consensus that is usual among Dutch banks
before launching a project. "The speed to market was all-important,"
Verwaayen said.

A similar electronic purse is being piloted by the other Dutch banks,
though it is a less ambitious project than the "multifunctional" card
venture.

ABN AMRO and most other banks say they are undecided about joining the
new venture, pointing out that they are already committed to an
all-bank chip card project, currently under test in Arnhem.

BZW analyst Hakker said: "Both ING and PTT are putting themselves
behind it, and they are in dominant positions in their markets. It can
become a big success. The Arnhem card has been badly received by trade
and industry because it is too inflexible and too expensive."

Rabobank said it will "certainly not" be involved in the Postbank card.
A spokesman said that the combined banks' card would probably be
available in a few months, before the Postbank card, and that research
from the pilot project in Arnhem was very positive.

"On a scale of one to ten, customers gave it 7.2 and retailers gave it
6.9. Retailers don't think it's too expensive. And 58 percent of
retailers would recommend it to others, said a Rabobank spokesman.

PC-based home banking is well advanced. For example, Postbank has
117,000 customers, including 91,000 retail who subscribe to Girotel,
the PC-based home banking service launched in 1988. Subscriptions have
taken off since September 1994 - a three-fold growth was seen after the
introduction of a friendlier home banking system.

The service is off-line, so users can complete all the necessary data
and send when they are ready. This has led to cost savings for the bank
as well as for customers who do not have to wait for processing to be
done on-line, saving them on the phone bill.

Rabobank has 80,000 private customers and 70,000 companies banking via
PCs, and expects this to grow to 200,000 within "a couple of years".
The bank's PC banking started in 1992. A typical day would have about
150,000 corporate transactions and 35,000 personal transactions.

The use of smart phones has met with little success, however. On a
Postbank test, while technically successful, customers felt that the
added convenience of banking with screenphones did not outweigh their
high costs.

"At the moment, we draw the conclusion that the coming years will be
dominated by the use of the straightforward phone. Rapid penetration of
mobile telecommunication can support this. And in all circumstances we
have to rely on our staff to communicate with the customer," said
Postbank's Huizinga.

AVCB Bank is trying out PC banking in 1996, and may go ahead depending
on the results of the pilot.

HONG KONG SET TO LEAP-FROG DIRECT

A variety of factors particular to the territory mean that the
development of direct delivery is taking an unusual course in Hong
Kong. Andrew Moody reports

HONG KONG, like many centres in Asia, is a major focus for technology.
The people, too, are gadget-obsessed. It is therefore somewhat
surprising that this culture of technology has not spread to direct
delivery.

The lack of development in this area is not because Hong Kong is
unsophisticated in banking terms - it is one of the leading financial
centres of the world, and its 400 banks are a key element of that
strength.

But while the corporate banking community is fairly advanced in
technology terms, retail banking appears pretty slow off the mark. A
key reason for this is that Hong Kong is by geographical and
sociological accident clumsily suited to the primary forms of direct
delivery in banking.

Telephone banking often requires huge space but Hong Kong, where land
comes at a higher premium than anywhere in the world, does not have
much to spare. And in a country where unemployment has until recently
been insignificant, no-one, particularly anyone calling themselves a
banker, wants to be a telephone operative.

Sergio Rial, general manager of ABN AMRO in Hong Kong, agrees that the
steps towards telephone banking in the territory are only tentative.
"The real challenge and the barrier to phone banking in Hong Kong is
the people. In a place of full employment, no professional wants to be
behind a phone. I don't think they would be able to hold their heads up
as a real banking professional," he says.

And he adds: "Going through password procedure and paying people's
utility bills would not be anybody's idea of fun. Everybody here wants
to be part of a go-ahead marketing team, not this."

So what have Hong Kong banks been doing in terms of direct delivery
systems? The first steps towards telephone banking came in the late
1980s and early 1990s, pioneered by the territory's major players,
Hongkong Bank, Hang Seng Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered.

"We have been in direct banking since 1990 in one form or another. We
can do telephone, we can do fax and we have been looking at the most
cost-effective and customer-receptive forms of direct banking to
implement," says Eric Tai, senior executive, retail, marketing and
planning for the Hongkong Bank and a leading figure within the
territory's banking community.

"Most banks in Hong Kong have some direct banking offer but it is still
offered within the bank itself rather than by setting up a separate
entity such as First Direct."

But the services offered in Hong Kong are more primitive compared to
many of those in the west. The standard product is automated so that a
customer speaks to a voice-activated machine which is able to carry out
simple routine transactions. Generally, only AB and high-rated
customers get the chance to speak to a person, but that individual may
be someone from their branch who they would normally deal with during
the course of their conventional banking transactions.

High employment and land prices are not the only barriers to telephone
banking. The greater role played by the ATM compared to the west may be
another.

In Hong Kong, the ATM is not just something in which you insert your
card to check your balance and withdraw cash but something much more
highly prized. People can pay their utility bills, swap money between
different accounts and carry out a variety of other functions.

In fact, in most streets in Hong Kong the ATM machine seems to be a
community focal point, like some open air post office, where people can
stop and gossip, judging by the crowds they tend to gather around them.

Staggeringly, there are 7 million ATM cards in use in the territory
serving a population of 6 million.

In part, the ATM has taken over many of the functions served by
telephone banking in the west, and the average ATM transaction costs
the bank one-eighth of what it would cost over the counter.

ATMs, however, are still more costly than more modern methods of direct
delivery. They don't operate independently of branches. In fact, many
operate within them, so this halfway house towards full direct delivery
is far from ideal.

But the real catalyst for a wholesale change to more sophisticated
forms of banking could be the economy itself. So far, economic
pressures on the banks to adopt new methods of technology have
certainly been nowhere near as great as in the west.

Retail banking in Hong Kong is as profitable as virtually anywhere in
the world. Much of this has to do with the fact that Hong Kong has
averaged economic growth rates of between 5 percent and 8 percent for
the last decade. It has also operated an infamous interest rate cartel.

Bank customers have, therefore, been getting richer and more
middle-class. There have therefore been fewer bad debtors, savings
rates have been higher and the bottom line of the banks ever bigger. In
1993, for example, the Hang Seng Bank, 62 percent-owned by the Hongkong
Bank, was the most profitable retail bank in the world, according to
credit rating agency IBCA. Consequently, banks have not been forced to
cut costs by closing branches, get rid of staff and move more quickly
towards automated methods of banking.

This factor, however, is beginning to change. GDP growth forecasts for
Hong Kong, particularly over the difficult period of 1997 when the
colony transfers from British to Chinese control, look very uncertain.
A survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit, published in January,
points to growth slumping to 1.7 percent in 1997, compared to around 5
percent now. If this is the case, retail banking in Hong Kong can no
longer rely on the ever-increasing wealth of their customers to dig
them out of a hole.

The new harsher economic environment has undoubtedly begun to change
the thinking among senior bank executives within the major banks.

Alex Au, vice chairman and chief executive of the Hang Seng Bank, is in
no doubt the banks will have to adapt to the new environment.

"What is coming will be dramatic and will totally reshape the business.
By the end of the millennium retail banking will have undergone major
plastic surgery," he says. "It has become increasingly apparent that
the future of banking lies in automation and technology applications.
With the higher cost of operations, finding a more efficient way to
deliver banking services to customers is one of the critical factors
for financial institutions."

ABN AMRO's Rial believes that Hong Kong banks in their evolutionary
development will actually by-pass conventional telephone banking and
take a quantum step from branch banking to PC home banking. "Because of
the constraints within the market, I can see this happening. There are
also many local factors making it difficult to operate telephone
banking in any meaningful sense, so I would not be surprised if Hong
Kong banks took this peculiar step forward," he says.

Some, however, do not quite hold with this theory. Peter Wong,
vice-president of global consumer banking for Citibank in Hong Kong,
believes there is mileage in telephone banking. From his office next to
the futuristic Hong Kong Telecom Tower in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay, he
mainly deals with higher net worth customers.

"We have had considerable take-up of our telephone banking services,
and they have gone down well with our customers. We have a satisfaction
rating for this service of 90 percent, compared with 82 percent for our
conventional banking," he said.

Assuming, however, that the era of telephone banking in Hong Kong is
some form of interregnum - a brief stop on the way to more
sophisticated systems of direct delivery - what methods do the banks
have in mind?

The leading banks are already investing heavily behind closed doors
into technologies that will make home PC or TV banking a reality.
Electronic banking is already available to the corporate market and it
will inevitably spread into the retail market. Consumers in Hong Kong
are very computer literate; it is estimated that 200,000 people in the
territory are already Internet subscribers. And it is expected that
within just a few years, once banks have developed secure transaction
technology, there will be a flood of customers wanting to do their
banking over the Internet.

The direct delivery of banking services into people's homes through
interactive multi-media services may happen even more quickly. A number
of banks are planning to broadcast product information through this
technology in 1996 paving the way to them conducting transaction
banking through this medium.

Electronic cash could soon become a reality in Hong Kong with the
imminent introduction of smart cards. The Mondex card is expected to be
on trial later this year with a major launch in 1997. How it will take
off is difficult to judge. It is seen in the west as an anti-crime
measure but in Hong Kong there is virtually no cash crime.

A bank likely to lead the market is the Hongkong Bank, which has been
investing heavily in this new technology. "We are not doing home
banking yet but we are coming along with it. We are currently working
with Hongkong Telecom jointly to do TV banking. All the different
interfaces which are possible technologically are being looked at,"
says Hongkong's Tai.

Its sister bank, the Hang Seng, is also a driving force. "In terms of
technology products in use Hong Kong is still in the early stages of
technology banking when compared to the western countries," says Alex
Au.

"But although investment in new technology involves huge sums, banks
cannot afford not to make the investment. For in the end, technology
banking means - for both external and internal operations - improved
efficiency, higher productivity, better risk control and lower costs."

NAB LEADS IN PHONE BANKING

NATIONAL AUSTRALIA Bank has leapt ahead of its major competitors in
phone banking by permitting loans to be issued over the phone.

In late December, the bank announced that it had launched a telephone
loans service which will approve homes loans within 25 minutes, and a
personal loan or a credit card approval in around 15 minutes, using a
computer-based credit assessment system developed by the bank over the
past two years.

Provided the customer passes all tests, loan approval is subject only
to the customer presenting the required documents when calling into a
branch to sign loan documents.

Telephone banking has come very much into its own over the past two
years in Australia, with most of the smaller banks notably ahead of
their major rivals in offering phone services. NAB managing director
Don Argus, said National was the only bank "offering this level of
convenience".

ADVANCE ON THE NET

SECOND TIER Australian bank, Advance Bank, has become the first
Australian institution to allow its customers to access accounts
through the Internet.

Using software developed by an Australian company Techway, based in
Sydney, Advance announced in late December that its customers could now
use a pin number to gain access to their accounts through the bank's
site on the Internet.

A bank spokesman said the information accessible was initially limited
to basic account information, but the bank hoped to extend the services
available into a full alternative to its existing phone inquiry
service.

The security of the system is guaranteed by two levels of encryption,
with the second level involving a 128-bit key used for each session, as
opposed to the commonly used 40-bit encryption key.

The customer needs adequate Internet access, but does not require any
additional software.

UK WELCOMES DIRECT ROUTE

BANKS AND building societies came top of the supplier list for people
who would buy life assurance, pensions and investments over the phone,
according to a UK survey by consultants Prospektus.

When asked which type of company they would buy direct, "My bank or
building society" was the preferred choice of 76 percent, almost twice
the number choosing a "traditional insurance company", the next most
popular choice.

Anna Ellison, director of consultants Prospektus, says that people feel
that their bank is less likely to sell them an unsuitable product.
"It's the idea of the old-fashioned bank manager - a relationship where
they don't want to see me get into trouble."

The survey found people tended to associate selling by insurance
companies with pressure to spend more than they could afford.

One quarter of the 4,000 people surveyed said they were prepared to
complete the purchase direct, either by phone, mail or computer. This
seems to contradict the general view that these products are too
complex to sell direct, and require advice and advisers.

A major attraction of buying direct seems to be"the positive experience
of the price and service benefits delivered by companies such as Direct
Line and First Direct". Six out of ten customers cited value for money
as their key motivation for wanting to buy this way.

Banks were most popular among the mass market while affluent customers
tended to see pensions and insurance as more complex matters requiring
advice.

Customers cited companies like Marks and Spencer (17 percent), the Post
Office (34 percent), and even the utility companies (16 percent) as
places where they would buy life assurance, pensions and investments.

POLAND'S BANK CONSOLIDATION PROGRAMME CRITICISED BY S&P

BANK RATING agency Standard & Poor's has criticised Poland's bank
consolidation programme, saying it will not affect the creditworthiness
of the banks.

The Polish government has changed its bank strategy in the past year to
accelerate the privatisation of the remaining banks. Rather than
selling them off as it has done with four of the nine banks to date, it
now plans to merge the banks into two of the leading specialised banks -
 Polska Kasa Opieki (Pekao) and Bank Handlowy w Warsawie.

Under the plan, Bank Handlowy w Warsawie will absorb Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy (PBKS) and Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy (BPH), while Pekao will
merge with Bank Depozytowo-Kredytowy, Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy and
Polski Bank Rozwoju (PBR).

According to Standard & Poor's, "the consolidation would not
significantly enhance the creditworthiness of the two acquiring banks,
or be sufficient to propel either into the investment- grade range for
zloty-denominated obligations".

It added that certain risks would increase in the near term, as the
mergers would bring increased credit risk with the loan portfolio, and
the integration process could be difficult. S&P said that objections
from shareholders of the already semi- privatised banks BPH and PBR, as
well as from regional bank managements "could still scuttle the deal".

Recent reports from Poland said the president of BPH claimed she would
fight the merger with Bank Handlowy w Warsawie if it meant BPH would
lose its separate identity. And the president of Pomorski Bank
Kredytowy is reported to have said that a takeover of PBKS and BPH
would cause chaos and delay the privatisation process.

S&P said that"a more jaundiced view" held by some market players is
that the consolidation strategy is merely a ploy by the government for
reasserting control over the banking system, a theory which will be
borne out, it said, if Bank Handlowy w Warsawie and Pekao are not
privatised.

On the plus side, S&P said the consolidation plan could give the two
banks greater diversity and market share, which could be positive
factors. Bank Handlowy w Warsawie would gain more retail deposits and
commercial clients. Pekao would triple its retail distribution network
and possibly benefit from the institutional corporate finance expertise
of Polski Bank Rozwoju, which would complement its retail brokerage
strength.

CZECH REPUBLIC:  CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCES PLAN TO EASE BANK CRISIS

THE CZECH National Bank (CNB) has announced a consolidation programme
for small Czech banks to improve confidence in the sector, following
the near-collapse of a fourth bank in January. The programme affects
about 8 percent of the banking sector and will require small banks to
recapitalise and reduce their bad debt exposures by the end of 1996.

Ekoagrobanka, a small agricultural bank based in Usti nad Labem, north
Bohemia, was forced into administration by the CNB's Banking
Supervision Committee in mid-January and remained closed for more than
a week after rumours flared that it was having difficulties, creating
queues outside its 79 branches.

The CNB advanced the bank CK1 billion ($37.4 million) to help cover the
rush on its demand deposits, and the CNB issued a statement in support
of Ekoagrobanka and its likely recovery. Shareholders agreed
reluctantly to a capital reduction by nearly CK600 million to only
CK1.2 million plus the injection of CK500 million of fresh capital from
Konsolidacni Banka, which becomes the largest shareholder.

The CNB stated that Ekoagrobanka depositors should face no limits on
their withdrawals once the bank opens again for business. Although
depositors are insured for 80 percent of deposits up to CK130,000 under
a new national scheme, many are nervous following the collapse of three
other Czech banks in the past two years - Kreditni a Prumyslova Banka,
AB Banka and Ceska Banka.

The CNB had Ekoagrobanka under close scrutiny due to its large level of
overdue loans, but CNB spokesman Martin Svehla said unlike the three
banks which collapsed, Ekoagrobanka had a realistic plan for
strengthening its capital adequacy and was implementing that plan
within the agreed time.

The 1994 annual accounts of Ekoagrobanka received a heavily qualified
audit from local firm BDO. The auditors noted that reserves for
doubtful debts of CK266 million should, in fact, be CK1,291 million and
provisions against losses on securities should be raised from CK25
million to CK494 million. Total assets in the qualified accounts
amounted to CK12,005 million.

Short-term deposits amounted to 66 percent. The stated profit was CK63
million on CK1,286 million of revenue. The bank had planned to double
its share capital by issuing CK600 million of shares on the Prague
Stock Exchange, but there were few interested buyers.

The National Bank of Slovakia followed the example of their Czech
counterparts and placed the ten Slovak branches of Ekoagrobanka in
forced administration in mid-January.

The CNB has not revealed the names of the banks which it has forced
into its new consolidation scheme, partly for fear of creating further
pressures at a sensitive time. But it is known that many small Czech
banks are struggling from high levels of bad and doubtful debts and low
margins compared to the larger banks.

Banking analysts consider the Czech Republic to be over-banked,
especially with many smaller banks failing to offer a differentiated
service and thus suffering from a lack of access to low-interest loans
and poor quality borrowers.

CZECH REPUBLIC:  CREDITANSTALT TO SELL FUND MANAGEMENT BUSINESS

AUSTRIAN BANK Creditanstalt has agreed to sell its Czech fund
management business Creditanstalt Investment Company to Czech bank
Agrobanka.

The Creditanstalt Investment Company (CAIC), which was established to
participate in the Czech Republic's privatisation programme, manages
the investment portfolios of two coupon privatisation funds,
Creditanstalt Czech Investment Fund (CCIF) and the Creditanstalt Czech
Infrastructure and Utilities Investment Fund (CCIUIF).

Creditanstalt owns 80 percent of CAIC with the rest held by local
investors who are also selling their stake. The sale should be
finalised in the next three months, according to Creditanstalt.
However, the Austrian bank will retain the money market, share funds
and pension funds business of CAIC which will be managed by
Creditanstalt Securities in Prague.

CCIF is listed on the London Stock Exchange where foreign investors
hold over 10 percent of the fund. Agrobanka has offered to buy over
these shares. When complete, Agrobanka will then own all of the shares
of the fund manager and will control the management and investments of
CCIF and CCIUIF.

Agrobanka is the fifth largest bank in the Czech Republic with 350
offices and a sizeable funds management business. Despite the sale,
Creditanstalt still maintains a considerable presence in the Czech
Republic where it has eight offices and a share in Komercni Banka.

RUSSIA REVOKED OVER 300 BANK LICENCES IN 1995

RUSSIA'S CENTRAL Bank revoked the licences of 315 banks in 1995. This
represents over 12 percent of the total number of banks operating in
the country last year.

More than 80 percent of the 2,500 commercial banks examined by the
Central Bank had also broken the law during the year. The Central Bank
also restricted the operations of 423 banks and introduced temporary
management at five banks.

The majority of suspensions happened in August when a liquidity crisis
hit the Russian banking system, crippled the domestic credit market and
brought the system to a standstill. Many banks were unable to meet
obligations on the interbank market (see EEB56). The crisis left few
banks untouched with many smaller banks in particular being badly hit.

The crisis led to a shift in the balance of forces that has affected
even top banks. It led to a serious shake-up in the banking system with
many of the top banks forging close alliances with each other.

Many of the top ten banks reacted to the crippling demise of the
interbank market by forming their own alliance, offering to resume
lending to each other in return for mutual access to financial records.

In response to the crisis, the Central Bank is planning to introduce in
March new laws which will determine how banks will be run and funded.
It has also set up a programme to identify troubled banks.

CZECH AND RUSSIAN BANKS IN JOINT VENTURE

INVESTICNI A Postivni Banka (IPB), the third largest Czech bank, has
entered into a joint venture to establish an investment bank in Russia.
The First Czech-Russian Bank was established in Moscow in a deal
between IPB and local firm Vozrozdenije Bank. IPB will hold a majority
of the $6 million of initial capital.

IPB officials said they had considered buying an established operation,
but settled instead for a joint venture with a local bank which had
complementary operations. The new bank is IPB's first joint venture
outside of the Czech Republic.

UNISYS LOSES A SECOND CONTRACT IN PRAGUE

WESTERN COMPUTER heavyweight Unisys is licking its wounds in the Czech
Republic after losing a major defence contract as its rivals raked over
the embers of its failed contract with savings bank Ceska Sporitelna.

In December Unisys won a tender to supply the Czech Army with an
integrated computer system as the country prepares for entry to NATO.
But the announcement created such a furore among competing firms that
the authorities cancelled the deal a week later.

Although the main reason was said to be the lack of compatibility of
the Unisys system with NATO systems, the army also appeared surprised
to hear about Ceska Sporitelna's experience with the computer firm.

Unisys sealed its first contract with Sporitelna in 1992 to automate
the bank's back office functions, including bookkeeping and inter-bank
transfers, and later to develop a fully integrated banking system
throughout 650 branches. But the projects were dogged by delays,
constantly changing requirements and ongoing disputes.

Sporitelna claims Unisys was using the Czech Republic as a retirement
home for low-quality staff. Unisys claims Sporitelna lacked consistent
policies and made unreasonable demands outside the terms of its
contracts. Either way, in 1995 the bank cancelled the deals and took
over training and project management, leaving Unisys with a hardware
service contract. Both claim they are owed millions of crowns by the
other.

Whatever the truth of the matter, the issue has given Unisys rivals a
major competitive weapon and left the firm scrambling to convince
locals of its capabilities.

CZECHS SIGN AGREEMENT WITH KUWAIT

THE CZECH Republic signed an investment treaty with Kuwait in early
January and is poised for a substantial boost to its search for $100
million of debt to help finance a transnational railway reconstruction
linking Poland and Austria through the Czech Republic.

Czech prime minister Vaclav Klaus toured Kuwait with 25 bankers and
businessmen as part of a general diplomatic and trade mission
throughout the Gulf. The new Czech-Kuwaiti investment treaty aims to
protect investment in the respective countries.

Elsewhere, Czech banks are preparing for an increase in business with
the former Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Croatia, now that a peace pact
appears likely to hold. The Czech Export Bank (CEB) and the Export
Guarantee and Insurance Company (EGAP) are both working on funding to
help support merchants and others targeting the battle-scarred zone.

Czech and Slovak businesses once had strong ties to the region, and
many expect to renew them now that the embargo on Serbia has been
lifted. Some firms are also keen to capitalise on the extensive
reconstruction and infrastructural work which will be required, with
the CEB and the EGAP hoping to help with finance and insurance.

HUNGARY SEEKS TO DELAY CROSS-BORDER BANKING

HUNGARIAN AUTHORITIES want a two-year postponement of an OECD
membership requirement allowing foreign banks to open branches in the
country, according to the finance ministry.

Hungary is expected to join the OECD later this year but wants the two
year grace period to overhaul its banking sector and prepare for cross-
border banking. Hungary has already spent nearly $3 billion
restructuring and privatising banks and helping them deal with bad
loans.

RUSSIA'S MOST-BANK OPENS IN AZERBAIJAN

RUSSIA'S MOST-BANK opened a branch in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan,
at the end of December. It is the first major foreign bank to open a
branch in Azerbaijan following the Azerbaijani parliament's decision
last year to lift the restriction on foreign capital not exceeding 49
percent of the charter capital of any bank in the republic.

Most-Bank Azerbaijan will serve local and Russian exporters and finance
the construction of housing and industrial enterprises in the city. The
new branch is Most-Bank's first foreign subsidiary.

IPARBANKHAZ OF HUNGARY TO CLOSE

IPARBANKHAZ, THE state-controlled Hungarian commercial bank is to close
in February. At an extraordinary general meeting on December 29, the
bank's shareholders decided to cease banking activities by the end of
February as no buyer had been found for the bank. The state controls
over 80 percent of the bank.

EEB reported last month that the troubled commercial bank was to be
closed down after a gradual liquidation reimbursed depositors.

Iparbankhaz stopped accepting new current accounts at the end of last
November and it will cease to handle these accounts from the end of
January. The bank has asked deposit account holders to withdraw their
funds and said it will pay no interest on deposits after January 15.

Banks have been invited to submit offers for the bank's branches, and
offers will be evaluated by the end of January.

BUDAPEST BANK DEAL GOES THROUGH

GE CAPITAL, the banking and insurance arm of the US General Electric
corporation, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD) purchased a combined 60 percent stake in Budapest Bank in
Hungary in late December.

The transaction has been the first bank privatisation in Hungary in
which the state sold off a majority stake to strategic investors in one
round.

The privatisation allows control of the bank's board and management to
pass from the state to the institutions's new owners. GE Capital will
have operational control of the bank, and will provide the Bank with
new financial products, technology and training.

The deal cost $87 million with GE Capital taking a 27.5 percent stake
and the EBRD acquiring 32.5 percent. In October GE Capital signed a
memorandum of agreement with the Hungarian government to carry out due
diligence of Budapest Bank as a prelude to purchasing a stake in the
bank (see EEB57).

Budapest Bank, Hungary's second bank by capital, with a comparatively
large retail network of over 74 branches, was under pressure to secure
a buyer by the end of 1995 in order to hold on to a controversial state
capital injection made prior to a failed buy-out deal earlier in the
year.

Swiss Bank Credit Suisse pulled out of a purchase deal following its
own due diligence. It is believed to have been mainly dissuaded by key
discrepancies in strategy between the two banks.

Budapest Bank declared a net profit in 1994 of HUF1.6 billion ($12.2
million), mostly due to a capital injection of HUF12 billion secretly
made by the government to shore up losses after the compulsory creation
of a HUF21 billion fund to cover bad loans. It has assets of HUF210
billion and has an image as one of the most innovative banks with
western-style management and product launches.

BANK CRISIS HITS LITHUANIA

THE LITHUANIAN banking system was plunged into crisis in the New Year
sparked by the suspension of the two of the country's commercial banks
at the end of December. The Bank of Lithuania suspended the operations
of the banks and froze their assets, accusing them of insolvency.

The two banks which had been set to merge - Litimpeks and the
Lithuanian Incorporated Innovation Bank (LAIB) - are now at the centre
of an insolvency and fraud investigation.

The reasons for the insolvency of the Lithuanian Joint-Stock Innovation
Bank and Litimpeks banks are being investigated. International audit
company Ernst & Young is performing an audit in these two banks," said
a Bank of Lithuania statement.

The suspensions and investigation have had a serious knock-on effect on
the rest of the banking sector with fears of a run on bank deposits.

On January 9, the government and the Central Bank issued a statement
saying most of the commercial banks were operating normally and
advising people to ignore rumours about the instability of certain
banks. It also urged them not to withdraw deposits from commercial
banks and said that banks were not experiencing difficulties with
payments to customers.

Reports in early January suggested that many Lithuanian commercial
banks had started to run out of hard currency as depositors rushed to
withdraw funds following the suspension of the two banks. Depositors,
fearing a devaluation of the national currency, the litas, queued at
major banks to withdraw hard currency from their accounts.

One report said the demand for US dollars increased tenfold since the
crisis broke, while another said hard currency deposits had dropped by
22 percent and individual deposits by 16 percent. But the government
and the central bank ruled out a devaluation.

However, both the Prime Minister and the President promised state aid
for personal and corporate account holders of the two suspended banks
and said the government will assume liability for their deposits.

The Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas, passed a law on December 21
bringing in a mandatory insurance scheme to protect private investors
against lost bank deposits.

Lithuanian politics were also thrown into chaos by the crisis when the
foreign minister and defence minister resigned in protest against Prime
Minister Adolfas Slezevicius's move to withdraw deposits from his
accounts in the LAIB just days before its operations were suspended.

President Algirdas Brazaukas, however, refused to accept the ministers'
resignations. Slezevicius maintained he did nothing wrong and said he
would stay in office despite some calls for his resignation.

There were also calls for the resignation of Central Bank Governor
Kazys Ratkevicius. His resignation on January 9 was not accepted by the
government which felt it could cause more instability in the banking
sector. Ratkevicius rejected charges that the Central Bank had not
exercised sufficient control over the activities of commercial banks.

On January 12, a joint mission of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the World Bank met with the Prime Minister, the finance minister
and the chairman of the Bank of Lithuania.

Originally, the aim of the mission had been to evaluate the economic
state of the country. But following the crisis, it is now investigating
the reasons behind the problems of the two banks. Together with
officials from the Bank of Lithuania, it will prepare a programme to
overcome the difficulties in the banking system.

LITHUANIAN BANK ISSUES NEW SHARES

VILNIAUS BANKAS, Lithuania's largest private sector bank, recently
completed an international private placement of 34,000 new shares,
raising Lit17 million ($4.25 million) for the bank. The shares were
priced at Lit500 each. The funds raised are aimed at helping the bank
expand its general lending activities.

Vilniaus Bankas, which had total assets of around Lit450 million at the
end of 1995, was established in March 1990 with its head office in the
capital of Lithuania, Vilnius. It has a network of 13 branches,
primarily located in the country's urban, commercial and industrial
centres.

It was the first Lithuanian bank to introduce ATMs and banking cards
and is the sole issuer of Visa cards in Lithuania. Vilniaus Bankas is
twinned with Dutch bank ABN AMRO, which advises it in major operational
areas.

AMENDMENT TO BENEFIT INVESTMENT BANKS

THE CZECH investment market got a shot in the arm in the early New Year
with an amendment to the law on investment funds. The amendment enables
the creation of "managerial funds", which may hold majority stakes in
companies. The law, and related investment activity, is spelling a boom
for local investment banks.

Voucher privatisation funds can now be converted into more aggressive
and predatory managerial funds, but only if they buy out dissenting
privatisation fund shareholders at a price equal to or above net asset
value. That may help to reduce the massive discounts of up to 50
percent at which most privatisation funds are trading.

The amendment, approved by the Czech government in early January, is
partly in response to a sudden rise in mergers and acquisitions in the
market, which CS First Boston head of equity sales Peter Mayer called
"a feeding frenzy".

Recent corporate raids have included a $200 million shopping spree by
Bahamas-based US businessman Michael Dingman, with help from leading
Czech fund manager Viktor Kozeny, targeting a handful of blue chip
companies in late 1995 (see EEB 58). The pair were closely followed by
a flurry of stockmarket deals involving Motoinvest, a private firm
operating through Plzenska Banka and Agrobanka, both of which
Motoinvest now controls.

Motoinvest snapped up millions of discounted shares in the
privatisation funds run by the leading Czech banks, and later sold them
back at a substantial profit. Komercni Banka's fund has now swallowed a
poison pill to help prevent a similar raid in future. Motoinvest rose
to fame by buying up heavily discounted small privatisation funds and
selling their assets at a large profit.

In December, Motoinvest bought the Czech privatisation fund management
operations of Creditanstalt, one of the most popular fund managers in
the first wave of voucher privatisation. Other merger and acquisition
activity in December included a deal by leading privatisation fund
manager Ceska Sporitelna to sell 40 percent of its two voucher funds to
Bankers Trust for CK6.7 billion ($252 million) - a discount of more
than 40 percent on their net asset value.

Tomas Fiala, investment funds analyst at Czech stockbroker Wood & Co,
said the level and scope of such financial activity may eventually be
curbed by securities legislation which was proposed alongside the new
investment funds law. The government rejected details of some of the
proposals, including provisions to protect small shareholders by
setting ownership limits beyond which corporate raiders would be forced
to make a takeover bid for an entire company. Fiala said the proposals
have gone back to the drawing board but are likely to be approved by
parliament after the general election in October.

Fiala said the approved changes to the law on investment funds may
improve the impact of the post-communist privatisation process upon
Czech industry, since portfolio investors may now officially take
effective control of their investments for the first time.

Privatisation funds are prohibited from owning 20 percent of any single
company and therefore are forced to work together to achieve managerial
control of companies and effect operational changes. The concept of
active management is not universally accepted and stirred controversy
when some fund managers endeavoured to"tamper" with their investments.

Even so, privatisation investment funds own the bulk of shares in Czech
industry, and the result has been a slow start to economic reform in
the private sector. Some analysts claim the privatisation funds run by
banks, which are among the largest in the country, are especially to
blame for the lack of commercial reform, since many own shares in
companies which are major clients of the banks, and the banks exert
pressure to prevent major changes in their clients' activities.

The new draft law allows the investment fund managers to manage pension
funds for the first time. Its most likely impact is to help fund
managers reduce costs by merging their separate management teams. After
one year of pensions legislation, the major banks and insurance
companies and the leading employers have already established 35 pension
funds. Government authorities expect the total to reach a maximum of 45
before shrinking as market forces dictate rationalisation and mergers.

All funds will also face more stringent reporting requirements.
Penalties for non-compliance are also much stiffer, at a maximum of
CK10 million plus the possibility of suspension, forced administration
and the replacement of management by finance ministry regulators.

GROWTH BUT NO PROFIT FOR PENSION FUNDS

THE NUMBER of Czech pension funds topped 40 by the end of 1995 but few
are yet in profit, according to the Czech Statistical Office.

Total losses in the nine months to the end of September 1995 were CK244
million ($9.17 million), the statistics office revealed recently.
Pension revenues in the first half of 1995 were CK1.02, billion on
which the funds were reported to have lost a total of CK569 million. A
poll in June by the Factum agency found 20 percent of Czechs were
participating in pension funds and a further 21 percent were thinking
about it. A Social Affairs Ministry spokesman said the number of
participants was at the higher end of estimates. The Ministry expects
the total number of funds to reach at least 45 this year, but due to
competition and the lack of immediate profitability, the number is
expected to consolidate.

Some pension schemes have fewer than 5,000 participants, and the figure
of 100,000 participants is exceeded in only three cases: Penzijni Fond
Komercni Banky, Podnikatelsky PF and Vojensky Otvreny Fond. Komercni
Banka's fund has the largest capital base, at CK120 million, followed
by Prumyslovy PF (a subsidiary of Investicni a Postovni Banka) and
Allianz-Hypo.

HUNGARY:  THOMSON BANKWATCH ISSUES BANK RATINGS

US-BASED BANK rating and consulting agency Thomson BankWatch has
assigned intra-country issuer and local currency short-term debt
ratings to a number of banks in Hungary.

The Cental-European International Bank, the Hungarian Foreign Trade
Bank (Magyar Kulkereskedelmi Bank) and Unicbank are the top-ranked
banks in the country, according to the agency's ratings. Worst
performers are the Commercial and Credit Bank (Kereskedelmi Bank and
the Hungarian Credit Bank (Magyar Hitel Bank).

Last July Thomson BankWatch acquired Bank Research Eastern Europe
(BREE), a bank rating agency specialising in providing research on east
and central European financial institutions. The Hungarian ratings are
the first BREE ratings to be converted to the BankWatch scale. Intra-
country (IC) issuer ratings reflect a combination of pure credit risk
and performance risk, and offer a relative indication of the likelihood
of receiving timely repayment of principal and interest as well as an
opinion regarding the company's vulnerability to negative events that
may alter the market's perception of the bank.

The ratings use a nine-point scale ranging from IC-A for banks with
exceptionally strong fundamentals, representing low-risk, to IC-E for
banks whose viability is in doubt. The nine-point scale is IC-A, IC-
A/B, IC-B, IC-B/C, IC-C, IC-C/C, IC-D, IC-D/E, EC-E.

Short-term debt ratings apply specifically to local currency
obligations. The ratings range from LC-1, indicating a very high
likelihood that interest and principal will be paid on a timely basis,
to LC-4, which is considered speculative. The four-point scale is LC-1,
LC-2, LC-3 and LC-4.

BankWatch uses a rating methodology which involves a thorough analysis
of both financial as well as qualitative factors. Emphasis is placed on
management, market position, ownership, the local environment and
strategic initiatives. Extensive on-site due diligence is conducted on
an annual basis.

"For Hungarian banks, the environment has been extremely challenging
over the last several years. Delayed bad debt work- outs, under-
investment in modern systems and few sophisticated services in an
ineffective regulatory environment have all hampered the restructuring
process in the banking sector," explained Ramin Habibi, president of
Thomson BankWatch-BREE.

As in other eastern European countries, Hungarian state-owned banks
inherited a huge volume of bad loans from the old economic system.
Major reforms were initiated in 1987 with the introduction of a two-
tier system. However, Hungary's massive foreign debt burden held back
the state from cleaning its banks' portfolios as quickly as in
neighbouring countries. Since then, state-owned banks have been
recapitalised along BIS norms, and bad loans have been swapped for long-
term state bonds under the Loan and Consolidation schemes initiated in
1992 and completed at the end of 1994.

"While much improved, asset quality remains an issue," said Habibi.
"The fragmentation of supervisory responsibilities has impeded
effective regulations. Hungary's unique situation has given foreign and
joint-venture bonds an unprecedented opportunity to penetrate the
domestic market. Such intensified competition has fostered a new
rapidly evolving environment, with local management becoming much more
client- oriented and responsive to market needs.

"Overall, much progress has been made to establish a well- functioning
financial system - one that can operate without the support of the
government, but there still is a difficult road ahead."

THE PROSPECTS ARE GOOD

Eastern Europe, though still a drop in the ocean in terms of world
insurance premiums, is a rapidly growing market. In the first part of a
major survey, EEB reports on the state of the industry in countries of
eastern central Europe.

AFTER YEARS of reforms the turnaround in the insurance industry in
eastern Europe appears to have begun. Despite the fact that the world
market share of the region amounts to less than 1 percent and the
insurance industry is still extremely under- developed, the prospects
are good.

Clearly-defined rights of ownership and privatisation of the economy
are of the utmost importance for the insurance industry, according to a
1995 report by Economic Studies Unit of Swiss Reinsurance Company
(Swiss Re). An important indicator for progress in this area, it said,
is the private sector's share in total production which, in most
countries, rose to over 50 percent by the middle of 1994.

But, it added, insurance penetration - the proportion of income spent
on insurance policies - is still quite low throughout the region,
ranging from 3.4 percent in Slovenia to just 0.3 percent in Romania.

In Slovenia, incomes and insurance penetration stand at around half the
EU average, and in the other eastern central European countries at
about one-third. The low penetration could be attributed to the fact
that in the first few years of the changeover to a market economy,
premium income fell in most countries.

The year 1993 appears to have been a watershed for insurers in eastern
Europe. The falling rates of inflation, the economic upturn and the
turnaround to sustained real growth in premium have been having a
positive effect on the insurance industry since 1993. The volume of
premiums in the region increased by an average of 8 percent compared
with the previous year. Worldwide, growth stood at 6 percent. Premium
volume continues to grow at a faster rate than on the world market as a
whole.

The countries of eastern central Europe accounted for 62 percent of
total premium volume in 1993, with Poland the most important single
market. However, in 1994, Russia replaced Poland as eastern and central
Europe's biggest single market. But Swiss Re noted that, apart from in
Poland and Slovenia, it has not yet been possible for eastern European
countries to make up for the sharp downturn in insurance activity which
occurred in the first few years of the transition to a market economy.

Life insurance has shown the highest growth in most countries. However,
it is also exceptionally underdeveloped, accounting for just 25 percent
of premium volume in 1993 against the European Union average of 50
percent. The decline in economic activity resulting from the changeover
to a market economy affected life insurance more than it did non-life
insurance, according to Swiss Re. Only in Poland and Slovenia was there
any increase in the initially very low level of life insurance, it
said.

In 1993, the life insurance sector in eastern central Europe began to
experience strong growth. Provided inflation rates continue to fall and
there are improved investment opportunities on the developing capital
markets and tax incentives for private provision for old age, the life
insurance sector should also see above-average growth in the years
ahead as levels of prosperity rise, according to Swiss Re.

In the non-life sector, motor insurance is expected to dominate. Marine
insurance has also helped to push up growth in non-life business. But
motor insurance is expected to continue to account for 40 percent-50
percent of this sector, in line with traditional developing market
growth patterns, until rising prosperity levels make for more diverse
demand.

General third-party liability insurance is also projected to grow
significantly. Indeed, in contrast to western Europe, it could
initially outstrip personal accident and health cover, a segment
traditionally more than twice as large as liability. Agricultural
insurances, which were very prevalent when reforms began have fallen
off considerably and their importance looks set to decline even
further, especially in the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

But reinsurance rather than insurance is likely to grab much of the
limelight until eastern European countries are in a position to raise
minimum capital requirements. These are still being kept precariously
low due to the structural weakness of the insurance sector and the lack
of capital.

Under these conditions, reinsurance is of the utmost importance for
safeguarding solvency, said Swiss Re, both by providing support to new
private companies during the process of growth and by helping with the
restructuring of the former monopoly companies, which often do not have
an adequate capital base.

That leaves reinsurers, especially foreign ones, in a strong position
to tap a regional market which hands over 5 percent more than the
European Union's average of 17 percent of non-life insurance to
reinsurance. Most countries are eager for foreign reinsurers to take on
the secondary insurance market that no local players are willing or
prepared to supply adequately.

The progress of the past five years has also been helped by the reforms
in the regulatory framework of the various countries and the enactment
and enforcement of supervisory laws. Different approaches have been
taken by different countries - Poland's market is highly deregulated
with emphasis on financial control and Hungary has substantive control
for all products.

It should be noted that regulations in various countries are still in a
state of flux with regulations to be passed or laws completed. The
legislators in the countries of eastern central Europe have been
strongly influenced by European Union Directives when drafting
regulatory legislation.

POLAND

Although replaced by Russia as the region's biggest single insurance
market in 1994, Poland's insurance sector continues to grow quickly.
Economic development, a decreasing level of inflation and the
progressive adjustment of legal regulations to EU directives create
good opportunities for the insurance sector, according to corporate
finance and advisory services firm Ernst & Young in Warsaw.

Among the 41 insurance companies licensed to run insurance businesses
in Poland, 13 are conducting life business with the remainder running
non-life business.

In 1993, the Polish market represented 27 percent of the total premium
collected in eastern Europe. In 1994 all insurance companies jointly
collected a gross premium equal to ZL4.15 billion ($1.75 billion) - 33
percent more than in 1993.

In the first half of 1995 the gross premium collected in the life
business increased by 40 percent more in comparison with the first half
of 1994, while the gross premium of the non-life business was 21
percent more.

In 1994, almost 70 percent of premiums were accounted for by general
business with the remainder accounted for by life business.

At the beginning of the 1990s, the development of the life products
market was rather slow due to high inflation, low average real wages
and the marginal size of the middle classes.

The majority of the Polish population had one cheap group life
insurance with a very limited level of protection. However, Poland's
life insurance industry enjoyed dramatic growth in 1993 and 1994. Life
insurance premiums collected in 1994 were approximately 45 percent
higher than in 1993 and amounted to around $0.6 billion.

Taking into account that inflation was at 32 percent in 1994, this
represents a real increase of about 13 percent. In 1994 the main areas
of growth were in group life policies. PZU, the state- owned insurance
company which still dominates the Polish market, collected premiums
amounting to $500 million, although its market share decreased to 95
percent.

In the first half of 1995, PZU's market share reduced further to 90.3
percent, losing out to foreign insurers Commercial Union (5.2 percent),
Amplico (3.9 percent), AGF (0.4 percent) and Nationale-Nederlanden (0.1
percent).

The continuing development of the life insurance market will depend on
the level of economic growth, inflation trends and changes in the
social security system and income tax policy, according to Ernst &
Young. The following factors will determine the development of the life
insurance market in the coming years.

1. Unfavourable personal tax treatment of life products. However, the
regulation introduced this year allowed the companies to consider life
insurance premiums for the first time (paid on behalf of employees) as
company costs. Life insurance premiums will not be tax deductible in
the short and medium term unless an aggressive lobbying campaign is
conducted.

2. Further postponement of the social security reform since 1990. In
April 1995, the Council of Ministries presented the draft of the Social
Security Act with a new pension system (consisting of a state pension,
a social insurance pension and a voluntary pension plan).
Realistically, a programme for social security reform could be prepared
and approved in 1996. This programme will definitely not be "a shock
therapy", but rather a step-by- step approach, explained Ernst & Young.
Regulation concerning close-end funds and pension funds have also been
drafted and will be passed and implemented in 1996. This may start
benefiting the life insurance market by 1997 or 1998.

3. VAT on insurance agents' services was implemented in 1995 and had a
big impact on agents' incomes. Under pressure from the insurance lobby,
tax decreased to 7 percent until the end of 1995. The tax rate for 1996
is still unknown.

4. The monopoly of PZU and state protectionism. In June 1994, the
Ministry of Finance accepted a plan presented by the management of PZU
for its privatisation without turning to the EBRD for a $200 million
loan designated to boost the company's reserves. Under the plan, the
Ministry opted to split the PZU into two separate companies. But
following the change in government at the end of 1995, it was decided
not to split the PZU, but to leave the company intact and privatise it
in 1996 through the sale of shares to employees, individual investors
and carefully selected institutional investors.

5. Low confidence in the financial institutions among the Polish
population. Such an attitude was the result of Polish private banks and
private insurance companies going bankrupt.

Ernst & Young said that the economic growth of 1994 points to the
resilience of the recovery which was initiated in mid-1992. The
economic mechanisms launched a guarantee that the rate of economic
growth will be kept at 4.5 percent in the 1990s and long-term inflation
is showing a gradual downward trend.

The annual inflation rate which was 32 percent in 1994 is expected to
fall to 10 percent in 1999. Therefore, it can be expected that the
development of the life insurance market will accelerate in the coming
years, said Ernst & Young.

Foreign insurers may not open branches in Poland until 1999. However,
they may set up separate companies, in full accordance with Polish law,
and/or enter into joint ventures with Polish partners. Despite local
companies facing technical problems, a lack of qualified personnel and
limited solvency, a number of foreign companies are approaching the
market.

The most popular distribution channel is the own distribution network,
a regional level structure, with branches and sub- branches or
representative offices. The number of independent brokers and agents is
growing, with around 600 brokers now licensed in the country.

According to Ernst & Young, co-operation between different insurance
companies and Polish banks is expected to grow with the increasing
acceptance of the idea of bancassurance and the fact that most of the
foreign companies created joint-ventures with Polish banks when they
entered the Polish market.

A law on insurance activities was passed in July 1990. However, due to
the rapid development of the market, much-needed changes were
implemented with the Insurance Act in October 1995. Ernst & Young said
that these changes had the following objectives:

* Increase the compatibility to EU directives;

* Better protection of the insured by increasing the financial
requirements of companies applying for an insurance licence as well
existing insurers. In particular, the share capital for insurers
entering the market, should equal the minimum guarantee capital
(Ecu800,000 for life business or Ecu200,000-Ecu400,000)

* Increasing and clearly defining the power of insurance supervision
which will control insurers, brokers and agents. An independent Office
of Insurance Supervision (OIS) will be established. At present,
insurance supervision is part of the Ministry of Finance.

* Re-drafting all the provisions unclear in the former insurance law -
in particular, the licensing rules for new insurers and requirements
with respect to actuaries will be described in more detail.

* Clearly defining the rights and obligations of insurance brokers.
These provisions are based on recent EU directives.

The Ministry of Finance must issue a licence for a company to set up an
insurance business. A company may not issue both life and non-life
policies. Neither can they engage in other non-insurance business. They
can only operate as joint-stock or mutual companies.

There are strict guidelines regulating reserve capital, contingency
funds compensation in the case of a lack of compulsory insurance (like
motor vehicle third party liability, fire insurance for farmers' real
estate, farmers' civil liability). The assets may be invested only in
approved instruments, with some limitation to the portfolio's
composition.

According to Ernst & Young, the Polish Finance Ministry which, for the
moment, supervises the insurance sector, is to press for a
strengthening of the capital base of Polish insurance companies. In
order to prepare domestic companies for direct foreign competition in
the domestic market after 1999, foreign companies who want to enter the
Polish market are strongly encouraged to merge with small Polish
insurance companies.

HUNGARY

The Hungarian parliament passed a new insurance law in 1995 which came
into effect on January 1 this year. All newcomers to the insurance
market must set up separate life and non-life companies. The 14
existing insurance companies will not be forced to establish new
companies but will be obliged to clearly separate accounting and
management structures for each sector.

Insurance companies will also face new minimum capital requirements
with the introduction of the distinction between organisational and
security capital, distinguishing between operational and business
commitments.

The new legislation also modifies the supervisory environment,
eliminating the need for permits for non-life products. The existing
State Insurance Supervision (ABIF) agency's remit will cover ensuring
compliance with legislation, rights protection for insurance company
clients, monitoring of applications by insurers and supervision of
companies' financial status and investment procedures.

Life insurance start-ups must continue to obtain permits for their
products and have initial security capital of at least HUF250 million
($1.8 million). New non-life operations will be required to have
security capital of at least HUF150 million and up to HUF70 million
more for certain categories of product.

Although foreign insurers are admitted only by the establishment of
subsidiary companies or through participation, the market is dominated
by outsiders.

Allianz is reportedly in negotiations with state privatisation agency
APV to sell the German group the remaining 9.2 percent public stake in
local non-life leader Hungaria. Allianz has already built up a 90
percent holding in Hungaria, which own 0.8 percent of its own stock.

CZECH REPUBLIC

The implementation of a new insurance law has been in the pipeline for
some time as the current law dates back to May 1991. In any new law,
solvency regulations are intended to be in accordance with European
Union directives.

Insurance penetration in the Czech Republic is around 2.5 percent and
like other eastern central European countries is growing. Motor
liability and occupational accident insurance is compulsory.

There are no limits on the establishment of foreign insurers but cross-
border services are not permitted. Germany's Allianz and Italy's
Generali both denied speculation recently that they were interested in
becoming strategic investors in the Czech insurance giant Ceska
Pojistovna in which private fund manager PPF (Privni Privatizacni Fond)
recently bought a 12 percent stake.

Both already have domestic Czech insurance operations which although
much smaller are more flexible and able to target the most profitable
sectors of the market.

PPF bought its 12 percent stake from Ceska Sporitelna, the former
monopoly state savings bank at the end of 1995 and is negotiating with
Interbanka, the Hungarian-owned Czech merchant bank, over its 7 percent
stake in the insurer.

PPF claimed it was a long-term investor and denied it was acting for a
third party. But analysts of the insurance industry say PPF is unlikely
to hold its stake for long, but may want to build a sizeable position
and find a strategic investor.

Although Ceska Pojistovna is losing market share as the number of
competitors swells, it still claims more than 70 percent of the main
sectors such as life and motor insurance, and its revenues are growing.
It has raised motor premiums substantially and is lobbying hard for an
overhaul of the compulsory third party sector, in which it is the sole,
reluctant provider.

Analysts also point to substantial reserves of more than CK64 billion
($2.4 billion) and numerous other activities such as fund management as
likely magnets for an investor or strategic partner, either local or
foreign.

Elsewhere, Czech health insurers were forced to reassess their budgets
in December after most had their business plans for 1996 rejected by
the government.

Only five of 27 insurers got a clean bill of health under a tough new
government fitness regime. In an effort to spruce up the industry, the
government has demanded that health insurers make more realistic income
forecasts and keep administration costs under 7 percent of revenues.

Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus estimated that seven of the rejected
insurers should have no trouble getting in shape by their second
attempt in January, but that still leaves 15 insurers on the critical
list.

As a result, a rash of mergers is likely to break out among the smaller
funds. But such mergers will not be easy, due to a list of problems
including long-standing debts to hospitals and doctors and difficulties
winning projected volumes of clientele.

"The system has many childhood diseases," said Frantisek Beranek,
general director of insurer Vojenska Pojistovna, referring to the fact
that the first health fund was established only in 1993. Vojenska had
its own plans rejected, but Beranek was confident of winning on appeal
after its accountants gave it a more thorough check-up.

The insurers' woes reflect the dismal state of the Czech health
industry, beset by increasingly volatile labour relations and blatant
over-billing by under-paid doctors. Insurers owe more than CK5 billion
to health providers. But even if they can pay their bills, they are
often too busy investigating claims of unnecessary treatment by doctors
who are paid per consultation.

Challenging claims is the insurers' responsibility and their only
chance to improve profitability in an industry where both premiums and
the cost of services are set by the government.

Czech health sector costs have risen from 5 percent of GDP in 1992 to
the current level of 8 percent and the government is struggling to find
a solution. It is considering a range of plans including mandating a
single agency to collect all revenues and limiting the scope of all
other insurers to offering only supplementary medical services.

If the government does choose radical surgery, the quickest recovery
may be made by the General Health Insurance Company. It was the first
to start business and it now insures 6.7 million people - well over
than half of the country.

SLOVAKIA

Insurance operations in Slovakia are governed by the insurance law of
December 1990 which was implemented in March 1991. Changes to the law
are expected to bring solvency regulations in line with EU directives.
Branch separation is planned for life and non-life businesses.

The minimum capital required to set up a non-life insurer is SK20
million-SK30 million ($672,429 - $1,008,640) and SK50 million for life
insurers. There have been no limitations on the participation or
establishment of foreign insurers since the beginning of 1992. However,
higher deposits are required for foreign establishments. Cross-border
services are not permitted. Supervision is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Finance.

SLOVENIA

A new insurance law, based on earlier German and Austrian legislation,
was passed in October 1995. This succeeded a law which had been in
operation since mid November 1994. However, further changes will be
needed to bring Slovenian law in line with European Union regulations.

"This law should last for about two or three years, but it must change
to open the market and align it with the EU. But Slovenian insurers are
still not prepared for competition," explained Dr Miro Koncina of ITEO
management consultants in Ljubljana.

Under the law, a guarantee fund has been established for insurance
companies consisting of DM1.5 million ($1.04 million) for life insurers
and the same for property casualty insurers. Supervision is carried out
by the Ministry of Finance. There is no branch separation between life
and non-life business, although separate accounting is required.

Majority participation by foreign insurers is possible, although this
is not the case in reinsurance companies. Foreign insurers must be
registered in Slovenia to operate there and cannot sell products from
abroad into the country.

Insurance penetration, while quite low by European Union standards, is
the highest in eastern central Europe at around 3 percent-4 percent or
DM800 million-DM900 million in premium volume. The market is continuing
to grow strongly, according to Koncina, but needs to reach a premium
volume of DM1.5 billion.

He concedes that the process of changing people's attitudes is
difficult. "The difficulty is that people are still waiting for state
social insurance," he said."We are in transition. We have a middle
class with money. We must spread this capital and this involves
changing tradition and culture. It is a process and it is changing."

The proximity of Slovenia to EU countries like Italy, Germany and
Austria is making this process of education easier, he said.

Former state monopolies still hold around 60 percent of the total
insurance market with the rest held by small independent companies and
joint ventures between Western and local firms.

In the second part of the insurance survey EEB will report on the
markets of Bulgaria and Romania, and Russia, Ukraine and Estonia.

FEELING AT HOME

It has been a hard five years, but western accounting firms are
starting to get used to working in Poland. David Porter reports

IT IS more than five years since the Big Six arrived in Poland, and
only now are they beginning to feel at home. Resistance from clients to
western fees seems to be easing, and hitherto frosty relations with the
local Chamber of Auditors may be starting to thaw.

Not that Poland has suddenly become an easy place in which to do
business. Revenues may be growing at 50 percent a year, but keeping
control of that growth and turning it into profits is a different
matter.

Take Arthur Andersen, for example. Ranked third in the staff tables,
the firm is streets ahead of the competition in revenue terms, with
fiscal 1995 fee income of about $20 million. Andersen is breaking even
currently, but it has no plans to start raking in profits, according to
managing partner Duleep Aluwihare.

"We believe that this market shows better growth prospects than some of
our more mature markets and it would make sense at this stage to
continue investing," Aluwihare said. "From a strategic point of view,
we have no intention of making a profit, that would be when we run out
of investment opportunities."

Andersen is also keeping a tight rein on this investment. It is one of
the few Big Six firms to have just one office in Poland, although it
plans to open further offices during 1996, one in either Katowice or
Cracow in the south, and another in the north of the country. "In order
to set up a satellite office, you have to be happy that you're going to
maintain the quality of service; and that's difficult to achieve in
this marketplace," said Andersen audit partner Jon Newbery.

This emphasis on quality not only applies to the work Andersen does,
but also to the clients it targets. "Andersen go for the big ticket
items," said a partner at one firm. "They don't take a lot of basic
work, they've tried to go for the top end of the market," said another.

Among Andersen's major audit clients are the chemicals group Hortex,
Polish Oil and Gas and the brewer Zywiec. Its consulting clients
include Poland's finance ministry.

Andersen's approach to the market is not shared by all of the Big Six.
Perhaps the closest to it in terms of attitude are Coopers & Lybrand
and Price Waterhouse. C&L managing partner John Jeffrey, who arrived in
Poland last summer, said his brief on taking over was to assess when
the firm should start making a profit.

Jeffrey's predecessor, Tim Heaton, speaking last July before returning
to the UK, outlined the firm's policy up until then: "We're not just
here for a financial return on investment, we're here to make sure that
Coopers & Lybrand has a significant presence in Poland."

C&L currently has two offices, in Warsaw and Cracow, and is looking at
opening a third, either in Gdansk or Poznan.

Like Andersen, C&L has tried to concentrate on the top end of the
market, Jeffrey said. Among its international clients are Unilever,
Ford, Peugeot and Citroen. In the corporate finance sector, the firm
has acted as lead financial adviser on the privatisation of BIG Bank
and of construction group Exbud. Recent corporate finance successes
include the public offering of Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, which
raised $39.7 million, and a $7 million acquisition by brewing group
Okocim.

PW, which did not reveal revenue figures for this survey, was budgeted
to start making a small profit in 1995, according to Roger Merchant,
the firm's head of audit up until the middle of last year. After five
years in Poland, "that would be about normal for a multi-national
company investing in a developing territory", he said. Revenue growth
is running at about 40 percent to 50 percent a year, he added.

PW's biggest western client is Fiat, based in Bielsko-Biala where the
firm maintains a permanent presence. Other major western clients
include Nestle and Pepsico, neither of which are PW clients worldwide.
One of the firm's largest Polish clients is the recently-privatised
Bank Gdanski.

Three firms which claim to have been profitable in Poland for some time
are KPMG, Ernst & Young and Deloitte & Touche.

"We cannot rely on deep pockets," said KPMG managing partner Bill
Drysdale. "Over the last couple of years, we've hit the point where we
are largely self-sufficient."

Drysdale highlighted a number of corporate finance successes at Barents
Group, KPMG's emerging markets consulting arm, and a stream of new
clients from Germany and the Netherlands during fiscal 1995. The firm
recently recruited a Wirtschaftsprufer from KPMG Germany to run its
German practice in Poland. "That's a big breakthrough for us, to have a
fully-resident, fully-qualified German partner," Drysdale said.
"Germany is probably the absolute critical market for us."

KPMG lists three of Germany's leading banks, plus electronics group
Siemens and chemicals company Henkel among its clients. Its Polish
clients include three of the country's largest banks, Bank Handlowy,
Bank Slaski and Bank Premyslowo-Handlowy, as well as the insurance
companies PZU and PZU Life. The firm opened additional offices in
Cracow and Poznan during the last year.

At E&Y, meanwhile, talk of choosing between investment and profits gets
short shrift from managing partner Derek Chrusciak. "Our firm has
always been profitable in Poland," he said. "We've not had financial
support from outside, other than very small amounts. All the other
firms run on a budget. Their actual revenues are irrelevant; they have
X amount to spend and the closer they get to that number the better.
They're expenditure driven. We're income driven."

In staff terms, E&Y is the largest firm in Poland, with about 440
employees at last count. It also has more offices than any of its
rivals, with bases in Warsaw, Poznan, Katowice, Gdansk, Wroclaw and
Szczecin. According to Chrusciak, managing that number of offices is a
headache and, in the early days, dented the firm's bottom line.

"Poland is not an easy place to manage from a distance," he said. "It's
difficult to have people that are isolated and have them motivated into
a corporate-thinking, common philosophy and maintain the same standards
right way."

E&Y is something of a rarity in that its tax practice brings in as much
business as auditing. The firm pulled off a coup in November when it
hired almost the entire tax team - some 20 people - from Deloitte &
Touche, boosting its total head- count in that practice to about 130.

Chrusciak stressed that E&Y did not set out to poach staff from D&T.
"These people were in the marketplace," he said. "They didn't speak
only with us, they spoke to a couple of other firms as well . . . Often
you'll get a situation where if one or two key people decide to leave,
all the rest will follow."

The defections are perhaps indicative of D&T's current fortunes in the
Polish market. In both staff and revenue terms, the firm is the
smallest of the Big Six, a surprising situation given D&T's strong
position in the rest of eastern Europe. In 1994, the east European firm
took action by bringing in a heavy-hitter to replace Jan Maciejewicz as
head of the Polish business. Leslaw Paga was head of the Polish
Securities Commission before becoming chairman of D&T.

Charles Dalch, D&T's chief operating officer and head of audit, is sure
that Paga's arrival has been good for the firm. "It's definitely
enhanced our visibility in the marketplace and our image," he said.
"There have been some direct client wins as a result of his efforts."

Meanwhile, D&T has a "definite, planned strategy" to boost its position
in Poland, Dalch said. This will involve targeting specific industries
and service lines, in particular, leveraging the firm's strong position
in financial services throughout eastern Europe. "Although I'd say we
were latecomers in the market in Poland, that's changing very quickly,"
he explained.

Among the firm's recent successes were winning the audits of BGZ Bank
and of Kredyt Bank, which was already a consulting client. D&T's 64-
percent owned IT consulting subsidiary IDOM is "very active" in the
banking sector, according to Dalch. IDOM recorded revenues of about $3
million in 1995, up from $2 million a year earlier, he said.

D&T added an office in Szczecin to existing bases in Warsaw, Gdansk and
Cracow during 1995.

Another firm in an unaccustomed position in Poland is BDO Binder.
Revenues of $600,000 put it behind the local affiliates of four other
mid-tier networks. But, Richard Webb, BDO's regional co- ordinating
partner for eastern and central Europe, aims to bring it up to "the
sort of critical mass we would want to have" in Poland by merging with
another firm.

He said a deal is close to being signed, but declined to name the
prospective merger partner, which is currently affiliated to another
network. "Clearly the Big Six are not involved, so that means we are
looking at something which is certainly going to be Polish, but with a
heavy UK or English language capability," he said.

Elsewhere in the mid-tier, Baltic Accountants and Consultants switched
international affiliations from CKL International to Alliott Peirson
International during 1995. Baltic Accountants continues to also
represent RSM International and GMN International.

The question of who owns and manages the firms remains a thorny issue
for many of the Big Six. From a marketing point of view, most firms
like to describe themselves as "Polish", in order to appeal to local
clients. But, in practice, some are further advanced in bringing in
Polish equity partners than others.

Andersen is 20 percent owned by two Polish partners, with the UK firm
holding the remainder. PW is a joint venture between its UK and US
affiliates, with no local partners at present. At C&L, Jeffrey has been
given the goal of "indigenising" the firm in three to five years, while
KPMG expects to conclude the transfer of its practice to local, or
"locally resident", partners by the end of 1997, Drysdale said.

According to Chrusciak, E&Y is a "locally-owned, locally- managed
firm", period. D&T, meanwhile, is still wholly-owned by Deloitte Touche
Tohmatsu International, although Dalch stressed that "our intent from
the start of doing business in eastern Europe was to have the local
practices owned by local partners. That is still our intent."

Another prickly question is pricing. Most of the western firms agree
that fee resistance from clients is still strong, but that the gap
between what western firms are charging and what local clients are
willing to pay is narrowing.

One reason is that, while most of the Big Six say each assignment must
pay for itself, there is little doubt that firms have had to meet the
market half way in order to fend off competition from cheaper local
firms. For example, one Big Six firm charged $425 an hour when it first
arrived in Poland. These days, its partners work for $300 an hour.
Another firm admitted that it is prepared to reduce audit fees in
"strategic situations".

Meanwhile, Polish companies are beginning to realise the value of a
western-style audit, particularly since the Act on Accounting came into
effect at the start of 1995. This seeks to bring Polish accounting
procedures more into line with International Accounting Standards and
to move Polish accounting away from its traditional emphasis on tax
compliance.

Another area where western accountants are making more encouraging
noises is in relations between the international firms and the local
Chamber of Auditors. These hit an all-time low last year when the
chamber failed all the candidates who sat one of its accounting exams.
Coming several years since the last new members had been admitted to
the chamber, the exam reinforced the perception among westerners that
Poland's auditors wanted to preserve their own livelihood by shutting
new blood out of the profession.

Several months on, the talk is of bridges being built and fences being
mended. "The situation with the chamber is only natural," Chrusciak
said. "They're growing, they're developing, they're learning. Of course
there will be issues where there are a lot of different opinions.
Possibly, at the very beginning, the idea of so many opinions was a bit
frightening to them."

While the situation regarding audit training and exams remains
unacceptable to most western firms, there is optimism that the chamber
will rethink its approach.

Webb at BDO said that having started out being over-generous in
admitting non-Poles to the auditing profession, the chamber seems to
have gone too far in the other direction. "The matter will probably be
reviewed by the Polish chamber during the course of 1996," he said.
"And rightly so. I do think that we as non-Poles have a lot to offer."

After all, Chrusciak said, "we're all in the same boat, we're all part
of the same profession, and it's in every one's interest to make sure
the chamber is a strong and active body."

Most accountants agree that the difficulties can be overcome and that
the growth in demand for their services will continue. "Everyone feels
that this market has tremendous potential," Dalch said. "We all
experience similar problems, but I think the mood is one of optimism."

ATM SURCHARGING TOP EFT ISSUE OF 1996

     Automated teller machine (ATM) surcharges will dominate the
electronic banking industry during the next 12 months, industry
experts unanimously agreed in interviews with EFT.
     Sources predict non-discriminatory ATM surcharges will be the
banking issue of 1996 as financial services providers try aggressively
to reap profits from alternative delivery methods.
     No national EFT network allowed its members to surcharge prior to
1996.  However, 14 state legislatures passed laws prohibiting such
restrictions.
     Visa's PLUS ATM network will allow its members to surcharge on
April 1, 1996, and many regional EFT networks have lifted their
surcharge bans. 
     MasterCard's Cirrus network has not lifted its surcharge ban and
a company spokesperson said it does not plan to change its position.
     The Wilmington, Del.-based MAC EFT network, the second-largest
regional network in the  country, said last month that it will allow
surcharging in 1996.

Competitive Pressure

     Many financial institutions and other third-party ATM owners such
as Plano, Texas-based EDS and Dallas-based Affiliated Computer
Services, claim they cannot support the cost of placing ATMs in low-
volume transaction areas without a surcharge.  However, consumer
groups say surcharging is just another means for banks to add to their
record profits.
     The networks receive no money from the surcharge.  Surcharge
revenue goes directly to the ATM owner.  Banks claim they need
surcharges to compete with third-party ATM owners such as EDS and
Affiliated Computer Services (ACS), which negotiate contracts with
casinos and malls.  
     Some bank executives said EDS and ACS can outbid financial
institutions for these contracts because they offer the retailers a
cut of the surcharge.
     "A lot of pressure is on banks to surcharge even if they are
philosophically opposed to it," said Joseph Pendleton III, senior vice
president of electronic banking for Wyomissing, Pa.-based Meridian
Bank.  "If they don't [surcharge], they will not be able to manage an
off-premise program with significant value."

Who Wants the Surcharges?

     The non-financial ATM owners are not so sure financial
institutions are really opposed to surcharges. 
     One ATM owner suggested banks may be hiding behind the third-
party ATM owners to avoid public outrage.
     "We are in favor of surcharging and believe it will give us the
ability to deploy more ATMs," said T.A. "Kip" Hyde Jr., a director of
EFT development for ACS.  "As far as people like us and EDS pushing
it, that is not entirely true.  Banks are learning that in off-premise
ATM sites, there is only a certain [limit] to the expenses you can
bury in marketing costs."
    ACS surcharges range from $.50 at convenience stores to $2 at
casinos in its 4,100-ATM MoneyMaker Network.  EDS charges from $.25 to
$1 at approximately 10 percent of its 5,800 ATMs, according to company
spokesperson Carol Winters.
    Consumer interest groups don't believe the claim that remote ATMs
cost too much to run.  "Banks are already able to save billions in
teller and branch costs with ATMs and they are already generating
billions in fees," said Janice Shields, a banking researcher for the
Washington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of Responsive Law (CSRL). 
"Now, we are just adding more profit to the top."
    According to the Consumer Federation of America (CFA) -- an
affiliate of CSRL -- ATM transactions generated more than $2.55
billion in fees, while saving banks $2.34 billion in teller costs in
1993, the last year for which such figures have been compiled.  The
CFA claims more than $.78 in profits was generated for every dollar
collected from consumers for ATM services.
    With consumers being charged for using an ATM not owned by their
bank and then having a surcharge added on top of that, shouldn't the
industry be concerned that transaction volumes will decrease?
    The majority of the machines with surcharges exceeding $1 will be
placed in areas where the consumer desperately needs the money and
will pay for convenience, ATM owners said.  For example, highway rest
areas and casinos present prime surcharging opportunities.

A Transaction Drop?

    New Orleans-based GulfNet EFT Network has allowed its members to
levy surcharges because the Louisiana and Mississippi legislatures
overruled the mandate of the national networks.  However, Del
Tonguette, president of GulfNet, said transaction volume has not been
affected by the surcharges. 
    Nearly 87 percent of GulfNet's 4,000 ATMs carry member surcharges
and Tonguette said pricing has not been an issue.  He claims setting a
fair and equitable surcharge is easily determined by the consumer. 
ATM owners who charge too much will quickly lose transaction volume.
    "I am gratified to see at least Visa has seen the light.  One
prediction that I can make is that MasterCard and all of its
subsidiaries will follow suit," said Tonguette, who has been a staunch
proponent of surcharging.
    The MAC Network, which is owned by Wilmington, Del.-based
Electronic Payment Services (EPS), admits it is not exactly sure what
effect surcharging will have on transaction volume, but it does not
believe it will inhibit growth.
    "A lot of discussion and consideration [went into our decision],"
said Barbara Link, an EPS spokesperson.  "It is difficult to say
exactly what surcharging will mean.  Certainly, the banks would like
to have a lot of say [in determining whether surcharging is prudent]."
    Reston, Va.-based Electronic Funds Transfer Association (EFTA)
has not taken a position on surcharging because it claims members are
divided on the topic.  Consequently, the EFTA has not lobbied any of
the national or regional networks to lift the surcharge bans.   
However, Kurt Helwig, executive director of the EFTA, said EDS has
vocally supported surcharging, while other financial institutions have
opposed it.  Helwig understands both sides of the argument:  "This is
yet another issue we cannot take a position on.  [However,] to date,
studies have shown consumers are willing to pay for convenience ...
[But] ATM owners have to be smart about pricing because the consumer is
going to decide this marketplace."

Government Intervention

    As banks begin to learn how much consumers will pay for the
convenience of remote ATM services, it appears ATM owners will not
have to worry about scrutiny from Capitol Hill.  According to Shields
of the CSRL, "consumers don't exactly have a good Congress for
[surcharge reform] now.  It is not a good legislative climate to tap
ATM fees."
    The CSRL is working with representatives in Washington to draft
legislation that would require disclosure of fees before a transaction
is completed.
    Despite the push for surcharges, fees are not the only answer to
increasing ATM installation and maintenance costs.  EDS's Winters said
ATM owners can lower their costs by offering more services, such as
stamps, event tickets, calling card vouchers and travelers checks. 
These services can require the bulk of the surcharges, while ATM
activity is left relatively untouched.  (Kurt Helwig, EFTA, 703/435-

PROPRIETARY SMART CARD PROGRAMS TO CONTINUE STEADY GROWTH IN 1996

Smart cards will continue to gain market share this year, but their
growth still will fall short of the explosion enthusiasts seek. 
Millions of smart cards will be issued this year; however, the
majority of them will be used in closed systems such as college
campuses or large business headquarters, according to Basil Bromberg,
president of Dallas-based smart-card consultancy Smart Cards USA.
    "The big open systems are all waiting for a bank to issue [smart]
cards," said Bromberg.  "Niche systems will develop more quickly. 
After that, the shared smart card will [arrive].  For instance, a
transportation industry may link with a school [identification card]
where the [bus company] can buy some of the memory on the I.D. and the
kids can use the card to pay for the bus."

Sports Stored Value

    The eyes of the financial services industry will be on the
Visa/First Union smart card pilot at the Atlanta Summer Olympics this
summer.  Visa and First Union plan to launch more than 1 million smart
cards in an open system pilot.
    Bromberg called the pilot a glorified closed project.  "It is
only a large- scale show, really," said Bromberg.  "It is an access
card.  It is nice.  It is no great brainstormer.  The trouble is that
once the Olympics are over, all you have is a souvenir."
    It is easier for the banks to see the profitability of a closed
system at this point in the smart card's development.  The bank would
make money in a proprietary system by sponsoring the transaction
handling and money transfer.
    The specialized sport stored-value card, as employed by the
National Football League's Jacksonville Jaguars, will continue to gain
momentum.  The Jaguars have issued stored value cards that can only be
used inside the stadium to purchase refreshments or souvenirs.
    "That is going to take off like a rocket," said Joseph Pendleton
III, senior vice president of electronic banking at Wyomissing, Pa.-
based Meridian Bank.  (Basil Bromberg, Smart Cards USA, 214/991-6502;

NYCE ATM NETWORK BUILDS HOME BANKING PLATFORM

The NYCE EFT network said it is ready to expand into home banking and
take advantage of the largest single opportunity for EFT transaction-
building.  As a result, it could pose a challenge to industry
mainstays MasterCard, Online Resources, Servantis and Visa.
    NYCE, the largest EFT provider in the Northeast and a subsidiary
of Hackensack, N.J.-based Infinet Payment Services, invested at least
$2 million in creating a bank-branded home banking and electronic
commerce services platform, according to NYCE President and CEO
Richard Yanek.
    The main goal of the platform is to create a single interface for
NYCE members to access customer financial institution information from
any personal financial management (PFM) software product and any
access device.
    Without NYCE or another commercial interface, if a bank wants to
allow its customers to use PFM software from Intuit's Quicken, Meca's
Managing Your Money or Microsoft Money, the institution must build a
separate interface to each vendor.  NYCE will manage the interfaces
and act as a translator so the bank's customer information will look
the same regardless of the customer's means of access.
    Three to four institutions of various sizes will begin piloting
the NYCE product in the second quarter of 1996, Yanek said.  The
product should be commercially available to NYCE's 1,200 member
institutions by the end of 1996.  
    "We tend to think of this [product] as a transporter translator,"
said Yanek.  "What comes through to the bank [is the same no matter
what the PFM software].  We already have the pipeline [to the banks]. 
And, very importantly, think of the cost of implementing such a
system.  We are spending a substantial amount of money.  But it is
minuscule compared to what an institution would have to spend
individually."
    NYCE is negotiating with "all of the providers on the market
today," Yanek said.
    New York-based MasterCard, Reston, Va.-based Online Resources,
Norcross, Ga.-based Servantis and San Francisco-based Visa started
similar home banking "translation" software in the last 12 months. 
However, Yanek claims NYCE's system will be the only one to be both
on-line and interactive.

A Change in Branding Philosophy

    All NYCE EFT products carried the NYCE brand prior to home
banking.  Yanek said NYCE has decided to allow the institutions to
brand their home banking offerings.
    "With services of this kind, the consumer is operating within the
bank.  They are working directly with the bank," said Yanek.  "Hence,
there is no need for the NYCE logo.  That contrasts with what exists
on the marketplace today.  When you sign on with Quicken, you see a
roster of all of the Quicken banks.  It is counterproductive.  When
customers sign on, they want to see or hear the name of their bank."
    What NYCE loses in name recognition, it could gain in transaction
volume and licensing fees.  
    Yanek predicts that home banking transactions will build
gradually, and by the end of the century, each home banking household
will complete approximately 24 transactions per month.  Currently,
each ATM cardholder performs an average of one transaction per month.
    In addition, NYCE plans to license and offer equity in the
product to other large EFT networks.  Yanek said preliminary
discussions have begun, but don't expect small networks to join the
home banking mix just yet.
    "Small networks will not venture unless it is free-ride," said
New Orleans- based GulfNet EFT Network President Del Tonguette. 
"Offering home banking is fine with me as long as [someone else] pays
for the expensive startup."
    Omaha, Neb.-based bill-payment provider SmartPay paid all of the
communications and hookup costs to link GulfNet member banks Hancock
Bank and Jefferson Guarantee.  The increased transaction volume at
these two banks has been negligible, according to Tonguette. 
    Tonguette, however, believes home banking will be a very small
piece of the action through the rest of this century for his company's
277 financial institution members.
    The future of home banking could be here for large networks like
NYCE.  Before creating the home banking platform, NYCE surveyed its
top 25 banks in addition to 125 other members of various sizes, asking
them to set their priorities from a list of 27 possible product
offerings.
    Home banking and bill payment services were highest on the
request list from the top 25 banks and second on the list for the
remaining banks surveyed.  At the top of their list was enhanced ATM
services.
    Financial institutions also want their customers not only to
complete conventional home banking transactions but also to have
access to financial periodicals and the Internet.
    "The reality is that [consumers and banks] are desiring something
more than home banking," said Yanek.  "A better term is 'electronic
financial commerce.'  We see a need for something more than a simple
set of transactions."  (Del Tonguette, GulfNet, 504/643-5070; Dick
Yanek, NYCE Network, 201/488-6111.)

DIEBOLD EXPANDING INTO ATM MAINTENANCE

     Diebold no longer sells only automated teller machines (ATMs). 
The Canton, Ohio-based company is producing and selling ATM management
software to avoid any loss of revenue if the ATM market becomes
saturated and profits flatten.
     Many EFT sources predict new ATM sales could decrease sharply
over the next 5 to 10 years.
     Interbold, Diebold's ATM joint venture with IBM, holds 55 percent
of the U.S. ATM market.
     Diebold took its first step into the ATM software management
arena at last month's Bank Administration Institute (BAI) Retail
Delivery Conference (RDC) in Atlanta.  Diebold and its partner,
Optical Data Systems of Richardson, Texas, have created a new
networking solution for client-server systems.
     The local area network (LAN) hub and ATM-driving software allows
banks to download programs and change ATM screens in seconds, said
Harry Bosch, Diebold business development manager.
     The system can help banks increase uptime because ATMs will not
have to be down as long for changes.  It also can save bank personnel
costs because it eliminates the need to change programs and screens by
"sneakernet" -- employees visiting each machine to load software, he
said.
    Additionally, banks can improve marketing efforts because the
system allows targeted screen changes, Bosch said.  For example, if a
bank wanted to run a promotion involving a certain chain of grocery
stores, the 50-or-so ATMs at that chain can be loaded with a
specialized screen, he added.
    In the security arena, Diebold also released an event management
system.  The software will identify ATM device failures, analyze the
situation, open a trouble ticket and determine the proper course of
action without human intervention.  It sends faxes to the owner-bank
or beeps a service representative, Bosch said.
    InterBold displayed many of its updated machines at the RDC.  The
machines can read and cash checks, print courtesy amounts and give
change.  Updated ATMs also can dispense checkbooks, stamps and
tickets.  Interbold's most advanced technology was demonstrated in its
MicroBranch, a sit-down kiosk with touch-screen monitors, dual
telephone handsets and videoconferencing.  The outside walls of the
kiosk change from clear to cloudy when occupied for privacy.
    Diebold has the right idea in enhancing and expanding its ATM
product line, said Megan Robertson, a Smith Barney analyst:  "ATMs are
commodity products, so this is a value-added product.  That's the
right stuff."
    Competitor Fujitsu ICL offers similar enhancements and AT&T's
newest machines offer coupon-printing capabilities.

S2 SYSTEMS AND ATM MONITORING

  S2 Systems, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Stratus Computer Inc.,
recently released an automated, integrated automated teller machine
(ATM) information and monitoring system (AIMS).  The system was
developed with Richardson, Texas-based ProAmerica Systems Inc.  The
two companies integrated Dallas-based S2's ON/2 electronic banking
software with ProAmerica's help desk software -- Service Call
Management (SCM).  Now, when an ATM system failure or network
breakdown occurs, ON/2 sends an alarm message to SCM.  SCM then
processes, logs and transmits the information, notifying a technician
via digital pager, fax, E-mail or voice system.  SCM also creates a
Technical Assistance Request (TAR) and records the transaction for
network and system analysis.  Using a touch-tone telephone, field
technicians can access their individual problem lists and change the
status of items, or TARs, on the lists by using personal
identification numbers assigned to each technician.  (Susan Kemp, S2
Systems, 214/458-3887.)

NEW PRODUCTS HELP BANKS INCREASE CONSUMER ACCESS

    Smart card holders now can use a portable smart card reader --
the size of a key chain -- to view balance information, according to
software and hardware supplier Oki America Inc.
    The Advanced Products Division (OAPD) of the Marlborough, Mass.-
based company released the Value Checker Balance Reader (BR).  The
personal smart card reader allows consumers to verify balances on
electronic purse smart cards or pre-paid phone cards.
    In addition, the Value Checker BR can display such other
information stored on cards as health care data, identification
numbers and electronic benefit transfer values.  The Value Checker BR
will be commercially available in the first quarter of 1996.
    The new product is an extension of Oki's Value Checker product
line.  Oki released the Value Checker Card Protector (CP) in April
1995.  (Wes Shimanek, Oki America, 508/460-8776.) 

World Wide Web Access

    Meanwhile, Santa Clara, Calif.-based Edify Corp. released its
Electronic Workforce 4.0 interactive services software product last
month.  The software allows companies to launch interactive services
quickly and cheaply via standard World Wide Web (WWW) browsers.
    Blue Bell, Pa.-based Unisys Corp. already has purchased Workforce
4.0 to create and deliver interactive human resources applications for
its employees.  Financial institutions can use the software to create
direct customer access to account information.
    Charlotte, N.C.-based First Union Corp. and Richmond, Va.-based
Signet Bank both are using Workforce 4.0 to deploy WWW banking
applications.  
    Pricing is based on volume.  However, general pricing for the
Electronic Workforce 4.0 starts at $10,000 and solutions offering Web
capabilities begin at $40,000.  (Jan Hames, Edify Corp., 408/982-
2000.)

TSB SIGNS CROSS-BORDER DEALS ON THE CONTINENT

TSB BANK, the UK's eight largest retail bank, has concluded contractual
arrangements with Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB) and Banque Francaise
du Commerce Exterieur (BFCE), which will give the German and French
banks access to the UK clearing system, for low-value cross-border
payments. Developments are already under way to make the link two-way.

Manus Fullerton, head of TSB International, said the deal will allow
WestLB and BFCE to make payments to British beneficiaries, while
complying with the proposed EC directive on cross-border payments.

"We are able to fulfil this contract using our existing technology,
which is seen by our European partners as offering significant benefits
in building a pan-European payments network," he said. "The other
factors which came into play were service levels and price . . . The
combination of TSB's proprietary systems and SWIFT's solution for bulk
data transfer (IFT) has allowed us to develop an innovative and
attractive product."

WestLB, in turn, has been nominated by the German savings banks as
their agent for sending payments to the UK. At the moment, TSB has set
a limit of #10,000 ($15,600) for transfers to the UK, while WestLB has
a limit of DM5,000 ($3,200) for payments to Germany.

Alan Gibson, international services manager of TSB's Edinburgh- based
international division, said: "There are some technological
developments taking place to establish our links, so I would not like
to say how much it will cost. We are happy with the investment made due
to the service benefits for our customers and the steps we are taking
towards meeting EU legislation."

"We see an expansion of cross-border payments, both within the EU and
further afield. The proposed EU directive on cross-border payments,
which will insist on small payments being made more cheaply and faster,
is a challenge which we have anticipated for some time," Fullerton
said.

TSB is discussing similar arrangements with a number of other banks in
Europe and further afield. "The cross-border payments system is
continuing to evolve. This process will develop and gain momentum.
Customers will see benefits in terms of improved levels of service,
greater product choice and reduced cost", Fullerton added.

"We are happy with the transfer arrangements", Wolfgang Grauer, manager
of international payments at WestLB, told EPI. "We chose TSB because
they are a well-known bank and we have already worked with them in
international payments. Since mid-December we have been sending mass
payments and it works. Volume is slowly growing."

UNITED STATES:  FEDWIRE TO UPGRADE IN 1997

THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors has expanded the format for
Fedwire funds transfers to be more compatible with the comprehensive
formats used outside the US. It has also pushed back implementation
deadlines to the end of 1997, a year later than previously discussed.

In addition to a longer timetable, the Fed last month opted for
staggered-date phase-in, with separate deadlines for send and receive
capabilities. The Fed rejected having all banks switch on the same day,
fearing that with 11,000 banks the risk of disruption to the system was
too great. "We did not believe it was practical to do a one-day
cut-over due to our large size," said Louise Roseman, associate
director of the reserve bank operations and payment systems division.

The Board ruled that all banks must be ready to receive the new format
by May 1997 and to send by the end of December. A small number of banks
will be authorised for same-day change over.

Expanding the format was first recommended by a task force of the
American Bankers' Association, though bankers acknowledged that the
costs of conversion will be very high. The greatest disagreement has
been over how and when to implement the changes. The expanded format
will permit banks to include the names and addresses of transfer
originators and beneficiaries, which are also required under new
Treasury regulations.

As a result, the format of Fedwire transfers will be more consistent
with those used by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial
Telecommunication (SWIFT) and the Clearing House for Interbank Payments
System (CHIPS), operated by the New York Clearing House. From an
operations standpoint, US banks will able to increase automation and
facilitate more end-to-end processing of international transfers.

"The new format will allow banks to facilitate mapping of transmissions
from other transfer systems. It will make Fedwire more consistent with
SWIFT and CHIPS, and will allow for more automated mapping without the
elimination of any critical payment information," said Roseman.

Roseman said some of the highest-volume banks will be authorised to
complete a same-day change over in June 1997. Smaller banks will have
an easy transition since the Fed-provided software will be upgraded for
them. The expanded format was supported by the country's largest banks,
particularly those which transact business outside the US through other
systems. "This format will effectively make the Fedwire system more
compatible with other payment systems - SWIFT as well as CHIPS," said
Sy Rosen, vice president of payment systems at Citibank.

"More importantly, it defines fields now that would allow one to
effectively, more directly, translate format messages from other
systems. From the viewpoint of efficiency and automation, it really is
a plus," he said.

"When you have this smaller format, sometimes, when you map from one
system to another, you can't necessarily map one for one," Rosen said.
But with the new, expanded format operations staff will be better able
to translate messages field by field, he said.

UNITED STATES:  PAYMENT BY FAX MADE SECURE

TWO COMPANIES have developed systems that use computer fax technology
for secure funds transfer over public telephone networks. The system
transforms a fax machine into a front-end device for access to
automated clearing houses and financial wire services.

MoneyFax, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, holds US and international
patents. Parties initiating a transfer are registered with the MoneyFax
system and draw a unique item number for each pay order, much like a
paper cheque. Transmissions are encrypted and paperless, so the
electronic documents can be stored efficiently.

The MoneyFax system, which can be set up at banks or processor data
centres, offers such amenities as image scanning and interactive voice
response. It also notifies the sender and receiver by fax when
transmissions go through. MoneyFax is ready for delivery, according to
president William Benton. It is being piloted in a Canadian bank, which
he would not identify.

As well as talking to banks and third-party processors, MoneyFax is
seeking approval from US and Canadian governments that would allow the
system to be used for electronic tax payments.

CONNOTECH, based in Montreal, has a patent pending for a payment-by-fax
system. Its president Thierry Moreau said that over the last two years
he has developed a cheque-replacement technology that allows computer
fax-users to send data and images securely over fax lines.

This system ensures protection against misdirected calls, as well as
confidentiality so that only the intended party sees the document,
Moreau said.

CONNOTECH is currently negotiating with partners in the US and Canada
to install the system, which will be ready for field trials in nine
months.

SINGAPORE:  NETS HIT BY BREAKDOWNS

SINGAPORE'S NATIONAL eftpos system, run by the Network for Electronic
Transfers (NETS), is showing signs of strain. Recently, the system
broke down four times in two weeks.

The breakdown in service affected the whole of the island and occurred
during the pre-Christmas shopping "rush hour". The breakdowns do not
usually last more than half an hour, but the latest incident lasted
three hours, just three days before Christmas. Shoppers who depended on
NETS for payments were furious at the system's failure.

The breakdown was blamed for longer queues at the check-out counters of
many retail outlets, because customers did not realise that the NETS
system had broken down, and check-out staff did not know when the
service would be restored.

NETS attributed the recent spate of breakdowns or "system down-time"
to the surge of users trying to transact at the same time. A NETS
spokesman said the system, which is usually configured to handle five
transactions a second, was reconfigured to handle twice the volume in
anticipation of the demand of the festive season and peak-hour shopping
activities. Apparently, the system failed when actual transactions
exceeded 10 per second during peak hours, causing the breakdowns.

This has raised concerns about the system's ability to cope with
increasing volume during peak hours. Interestingly, while trying to
increase the capacity of its system to handle more transactions, NETS
caused similar breakdowns in service on several occasions during the
same period in 1993.

NETS has since assured the public that it has "rectified the hardware
problem" and is "fine-tuning the system to handle the sudden surge in
transactions". It has also decided as part of a longer-term measure to
upgrade the eftpos system to meet a higher transaction demand.

In the mean time, to address public concern about the system and to
enhance its response time to another breakdown, it has set up a
customer hotline service.

On a separate issue, NETS has announced that the pilot phase of its
national electronic purse project, CashCard, has been delayed for the
third time. This follows similar postponements in July and in the final
quarter of 1994.

NETS said the pilot implementation of the CashCard, which is to take
place at two locations, was delayed by the final technical test, which
is still on-going. It stressed that the pilot can only proceed after
the final technical test is completed, because security issues and
features which"cannot be compromised" have to be resolved first.

UNITED STATES:  PROCESSOR ENABLES BANKS TO PRODUCE CARDS INSTANTLY

FIFTH THIRD Bancorp's transaction processing subsidiary, Midwest
Payment Systems (MPS), together with Atalla Corporation, are selling a
card activation system that would allow banks to issue debit cards
instantly in the branch.

Atalla's Card Activation and PIN Selection (CAPS) 2000 System allows
banks to issue debit cards, replace lost or stolen cards, and rewrite
the magnetic stripe of damaged cards.

It also has the customer service benefit of letting depositors choose
their own PIN code. Financial institutions can perform most of these
functions in the branch that previously required outside providers,
reducing costs and waiting times.

According to the agreement, MPS installs CAPS. It also markets the
branch terminals which are the size of POS card-swipe devices, to its
client banks. The system is capable of driving up to 240 terminals
distributed through branches.

MPS, a Cincinnati-based transaction processor, claims it is the only
one to offer the service. Smaller banks can now offer the service
available at larger banks without the expense of buying the central
computer, Atalla explained. Client banks would pay MPS a fee for every
transaction. The amount of the fee was not disclosed.

UK SHARES TRADE TO GO LIVE

A UK BANK is to launch an electronic share dealing scheme available to
any personal computer owner before the end of September.

Jack Lang, technical director of Electronic Share Information (ESI),
the Cambridge-based company behind the new share-trading market, told
EPI it was "well down the line in discussions with two leading banks to
provide an interest-bearing account for customers to use on-line".

Although its main use will be to facilitate rapid payments for shares,
Lang said the account would also offer other banking services. He would
not disclose which banks were involved, but said the project would go
live either in June or September, following the summer holiday season.
He expected developments of the service in due course, with further
banking services and home shopping.

The company is the brainchild of a group of electronics and computer
specialists, chaired by Hermann Hauser, founder of Acorn Computers.
They believe ESI will revolutionise share dealing, in much the same way
that general insurance was transformed by Direct Line. "It will reduce
costs by an order of magnitude," said Lang. "Flotations will be about a
tenth of the cost of floating a company on the London Stock Exchange,
and share dealing will be considerably cheaper."

ESI will specialise in flotations and dealing in the shares of small
companies, challenging the London Stock Exchange and its Alternative
Investment Market (AIM), which will be launched to replace the unlisted
securities market.

By using a personal computer to buy and sell shares via a modem, the
company expects to dramatically reduce the cost to small investors
getting involved in the market. "If you take some of the mystique away
and reduce costs to say a #10 ($15) dealing fee, you can offer a
realistic return on a #200-#300 investment", says Lang.

Speed will be a key attraction. The software, developed by TCAM
Systems, a UK-based software supplier, will allow customers to log on,
pass through security procedures and buy packets of shares from ESI's
public order board. The bank would then transfer the funds
automatically from the account of the buyer to the seller. Lang
estimates an average transaction will take seven seconds."We needed to
find banks which have immediate money transfer systems, rather than
doing it overnight".

There are 9 million shareholders in the UK, almost half of them holding
shares in government-privatised firms. By providing affordable, direct
access to share dealing many of these may be tempted to play the market
regularly.

UNITED KINGDOM:  FIVE BID FOR PO CONTRACT

A CONTRACT for an electronic stop-list to clamp down on benefit fraud,
which costs the UK government #220 million ($340 million) a year will
be awarded shortly.

This will offer short-term protection against fraud before a
comprehensive overhaul of the benefits payment system takes place.
Benefit order books will possibly be replaced by smart cards. At the
moment pensions and other payments are made using a personalised
benefit order book issued to each claimant. Although they are already
bar-coded, copying and theft of books is commonplace.

A Senior Post Office Counters spokesman said: "given the need to combat
order book fraud, we hope to finalise things as soon as possible".

Five technology companies, including ICL Enterprises and Gemplus, are
tendering for the initial contract, which will develop a combined
bar-code reader and electronic stop-list. It will be tested"in about
1,500 post offices in a large metropolitan area," said Wilson. With
experience of the fraudsters' ability to adapt to and beat anti-fraud
systems, the Post Office is concerned that as little information about
the reader and the test location (which is likely to be London) is
released. If successful, the system will be rolled out to all post
offices.

Two contracts which apply to the automation of the UK Post Offices will
be awarded. The larger contract for revamping the entire payments
system is expected to be announced before the end of the year (see EPI
92).

PORTUGAL:  NEW BARCLAYS SYSTEM AIMED AT COMPANIES

BARCLAYS BANK has launched a "global cash system" to replace its
traditional electronic banking system in Portugal. According to the
bank's marketing director, Gloria Brito, the new system is "aimed
primarily at businesses hoping to cut accounting costs, although it is
open to anyone who wants it".

The system involves a computer link-up between a customer and the bank
and is broken down into three components - cash management, cash
pooling and cash express.

Cash management allows for cash movements within the country, and for
up-to-date information on money and exchange markets. Cash express
allows international cash transfers to be carried out on the same day.
"In effect, it is as if the customer were linked to the international
SWIFT network," explains Brito.

Cash pooling is aimed at centralising customer's accounts. "A customer
with several accounts can consolidate his various accounts on a daily
basis, thus increasing his positive accounts or reducing his
overdrafts." The system, says Brito, also means that a customer can
make predictions on their accounts in conjunction with the cash
management programme.

Brito says it is difficult to evaluate the investment made by the bank
in the new system. "Most of the necessary software already exists in
England, although we have had to modify it slightly for the local
market. This includes making a translation of the software into
Portuguese, something we are working on at the moment. It should all be
in place by the early part of next year."

The system is already available to some 50 customers in Portugal, most
of them large companies who have swapped it for the old electronic
banking system.

Barclays says it is not worried about whether or not the system can pay
for itself."Its real aim is not to directly make money, but rather to
increase our customer portfolio and to increase the movements of our
existing customers,", Brito told EPI.

IBOS SIGNS UNIBANK

THE INTERBANK On-line System (IBOS), set up by Royal Bank of Scotland
and Banco Santander in Spain, has signed Unibank, Denmark's second
largest bank, to the network.

Unibank becomes the seventh financial institution to join the
real-time, cross-border payments network. It is also the first bank in
Scandinavia to become involved, and brings an extra 440 domestic
branches to the IBOS network, increasing the number in Europe to 3,800.

According to Jorgen Christian Andersen, first vice president of
Unibank, discussions with IBOS had been on-going for about six months.
He said Unibank decided to join in order to compete with larger banks
which have a global presence.

"It is a good way of getting a branch network all over Europe without
the costs," Andersen told EPI. Andersen said it should be ready to go
live in the second half of this year.

Unibank plans to offer the service only to corporates with regular
cross-border payment needs. It will not be offered for one-off
payments; they will be sent through the normal SWIFT channels, he said.

The other members in IBOS include: Banco de Comercio e Industria in
Portugal; Credit Commercial de France; Kredietbank in Belgium; and
First Fidelity Bancorp in the US.

Economies of scale have proved elusive for IBOS, which is essentially
competing with the giant message carrier SWIFT, despite protestations
to the contrary. IBOS's future was secured last year following the
decision by US-based technology company EDS to buy a stake in the
company.

The cost of joining IBOS, said to have been a deterrent to joining, is
said to have dropped following the purchase by EDS of a stake in IBOS.
According to Andersen, the most expensive element is adapting Unibank's
back office systems to be compatible with the IBOS software.

GZS SETS UP SUBSIDIARY

GESELLSCHAFT FUR Zahlungssysteme (GZS), the bank-owned German payments
system, has set up a subsidiary for payments transfers which, it says,
will allow cross-border bulk payments in Europe to be made in three to
five business days, compared with seven to fourteen days at present.

The new operation, known as Bank fur Zahlungsservice or BZS, will
handle smaller-denomination payments of up to  Ecu 2,000 or DM5,000
($1,600-$3,200).

Payments may be routed from any of the German banks that are members of
GZS. They include all major institutions.

According to GZS, the rationale for the new bank is to realise quick
and low-cost transfers of funds within the European Union in line with
the European Commission's Green Book recommendations of 1990.

BZS will be the German link in the chain of automated clearing houses
(ACHs) which should eventually extend to all European countries. Member
banks will be charged a fixed price per transaction and are expected to
pass on any cost benefit to customers.

A GZS spokesman said that each member bank would have to calculate its
savings individually, but acknowledged that Germany's major banking
groups might still find it cheaper to operate their own systems.

The co-operative banks' TipaNet system, for instance, offers flexible
arrangements for cost-sharing between the sending and the receiving
bank and should eventually deal with substantial volumes.

BZS will make transfers to ACHs in other European countries and to its
member banks on a bulk basis. At present, the system can handle
eurocheques only. While GZS hopes to extend the service to bank cheques
too, no final decision has been made on whether to offer that facility.

BZS is not yet in a position to operate a pan-European system. The
pilot system set up with Belgium has gone into operation immediately,
and the link should be extended to the UK, Austria and Italy in the
course of this year.

Frankfurt-based BZS will be headed by Detlev Buchal, the chief
executive of GZS, and Gerhard August Stern, who was previously head of
payments systems at Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen in Frankfurt.

CANADA'S INTERAC DOWN, BUT UP

INTERAC DIRECT Payment, Canada's national on-line debit network,
weathered its first Christmas season as a fully-deployed system,
handling volumes that were almost three times higher than December
1993.

Several bankers gave the debit card system glowing marks for its
performance. However, the system suffered a set back during the height
of the Christmas shopping season when local and wire news media
reported that HMV Canada, a major chain of record stores based in
Toronto, complained that the system caused "frustrating delays."

Interac general manager Fred Harris told EPI the system experienced no
significant downtime in December, while other defenders dismissed the
complaint as an isolated case. In addition to problems within the
merchant's system, longer transaction times could be attributed to
system-clogging volume: a peak 1.2 million transactions passed through
the system on Christmas Eve, he said. He did not expect that Interac
would be modified as a result of the complaint.

"If that is the case, then I would suggest that there was a system
failure," said Mel Fruitman, president of Retail Council, an
association of Canadian retailers, adding that a debit system should
work quickly and accurately no matter what day it is. "Even ten seconds
is an infinite amount of time when people are waiting. If a system is
having these delays, it is not meeting customer needs," Fruitman said.

Interac features a distributed system, Harris explained. When one
bank's card is used at a "foreign" POS terminal, the transaction is
passed to the issuing bank for authorisation and clearing. Interac
maintains no central switch, except for a central diagnostic facility.

"We did not see any degradation or problems with the core network,"
Harris said. With the distributed architecture of the system, he
explained, transaction delays could be traced to any number of steps in
the cycle. Of 26 million transactions made with Interac cards, 18
million to 19 million went through the core interchange backbone.

According to Harris, 5.5 million cardholders used the system 26 million
times in December, generating C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) in sales - a
more than 50 percent increase over August's C$892.5 million in sales.
And compared to December 1993, when 2.5 million customers generated
C$500 million in sales, system volume last month almost trebled.

"We think it will double again this year," Harris predicted. The
greatest system growth took place after April, when Ontario was linked
to the system. Ontario is also the province where most national chains
are centred.

In other news, Harris said the Bureau of Competition is still
scrutinising the network. Earlier in 1994, it was revealed that
regulators were investigating Canada's only EFT network after it
received complaints of excessive fees and charges.

US FED HITS `SHOULDER SURFING'

THE FEDERAL Reserve Board of Governors took aim at "shoulder surfing,"
a technique used by criminals at ATMs, by eliminating the requirement
that banks print a consumer's account number on every ATM receipt.

According to an interim rule approved last month, banks are no longer
required to "uniquely" identify the consumer's account or card number
on ATM receipts.

Previously, Regulation E, which governs electronic fund transfers in
the US, specified that banks print a consumer's number so that a
transaction could be clearly identified. It is presumed that banks will
truncate the account number to three or six figures out of a 12 number
account, enough so that a transaction can still be identified.

Criminals can often videotape or photograph people entering their PINs,
which they then combine with receipts that are often disposed at the
ATM. Criminals are then able to counterfeit cards and access accounts
with the PIN codes.

Losses due to counterfeiting are conservatively estimated at $25
million to $40 million, according to Tami Ishida, a senior researcher
at Dove Associates, a Boston-based consultancy. She agreed the interim
change would help to slow fraud losses.

While issuers will win out in the long term by denying counterfeiters
critical data, converting terminals to accommodate the new rules will
cause some expense, she observed. Acquirers will have to re-programme
some 400,000 POS terminals and 109,000 ATMs.

Industry reaction was positive. A spokeswoman for the Star System, one
of the largest EFT networks in the US, said her network was pleased
with the change. "This will significantly help curtail the size of the
problem caused by shoulder surfing," she said.

However, she added that the interim rule is vague and the industry
would be better served with uniform standards."It allows too much room
for interpretation. We're urging them to be more specific so the
industry has better guidelines," the spokeswoman said.

INFINET BOSS SAYS REGIONALS WILL PROSPER

REGIONAL NETWORKS may face pressure from neighbouring regionals,
national brands and non-bank processors. But there are substantial
opportunities, even as customers demand increasingly sophisticated
services, according to InfiNet Payment Services chief executive Richard
Yanak.

In a December 21 speech before the Electronic Banking Economics
Society, a professional association in New York, Yanak described his
vision for the future of the newly-created InfiNet and for other bank
EFT networks.

"People value their time even more than they value money," he said,
listing the first among absolutes that rule today's payments industry.
"We need to deliver those services whenever and wherever they are
wanted."

Until now, Yanak said, shared networks were limited to transaction
switching, terminal driving and other aspects of maintaining ATM
systems, such as card authentication and embossing. In the next year
and beyond, networks will introduce remote banking, electronic bill
payment, off-line debit, and electronic purses, he said. And as banks
face pressures to reduce costs, InfiNet could serve as a bank-owned,
third-party service provider to the virtual bank, Yanak said. Bankers
have to examine if they need a data centre or back office. Yanak warned
that past in-house efforts have not shown success. Chemical Bank and
Huntington Bank both have launched bill payment systems to no avail, he
said.

Providing new and expanded services will help to generate new revenue
for member banks. Yanak told the EBES attendees that InfiNet will
explore developing in-house services, buying other enterprises and
forging business alliances. "Every service can generate a fee income
for our members. If priced properly, consumers will pay," he said.

Yanak said InfiNet is looking at creating a terminal leasing business.
The network would strike deals with manufacturers, buying large numbers
of units at lower prices and leasing machines to banks. By partnering,
he said, "InfiNet would guarantee manufacturers substantial orders at a
price lower than is available to any individual bank. Participating
bankers, who would pay a monthly rate, would be sure to always receive
updated ATMs."

Yanak questioned Visa and MasterCard's apparent direction of late, and
suggested the traditional division of territory could be jeopardised.
"Are the regional networks superfluous? Under the right circumstances,
they wouldn't be needed," he said. But banks have turned to regional
networks to remain competitive. "A substantial fraction of the payments
business has moved to non-banks, in part due to the policies set out by
the associations."

This year, Yanak observed, the creation of Visa Interactive remote
banking and MasterCard's purchase of the BankMate network in St Louis
posed tangible threats to regionals. While advising a wait-and-see
approach, Yanak said the nationals should be watched. "If competition
between the national and regional networks increases, regionals will
have no choice but to implement universal interchange," he said.

"Both associations say they support the bank brand in its relationship
with the customer. The difference between them and us is that we
believe it," he said. For the good of the banks, in the battle for the
hearts and minds of consumers, Yanak called for a national brand to be
placed on the back of cards.

Member banks face continuing erosion of their relationship with the
community due to the growing dominance of the national marque, Yanak
said."When national brands are put on the card, it usurps the local
brand and it sounds the death knell of the depository account business.
We have to come to grips with that reality," he said. Depicting a worse
scenario, Yanak said a powerful corporation, such as General Motors,
might create a GM National Bank and offer deposit access services via
the national systems.

HUNGARY:  GIRO PROCESSING TIME CUT TO 24 HOURS

HUNGARY'S BANKING system has taken a giant leap forward with the
introduction of an inter-bank giro system. The new giro facilitates
overnight electronic domestic money transfers among the country's
500-plus bank branches.

Before the launch of the system, bank-to-bank transfers routinely took
days and even weeks, representing a major obstacle to the country's
transition to the free market.

After extensive training of thousands of employees in every bank branch
in the country, the system's architects managed to convert from an
antiquated network to the new X-25 packet switching system between
Friday November 18 and Monday November 21, 1994. Under the old system,
magnetic tapes and disks were delivered round the country by train.

"The effort was no small peanuts," said Peter Braun, president of
Giro's board of directors. "We didn't get much sleep before the
launch."

Braun is also the deputy chief executive of Orszagos Takarekpentzar
(OTP), the national savings bank, and the country's largest
deposit-taking bank with 365 branches. Giro, the system's legal owner,
is held proportionally by all of the commercial banks who are obliged
by the National Bank of Hungary to belong to the system. OTP holds the
largest stake at 22 percent.

The overnight X-25 system is itself intended to be a back-up system to
a realtime giro due out later this year. The network runs on a series
of Intel Pentium-based PCs, linked via satellite and microwave
transmitters, with further back-ups made on floppy disks.

Transfer orders are sent in the late afternoon from branches to the
Giro headquarters in Budapest, where they are sorted overnight for
dispatch early the next morning. The pending real time system, made
possible by a World Bank grant, will be administered on a Bull DPS7000
mainframe.

One reason for launching the overnight back-up system before a real
time system was to determine whether the back-up system was functioning
properly, according to Pal Kerekfy, software director for IDOM, a
domestic information technology company which administered the
transition to the X-25 exchange.

In addition, the Bull network has been delayed for more than two years
pending the central bank's newly-defined system of liquidity control
among commercial banks. Now, the National Bank sets a liquidity limit
for each bank daily. The X-25 network's software was developed from the
beginning to accommodate the liquidity limits, while the Bull system
still has to be modified accordingly, Kerekfy said. IDOM, which was
taken over by Deloitte & Touche last year, also won the tender to
administer the installation of the Bull system.

Before the projects are completed, all commercial banks will have to
adopt a new system of client account numbers. At the moment, the banks
use as many as 40 systems of keeping track of client accounts, said
Kerekfy.

The National Bank has devised a new system, also to be implemented
universally this year, but it has decided to delay the new account
number system until after the launch of the Giro as"it was considered
too much of a shock to modify both systems at the same time", Kerekfy
said.

In more than a month of operation, the new giro system has functioned
without a problem, apart from the occasional human error among clients.
The margin of error is within the 1 percent to 2 percent international
norm, said Braun.

FRANCE:  SELF-SERVICE EXTENDS TO STOCK TRADING

IF A new series of tests succeed, self-service banking may be extended
to include stock exchange transactions. The tests are being undertaken
in two branches of CIC-Paris (Credit Industriel et Commercial), and may
be extended to other banks and branches where sufficient demand exists.

The CIC-Paris experiment is being undertaken in partnership with the
Societe des Bourses Francaises (SBF), which manages the French stock
exchange. It is scheduled to run through June 1995. During this period,
CIC-Paris and SBF will analyse results based on quantitative and
qualitative considerations. These include: the number of users; what it
is used for; and clients' suggestions. A decision on whether or not to
extend the service will then be made.

The test terminal, known as the "Borne-Bourse", consists of a
specially-equipped Minitel (part of the French national videotex
system) with a colour screen, a keyboard and a smart card reader called
"LECAM". Initially, there will be one terminal in each of the two test
sites.

Users of the service simply put their bank card into the card reader
and enter their PIN code. This gives them access to the CIC-Paris stock
market videotex service. Menu-driven software guides them through the
session.

At the moment, the service includes three offerings: personal portfolio
information (by value, rubric, settlements, and taxes); general
information on various stocks and the market, on privatisations and on
CIC-Paris mutual funds; and order placement for buying, selling,
cancellation or amendment. For reasons of security, clients must
confirm any orders they pass by entering their PIN a second time. Under
the present experiment, clients must use terminals only at branches
where they have an account and a portfolio.

SBF made the decision to run this trial last year, following the
success of its"Points-Bourse" information terminals. The Points-Bourse
programme, which was launched in 1992 in partnership with various
banking networks, provides clients with up-to-date SBF stock exchange
data using a system called Chronoval.

The programme has grown dramatically since October 1992, when the
number of these terminals located within branch offices totalled 45 in
six banking networks. By the end of 1994, there were 263 terminals used
by 28 partner banks. SBF officials hope for similar success with the
new venture.

ELECTRONIC PAYMENTS INTERNATIONAL via NewsNet
January 1, 1995

PAYMENTS COME OF AGE

Previously the poor relation of the banking industry, payments are
increasingly seen as the most interesting and profitable area of the
business. Electronic Payments International looks back at some of the
developments of the past year which have shaped this thinking

IF 1993 was the year when eftpos took off, then 1994 was the year of
the smart card. The issue of rising telecommunications costs, coupled
with the problem of fraud, forced banks to move away from traditional
magnetic stripe technology and look at the alternatives. Without doubt,
1995 will see a continuing migration to chip card technology.

Smart Cards

Encouraging results from France's Cartes Bancaires smart card system,
prompted banks in other countries to begin investing in the technology.
Cartes Bancaires' decision to replace magnetic stripe cards with chip
cards was criticised by local banks and dismissed by the international
banking community as an expensive folly.

However, events in 1994 vindicated Cartes Bancaires' decision. Card
fraud in France dropped by 50 percent between 1992 and 1993, falling
from 0.08 percent to 0.04 percent of all transactions. This translates
into losses of Fr207 million ($40 million) at the end of 1993, as
opposed to Fr472 million in 1991. Interestingly, though, Cartes
Bancaires abandoned its electronic purse project being developed with
La Poste, the French postal service.

In January, National Westminster Bank in the UK announced the imminent
launch of Mondex, arguably the most ambitious smart card scheme. The
card, which includes an optional wallet, is being developed in
conjunction with British Telecom (BT), the UK's main telecom supplier.
Midland Bank, a subsidiary of the giant HSBC corporation, also
announced its involvement in the scheme.

Due to go live this year in a pilot in Swindon, Mondex allows users to
transfer funds between their bank accounts and their cards through BT
telephones and adapted NatWest and Midland ATMs.

Tim Jones, senior executive of IT, strategy and policy at NatWest, and
the man behind Mondex, said the scheme differs from other electronic
purse schemes in that Mondex aspires to replace cash, with no audit
trail. Cardholders can transfer money between wallets and can lock it
with a PIN-code. If the person loses the wallet, the cardholder has
lost the money.

Despite, or perhaps because of, its technical sophistication, Mondex
has been severely criticised by industry sources. At the International
Smart Card Conference held in Frankfurt in February, Tim Jones came
under fire from speakers from Banksys, Belgium's national payments
organisation which has developed its own electronic purse scheme, and
from others who questioned Mondex's security and economic viability.

Armand Linkens, director of marketing and sales at Banksys, said the
team developing the Belgian pilot looked at Mondex and concluded that,
because it leaves no audit trail and because it is an "open", rather
than a "closed" system, the potential for fraud was considerable.

However, Mondex does have its proponents. Jerome Svigals, a US-based
smart card consultant, said NatWest has taken a bold step in the right
direction. Firstly, it increases productivity at the bank and the
retailer because it eliminates cash handling. Secondly, the banks
benefit from the float created by a prepaid card.

In fact, the industry became increasingly divided into two camps: the
pro-Mondex banks and the closed system banks.

A further division within the smart card industry was created by the
card associations, Visa and MasterCard/Europay. In December 1993, Visa
and MasterCard/Europay agreed to co-operate on chip card
specifications. The decision was greeted with enthusiasm by the
industry, but failed to hide the fundamental differences between the
card associations approach to smart card applications.

Under the leadership of Charles "Chuck" Russell and with Roger Peirce
in charge of delivery systems, Visa was less enthusiastic about smart
cards than MasterCard. Although this philosophy changed with their
departure - Russell left as president and chief executive officer at
the end of 1993, while Peirce left in March 1994 - Visa is still
unconvinced that smart cards should be implemented as a replacement for
magnetic stripe cards. MasterCard, and particularly Europay, have
committed themselves to migrate to smart cards within an ambitious time
frame.

At Europay's annual members' meeting in Bergen, Norway, the
association's board agreed to invest Ecu1 billion ($1.2 billion) to
implement smart cards. It expects its members to begin introducing
smart cards by 1996. Understandably, the decision was dismissed
as"headline-seeking" by Visa.

Europay claimed that members would see a return of $2 billion within a
seven-year period as a result of a reduction in fraud. Visa, meanwhile,
replied by saying these figures were only relevant to Europay, since
its fraud was higher than Visa's. This is because Visa had reduced
fraud as a result of its Card Verification Value (CVV) technique.

It was not long after the Europay board's decision that MasterCard
announced it too was fully endorsing smart card technology. The
decision was made in tandem with Europay's decision, but MasterCard
would not say how much money it was committing to the project. It did
say, however, that it would be converting terminals to accept chip
cards by 1996.

Visa, aware it was becoming branded as the anti-smart card
organisation, sought to counter this with some high-profile
announcements. In March, it said it was planning an electronic purse
project which would rival the Mondex scheme.

In order to develop such a scheme, Visa linked with two groups of
industry specialists to develop specifications for a purse. The first
includes banking groups working on electronic purse projects: Banksys
in Belgium; Cartes Bancaires in France; Taiwan's Financial Information
System Centre; Sociedade Espanol de Medios de Pago in Spain; Sociedade
Interbancaria de Servicos (SIBS) in Portugal; Denmark's Danmant;
Electronic Payment Services (EPS), NationsBank and Wachovia - all from
the US.

The second group included technology companies, such as Gemplus and
VeriFone. These were contacted to help develop the specifications for
an electronic purse scheme, while the first group were responsible for
ensuring technical compatibility across the various schemes.

One notable exclusion from the first group was Mondex. The significance
of this was played down by both groups. Mondex said it was following
standards set by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) and the
European Commission's working group (CEN), but would not say if it had
been contacted by Visa.

Europay was sceptical about the Visa initiatives, sticking to its
figures on fraud. Neither organisation said Visa's working groups
jeopardised the joint specifications committees, although Europay
professed disappointment that it had not been made aware of the
consortia.

However, despite their differences, Visa and MasterCard/Europay did
announce the completion of their joint specifications. On November 8,
the third and final part of the standards, which determine how smart
cards and POS terminals would process financial transactions, card
applications, and provide for contingencies were announced.

As the associations battled it out for the upper hand, individual smart
card initiatives continued during the year. In February, Banksys
announced the towns to be involved in its electronic purse trial. The
card, later called Proton, was developed to replace cash at the point
of sale. The trial, due to go live in December in Leuven and Wavre, was
one of the most ambitious purse schemes. Given the centralised nature
of the country's payments system, the electronic purse was expected to
migrate to general bank cards in the future.

In July, NETS, the national payments organisation in Singapore,
expanded its CashCard electronic purse project by linking with a local
university and Singapore Telecom. The CashCard scheme announced an
affinity programme with the National University of Singapore. It was
adapted to the needs of students and university staff for payments on
the campus. The Telecom deal opened up 25 adapted telephones to
CashCard holders.

Meanwhile in August in Portugal, the SIBS-backed purse announced it was
to go live in the third quarter of the year, several months early.
Unlike other pilots, it was controlled in the branch of one of the
member banks, Caixa Geral de Depositos.

Danmont, the first major electronic purse scheme, celebrated its second
anniversary in September. Transaction volume grew 108 percent in the
first quarter of 1994, compared with the last quarter of 1993.

In the US, one of the few backers of smart cards, EPS, announced
details of its electronic purse pilot in September. It is due to go
live in the fourth quarter of this year. Due to involve 10,000
customers, the trial will take place in a five-mile corridor in
Delaware.

South Africa also backed smart cards that month. Six of the country's
main banks are involved in the project, called the South African
Electronic Purse. The pilot, which went live in September, involved 100
merchants and 12,000 customers in Alberton, a suburb of Johannesburg.

Finland became the next to announce the launch of an electronic purse
project. Called Avant, the scheme was backed by the Finnish central
bank and came in two forms, a prepaid phone card, and a reloadable
electronic purse. About 40,000 cards were expected to be in issue by
the end of last year.

Mondex received a considerable boost near the end of the year when
Hongkong Bank signed to the scheme. It agreed to become a franchisee
for the scheme in the Asia region. The agreement was a natural result
of Hongkong Bank's association with Midland Bank, one of the banks
behind Mondex.

Finally, the Dutch banks announced the details of its electronic purse
scheme, to be launched in October 1995. The scheme, called Chipknip,
will be piggy-backed on to the banks' eurocheque cards. Interpay, a
merger of Eurocard Nederlands and BeaNet, will manage the scheme. It
expects up to 20 million smart cards to be in issue in three to four
years.

Cross-border payments

Low value, cross-border payments continued to dominate discussions
during the year, with various payment clubs emerging. One of the first
payments networks, Interbank On-line System (IBOS), launched by Royal
Bank of Scotland and Banco Santander in 1990, continued to sign new
banks during the year. The system transfers money, on-line, real time
to and from any branch of its members, which include, Credit Commercial
de France, Banco do Comercio e Industria in Portugal, Kredietbank in
Belgium and First Fidelity Bank in the US.

Although IBOS is keen to play down the potential conflict with SWIFT,
the international financial message sender, many see it as operating in
competition rather than as complement to SWIFT. Critical mass remains
an elusive goal for IBOS. The company says that 20 members would make
the system viable.

In February, the first signs that the European Commission (EC) was
preparing to take stern action against banks emerged. At the
International Electronic Payments Conference in Frankfurt, Peter
Troberg, head of DGXV, the directorate in charge of financial services,
warned banks that, unless improvements were made to the quality of low
value, cross-border payments, a directive would be proposed.

The financial community rallied together against the Commission,
accusing it of unrealistic expectations, saying that low value,
cross-border payments represent less than 5 percent of all payments.
Improvements, they said, could not be made since it could not be
justified by the volumes involved.

Despite the protests, various payment clubs went live during the year,
partly in response to the EC's threats. In April, B.epsys, a consortium
of seven of the largest Belgian banks, went live with its low value
system. It began processing payments between Belgium and Germany
through an arrangement with Geselleschaft fur Zahlungssysteme (GZS),
the bank-owned payments organisation. The system operates similarly to
an automated clearing house, with domestic transactions routed for
international clearing.

In that month, NatWest announced that the group in its payments club:
Commerzbank; Societe Generale; Banco Central Hispano, was to be
expanded. Unlike IBOS, which uses SWIFT message standards but does not
use the SWIFT system, the NatWest group used the international network.
In December, the bank rumoured to be joining was Banco Comercial
Portugues.

It was in December that the system went live with its first transaction
using SWIFT's Interbank File Transfer (IFT) service. It claims to cut
the transfer time down from eight to three working days.

Meanwhile, in July, Banque Nationale de Paris and its strategic partner
in Germany, Dresdner Bank, launched a cross-border payments service.
The service is designed for payments of up to Ecu2,500 ($2,800),
charging a fee of Fr140 ($7).

In September, TipaNet, the cross-border payments initiative set up by
the co-operative banks in France and Germany was adopted by Bankers'
Trust in the US, Swiss Bank Corporation and Austria's
Raiffeisen-Zentralbank. Like the NatWest system, TipaNet uses SWIFT's
IFT system for transfer of payment messages.

Despite these initiatives, the European Commission dealt a blow to the
industry in October when it proposed a directive to improve
cross-border payments. The decision was met with dismay from the
banking industry, but the Commissioner for DGXV, Raniero Vanni
d'Archirafi, was adamant the banks were given adequate time to improve
the situation.

The proposal came after a second study was undertaken for the
Commission which showed that double charging occurred in 36 percent of
payments, while at 46 percent of branches, no written information was
available.

Banks criticised the quality of the research in the report and the EC's
interpretation of its findings. They said that in most instances the
banks were within the Commission's parameters. The average cost of a
transaction had fallen from Ecu22.39 to Ecu19.80 since the last survey,
while the time for the transfer of payments, 4.8 working days, was well
within the EC's recommendations.

Other developments

ATMs continued to be adapted to deliver extra services. In Brazil,
Tecnologia Bancaria (TecBan), the Brazilian company which runs the
Banco24Horas ATM network, revamped its machines to allow for bill
payments. An initial 30 Pagamento Eletronico terminals went live in
March in Sao Paulo for paying electricity and telephone bills. TecBan
expects 500 to be installed by the end of this year, with other
utilities, such as gas and water companies coming on-line.

In Thailand in May, Bangkok Bank began selling mutual funds through its
400 ATMs. The system was launched in conjunction with BBL Asset
Management, a subsidiary of Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.

La Caixa in Spain also offered extra services through its ATMs. Called
Servicaixa, the system dispenses concert, local transport and airline
tickets, provides for the payment of taxes, and pay for university
fees.

The service was expanded in February 1994 by installing a further 400
machines, bringing the total to 800 and could be accessed by all the
bank's Sistema 6000, Visa and Eurocard cardholders.

The US

The US electronic payments marketplace showed signs of maturity in
1994, as government regulators alerted the banking industry that it
promised to pay closer heed to competition issues.

The pace of regional EFT network consolidation slowed slightly, though
there was no shortage of merger discussions. In November, the
Missouri-based BankMate network was purchased by MasterCard, a move
that confirmed the worst fears of regional executives, who suspected
that the national associations want to be more than just gateway
switches.

The only major merger to succeed was between Yankee 24 and NYCE. They
merged as equals in October, creating the third-largest network in the
US. The MAC network continued westward when its members, which acquired
owners of the Quest network in Kentucky, absorbed the network into MAC.

Local jealousies in Colorado, however, sparked a spin-off as small,
independent banks formerly affiliated to the Rocky Mountain Bankcard
System created their own network. There was reportedly great strife
between the independent bank and First Bank Systems, which recently
purchased the owners of the Rocky Mountain network.

Talks, were broken off between Cash Station of Chicago and Magic Line
of Michigan in May, both parties citing philosophical and cultural
differences. The perennial discussion of a merger between the Honor and
Most networks, in the southeast US, also bore no results.

State and federal watchdogs caused the greatest stir in April when the
US Justice Department brought anti-trust charges against Electronic
Payment Services, parent to the owners of MAC, the largest ATM network
in the US. The Justice investigation resulted in EPS signing a consent
decree that said EPS must open the network to third-party processors,
reversing a long-standing network policy.

EPS management said the consent decree, which is not an admission of
guilt, made no difference because EPS earlier changed its bylaws. The
consent decree accelerated the timetable for opening up the network.
Justice complained that MAC policies left banks, particularly small
institutions, vulnerable to higher fees and charges. Competing EFT
networks said this action was inevitable, with the rising importance of
ATMs in the consumer banking industry, but also added that MAC's
restrictive policies were unique in the US.

US Congress also entered the fray, with several consumer groups
lobbying the House Banking Committee. A subcommittee headed by Joseph
Kennedy took bankers to task, questioning the wide variety and the
rising cost of service fees in the last few years. No further action
was taken after the public hearing.

The US Government, in an effort championed by Vice President Al Gore,
supported the development of systems that would deliver federal and
state benefits via the electronic payments system. With limited runs in
Texas, Maryland, California and Ohio, EBT programmes performed well.

However, the Federal Reserve Board created a storm with its decision to
extend Regulation E to stored-value cards, including EBT cards. EBT
proponents criticised the Fed action, claiming Regulation E will stymie
projects because of the heavy liabilities that would be transferred to
state governments and onerous reporting requirements.

MasterCard, at the end of 1994, sparked a new round of competition
concerns when it unilaterally declared that its national on-line debit
programme, Maestro, would not prohibit duality. A few years earlier,
MasterCard and Visa were rebuffed by the National Association of
States' Attorneys General for trying to launch Entree, a joint debit
card programme.

MasterCard submitted its proposed rule change to the group for comment.
When the group responded that it was not filing suit, MasterCard
executives proceeded with the change. Visa and other industry observers
noted that the Attorneys' opinion, while not against the proposal, was
hardly an endorsement they emphasised that the group had reserved the
right to bring suit in the future.

Americans showed that they have warmed to electronic payments. Visa's
72 million cards in circulation generated 35 million in sales volume as
of second quarter 1994. Officials from regional networks, Visa, and
MasterCard report that debit volumes are starting to rise, claiming a
larger share of total spending. MasterCard reported that ATM usage had
begun to carry over to debit.

Perhaps most unsettling was the sudden realisation that computer
software and telecommunication companies are poised to play a very
significant role in payment systems. Assuming the role of bankers'
worst nightmare, Microsoft and its outspoken president, Bill Gates, was
widely credited with awakening bankers to the urgent need to adapt to
changing times. Bankers also learned about software and technology
companies, such as Intuit and Netscape Communication.

Several companies shook up the industry by plying alternative delivery
channels, such as banking by telephone, screen-phone and by personal
computer. Visa in July established Visa Interactive when it bought most
of Virginia-based US Order. Interactive billed itself as a bank-owned
solution for banks that wanted to offer home banking and bill payment
services.

Non-banks were very active. US West, Electronic Data Services (EDS) and
France Telecom Intelmatique formed Interactive Transaction partners
(ITP) and quickly signed such sizeable clients as Comerica Bank Texas.

Visa trumped MasterCard when it signed a deal with Microsoft in
November. It agreed to develop software that would allow consumers to
make payments securely and transact business over computer networks.
This and other software will open up the worldwide web to commerce. In
December, First Data Corporation, the largest transaction processor in
the US, signed a deal with Netscape Communications that could route
credit card transactions over the Internet. MasterCard finally followed
in January when it launched its own programme with Netscape.

In ACH news, bankers turned long-standing grievances against Fedwire
into action this year with the formation of the Private Sector ACH
Exchange, or PAX. Visa USA, the New York Clearing House, and Arizona
Clearing House agreed to link up, allowing banks to route ACH payments
outside the Fed. At the moment, the federal reserve, which plays the
role of both regulator and competitor, controls 80 percent of the
business. In its first year, Citibank NA and Chemical Bank joined the
new system, while PNC Bank moved more of its business through Visa ACH.

The private sector scored another victory when lobbying, led by the
National Clearing House Association (NACHA), spurred the Federal
Reserve to drop its bid to process corporate tax payments to the US
Treasury, a programme expected to add $1 trillion in payments to the
national ACH volume. ACH executives also had feared that the government
could have exceeded its authority by controlling such a significant
piece of business.

PAYBACK TIME FOR MEXICO?

Mexico roared into the markets with its first deals of the year,
raising more than $1 billion last week from some of the same investors who
decried the country as untouchable just a year ago. The sovereign easily
raised DM 1 billion Monday with its first ever 7-year DM issue, equal to
$690 million. The state bank Nafinsa raised $100 million Wednesday and the
import-export bank Bancomext issued $300 million in commercial paper.
        But top Mexican financial officials denied that the country is
using the sovereign cash expressly to make any of the $1.3 billion in
payments due Jan. 29 on short-term swaps drawn from the U.S. Treasury and
the Fed.
        "People might think it is for the IMF or the U.S. Treasury, but the
money does not have a specific purpose," insists Daniel Martinez, advisor
to Martin Werner, Mexico's director general of public credit."The money is
just being used to refinance short-term debt and improve the debt profile."
        Market sources, however, disagreed and seemed amused with Mexico's
curious response.
        "They have some money to pay back to the U.S. Who are they
kidding," wonders a syndicator.
        Chemical Bank analysts suggest that Mexico will almost surely repay
the half due to the Fed, for legal reasons, but that payment on the
Treasury's half is less certain. There's been "some hint" that the Mexican
government has been seeking to roll over the debt, says the research group
in a Jan. 8 analysis. But, "given the politically charged environment in
the U.S., we believe this will be a hard sell," Chemical says.
        Martinez  refused say when Mexico would issue next. Perhaps the
country will follow Argentina to Japan--Mexico has certainly mimicked
Argentina before. The Argentine government is said to be leaning towards a
yen deal, maybe as soon as this week (see page 8).
        Deutchemark deal fever shows no sign of abating--the likely drop in
German interest rates should stoke even more issuance. Mexico was the
second Latin American country to lengthen a DM tenor to seven years. Co-led
by CS First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, the issue carried a 10.38%
coupon, 1/8% higher than the 10.25% coupon that Argentina's seven-year deal
carried two weeks ago.
        A syndicate source says the Mexican issue's higher coupon makes it
slightly more attractive than the Argentine seven-year bond, and has sold
briskly with German and Swiss retail investors. Mexico last tapped the DM
market in October with a five-year DM 1 billion deal for 9.38%.--Dan B.

DEBT RESTRUCTURING TICKING ALONG

With the holidays over, the commercial debt restructuring deals of
Peru, Panama and Slovenia are seeing renewed progress toward completion.
There have been no reports of significant snags or delays in any of the
deals; the original timetables seem to be substantially on track.
        As it promised, Panama has refrained from asking for a rebalancing
of options choices in its $3.5 billion Brady, even though the choices were
far from the balanced breakdown the country the country had sought. With
nearly all the debt spoken for--and no indication of any major renegades
among creditors--the overwhelming majority of orders came in for interest
reduction bonds, covering 81.9% of the debt by Panama's count. Pars bonds
were chosen for only 13.6% of the debt, and discounts only 4.5%. Nary a
creditor chose new money.
        "There is nothing at this point that would hold the deal back,"
said a banking source. Panama is still reviewing the final documentation.
No signing debt has been set, but the two sides are still hoping for
signing in this quarter, and a closing in the next.
        The aggressive timetable for Peru's $9 billion Brady has slipped a
little. Bank creditors handed their version of the term sheet to Peru in
early December, right on time, but it hasn't yet come back. The Peruvians
say they want a first quarter closing, but it looks now like both sides
would have to work like lightning to accomplish that. There has been no
further movement on specifying more closely the debt's participation in
debt for equity swaps; apparently the term sheet will say only that the
Brady debt can't be excluded from any such scheme the country puts forth.
        Slovenia's bank advisory committee was last week awaiting waivers
from creditors that would free Slovenia's share of the ex-Yugoslavia's debt
and allow Slovenia to begin paying off about $800 million in obligations at
Libor + 13/16. Creditors holding at least two-thirds of the debt must
approve the country's exit from the joint and several liability for ex-Yugo
debt. Bankers have not expected a problem, but the New York blizzard and
the fact that some French banks reportedly didn't get the documents until
last Tuesday could create some slight delays. Slovenia hopes to close the
deal within 70 days from waiver approval. -- MD

THINK TANK CHIEF FORESEES CUBAN BLOODSHED

Despite some Cuban economic modernization and a tentative opening
toward non-U.S. foreign investment, Cuba and the United States are unlikely
to move toward eliminating the long-standing U.S. economic embargo against
Cuba in the near future, predicts Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on
Foreign Relations.
        In fact, Gelb foresees something much darker: the possibility of a
bloody civil war "as awful as Bosnia" in the coming years, with the
transition away from a Castro regime.
        Cuba "could be on the edge, in three years, or 10 years, of real
civil war," Gelb suggested last week during a talk at the Americas Society
in New York, shortly after returning from a week of talks in Cuba that the
Council on Foreign Relations arranged with the Cuban government.
        Gelb, a former Pulitzer-prizewinning New York Times journalist and
U.S. diplomat, participated in a series of meetings with top Cuban
political and economic officials during his November visit, which included
five hours of talks with Castro.
        His conclusions are bad news for investors who hope for
regularization of Cuba's defaulted $4 billion debt to Western banks. While
offshore and other non U.S.-registered funds have taken small positions in
defaulted Cuban loans (the Emerging Markets Traders Association recorded
nearly $1.2 billion face value in trades of Cuban instruments last year,
$652 million of that in loan trades that averaged less than $2 million
each), and there are several funds collecting money in wait for better
portfolio investment opportunities on the island, the main impetus for
appreciation of such investments would be the lifting or softening of the
35-year-old embargo.
        Liquidity would improve dramatically, as U.S. investors now banned
from holding the debt would be allowed to participate. War, of course,
could wipe out such positions altogether. Cuban debt now trades in the low
to mid 20s.
        Cuba has a team of well-trained economic managers, which Gelb
equates with the teams Mexico has sported in the last dozen years. However,
their initiatives would presumably be overshadowed by the thrust U.S. -
Cuban diplomatic relations.
Both Sides Take Hard Line
        Pressured by anti-Castro Cubans in the United States, President
Clinton is highly unlikely to soften the U.S. stance toward Cuba in the
runup to the Nov. 1996 U.S. presidential elections, Gelb points out. But,
for reasons of its own, the Castro administration isn't particularly eager
to see sanctions lifted now, either.
        Despite a 40% plunge of the Cuban economy after the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and a desperate need for U.S. investment, Castro seems to
fear that the end of the embargo also might mean an end to his regime.
Cubans could become further disillusioned with their president if they
conclude that domestic problems typically blamed on the embargo persist
after it is lifted.
        "My sense is that Fidel Castro is not interested in the next year
or two in making any significant concession to the United States," Gelb
says.
        Gelb advocates gradually lifting the embargo, to avoid shocking the
Cuban economy, and calls for increased diplomacy via U.S.-Cuban military
contacts and a strengthening of the trend to encourage U.S. NGOs to operate
in Cuba.
        But he doesn't think the present situation can last too long,
partly because of the great pressure of an alluring American society 90
miles away.
        "I don't think the situation is long-term stable," Gelb says. Cuba
has begun to grow again, but the 2.5% growth expected this year--perhaps 4%
later on if the sugar harvest is good--is far too slow to be meaningful
after a tumble that was far worse than the United States suffered during
the Great Depression.
        "I just don't think the Cuban situation will continue to evolve
peacefully," he says. He reports that Cuban officials are "very concerned"
about how to create a transition from the rule of Castro, who doesn't want
to leave. Under one scenario, the Cuban military could end up disbanding,
Miami Cubans could return en masse, and the island could find itself thrust
into a civil war.

NY FED'S E-MARKETS CHIEF: IT'S NOT A CRACKDOWN

The New York Fed's new emerging markets group will be strongly
focused on information gathering and policy recommendation--and wasn't
created to crack down on emerging markets banking and financial practices,
the chief of the effort stresses.
        "I'm not supposed to blow the whistle. I'm not supposed to smack
people in the fingers," says Terrence Checki, who last week was named to
the new post of executive vice president of emerging markets.
        Checki, 50, becomes the New York Fed's eighth executive vp. The job
is intended to consolidate various pieces of emerging markets research and
supervision that had been scattered across different departments, he says.
His top priority, he adds, is to be sure Fed policymakers know what's going
on.
        While it seems logical to take such a step after the solution to
Mexico's Dec. 1994 peso crisis landed squarely and expensively on the U.S.
government's doorstep, and the Daiwa Bank trading loss debacle appeared to
catch the New York Fed failing to act on information it had for years, Fed
officials said creation of the group was neither expressly the result of
these issues, nor a signal of stepped-up or changing regulatory practices.
"We're not doing anything now that we haven't done before," Checki said.
        Checki, whose former title was senior vice president in charge of
international banking supervision, has long been the New York Fed's LDC
expert, working closely with both banks and Latin countries during the LDC
debt crisis in the 1980s, functioning as ex-NY Fed chief Gerald Corrigan's
top international troubleshooter and then taking on the same role for
current NY Fed chief William McDonough.
         But Checki doesn't see his role as limited to U.S. commercial or
foreign bank supervision. Instead, he expects to maintain information ties
with all of the players and influences driving emerging markets--keeping
informed about the initiatives of investment banks and funds, tracking
political, economic and financial trends, and consulting with other central
banks.
         His priority is to get emerging markets information to McDonough,
preferably "before it emerges," and make policy recommendations, he says.
        The way to prevent the a new LDC debt crisis is to secure better
economic information from third world counties, Checki says, echoing the
majority consensus put forth by U.S. policymakers and market players in the
wake of the Mexican crisis.
         "I think we need to see that the information is as available as
possible to as many users as we can," he says. While he believes that the
IMF "should not be in the business of assembling information for the
private sector," he does think the Fund has an important role to play in
making sure good financial information is procured from borrowing
countries.
        His advice to those thinking of participating in emerging markets
for the first time: "Tell them to be sure of their ability to swim," he
says, "and to understand how deep the water is."--Mary D'Ambrosio

TELEBRAS RATED TO SOVEREIGN CEILING

Moody's has assigned an initial B1 rating to Brazil's
Telecomunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras). About $720 million worth of debt
securities are affected. The rating is constrained by the Republic's B1
sovereign ceiling.
        The agency says Telebras needs to raise significant funds, reduce
overhead and adjust its rates as it loses its virtual reign as the monopoly
provider of Brazil's telecommunications service.
        Moody's believes, however, that the Brazilian government will
establish a new regulatory and pricing framework to adjust Telebras's rate
structure so the rates become closer to the costs of providing services,
enabling Telebras to compete more effectively in the new environment.
Chilgener Rated Baa1
        Moody's has assigned a Baa1 to Chilgener of Chile, at the sovereign
ceiling. The rating will apply to the company's $150 million Yankee.

CALDERA MAY FACE VIOLENCE; CHINA TIED TO DENG'S FATE

Venezuelan President Rafael Caldera faces the increased threat of
political violence and a military coup if he accepts IMF conditions, and
the country may emerge with a center-left government in the 1998 elections.
China's business climate is threatened by a weak central government and
political uncertainty as Deng Xiaoping's death nears. In Ecuador, a
sluggish economy and a divided congress mean May 1996 elections are
unlikely to usher in economic improvements.
        Those are some of the conclusions that the Syracuse, New York
analytical firm Political Risk Services presents in its January forecast.
        Romanian President Ion Iliescu's supporters are unlikely to win a
majority in September's Parliament elections. But both Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori are seen as secure in
their positions.
        Venezuela's considerable problems remain due to an overdependence
on oil exports and a lack of fiscal discipline, in the opinion of these
analysts, in a climate of high inflation and no growth. Inflation is
projected to climb to 75% in 1996, from 46.9% last year. Caldera's populist
stance is not making the country's situation easier either, and leftist
Causa R may benefit in the 1998 elections. Causa R's presidential candidate
Andres Velasquez finished second to Caldera in 1993.
        In China, despite some forms of private enterprise, there is much
concern over the business climate. Some government groups are discussing
the removal of foreign tax breaks. Another potential problem is the growing
aggressiveness of the Chinese military in the South China Sea. Pressure
from the U.S. over the status of Taiwan and Hong Kong, trade policy and
human rights could also threaten foreign businesses, analysts say.
        In Ecuador, prospects are slim that President Sixto  Ballen's
administration can implement necessary economic reforms to stimulate the
economy. GDP growth is expected to fall to 1.8% in 1996 after reaching 3.6%
this year.
        The economy is also at risk because of increased violence and the
threat of a military coup. But the May 1996 elections are unlikely to
result in a regime any more capable of improving the economy.
        Romania's Iliescu is favored to win September's presidential
elections, but his supporters are unlikely to win a parliamentary majority.
Despite opposition, Iliescu remains popular as he moves the economy towards
integration with the EU.
        Budget cuts and market reforms are being implemented to qualify for
assistance from the IMF and the EU, but not enough to greatly improve the
business climate. But, inflation is projected to fall dramatically to 28%
in 1996 from 161.5% last year and GDP growth is expected to rise to 4% this
year from 3.6% shrinkage in 1995.
        In Egypt, Mubarek's willingness to use force, mixed with political
liberalization, has kept the opposition off balance and solidified his
control in Egypt. Some progress has been made in reducing foreign debt,
controlling inflation and stimulating economic growth,but essential
privatizations have yet to occur.
        Peru's Fujimori also shows no signs of losing control, standing
high in public opinion polls. Peru's economy is healthy by South American
standards, and Fujimori presided over the country's debt-restructuring
deal. A question for the long term is finding a presidential successor.

LEGAL NOTES

Legal Notes is prepared by James Leavy and M. Cecilia Gaviria of Serra
Michaud & Associes, Paris based on information produced by law firms from
Latin America. This is part one of their monthly report. Part two will
appear next week.
Brazil
Measures to strengthen the financial system
The government and the Central Bank have adopted a series of measures to
support the financial system, parts of which have come under strain as
Brazil moves to a low-inflation monetary system.
a) PROER
A package of measures concerns a special program created by the Central
Bank and known as PROER (Program for Encouraging the Restructuring and
Strengthening of the National Financial System).
Created by Resolution 2208 of the Central Bank, PROER consists of the
following major elements:
i) a special line of financial assistance linked to securities or other
operations of the National Treasury or Federal Government entities, to
losses arising in the process of reorganization of financial institutions,
to the costs of restructuring and modernizing operational systems and to
mobilization of assets of the participating institutions. (Circular 2636 of
the Central Bank sets out the principal conditions applicable to operations
using this financial line);
ii) availability of resources arising from compulsory deposits or
contributions, linked to acquisition of bank CDs issued by entities
participating in PROER;
iii) greater flexibility in reaching operational limits required of
financial institutions;
iv) deferment of costs related to restructuring and modernizing of
financial institutions.
In connection with this program the Government adopted a provisional
measure providing for several tax concessions to entities taking part in
PROER, including the following:
a) where an entity is incorporated to take over a failing institution, it
may treat the institution's difficult loans as losses ("difficult loans"
are defined in Resolution  2210 of the Central Bank);
b) the incorporating entities may treat as a financial cost, the difference
between the purchase price of their investment and the book value of their
interest in the acquired entity;
c) for tax purposes, the losses described in a) and amortized costs
described in b) (up to a limit each year together with tax losses carried
forward from previous years, of 30% of gross profits) can be offset against
gross profits.
Central Bank Circular 2633 specifies that access to the PROER program will
be decided on by the Central Bank on a case-by-case basis and is limited to
recognized financial institutions which acquire the control of another such
institution or whose control passes to such institution or which assume the
rights and/or obligations of such an institution. The Circular specifies
that admission to PROER does not diminish any criminal or other liability
which the directors of an entity taken over might otherwise have.
b) Other Measures
Provisional Measure 1.182 applies the rules of existing legislation on
quarantine of property ("indisponibilidade de bens") to that of the persons
controlling a financial institution which is the subject of intervention,
liquidation or temporary special administration. It authorizes the Central
Bank to take special measures such as injecting additional capital,
transferring control or corporate restructuring for the purpose of
safeguarding the public interest (including the interests of depositors)
where a financial institution is in serious difficulty. It sets out the
types of measures which can be taken with the prior authorization of the
Central Bank when a financial institution is subject to intervention,
liquidation, as well as the measures which can be taken in respect of the
directors of the affected institution.
Resolution 2.212 of the Central Bank strengthens the capital adequacy and
prudential requirements of financial institutions, particularly in the
context of a change in the control of such institutions.
Resolution 2.211 of the Central Bank approves the by-laws and regulations
of the Credit Guarantee Fund, which is designed to guarantee deposits and
other credits against financial institutions in case of bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar situations. Financial institutions contribute monthly
to the Fund an amount equal to 0.025% of the balance of accounts guaranteed
by the Fund.

Colombia
Privatization legislation
Following a decision of the Constitutional Court, Congress has adopted
legislation to regulate article 60 of the national constitution and thus
provide a general legal framework for privatizations. The new legislation
provides that privatizations must be carried out in accordance with a
program approved the Finance Ministry and the relevant Ministry to which
the respective entity is attached, which program must be notified to
Congress.
Each privatization must be carried out in a context which permits wide
dispersion of share ownership, protection of public resources and (where
applicable) continuity of the public service which is provided by the
privatized entity.
Current and former employees of the entity would be given preferred status
in the allocation of shares, as would, labor unions, employee pension
funds, investment funds and similar entities.
Shares in the relevant entity must be offered at a price which reflects the
valuation carried out under the authority of the relevant ministry. Offers
can only be made when arrangements have been put in place to enable those
having preferred allocation rights to exercise those rights, including
special lines of credit (minimum term 5 years: security interest on shares
being purchased). Those receiving preferred share allocations may be
required to retain their shares for up to 2 years and limits may be placed
on the amount of shares allocated to senior management of the entity
immediately prior to privatization.
The new legislation specifies that privatizations of financial institutions
are subject to the special legislation governing the financial sector and
that no privatizations of certain entities in which the State telecom
company has an interest may be carried out before Jan. 1, 1998.
(Source: Vincent Trevisani, Cavelier Abogados, Santafe de Bogot )
Mexico
Adjustments to financial institutions legislation
A recent congressional decree has made some adjustments to the legislation
governing banks, securities markets, insurance and guarantee companies and
specialized financial institutions. Among the changes are the following:
i) provision is made so that the shares held by foreign financial
institutions or insurers in their Mexican subsidiaries are clearly
identified. At least 51% of the shares in the subsidiary must be held in a
special category reserved to the foreign controlling entity (or its holding
subsidiary). Those shares can only be disposed of with the prior
authorization of the Finance Ministry;
ii) the limits on individual holdings of shares in insurance or guarantee
companies can be exceeded where such a company is being converted into a
local subsidiary of a foreign entity;
iii) financial institutions must establish systems for dealing with clients
inquiries and complaints and a system of arbitration is provided for before
the National Banking and Securities Commission where a dispute persists
between a financial institution and its client;
iv) special provision is made for recovery of claims owed to the national
government and generally for carrying out treasury activities in respect of
assets held by or belonging to the national government, including funds and
securities.

SOVEREIGN FUND SEES VALUE IN VENEZUELA AND BULGARIA

Diego Aramburu, manager of Atlantic Security Bank's Atlantic Sovereign
Fund, thinks Venezuelan and Bulgarian bonds will help him build on the
23.06% gain the $26 million fund achieved last year.
        The Cayman Island-registered fund, held by the offshore securities
arm of Banco Credito de Peru, performed slightly behind the J.P. Morgan
Emerging Markets Bond Index Plus, which returned 26.78% in 1995. But
Micropal ranked the fund third out of 23 Latin American regional debt funds
through last November.
         The fund is 100% emerging markets debt, and Aramburu, who invests
mostly in Bradys and some sovereign Eurobonds for yield and liquidity,
touts bonds of Venezuela and Bulgaria as values this year.
        "We understand the risks in Venezuela. We think there are
fundamental changes in the policy that will make Venezuela attractive,"
says Aramburu, who works out of Lima and Miami. Though he is critical of
President Rafael Caldera's populist stance, he supports the government's
recent devaluation and thinks an IMF deal is coming soon.  He is also
counting on banking, social and tax reforms to cut the fiscal deficit.
Gasoline price hikes are also likely as part of an IMF deal, but the fund
manager differs from many analysts in believing that social unrest will not
result. "The population is understanding better that some measures need to
be taken. They are going in the right direction," says Aramburu.  But he
predicts that Caldera won't be reelected in 1998.
        Aramburu recently bought options on Venezuelan DCBs, bringing the
portfolio's Venezuelan holdings to 5%. "The fact is the market gave us
relative value with those," he says.
        Aramburu also argues that Bulgarian Bradys, which make up 10% of
the fund, are undervalued compared with Poland's. "There is not a big
difference between those countries," he insists. "Bulgaria's financial
numbers are not the best, but they are improving." Aramburu thinks
Bulgarian IABs, yielding around 14%, are one of the most undervalued
instruments available today.
        The remainder of the fund's portfolio includes a heavy 10% position
in Peru, a standard 25% stake in Brazil, 15% holdings in each Argentina and
Mexico, 7% holdings in Nigeria and small positions in other Latin
countries, such as Guatemala and the Dominican Republic.
        The fund started in Oct. 1994 when the company merged the bank's
Latin and Growth funds. Aramburu had established the Latin Fund in 1990,
shortly after joining the bank, and set up the Growth Fund two years later.
But, "both funds had similar objectives so it didn't make sense to have the
two separate," he says.
         Fund products cannot be sold in the U.S. The Sovereign Fund pays
dividends twice a year equal to six-month Libor + 1% of the value of the
purchase price of the fund's shares. Latin American private investors are
the typical clients,  and they purchase shares with a minimum investment of
$50,000.
        Aramburu, 34, is a total return investor who uses bottom-up
fundamental analysis when making investment decisions. He also follows
political situations closely, but acknowledges his worst mistakes have been
those made primarily based on news from various newspapers around the
globe.
        "The political part of analysis is very difficult to quantify, and
we are very much interested in quantification," says Aramburu, who holds a
Ph.D. in international economics from the University of Miami. Aramburu
follows a model that establishes a relationship between the values of
assets against a country's fundamentals.
        Aramburu generally holds assets for at least three months, but
trades part of the portfolio heavily once a month to find high yields. The
fund is now fully invested, compared to the 40% cash it held at the
beginning of 1995.
         Aramburu maintains a 25% stake in Brazilian holdings because he
finds excellent values among DCBs, Exits and EI's.
        Argentine FRBs and discounts make up the bulk of the 15% Argentina
position. Aramburu says Argentina is being unfairly correlated with pre-
peso devaluation Mexico; he thinks the country's stronger export sector and
reserve position leave it in superior shape. Aramburu expects Mexico to
struggle mightily during the first half as fourth quarter 1995 numbers are
released, but foresees improvements later in 1996.              One country
he won't invest in is Russia, despite the $32 billion debt rescheduling
agreement. "The problem with Russia is the lack of financial numbers," he
says. "It's like investing in a company that you don't have the financials
for. I still don't have a grasp on what Russia's numbers are. --Dan B.

BRAZIL BUYBACK TALK STOKES LDCS

The LDC debt market gained for the second straight week, despite
concerns over the U.S. budget negotiations, rising about one point on the
week to Thursday. Brazil led a spirited rally last Thursday on strong
rumors that it will soon conduct a two-step buyback worth $300 million of
debt owed to it by Paraguay. Brazilian locals were active in the buying as
well as a U.S. insurance company, which purchased $150 million worth of
Brazilian C-bonds, pars and EI's, according to a New York trader. C-bonds
gained two points to 61 3/8 bid, 61 5/8 offered, while IDU's were up almost
a point to 87 1/8 bid, 87 1/2 offered.
        The market traded up early last week, before halting last Tuesday
when the U.S. budget negotiations bogged down again. But the market rallied
later in the week and stopped following the long bond down. The long bond
then rallied last Thursday afternoon following President Clinton's news
conference to yield 6.15%. "The emerging markets are short of treading
water watching the U.S. budget discussions, but the underlying bid is still
strong," says the trader, noting how new money continues entering the
market.
        Mexican issues were mixed. Discounts gained almost one point to 74
bid, 74 1/4 offered, while pars lost 1/2 to 66 1/8 bid, 66 3/4 offered.
        Argentine issues were flat. FRBs were unchanged at 72 3/8 bid, 72
5/8 offered, while pars lost about 1/2 a point to 56 3/8 bid, 56 5/8
offered. Venezuelan issues held firm as the market watches the country
resume discussions with the IMF this week. Pars were flat at 58 1/8 bid, 58
3/8 offered, as were DCBs at 57 1/4 bid, 57 1/2 offered.
        Exotics, big gainers two weeks ago, were flat last week. Nigeria
par bonds fell one point to 51 bid, 51 1/2 offered, while Morocco tranche A
was off half a point to 67 3/8 bid, 67 3/4 offered. Vneshekonombank dollar
loans lost almost 3/4 of a point to 34 3/8 bid, 34 7/8 offered.

Modern, which increased its Euro with a 144A option to $125 million last
week. ELM's three-year deal, joint led by ING and J.P. Morgan, was
oversubscribed two to one and enlarged from $100 million. ELM was to launch
the deal last November but backed out due to a difficult market
environment. That was not the case this time, though, as the bonds,
carrying an 11.38% coupon, were equally distributed in the U.S., Asia and
Europe.
        "The deal went real well. We bought $10 million worth of bonds,"
says Steven C. Merrell, manager of IDS' Special Income Fund. "It was
relatively attractive in relation to other things offered in Mexico and is
well priced and valued."
        Merrell was one of many investors who turned away from the ELM
issue last November as the Mexican peso swooned, but was lured back by the
changing sentiment towards Mexico.
Nafinsa Gets Aggressive
        Mexico's Nacional Financiera launched a $100 million Euro via
Salomon Brothers that some market insiders considered too expensive and
aggressive. The three-year notes carried a 9% coupon for a spread of 375 bp
over U.S. Treasuries. The deal, which carries a 144A option, was popular
with European retail investors, but some in the U.S. were not impressed.
        "I think it's expensive for the investor. You can get Nafinsa paper
with the same spread for shorter maturities," says one.
Argentina Weighs Yen
        Argentina, fresh off of a DM 500 million ($347.8 million) deal two
weeks ago, is receiving bids for another issue, and may launch a
substantial yen deal this week, according to a yen source. "They've
received a number of different structures, but a yen deal looks good," the
source says. Argentina may launch either a five-year, 50 billion ($476.8
million) deal with a 6% coupon or a three-year, 30 billion yen ($286
million) issue with a 4.5% coupon, the source says. Nomura, Daiwa and Nikko
are in the running.
        But Argentina may instead issue in Italian lira again to get a
bigger deal, according to the source. Argentina issued a 150 billion lira
($93.1 million) Euro last September and may want to continue diversifying
again.
Colombia Dusts Off Yankee
        Colombia's 20-year Yankee issue lead-managed by Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs is expected to launch in the next three weeks, according to
market sources. Yield-hungry investors are said to have made the deal,
shelved last November, possible again. The issue may contain two tranches--
seven- and 20-years. Neither Merrill Lynch nor Goldman Sachs officials
would comment.
Chilgener Takes $150M Deal To Road
        Roadshows for Chilgener's $150 million Yankee begin today in New
York (weather permitting) and end in California later in the week. Lead
manager Smith Barney, and co-managers Chase Manhattan and ING Baring are
marketing the 10-year notes for Chile's second largest electric generator
to high grade funds, but few emerging market accounts, according to a
syndicate source. Price talk is not available, but a source says it will be
similar to the 7% that Celulosa Arauco's $300 million Yankee carried last
December. "Chilgener is a better credit than Celulosa Arauco. It is better
rated and is a utility while Celulosa is in the forestry industry," the
syndicate source says.
Brazilian Samurai Mandate Expected
        Brazil is expected to award a mandate for a Samurai bond worth 30
billion yen ($286 million). Nomura has been rumored to be named lead, but
yen sources say it may not be a done deal. "Nomura has been backing off,"
says one. "I think they believe their relationship with Brazil will be
enough to get them the deal." The issue is expected to be for five years
with a coupon of between 6% and 6.25% and may launch at the end of
February.
BBA Leads Brazilian Banks
        Banco BBA Creditanstalt is expected to launch a DM 100 million
($69.5 million) issue for three years this week via Banque Paribas. The
deal is expected to carry an 8.63% coupon for a yield of 470 bp over the
bund.
        Other Brazilian banks, including Banco Safra and Banco Bamerindus,
are expected to launch deals before the month is out. Safra is planning a
Eurobond, while Bamerindus is planning a Deutschemark issue via CS First
Boston, market sources say.
Telebras Set To Dial Italy
        Telecommunicacoes Brasileiras (Telebras) is expected to launch a
300 billion lira ($189.9 million) deal via J.P. Morgan this week. The
issue, expected to carry a coupon of between 13.25% and 13.50%, may be
increased to 400 billion lira ($253.2 million) due to positive responses by
potential investors, market sources say.
Japanese Brave Refah Threat
        Despite the possibility of a Muslim-led government in Turkey, some
Japanese investors have a strong thirst for Turkish paper. Turkey launched
a 10 billion yen ($95.4 million) deal via Yamaichi last week. The 10-year
notes sold at par with a 7.2% coupon and were purchased by Japanese
institutional investors and financial institutions. "This issue was driven
by a specific demand by a series of investors," says a Yamaichi source.
Turkey raised $493 million last December with a three-year 50 billion yen
deal led by Nomura Securities. Turkish officials are now contemplating
issuing more bonds in other currencies.--Dan B. Levine

CLARIFICATION

A story about the emerging market business on Dec. 18 left out
phrases in several statements by Bank of Boston Managing Director Ignacio
Sosa.
        Sosa said that "Whatever we did previously in emerging markets
sales and trading has absolutely no relationship to where we are going. He
added that the bank's focus "on the new issue side will be on corporates,
that is one difference in relation to our competitors who focus on
sovereigns."

IFC GETTING OUT OF BANKERS' YARD

WASHINGTON
Commercial banks are applauding the new guidelines
adopted by the International Finance Corp. designed to keep the World
Bank's private finance arm out of areas that could be handled by the
private sector. However, in a report by the Institute for International
Finance reviewing
the IFC changes, the banks cautioned that there are areas where the IFC
needs to be more clear about its efforts to avoid displacing private banks.
        The banks expressed concern about the IFC continuing to participate
in financing in countries that would have no trouble attracting private
sources, and should have been graduated from the IFC program by now, among
them Chile, Colombia, Turkey and Thailand.
        The IFC has left this "graduation" up to private banks, and has not
set a clear criteria for staff to judge whether a company or country should
be treated as off limits. Often companies that have a long-standing
relationship with the IFC are inclined to return there in the future, even
when they could find private capital sources.
        In these cases, the IFC should only become involved in exceptional
circumstances, and limit participation to countries that could not
otherwise find financing, the report stated, although it added the proviso
that a country's graduation should be reversible, so that the IFC could re-
enter if needed.
        "In Latin America and Asia the private sector is capable of doing
the job, if not single-handedly, than at least predominantly," while there
is much more need for the IFC in Africa, said Donald McCouch, group
executive of Chemical Bank, who participated in preparing the report.
However, McCouch said the IFC should be given credit for trying to adapt to
a changing world.
        The IIF report, which focuses on nine areas of the new IFC
guidelines, in general was in favor of the changes. "We believe the IFC is
taking important steps towards increasing its effectiveness and increasing
its ability to catalyze private finance for developing countries," said
Charles Dallara, managing director of the IIF.
        "It will help focus the efforts on places where it is most needed,
and greatly reduces if not eliminates the displacement of private sector,"
Dallara told reporters, adding that scarce IFC resources should not be used
on a project that could be financed wholly with private funds.
        The report also recommended the IFC limit its activities in
securities underwriting and equity participation to exceptional cases where
it is clear the transaction would not be completed without IFC
participation.
        The value of IFC participation in underwriting international issues
has been limited, since it has worked with well-known companies in
developing countries that could have been underwritten by private
investment banks. However, IFC has scaled back its operations in this area.
        There also were concerns about a conflict of interest when the IFC
acts as a lender, particularly in a B-loan syndication, in a company in
which it has equity interest.
        The report praised the IFC for deciding to refrain from competing
in bidding for privatization advisory mandates, but said the IFC should
continue to scale back its advisory operations, and stay out of any bidding
for such programs. It should concentrate on establishing regulatory
environments necessary for privatization, model privatization transactions
in countries like Russia and the Ukraine, and focus on those where there is
negligible private sector interest, such as Haiti.
        Bankers stressed that in no instance should the IFC link financial
support to obtaining the advisory mandates, which Dallara said he has seen
happen many times in the past.
        The report also recommended the IFC increase its use of guarantees
to leverage private financing, continue its efforts to diversity sources of
co-financing for B-loan syndications, use private sources more for
appraising, arranging and managing project financing, and put in place an
appeals procedure for institutions concerned about displacement.

PEOPLE

The next two weeks will be nervewracking for Chemical Bank and
Chase Manhattan emerging markets division employees,  as Chemical/Chase co-
emerging markets heads Daniel Canel and Jorge V. Jasson are expected to
eliminate some duplicate jobs. "The additional cuts are probably going to
come at the end of the month," says a Chase insider.
        Canel and Jasson named 13 top managers last month for the new
capital markets division: seven from Chase and six from Chemical. Chase
head Brady trader George P. Grunebaum and Chemical managing director Raul
Ponte become head traders in the U.S., while Barry J. Hoffner and Brian C.
Lazell, each of Chemical, hold the same positions in London. Chase research
head Lawrence J. Brainard maintains the same position in the consolidated
group, with Chemical research chief Thomas J. Trebat as deputy. Chase head
of syndication Cynthia Powell also keeps her spot, Chase's Federico L.
Amadeo is responsible for Latin America origination and Chemical's Gabriel
G. Politzer will cover Latin America local markets and external debt.
        Also, Chase's John P. Colligan has been tapped to handle U.S.
sales, while Chase's Gustavo M. Dominguez is responsible for derivatives,
structured products and arbitrage. Rounding out the appointments are
Chemical's Anette L. Kolenda, named business manager, and Chase's Rachelle
C. Keller, who was selected as Kolenda's deputy.
        Noticeably absent from the list is Chemical syndication head Juan
Lacroze, who helped engineer Mexico's $1.5 billion Eurobond last December.
Lacroze is remaining with the new Chase--just not in the syndication
department. But his new role has not been announced.

COMMISSION INVITES COMMENT SECOND BANKING DIRECTIVE

THE DECEMBER issue of European Banker, in the article Freedom or
fallacy?, discussed some aspects of the Commission communication on
interpretation of the Second Banking Directive, highlighting different
Member State interpretations of the Directive and quoting some initial
reactions to the communication by national banking associations. EU
Financial Industry Monitor readers may be interested in more details on
this text of major importance.

The Commission published its text, strictly speaking a Draft
Communication entitled "Freedom to provide services and the interest of
the general good in the Second Banking Directive", in the Official
Journal No C 291 of 4.11.95.

An introductory passage states that the Draft is "the Commission's
contribution to the discussions under way on the problems associated
with freedom to provide services and the interest of the general good"
under the Second Directive. It points out that the discussions have so
far been restricted to the Member States in the Banking Advisory Group
and the Working Party on the Interpretation of the Banking Directives.

The Commission, however, "takes the view that the broadest possible
consultation should be held on its interpretative work" and so invites
interested parties to submit comments on the Draft by 4.3.96. After
consideration of any such comments, the Draft will, if appropriate,
become a Commission interpretative communication which will give banks
an idea of how the Commission will view particular problems brought to
its attention.

This is a most unusual step. First of all, it is very rare for the
Commission to issue interpretative communications on directives. It has
done so in the case of several of its own regulations, for example in
the competition policy field, but very seldom in the case of Council
directives since they have to be implemented through national law.

Secondly, although the Commission has certainly consulted interested
parties in the past on the interpretation of EU legislation, it has
never published a draft interpretative document with an invitation to
the world to comment on its intended interpretation.

The reason for taking this unusual step is very honestly stated in the
introduction to the Draft Communication:

"In the course of its contacts with numerous economic operators, the
Commission has come to realise that continuing uncertainty with regard
to the interpretation of basic concepts, such as freedom to provide
services and the interest of the general good, has seriously undermined
the workings of the machinery set up by the Second Directive and is
such as to deter certain credit institutions from exercising the very
freedoms which the Second Directive sets out to promote."

It is also worth emphasising that this Draft Communication may be only
the first in a series. The Commission has tipped off the specialised EU
press that it considers it premature to issue such Drafts for the
"third generation" insurance directives and the Investment Services
Directive but that it is already reflecting on the problems of
interpretation of these measures and is committed to the coherence of
the positions adopted for all financial services.

This is hardly surprising, given the great reluctance of certain Member
States to open up their insurance and securities markets to services
provided cross-frontier and their alleged use of the general good
provisions of directives to make life difficult for institutions from
other Member States.

The Commission's approach

Only the European Court of Justice can give a final, definitive
interpretation of EU law. The Commission, therefore, makes it clear in
its Draft Communication that the contents are without prejudice to any
European Court of Justice interpretation of the Second Banking
Directive.

What the Commission has done is to restate the principles laid down by
the Court of Justice in giving judgment in cases involving the freedom
to provide services and the interest of the general good in other areas
of EU law and to examine the application of these principles to the
Second Banking Directive.

In a key passage which is implicitly revelatory of the restrictive
position of some Member States, the Commission states that its
interpretations of the Directive "do not necessarily represent the
views of the Member States" but then makes a threat:

"However, in accordance with its duties as guardian of the Treaty
reserves the right to exercise the powers vested in it by the Treaty
(Article 169)."

In other words, the Commission is warning the Member States that,
although they may not agree with how it interprets the Directive, if
they go against that interpretation the Commission will not hesitate to
start Treaty infringement proceedings against them. The Draft
Communication takes up thirteen-and-a-half Official Journal pages and
is both discursive and legalistic.

Freedom to provide services

Under the single licence system, a bank authorised in a Member State is
entitled to provide services without an establishment in any other
Member States after going through the sole formality of notifying its
home Member State regulatory authorities of its intention to do this.

The Commission's Draft Communication addresses:

1) the services covered by the Directive, 2) commencement of the
provision of services.

The first of these is sub-divided into: a) nature of services; b) forms
of provision of services; c) provision of services; and d) nature of
the notification.

Nature of services

Article 20(1) of the Second Banking Directive states that:

"Any credit institution wishing to exercise the freedom to provide
services by carrying on its activities within the territory of another
Member State for the first time shall notify the competent authorities
of the home Member State of the activities on the list in the Annex
which it intends to carry on."

This makes it clear that only the "core banking activities" listed in
the Annex to the Second Banking Directive are covered by the freedom to
provide services. It is equally clear that the notification procedure
only applies where services are to be provided for the first time.
Article 23(2) of the Directive explicitly states that rights acquired
by credit institutions which provided services before the Directive
came into force are not affected.

The Draft Notice then examines the questions of: 1) whether the fact
that an activity has only been carried on once or a few times be
considered enough to confer acquired rights; and 2) how far back in
time should one go to find evidence of past activity.

For the Commission it would be "absurd to set a quantitative limit . .
institution has acquired rights if it provided a service at least once
in another Member State, regardless of when. However, the Commission
adds that:

1) this activity must have been carried on lawfully, that is, in
conformity with the law in force in the host Member State at the time;
and

2) the institution must be able to provide, if necessary, evidence of
its past activity.

It also adds that institutions with acquired rights cannot be subjected
by their home Member State authorities to more onerous procedures than
were applied before the Second Directive came into effect. For example,
they will not have to notify the authorities of their intention to
continue providing the services under Second Directive terms. The
notification procedure only applies to services to be supplied for the
first time.

Forms of provision of services

Article 20(1) of the Directives requires notification for services to
be provided "within the territory of another Member State". On the
basis of European Court of Justice interpretation of the Treaty
provisions on freedom to provide services, the Commission Draft
Communication addresses the provision of services when there is
"movement" and also addresses rules on advertising.

The bank providing a service may move, in the sense that staff may go
to the other Member State for the purposes of providing the service.
The Commission considers that this situation is "undoubtedly" covered
by freedom to provide services.

Conversely, the receiver of the service may be the person to move, that
is, he/she comes to the Member State where a credit institution is
established without this being the result of canvassing by the
institution. No notification to the home Member State authorities is
required in that situation.

Nevertheless, an institution which before the Second Banking Directive
came into effect and only provided services to clients from other
Member States in that way, would have to notify if it intends to start
seeking new clients through canvassing in other Member States or by
travelling to them.

The third situation is where the service itself moves, that is, where
the service is provided by post or by modern communication method such
as telephone, fax, telex, electronic mail. In this case, the Commission
makes a distinction between whether the service is provided at the
customer's initiative or whether it follows canvassing by the credit
institution. In the first case, the institution is exempt from
notification but, in the second, the canvassing is proof of an
intention to provide a service in another Member State and notification
is, therefore, necessary.

It follows that the notification procedure should be completed before
the credit institution and its customers establish "commercial
relations". The Draft Communication points out that, where a credit
institution subsequently wishes to offer services not covered by its
initial notification, an additional notification would have to be made
first.

Advertising in another Member State

When does advertising amount to an intention to provide services in
another Member State and so create the obligation to notify? The
Commission's starting point is that:

"It is only where, by its very nature, the advertisement constitutes
commercial canvassing, ranking as an actual invitation, issued at a
distance, to enter into a contract, or where it precedes a physical
journey by the supplier, that it constitutes an intention to provide a
service within the territory of another Member State, within the
meaning of Article 20."

Two scenarios then arise. The first is where the bank which places an
advertisement does not intend to go subsequently to the consumer's
Member State of residence. In this case, the Commission considers that
notification of the intention to advertise is required when two
conditions are both met:

1) the advertisement contains sufficient information for the consumer
to make up his mind (for example, interest rate, duration, cost); and
2) the contract can be concluded at a distance, that is, by reply slip,
letter, telephone etc, without the bank and the customer having to
meet. If, however, the contract cannot be concluded without the
consumer going to the Member State where the bank is established,
notification is not required.

The second scenario is where the bank intends to go to the consumer's
Member State of residence to conclude a contract for a service which
has been advertised. Notification is required in this case. There may
be difficulties of classification. The Draft Communication takes the
example of advertisements in Europe-wide publications or TV channels.
The Commission considers that notification would only be necessary if
such an advertisement were directed at a specific Member State, for
example, if it appeared in a national edition of an international
newspaper.

Provision of services compared to establishment

The case law of the European Court of Justice makes a clear
distinction. When a service is provided in a host Member State, the
presence there is temporary. Establishment, in contrast, implies the
existence of permanent premises in the host Member State.

The Court has also ruled that, in the case of an activity carried out
temporarily but frequently, the Member States may apply their rules for
institutions which are established there if an institution invokes the
freedom to provide services abusively, so as to avoid the local rules
for established institutions.

The Draft Notice then considers some cases where it is difficult to
draw the line between provision of services and establishment -
electronic machines, recourse to independent intermediaries and the
permanent presence of the institution's own staff in another Member
State.

Electronic machines

Electronic machines capable of performing Second Directive core banking
activities may be covered by the concept of establishment.

A machine is unlikely to be a credit institution's only place of
business in another Member State. In the normal course of events, a
machine would be attached to a branch, agency or some other form of
establishment and so would not be "an entity in its own right". As a
result, it would be subject to the rules applicable to the
establishment to which it is attached.

In the unlikely event of an electronic machine being a credit
institution's sole presence in another Member States, then, in the
Commission's view, the machine would be deemed to be a provider of
services. As such, it would have to be notified, subject to the "first
time" rules already described.

As a provider of services, a machine would be subject to the general
good rules of the host country. In that respect, the Draft
Communication gives as an example the need for a machine to show a
telephone number in the host country.

Independent intermediaries

In its discussion of whether an intermediary used by a credit
institution to do business in another Member State is or is not to be
regarded as a permanent establishment, the Commission's Draft
Communication quotes extensively from the case law of the European
Court of Justice. It concludes that the links between a credit
institution and an independent intermediary in another Member State
amount to the institution having a branch in the second Member State
when the intermediary meets three cumulative criteria:

- he has received an exclusive brief from that credit institution and
from no other;

- he is empowered to negotiate on the credit institution's behalf and
to bind it;

- he operates on a permanent basis.

This raises the question of the intermediary who acts on behalf of more
than one credit institution and here the Commission distinguishes two
scenarios.

Where the intermediary acts exclusively for a group of credit
institutions which have jointly called on his services, all of them are
deemed to be established in the form of a branch, assuming that the
other criteria are met.

The other situation is where the intermediary acts for a number of
credit institutions which have not jointly called on his services. In
that case, the first of the branch criteria - receiving an exclusive
brief - is not met. Therefore, the instructing credit institutions are
not established in the second Member State and are providing a service
through an intermediary. Notification is required.

The Draft Communication then examines the situation in those Member
States which require intermediaries to be given mandates by the credit
institutions for which they act.

Without giving explicit answers, the Commission states that it would
have to examine the extent of the mandate, the credit institution's
ability to control the intermediary, the possibility for the
intermediary to commit the mandating credit institution.

Finally, the Draft Communication considers the situation where the
intermediary is itself a credit institution. If the intermediary offers
its customers the products of another credit institution, the latter
would have to notify its intention of exercising the freedom to provide
services in its intermediary's Member State unless, of course, it is
covered by the acquired rights provision.

If, on the other hand, the intermediary provides accommodation to a
branch of the other credit institution, there would have to be
notification of the intention to exercise the freedom of establishment.

Permanent presence of staff

Under this heading, there are two situations - either a credit
institution's staff in another Member State carry on a banking activity
or they do not.

If they do carry on a banking activity, they constitute a branch. Since
1.1.93, a branch start-up has required prior notification under the
Second Directive. If it was operational before that date with any
authorisation required by the host Member State's legislation, it
enjoys acquired rights under the Directive and so notification is not
required. If it was operational before that date but without the
necessary local authorisation, it requires notification as it had not
started operations "in accordance with the provisions in force in (its)
host Member State".

The presence in another Member State of a credit institution's staff
who do not carry on a banking activity - in other words a
representative office - does not, in the Commission view, constitute a
branch and so does not require notification. That does not, however,
prevent the host member State requiring the institution to inform it of
the opening of the office and to go through "a registration procedure
that would have to be a mere formality". The host member State would
also be at liberty to carry out "a simple, unsystematic check to
ascertain whether the office is not, in fact, engaged in banking
activities".

Nature of the notification

This is dealt with very simply in the Draft Communication. For the
Commission, the Second Directive's notification procedure:

"pursues a simple objective of exchange of information between
supervisory authorities and is not a consumer protection measure."

The Draft Communication continues by stating that notification cannot
be considered "a procedural condition underlying the validity of
banking contract". In other words, a bank which has not fulfilled a
notification requirement can be penalised for this failure but the
contracts it has entered into the second Member State cannot be
annulled on the grounds of non- notification.

In the Commission's view, that would be contrary to the Community law
principle of proportionality and would negatively affect the legal
certainty of contracts entered into in good faith.

Commencement of the provision of services

Article 20(2) of the Second Banking Directive states:

"The competent authorities of the home Member State shall, within one
month of receipt of the notification mentioned in paragraph 1, send
that notification to the competent authorities of the host Member
State."

The Draft Communication contrasts this provision on the freedom to
provide services with the corresponding provision on freedom of
establishment. The latter (Article 19(5) of the Directive) requires the
credit institution to wait for receipt by the branch of a
"communication" by the host Member State authorities.

In the absence of any such communication after a period of two months,
it can start operating. The Draft Communication points out that when
the proposed Directive was being examined in Council the idea of
applying that rule to both freedom of establishment and freedom to
provide services was rejected.

The Draft Communication continues: "In the Commission's opinion, the re-
introduction, by way of interpretation, of formalities which the Member
States did not wish to see in the definitive version of the text
adopted by the Council is neither desirable nor in keeping with the
spirit and letter of the Second Directive."

In other words, a credit institution can start exercising the freedom
to provide services in another Member State once it has notified its
intentions to its home Member State authorities, which have one month
in which to notify the host country authorities. The credit institution
may well ask the host country authorities to confirm receipt from the
home country authorities of the institution's notification but that
confirmation cannot be a prior condition for starting to provide
services. Making confirmation a pre-requisite "is unacceptable and
constitutes an infringement of the Second Directive".

The general good in the second banking directive

The general good part of the Draft Communication discusses firstly the
notification of conditions to be met in the interest of the general
good and, secondly, the applicability of rules adopted in the interest
of the general good.

Notification of conditions to be met in the interest of the general
good

This section of the Draft Commission discusses the interpretation of
Article 19(4) of the Second Directive which provides that:

"Before the branch of a credit institution commences its activities the
competent authorities of the host Member State shall, within two months
of receiving the information mentioned in paragraph 3, prepare for the
supervision of the credit institution in accordance with Article 21
and, if necessary, indicate the conditions under which, in the interest
of the general good, those activities must be carried on in the host
Member State."

It appears that uncertainty has arisen regarding the words "if
necessary". Some Member States have considered that this imposes an
obligation to indicate the general good conditions to a branch. Others
have read the words as merely giving an option or a "moral obligation".

The Commission considers that it is an option. Its principal reason for
stating this is that the text says nothing about the form and content
of notification of general good conditions. That being so, it would be
impossible to verify whether the "obligation" had been complied with.

In addition, there is no detailed, harmonised definition of "the
general good". It may vary from one Member State to another and may not
apply in the same areas in host and home Member States. Also, "there is
no way of knowing in advance what the credit institution wants to
obtain".

In conclusion, it is up to a credit institution which wishes to operate
in another Member State to establish the situation, either by its own
efforts or by asking the host Member State authorities.

Even if these authorities were to refuse to give the information, there
would be no breach of Community law, although any harm suffered might
be subject to a remedy under the national law.

Applicability of rules adopted in the interest of the general good

Services

The case law of the European Court of Justice has already laid down a
number of requirements on the national provisions which may be applied
to undertakings exercising the freedom to supply services. These must
not only be in the general good but also be:

- non-discriminatory;
- objectively necessary; and
- proportionate to the objective pursued.

In addition, the interest of the general good must not be safeguarded
by rules to which the service provider is already subject in the Member
State of establishment (non-duplication).

Finally, any restrictions on the grounds of the general good must be in
fields which are not the subject of EU-level harmonisation.
Harmonisation by Directive has already established what the Commission
calls the "Community general good". Thus, for example, national
measures on own funds, the solvency ratio, deposit guarantees or large
exposures cannot be justified on general good grounds because of the
Directives on these issues.

The Draft Communication then states that the Second Banking Directive
adds nothing new to this case law as far as freedom to provide services
is concerned.

Establishment

The European Court of Justice case law is essentially the same in the
field of establishment, with the additional rule that a national
provision which is discriminatory against branches of institutions of
other Member States may be justified on the grounds of public policy,
public security and public health.

The case law has recognised a number of areas as being covered by the
concept of the general good. Those relevant to the financial services
sector are:

- protection of recipients of services;
- protection of workers;
- protection of consumers;
- preservation of the good reputation of the national financial
  sector;
- the prevention of fraud;
- social order;
- protection of intellectual property;
- the cohesion of the tax system.

This list could be added to by the Court of Justice.

Measures in these areas would have to be justified on the grounds of
the interest of the general good and also respect the principles of
Community law already cited under services, that is, non-
discrimination, non-duplication, necessity and proportionality.

There then follows a rather theoretical and legalistic discussion
leading to the conclusion that:

"depending on the circumstances, the same restriction applied in the
interest of the general good could be adjudged proportionate in respect
of a branch, but disproportionate in respect of a service provider."

That is followed by a long and equally legalistic passage on the link
between rules governing the interest of the general good and law
applicable to banking contracts.

By determining the law applicable to a banking contract, it is possible
to establish the law applicable to the service proposed by the bank.
This raises the relationship between the mutual recognition provisions
of the Second Banking Directive and the rules laid down in the 1980
Rome Convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.

There is, of course, an important issue here. If the Rome Convention
has the result that the law applicable to a banking contract is that of
the home Member State, can the host Member State then apply its general
good rules to the bank's operations on its territory, as it should be
able to do under the Second Directive?

The Commission's answer to this is that the Directive's mutual
recognition principle should be given effect through a three- stage
process:

- the law applicable to a banking contract should be established on the
basis of the Rome Convention;

- it should then be established whether the result of that first step
constitutes an obstacle to mutual recognition;

- if there is no obstacle, then the host Member State law would apply
to the banking contract without further ado. If there is an obstacle,
the host Member State law would only apply if that can be justified by
the general good and if the European Court's criteria for application
of general good measures are met.

Conclusions

The Draft Communication ends with three conclusions.

Firstly, the Commission does not believe that a banking activity can be
carried on under the same conditions in home and host Member States,
whatever the circumstances. Host country civil, criminal, tax or labour
laws will apply to the branch or foreign service provider as these are
not affected by the Second Directive.

Secondly, non-discriminatory restrictions applying to the service
itself must, however, satisfy the general good test (and the
accompanying principles of proportionality etc) regardless of whether
the banking service is provided through a branch or from another Member
State under the freedom to supply services.

Here, the Commission makes specific reference to restrictions applying
to:

1) the intrinsic features of the service such as cost, interest rates,
duration, contractual terms and conditions;

2) the underlying financial techniques; and

3) the way the service is marketed, such as advertising, canvassing
etc.

Finally, application of the proportionality principle to measures
justified in the interest of the common good will produce varying
results for credit institutions operating in another Member State under
the freedom to supply services or through a branch.

MORE DETAILS ON NEW APPROACHES TO THE HARMONISATION OF ACCOUNTING

THE NOVEMBER 1995 issue of EU Financial Industry Monitor reported
comments by Commissioner Mario Monti on the possibility of adopting a
new approach to accounting standards. Since then, he has obtained from
his Commission colleagues approval for a Communication entitled
Accounting harmonisation: a new strategy vis-a-vis international
harmonisation. This is essentially a discussion document, although it
sets out fairly clearly what the Commission intends doing.

The Communication starts by setting out the reasons for a new strategy:

- the known shortcomings of the existing EU legislation. The
derogations and Member State options which have detracted from
harmonisation under the basic Fourth and Seventh Directives - on
company accounts and consolidated accounts respectively - have been
carried forward into the Bank Accounts Directive and the Insurance
Accounts Directive;

- the absence of progress on harmonisation since these measures were
adopted and the unlikelihood of new legislation. The Communication
reports that a conference in 1990 brought out a clear preference for
not adopting new legislation in the near future;

- the problems faced by large European companies seeking capital on the
international markets. In particular, companies seeking capital on the
New York Stock Exchange have to draw up separate accounts according to
US Generally Accepted Accounting Practices since accounts drawn up
according to European standards are not accepted in the US, although
the reverse is the case;

- the importance of the international harmonisation process and the
danger that in the present situation Europe can contribute little to
this process and then face problems of compatibility between its
standards and international ones.

After setting out these problems, the Commission Communication briefly
cites several solutions which have been aired with the Member States:
amending the Directives so as to exempt large listed companies and let
them follow other rules, negotiating a mutual recognition agreement
with the US, setting up a European Accounting Standard Setting Body.
All of these are rejected for one reason or another.

The Communication then sets out the Commission's proposed approach,
which will have to gain the explicit support and agreement of the
Member States. It emphasises that this new approach does not involve
the EU abandoning the field of accounting harmonisation but, on the
contrary, strengthens "its commitment and contribution to the
international standard-setting process, which offers the most efficient
and rapid solution for the problems of companies operating on a world-
wide scale".

The Commission's proposed approach consists of four steps.

Checking the conformity of existing international accounting standards
with the accounting directives

This is a priority, given the urgent issue of European companies
seeking listings on international capital markets.

The Contact Committee on the Accounting Directives, set up by the
Fourth Directive, would examine the compatibility of the IAS with the
Directives. Conformity is an essential first step if the Member States
are to allow their large companies to prepare accounts on an IAS basis.

The Communication points out that the Member States would have to go
through the same exercise for their national laws because of the
options in the EU Directives. An IAS could be compatible with the
Directives but not with national law.

Inconsistencies between the Directives and IAS would have to be
examined case-by-case so as to resolve conflicts. The International
Accounting Standards Committee could be asked to change the standard in
question (the IASC executive has expressed its willingness to consider
changes) but, if necessary, the Commission would propose changes to the
Directives. To that end, the Commission believes that serious
consideration should be given to an accelerated procedure for amending
the Directives by a committee.

European contributions to the work of the IASC

To ensure EU input to the IASC, the Contact Committee should examine
IASC Exposure Drafts and try to reach agreed positions on them. The
agreed positions would be sent to the IASC. In this way, the Commission
believes that the EU can build up a position of influence, possibly
even extending to IASC agenda fixing.

This would involve enlarging the role of the Contact Committee and the
Commission favours the setting-up of technical sub- committees.

Priority would be given to consolidated accounts for two reasons.
Firstly, it is those companies which prepare consolidated accounts
which are most exposed to the problems described in the Communication.
Secondly, a general approach covering individual company accounts would
be more likely to raise problems with the Member States because of the
link between company accounts and taxation.

Improving the comparability of accounts

The Contact Committee should increase its efforts in this area by
dealing with practical problems in the application of the Directives.
For its part, the Commission will co-operate with the Contact Committee
with a view to improving coordination among the Member State bodies
involved in standard-setting.

The Commission might, for example, incorporate the advice of the
Contact Committee in interpretative communications or recommendations.
Where appropriate, it would publicise the work of the Contact
Committee.

The Directives under the new approach

The new approach can only operate within the limits laid down by the
Directives. Therefore, if it proves necessary, the Commission will
propose amending directives, although it would clearly prefer to avoid
that course and hopes that legislation can be avoided in most instances
by "effective technical co- operation" in the Contact Committee.

To that end, it is essential that all institutions involved in
accounting standard-setting are involved in Committee's work.

Similarly, the Commission considers that there should be co- ordination
between the Committee and the Accounting Advisory Forum, which
represents users and preparers of accounts and which at present is
purely consultative.

Contact Committee members could attend Forum meetings and the Forum's
expertise could be "associated" with the Committee's technical work.

The Communication ends with a conclusion that"The Union needs to move
promptly to offer the users and preparers of accounts a clear prospect
that companies seeking listings on the US and other world markets will
be able to remain within the EU accounting framework and that the US
GAAP, over which they and their governments can exercise no influence,
is not the only option".

COMMISSION CONSUMER DG PLANS DATABASE OF BANKING PRICE STRUCTURES

THE COMMISSION'S Directorate-General for Consumer Policy (DG XXIV)
plans to set up a database to compare the national price structures of
banking services and follow their evolution. It published an invitation
to tender for a study to this end in the Official Journal C 233 of 7
September.

The invitation to tender, in its description of the proposed study,
states:

"Some banking services which were in the past apparently free of charge
for consumers are now explicitly charged and some are becoming rather
expensive. On the basis of information from several Member States, the
price of these services is increasing faster than the rate of
inflation. The introduction of a single currency will also imply a new
cost structure for some of these services (for example, cross-border
transactions)."

DG XXIV, therefore, aims to create an instrument to compare Member
State price structures and to follow their evolution. The instrument
will be set up before the end of this year and updated annually. It
will cover the management of consumer bank accounts and related
operations in all 15 Member States.

The first stage of the study will be to determine for each of the
Member States the typical use of a bank account by the consumer or
group of consumers and to establish the average cost to these consumers
of the typical use.

Since national habits vary - the relative use of cheques, bank
transfers, debit cards, credit cards, etc - the study will have to
ensure comparability of study results.

All costs borne by consumers will be covered by the study, including
annual administration charges, transaction fees, interest lost through
deferred value dates, consumer credit linked to credit cards and
overdrafts.

COMMISSION PROPOSES NEW LIST OF EXCLUSIONS FROM BANKING DIRECTIVES

THE 1977 First Banking Directive contains in its Article 2(2) a list of
institutions which are definitively excluded from the field of
application of the Directive.

Article 2(2) provides for amendment of the list by the Council on a
proposal from the Commission after consultation of the Banking Advisory
Committee.

On November 11 last, the Commission submitted a proposal for amendment
at the request of Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Spain, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Finland, all of which wish deletion from the Article 2(2)
of specific institutions whose exclusion from the scope of the
Directive is no longer justified.

Austria, on the other hand, requested an addition to the list.

The Commission has consulted the Banking Advisory Committee and the non-
European Union countries of the European Economic Area (Iceland,
Liechtenstein and Norway), since the Banking Directives are binding on
them also. (see table on page 8 in the hard copy)

UK:  EX-BINDER PARTNERS FACE RUIN AFTER RECORD DAMAGES AWARD

UP TO 150 former partners of BDO Binder Hamlyn could face financial
ruin following a record damages award by the High Court totalling #105
million ($160 million), including interest and costs.

The sum relates to the 1990 takeover of one of the firm's audit
clients, and the damages of #65 million are believed to be the highest
ever awarded against a UK accounting firm.

During the court case, counsel for Binder said the firm had insurance
cover of #71 million, leaving #34 million of the award to be met from
the partners' personal assets. With between 120 and 150 partners
believed to be involved, the average bill could be as high as #280,000
per partner.

The action related to an agreed bid by electronic security company ADT
for Britannia Security Group in 1990. ADT paid #105 million for
Britannia, basing the price on accounts for fiscal 1989 which had been
audited by Binder.

Following the acquisition, ADT discovered that Britannia's 1989 profits
were #3.2 million, not #8.7 million as stated, and that its net assets
were less than half the #36.5 million shown in the accounts. ADT was
eventually forced to write off its investment and filed suit against
Binder in 1992.

The judge in the case found that Binder had been negligent in its audit
of Britannia, and that, crucially, the firm owed a duty of care to ADT
because of remarks made by Martyn Bishop, the partner who signed off on
the accounts, at a meeting with ADT officials in January 1990.

At that meeting, held shortly before the bid was announced, Bishop was
asked if he stood by his opinion that Britannia's fiscal 1989 accounts
gave a true and fair view of the company's financial health. Bishop
replied that he did.

Binder argued that this "off-the-cuff remark" in no way constituted a
duty of care to ADT. It said it had not entered into any agreement,
verbal or otherwise, to advise ADT, nor had it been paid for any
advice. The firm cited the landmark Caparo ruling of 1990, which held
that auditors do not owe a duty of care to third parties regardless of
whether they are negligent.

Binder has pledged to appeal the decision and is confident that it will
succeed in overturning the verdict."The firm is certain that the Caparo
principles apply," a spokesman said. The appeal, which will not begin
until next year, could take a year or more to run its course.

BDO Binder Hamlyn ceased trading in October 1994, when the bulk of the
firm, which still uses the Binder Hamlyn name, joined the Arthur
Andersen Worldwide Organisation (EA 49). Bishop is still with Binder
Hamlyn in London.

Most of Binder's regional offices merged with Stoy Hayward (EA 46),
which subsequently became BDO's UK member firm, while some partners
joined other accounting firms or went into industry. Binder Hamlyn is
still trying to determine exactly how many partners are liable in the
Britannia case.

SPAIN:  C&L HIT BY MASS CONSULTING EXODUS TO E&Y

COOPERS & LYBRAND in Spain has been rocked by the defection of about 80
consulting staff, including head of department Jose Ramon Magarzo, to
Ernst & Young.

The exodus began on November 16, when Magarzo and another five of C&L's
12 consulting partners announced they were leaving for E&Y along with
three senior consultants. Since then, a further 70 consulting staff
have jumped ship.

The defections, which took C&L completely by surprise, are a blow to
the firm's consulting business, which reported revenues of Pta2.67
billion ($22 million) in 1995 - nearly three times that of E&Y.
According to a C&L spokesperson, the consulting practice had just
returned to profit after several difficult years during Spain's
recession.

Magarzo has already taken up his new position as managing director of
E&Y Consultores, replacing Michael McKay who becomes associate managing
director. In all, the first batch of nine people who left C&L have been
made partners at E&Y.

"This was part of a plan we started a couple of years ago when I came
from the US, and that was to increase the size of E&Y in Spain," McKay
said. "It became clear to us that to achieve the growth, we needed to
become a competitive force. We couldn't do it through internal growth,
we needed external resources at a senior level. That included bringing
in as managing director a Spaniard who would run the practice."

E&Y used an executive search firm to identify potential hires, but did
not specifically target C&L, McKay said. He said the former C&L
partners were attracted to E&Y in part because Ernst & Young
Consultores is a separate firm with its own profit pool.

The raid is not E&Y's first attempt to build a strong consulting arm in
Spain. Two previous efforts - the creation of a consulting division
when Ernst & Whinney and Arthur Young merged in 1989 and the 1993
establishment of E&Y Consultores with financial backing from E&Y in the
US - were not as successful as the firm would have liked.

Although head-hunting is not rare, the scale of E&Y's raid is
unprecedented and has been perceived by C&L as a direct attempt to
steal a large slice of its business and seriously damage the firm. C&L
is reported to be taking legal action against E&Y and the former
partners.

It accuses E&Y of breaching Spain's fair trade laws and of inducing C&L
staff to break their legal commitments to the firm by offering them
financial compensation to leave without giving the required 15 days'
notice.

McKay denied this. "We believe we have acted in accordance with the
laws and contractual obligations of all the people," he said. "The
people who have joined us have joined of their own free will and
exercised their professional rights in the marketplace."

E&Y also denies trying to steal C&L's business and has offered to
`lend' C&L its former consultants to finish work already in hand, an
offer which C&L described as cynical and not worthy of consideration.

NORWAY:  MRI'S LOCAL FIRM MERGES WITH NEXIA MEMBER

MOORES ROWLAND International's Norwegian affiliate, RevisorGruppen AS,
has beefed up its national coverage by merging with AS Revision
Noraudit, the local member firm of Nexia International. MRI has also
signed up a correspondent firm in Finland.

The new firm, to be known as Revision Noraudit & Co AS, will have
revenues of roughly NKr160 million ($27 million), a figure which will
give it sixth place in the local rankings ahead of Price Waterhouse and
behind the other Big Six affiliates. The staff figure totals around
250, including 48 partners, and the new firm will operate out of 17
offices.

The merger was "purely" driven by national considerations, according to
Kjetil Rivelsrud, chairman of the new firm and formerly executive
chairman of Noraudit. "We'd made a decision that we had to make a
merger in Norway to strengthen our coverage," he said. "We talked with
RevisorGruppen about a merger and the result was that we had to choose
one of the [international] groups. RevisorGruppen had more referred
work for Norway than Nexia, so we decided that MRI was the better
choice."

Rivelsrud said the merger is a good strategic fit. His firm is strong
in Oslo and the northern part of the country, while the MRI affiliate
is well represented in Bergen and Stavangar in the west of the country.

RevisorGruppen, the smaller of the two firms, comprised a network of 11
offices, two of which - Molde and Horten - have opted out of the
merger. Those practices accounted for revenues of between NKr10 million
and NKr15 million, Rivelsrud said.

Revision Noraudit's fiscal 1994 revenues totalled NKr119 million. One
associated firm, with revenues of NKr5 million, has opted out of the
merger, while Nexia Consulting AS, which is partly owned by the
auditing firm, is also remaining independent of the new firm.

Noraudit previously represented Deloitte Haskins & Sells, but opted out
of the global merger with Touche Ross in 1990. It joined forces with
Nexia in 1992, and last year changed its name from Deloitte Noraudit
following a legal dispute with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu International
over the use of the Deloitte name. Rivelsrud said the two sides
resolved the dispute through an out- of-court settlement.

Noraudit's defection naturally leaves Nexia with a gap in its European
coverage."They felt they had to do a merger locally," said Nigel
Hodges, Nexia's executive director. Hodges admitted that Nexia does not
refer much work into Norway and said the group will use the services of
Ola Petter Hopp, a former senior manager at Noraudit now operating as a
consultant, until a new member can be found.

Meanwhile, in Finland, MRI has linked up with Tilimerkono, a two-
partner Helsinki-based firm with revenues of $500,000. The firm, which
has nine staff, was recommended by MRI's Danish member, City Revision
A/S, and will help MRI expand into the Baltic countries, according to
John Cox, the network's executive director. The Helsinki practice was
previously unaffiliated.

JERSEY TO OFFER PARTNERS LIMITED LIABILITY

THE UK member firms of Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young look set to
be the first to take advantage of a proposed law in Jersey that will
let professionals form limited liability partnerships (LLP) on the
island.

Details of the draft law were announced on December 11 by the Finance
and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey, the island's
Parliament. It will be debated by Jersey legislators in the first
quarter of 1996 and, if approved, will then go to the UK Privy Council
for sanctioning. The measure is expected to become law before the end
of the year.

Accountants are not the only ones who stand to benefit from the Jersey
proposal. Solicitors, architects and surveyors will also be able to
establish partnerships on the island, as could practices from other
countries.

Under the proposed law, which was devised in consultation with PW and
E&Y, the LLP would remain totally liable for all the firm's debts, but
individual partners who are not responsible for a particular negligent
act would have their personal assets protected from debts arising from
that negligence.

Each LLP would be required to have at least one general partner and all
LLP assets would be available to creditors. In addition, the LLP would
be required to put up a #5 million ($8 million) bond for judgments
against the partnership.

"We are actively considering whether adoption of the limited liability
partnership structure is appropriate for the UK practice," said E&Y
senior partner Nick Land. "Initial consultation with a small number of
clients and all of our partners have produced a very positive
reaction." Privately, E&Y sources said the firm plans to move to LLP
status as soon as possible.

"At the moment, if you're found to be liable for negligence, then
you're liable for everything, no matter what your contribution to that
negligence might have been," said Ian Brindle, senior partner at PW.

All the Big Six have been working with the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales in trying to get the government to
change the UK legal principle of joint and several liability. "This
can't happen overnight," Brindle said. "These things take time and time
is not necessarily on our side." In the meantime, the firms need a way
to protect themselves from "Armageddon", he said.

Brindle described the UK's current limited liability law for
partnerships, which was created in 1907, as "not relevant to modern
times". Like joint and several liability, time-consuming primary
legislation would be needed to change it, he said.

The proposal allows E&Y and PW to maintain their partnership culture
within the UK and there will be no change to their UK taxation
arrangements. The Jersey option is claimed to be cheaper than the
incorporation route chosen recently by KPMG (EA 60). A senior partner
at one of the firms estimates the saving could be as much as 10 percent
of pre-tax profits compared with the cost of KPMG's chosen route.

However, some KPMG sources raised doubts over how effective the LLP
option will be in preventing potential litigants in the UK from
pursuing a partnership registered in Jersey through the British courts.

KPMG's senior partner Colin Sharman declined to comment on the legal
advice his firm had received. "When we made our decision to incorporate
we were aware of the Jersey option and we discounted it," he said. "For
a number of reasons - one of which was the degree of security we were
looking for - we elected to go the route we have."

UNITED KINGDOM:  BANK AUSTRIA SUES PW OVER ACQUISITION ADVICE

THE LONDON office of Price Waterhouse is being sued for damages of #146
million ($220 million) by Bank Austria over its role in advising the
bank on a UK acquisition which turned sour.

The suit relates to the bank's purchase of a 51 percent stake in
Sovereign Leasing in 1990. The Manchester-based company, which was
owned by entrepreneurs Paul Green and Martin Harrison, was mainly
involved in leasing cars, property and computer equipment.

Osterreichische Landerbank (OLB), as Bank Austria was known before its
1991 merger with Zentralsparkasse, paid about Sch450 million ($45
million) for the stake. It later increased its holding to 100 percent.

Bank Austria alleges that PW was engaged by OLB to conduct a due
diligence investigation into Sovereign and to provide corporate finance
advice in connection with the transaction.

In a statement, Freshfields, the law firm representing the bank, said:
"Bank Austria relied heavily on Price Waterhouse's investigations and
advice during the course of the transaction and in deciding to proceed
with the acquisition.

"It subsequently emerged that at the time of the acquisition,
Sovereign's financial position was in fact very different from the way
it was represented by Price Waterhouse. Had the true position been
revealed by Price Waterhouse's work, Bank Austria would not have
proceeded with the acquisition."

In 1991 and 1992, Bank Austria was forced to make total provisions of
Sch2.5 billion for losses at Sovereign Leasing and, in 1992, forced the
resignations of three former OLB directors over the performance of its
UK operations.

However, PW denies that the work it carried out for OLB constituted a
real due diligence investigation. PW partner Paul Hainsworth said the
firm conducted an "indicative valuation" well before the acquisition
took place. It was not, he said, engaged to carry out a full valuation
at the time of the purchase.

"We strenuously deny these allegations and we will vigorously defend
them," Hainsworth said.

The writ was issued in the High Court in London in November. The case
could take two years to be heard.

CODE DEMANDS SCRUTINY OF HIGH-RISK CLIENTS

NEW REGULATIONS in Germany have introduced a Big Six-style  approach
that requires all of the country's auditors to adopt a risk-based
approach to their work.

The new requirements have been jointly issued by the
Wirtschaftspruferkammer (WPK), the state auditing body run by the
federal minister of economics, and the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer
(IdW), the private professional body that represents Germany's 6,000
accountants.

In future, all statutory auditors will have to analyse their clients'
operating environments, assess the influence of general risk factors,
make a provisional judgement about inherent business risk, and evaluate
internal control procedures.

The risk-based approach, long used by the Big Six in Germany and
elsewhere, has now become part of the official guidelines which state
that "the high-risk audit areas should be given greater weight in the
audit process".

The new guidelines form part of a revised code of conduct on audit
quality. The code, which was last amended in 1982, has been updated in
an attempt to dissuade the justice ministry in Bonn from introducing
tougher legislative controls on auditors. For the first time, the
profession's quality guidelines cover voluntary audits, tax advice,
consultancy and expert advisory work, as well as statutory audits.

Outgoing IdW president Dietrich Dorner said the profession remains
strongly in favour of self-regulation. "We don't want to wait until the
authorities and the government take the reins," he said. "We don't want
state regulation." But he acknowledged that recent controversies about
audit quality in Germany have led the justice ministry to consider
tougher regulation of the profession.

WPK president Gerhard Burret acknowledged that there had been
shortcomings in all of the practice areas covered by the new rules. In
particular, the rules are stricter on auditor independence; auditors
are required to disclose financial, personal and shareholder links with
their clients.

The rules require auditors to ensure that their work is reviewed by a
suitably-qualified colleague (the so-called double-signature
principle). Dorner said the principle was equally binding on sole
practitioners. "These accountants usually have links with other
practitioners and I expect they will use them to fulfil this
requirement," he said.

Separately, Dorner commented on the growing acceptance of International
Accounting Standards (IAS) by German companies. The IdW recently
produced a dual-language guide to IAS for members of the profession and
their clients. Dorner believes IAS will inevitably become generally
accepted in Germany even though they contradict some of the main tenets
of the country's commercial code. "Our principle of prudence is a sound
one, but it is evident which way things will go," he said. "We won't be
able to avoid IAS."

Yet Dorner does not agree that the German profession would be able to
exert more influence on the formulation of IAS by having an Anglo Saxon-
style standard-setting body. "I'm not optimistic that [such a body]
would be any better than what we have at the moment," he said."It would
pronounce on individual cases and create precedents, and the effect
would be to reduce standards to the lowest common denominator."

GOVERNMENT WARNS PROFESSION ON SELF-REGULATION

THE GERMAN government has served notice on the local accounting
profession that it must vastly improve its self-regulation if it is not
to have practice rules imposed by law.

Open conflict broke out at an accounting conference held in Gottingen
in early December, when Herbert Biener, head of accounting standards at
the Justice Ministry, publicly criticised Gerhard Gross, deputy
chairman of the Institut der Wirtschaftsprufer (IdW).

Biener was dismissive of the profession's new quality standards,
introduced just a few days earlier (see story above). Even under the
new rules, he said, German accountants are still not obliged to
actively seek out evidence of error and fraud in corporate accounts.

"The biggest problems are with statutory audits," he said.
"Essentially, these standards haven't changed since the 1930s. The law
allows auditors simply to rubber-stamp the accounts; you aren't obliged
to argue things out with the company."

Biener also criticised the IdW's main practice committee for its late
discovery of shortcomings in the switch to International Accounting
Standards by Bayer, Schering and Heidelberger Zement for their 1994
accounts. Gross countered that it would have been unfeasible for the
committee to intervene any earlier, but that the changes suggested by
the committee would be incorporated in the companies' 1995 accounts.

Biener acknowledged that the leading accounting firms in Germany are
world-class, but expressed concern about the rank-and-file of the
profession. The German accounting environment "shouldn't give rise to
audits which are just average; rather they should allow accountants
with an international reputation to offer auditing in Germany which is
up to international standards," he said. "The dinosaurs died out
because they didn't adapt to the times. I just hope the profession has
grasped that message."

German accountants have lost respect, Biener said, and need to regain
public confidence, particularly as a result of the bad publicity
surrounding Daimler-Benz's accounts. As the only German company with a
New York listing, Daimler is obliged to publish not only German-style
accounts, but a reconciliation to US GAAP as well. That has resulted in
huge discrepancies between the two figures, particularly in the
company's 1993 accounts.

"Our audits have become suspect," Biener said. "Sooner or later German
accounts will no longer be accepted by the international community."

Companies' accounting departments, rather than accounting firms, should
provide the impetus for the regulation of accounting practice, said
Biener. Accounting firms have their own commercial interests to
consider, and may be reluctant to push for change. He therefore
suggested that German, and in turn European companies, set up a
regulatory body modelled on the Financial Accounting Standards Board in
the US.

In so doing, Biener put the IdW under pressure to promote this idea. "I
won't introduce guidelines or legislation if this [regulatory] body
operates in a sensible fashion," he said.

TWO FIRMS MERGE AS GRANT THORNTON ITALIA

ITALAUDIT AND Hodgson Landau Brands, two of Italy's largest firms, have
merged their activities under the Grant Thornton umbrella.

The new firm should now rank eighth in the Italian rankings behind the
Big Six and the Mazars & Guerard affiliate. Combined auditing revenues
for 1996 are expected to total L15 billion ($9 million).

The alliance was approved by Consob, Italy's bourse watchdog, at the
end of September and will formally take effect early in 1996. The firm
will operate as Grant Thornton Italia, although it was the partners of
Hodgson Landau Brands, the HLB International affiliate, who made the
first move.

The new firm's partners will own 90 percent of the shares, while the
remaining 10 percent will remain in the hands of Centrobanca,
Italaudit's owner. Recent legislation obliged Italian banks to reduce
their shareholdings in auditing firms to below 50 percent by the end of
1995.

Lorenzo Penca, managing partner of Hodgson Landau Brands, will be
president of the new firm while Claudio Muollo, the head of Italaudit,
is moving to lead Grant Thornton's consultancy arm -in Italy, the two
divisions have to be kept legally separate.

Penca said the merger will enable the firms to keep pace with the
competition. "This was an opportunity we could not pass up," he said.
"Auditing firms in Italy that do not grow will find it increasingly
difficult to survive. With this merger we have established a highly-
professional auditing body with a solid base and a recognised
international name which will distinguish us from the smaller firms in
Italy. Our view is that there will eventually be only ten auditing
groups [authorised to audit listed companies] in the country and this
is our way of ensuring that we are one of them."

Previously, Hodgson Laundau Brands was ninth in the rankings, with fee
income of L7.5 billion, while Italaudit was placed 12th with revenues,
including consulting, of roughly L6 billion.

The firm will have more than 70 staff with 11 partners. Clients include
Italian dairy producer, Parmalat, two leading football clubs, an
Italian drugs company, publishers, fashion houses such as Gianfranco
Ferre, and a clutch of Italian banks.

"We may not be able to compete with the Big Six on size, but we can
certainly match them for image and professionalism," Penca said. "There
are only a small number of groups in Italy whose accounts Grant
Thornton Italia would not be in a position to audit, which leaves a lot
of potential business. The trend for smaller companies to seek stock
market listings is very encouraging and we will be looking to exploit
the situation to the full."

The merger is a blow to the HLB International network. The Italian firm
was HLB's 15th-largest member and referred out "a reasonable amount" of
work, according to Peter Frost, the group's London-based chief
executive. "The move was driven by their desire for a merger at
national level," Frost said."We are looking at one or two alternatives
at the moment."

MID-TIER BODY PUTS BRAVE FACE ON DEFECTIONS

AIRE, THE association that represents local audit firms in Italy, is
putting a brave face on a series of defections that have left it with
just four members licensed to audit listed companies by bourse
regulator Consob.

The departing members have all rejoined Assirevi, the auditing
profession's long-standing representative body. Assirevi had come to be
regarded as almost exclusively a Big Six organisation since the smaller
firms broke away to form Aire in the late 1980s.

Vittorio Salvi, head of Milan-based Sofiresa, which recently quit Aire,
cited two reasons for firms returning to the fold. "It has happened
partly because of the growth of international affiliation among Italian
firms, but also because Assirevi carries more weight with banks and
Consob," he said. "The reasons for starting Aire for Italian auditing
firms have been overtaken by events." Sofiresa is a member of Summit
International.

Hodgson Landau Brands, which recently merged with Italaudit to form
Grant Thornton Italia (see above story), was one of the few mid-tier
firms not to join Aire. Dino Mangiarotti, senior partner at the new
firm and a director of Assirevi, is convinced of the value of Assirevi
membership. "Firms wishing to audit listed companies in Italy benefit
greatly from the international name and the status of being part of
Assirevi," he said. "It distinguishes these companies from the other,
smaller firms."

Aire president Fausto Vitucci does not dispute the differing roles of
the two associations but is convinced that Aire still has an essential
role to play for auditors in Italy.

"The listed company audit market is limited in Italy and an
exceptionally high number of non-listed companies will request audits,"
he said. "The problem is how this market is divided. Smaller firms are
better suited to auditing smaller companies, particularly in terms of
costs. It seems unreasonable that the largest firms seek to impose
their brands on this end of the market because it raises fees to an
unacceptable level for many small companies."

Vitucci said the Italian market is different from others in several
ways. The stock market is small relative to the size of the economy and
audit work is more seasonal than in other countries. The big firms, he
claimed, are forced to seek work at the lower end of the market to keep
their partners busy all year round.

Recent legislative changes have required all auditors to officially
register with the authorities - more than 65,000 have since done so. On
the other hand, there is no clear regulatory authority for the non-
listed market unless the work is performed by a Consob-authorised firm.
Vitucci said Aire can provide support for smaller audit firms and
ensure that standards are maintained at the lower end of the market.

Vitucci's firm, First Professional Audit, is applying for Consob
authorisation, a step which, he said, improves auditors' status even if
they do not plan to audit listed companies. Sofiresa, for example, is
also Consob-approved although it currently has no quoted audit clients.

UK JUDGE DISMISSES NAMES' CASE AGAINST LITTLEJOHN

THE HIGH Court in London has thrown out a #200 million ($300 million)
negligence suit against IA International's UK member firm, Littlejohn
Frazer.

The suit was brought by investors in the Lloyd's of London insurance
market and related to Littlejohn's audits of the Gooda Walker
underwriting syndicate, which ran up losses of almost #1 billion in the
late 1980s and early 1990s.

In October 1994, the 3,000 investors, or Names, won about #400 million
in damages from the agency that managed their underwriting. The Names
then sued the auditor for negligence, claiming that the syndicates'
accounts had disguised underwriting losses by overstating the value of
their investments. The Names said they would not have invested in later
years had they known of the losses.

The High Court decided that the precedents established in the 1990
Caparo case applied. Whether or not Littlejohn was negligent in
auditing the syndicate was irrelevant as no duty of care was owed to
future investors at Lloyd's. The Names are expected to appeal the
decision.

The case is a setback to attempts by Lloyd's to organise a market-wide
out-of-court settlement of all the litigation that has dogged the
market for the last three years. Names are seeking damages for the
estimated #11 billion of losses run up by the market since 1988. There
is now less pressure on the auditors to contribute to the proposed #2.8
billion settlement fund (EA 56).

IRISH FIRMS TO ESTABLISH FORMAL CROSS-BORDER LINK

INCREASED BUSINESS optimism arising from the Northern Ireland peace
process has prompted McGrath & Co, the Republic of Ireland member of
ACPA International, to establish a formal alliance with Belfast firm
MTF.

McGrath has worked with MTF on a number of projects since the peace
process began at the end of August 1994. Although it previously covered
the entire island for ACPA, an increase in outside investment into the
north, particularly from the US, has created the need for
representation there.

"The peace process has set it all in motion," said McGrath managing
partner Tom Kavanagh. "We've already seen a rise in inward investment
and this can only increase."

McGrath was attracted to MTF because of its specialty in mergers and
acquisitions, an area which the Dublin firm is not particularly strong
in.

McGrath reported revenues of IR#1.75 million ($2.8 million) in 1995.
Kavanagh estimates MTF's 1995 revenues at about IR#750,000. Combined
fee income at both firms is expected to reach IR#2.7 million in 1996.

KPMG'S GERMAN MEMBER LOSES SENIOR PARTNER

JOSEF LANFERMANN, senior partner of KPMG Deutsche Treuhand since 1991,
has taken the German profession by surprise with his decision to leave
the firm at the end of December.

Although health problems were the main reason for his departure, 57-
year-old Lanfermann will continue to practise as an accountant under
his own name. Rather than appointing a new senior partner immediately,
the supervisory board asked its chairman, Hans Havermann, to step into
the breach for an interim period of two years. Havermann was previously
senior partner between 1985 and 1991 and chairman of KPMG International
until September 1995.

Separately, KPMG Germany said it expects gross revenues in 1995 to rise
5 percent to about DM1.17 billion ($800 million). Profits will also
improve, the firm said, without giving details. This growth was largely
the result of "initial successes" in KPMG's efforts to put greater
emphasis on consulting work, it added.

Meanwhile, provisional figures from C&L Deutsche Revision indicate that
the Coopers & Lybrand member has drawn almost level with KPMG as the
largest accounting firm in Germany. Partner Horst Goldbach told EA that
group fee income expanded by 9.5 percent to about DM1.14 billion in
1995. Although fee income was up in all divisions, growth was
particularly strong in consultancy work, he said.

GRANT THORNTON FORTIFIES LINKS WITH POLISH FIRM

GRANT THORNTON International has strengthened its links with Polish
firm Potworowski Kinast, a GTI representative since 1993.

Potworowski's UK office, with ten staff and annual revenues of about
#500,000, merged fully with Grant Thornton's West London office on
December 1.

Grant Thornton country managing partner David McDonnell said his firm
has supplied Potworowski with training and support since the Polish arm
joined GTI. "The intention always was that the [London firm] would join
us at some stage," he said.

Acquiring Potworowski, with its strong roots in the Polish community,
ties in with the West London office's strategy of targeting certain
ethnic groups in the capital, McDonnell said.

The latest deal brings to eight the number of firms which have merged
with Grant Thornton in the last 18 months. "We are actively seeking
further acquisitions over the next year," McDonnell said. Grant
Thornton is in preliminary talks with a number of local firms, none of
which are linked to a national network, he said.

BALSAM/PROCEDO TRIAL TO AWAIT CRIMINAL VERDICT

MORE THAN a year after a group of German banks announced a claim of
DM250 million ($175 million) against Price Waterhouse, the
Balsam/Procedo lawsuit has finally opened in Frankfurt.

But after examining evidence and hearing preliminary arguments, the
judge quickly proposed an adjournment of the case until after former
executives of the two companies, plus former PW partner Rolf Muscat,
have been tried on charges of criminal fraud.

The group trial is expected to begin in April and may last for several
years because the evidence is so complex. The prosecution hopes to
prove that the former executives carried out fraudulent paper
transactions - worth billions of marks - between Balsam and Procedo and
thus caused the collapse of both companies. Muscat, who advised both
companies, is accused of "deliberate involvement" with the alleged
frauds.

Bernd-Wilhelm Schmitz, the banks' lead counsel, agreed that his case
against PW would stand or fall on whether Muscat and other PW partners
acted intentionally, rather than just negligently. But he is unwilling
to delay the banks' lawsuit further by consenting to a prolonged
adjournment. The court was scheduled to reconvene on December 19 to
make a final decision on the adjournment, after both sides had
consulted with their clients.

The banks claim that PW partners are guilty of"intentional misconduct"
in failing to follow up evidence of the fraudulent deals and approving
the accounts when they should not have done so. Now Schmitz has added a
new claim: that PW gave Balsam's accounts unqualified approval without
actually carrying out an audit. PW's lawyers denied the charge.

ICAEW, CIMA MERGER MAY COST 130 JOBS

A MERGER of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
(ICAEW) and the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants (CIMA)
could result in the shedding of 130 jobs as the two bodies seek to
rationalise costs.

Details of the cuts were revealed in the prospectus for the merger,
which was published in early December after being approved by the
governing councils of both bodies.

The new organisation, to be known simply as the Institute of Chartered
Accountants, has budgeted to save 20 percent of the combined costs of
the two existing bodies, which employ 630 people between them. ICAEW
chief executive Andrew Colquhoun said efficiencies will be possible as
a result of the inevitable duplication of services currently being
provided by the two.

Colquhoun said the job cuts will be phased in over five years. He
expects few compulsory redundancies since staff turnover at the ICAEW
is currently running at 10 percent to 15 percent.

The savings will allow the institute to reduce its #138 ($210) annual
subscription fee by #20, bringing it closer into line with the #110
currently charged by CIMA.

However, Colquhoun denied that cost savings are the main motive behind
the merger. "We are not promoting this on the financial issue," he
said. "We are promoting this because the environment for the profession
is becoming harder and we believe we can serve the interests of
accountants better by being bigger."

The new body will offer two types of qualification: one aimed at those
training in public practice, who will continue to be known as
"chartered accountants"; and the other for those working in industry,
who will bear the title "chartered management accountant".

There will be a four-stage education syllabus, consisting of two
foundation levels, an intermediate stage and a final level. Students
will be time barred if they do not pass their final exams within seven
years of starting the foundation course. Students will be able to
accumulate exam credits at all levels except the final one.

The "England and Wales" part of the current ICAEW name will be dropped
in an attempt to give the new body a global image. "This is not
marketing for its own sake, but we believe we can offer a high-quality
qualification around the world," Colquhoun said. "They will have to
meet the standards we have here in the UK, but we do think there is a
market out there for our qualification."

The new institute will have nine regions in England and Wales, each of
which will be able to elect six members to the new council: three from
industry and three from practice. The exception will be London which
will elect 14 members.

There will be further elections in Scotland, Ireland and in other
countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong and South Africa. Members of both
institutes are expected to vote on the merger proposal in April or May.

Meanwhile, CIMA has gained Privy Council approval for its members to
use the individual description of "chartered management accountant"
with immediate effect. According to a statement from CIMA, the new
designation"should enable the members of both bodies to consider the
merger proposals on their true merits, as there would be no change of
title for the members of either body".

ACCA CRITIC CALLS REFORM PLAN INSUFFICIENT

EAST LONDON University professor Prem Sikka has said plans for the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants (ACCA) to give increased
representation to its overseas members do not go far enough in making
the body democratic.

While welcoming the proposals, Sikka, a long-time critic of the way the
ACCA is run, called for more transparency within the association, open
meetings of its governing council, and access to agenda papers and
minutes. He also repeated his demand for the ACCA president and vice-
president to be elected by the association's members. "Basically, the
people who are leading the organisation need to be mandated," he said.

The plan to disband the current London-based council and replace it
with a federal structure was put forward by ACCA chief executive Anthea
Rose at a council meeting in early December. The proposed structure
devolves power to a number of new regional councils, which will in turn
report to an international committee. Sikka has argued that the
association's 18,000 overseas members - 40 percent of the total - are
effectively disenfranchised.

A discussion document outlining the proposals was sent to all ACCA
members on December 15.

An ACCA source said: "It is true the way our council is structured
makes it very difficult for members to play a meaningful role if they
live on the other side of the world. Instead, we are to propose some
form of devolution with a federal structure."

The powers to be devolved will be debated in the discussion document.
These could include direct dealings with regional governments and the
issue of guidance and advice on local auditing, accounting and taxation
matters. It is unlikely that the regional councils will have any
control over ACCA's examination syllabus.

As for Sikka's call for direct presidential elections, the ACCA is not
ruling this out. But a change to the current practice of having the
president elected by the council is not part of the latest proposals.

Meanwhile, the ACCA's application to change its name to the Association
of Chartered Public Accountants has been turned down by the Privy
Council, the body which must approve all changes to an organisation's
Royal Charter.

In a letter to the ACCA, the council said it objected to the use of the
word "public" in the proposed name. However, it had no problem with the
use of the term "chartered".

In submissions to the council earlier this year, the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales argued that the name change
would cause confusion with the certified public accountant designation
used in the US. Another vocal critic of the ACCA, Labour Member of
Parliament Austin Mitchell, argued that the association did not act
sufficiently in the public interest for it to merit the title"public".

The ACCA has been asked to come up with a new proposal and expects to
put forward a new name for its members to vote on in the near future.

A SOLUTION TO THE LITIGATION PROBLEM?

UK accounting firms may have found a partial solution to the problems
of litigation without the expense of incorporation. William Gleeson
looks at the implications of two firms' plans to register as LLPs in
Jersey

THE "ACCOUNTANCIES" - the collective noun that some UK newspapers have
started using for accountancy practices - have announced that, for the
time being at least, they are putting their hopes for salvation from
rogue litigants in the hands of the 600-year- old Jersey Parliament.
Or, at least Ernst & Young and Price Waterhouse are.

The Finance and Economics Committee of the States of Jersey - as the
island's Parliament is called - is proposing a new limited liability
partnership (LLP) law, to be debated in the first quarter of the new
year.

If the legislation comes into being, the UK's largest accountancy firms
will be able to re-register in Jersey and, should they be successfully
sued, the personal assets of the partners not directly involved in the
alleged wrongdoing will be protected.

Both E&Y and PW have said the Jersey route is their preferred way to
limit liability. It has the advantage of preserving the partnership
ethos of the firms, and is cheaper than incorporation. The change from
paying national insurance contributions under the rules for the self-
employed to the rules applying to those employed by a company would
mean, in effect, partners would face higher tax rates.

The basis for assessing taxable profits would change as well, with
Accounting Standards Board rules applying to the incorporated entity.
This particularly applies to work in progress which would be given a
higher value, making the income of the practice higher.

But serious question marks hang over the proposals. It is by no means
certain that the laws will have a smooth passage through the States of
Jersey. This body is not a traditional Parliament, and there are no
political parties. Instead, there is an assembly of individuals who
come from a wide cross-section of the community. Current members of the
54-strong body range from a retired stockbroker to a green activist.

Senator Pierre Horsfall, president of the Finance and Economics
Committee, said: "This is not in anyway like a party political system,
where you know you have a majority before you start . .
very meaningful."

Horsfall's seven-man committee has to persuade the other 47 members of
the States of the merits of the case for the new law during one stand-
up debating session.

In the autumn, a bill proposed by the States education committee to
reform the way school pupils are streamed at the age of 14 was thrown
out, forcing the committee to resign.

But limited liability for partnerships should be less of an emotive
issue for the Jersey Parliament than local education. Also, there is a
lot in it for the local economy. Passing this legislation will bring
closer ties between the island and prestigious financial sector
businesses. Of Jersey's 43,000 workers, 9,000, or just over 20 percent,
are employed in the financial services sector.

Whatever happens, the answer will be obtained quickly. Once the process
has passed through the States it must then await the approval of the UK
Privy Council, an honorary body whose role it is, by and large, to
rubberstamp the States' proposals. E&Y has said it hopes to become an
LLP sometime in the second half of next year.

But even if the proposed bill gets through in its current form, doubt
exists as to whether the new law will afford the protection being
sought.

KPMG has received legal advice that the UK courts may refuse to
recognise that Jersey's laws take precedence to UK laws. In essence,
the firm has been advised that if the accountant being sued works and
lives in the UK and signs his audit report "KPMG, London" and the
plaintiff is based in the UK, it seems perfectly reasonable to argue
that the re-registration in Jersey is nothing more than an artificial
ruse to escape the UK courts' jurisdiction.

Colin Sharman, KPMG's senior partner, said: "This law doesn't exist
yet, it is a proposed change. When we were considering it we were aware
that the States of Guernsey was thinking of revising its partnership
law and aware that the States of Jersey was considering doing so. We
have an English law solution to an English law problem which gives us
as much protection as we need."

Indeed, it transpires that KPMG has taken a long hard look not only at
the Channel Islands but at other European jurisdictions - not just the
obvious ones like Liechtenstein and Luxembourg, but France, Germany and
Spain as well.

But there are plenty who hope the cynics are wrong, not least the other
firms - Arthur Andersen and Touche Ross - which are currently sitting
firmly on their hands waiting for some progress.

It is undoubtedly wrong that all the responsibility for corporate
failure is borne by the auditors, with the failed company's management
getting away scot-free.

The firms feel time is against them. The campaign to reform liability
law in the UK is not likely to bear fruit for several years.

The same is true of UK partnership law. The Department of Trade and
Industry is said to be sympathetic to the needs of the accountancy
profession, but it is currently not high on the list of priorities of
either the government or the main opposition parties, especially with a
general election to be held sooner rather than later.

But in the end, this move is not about economic or legal realities. It
is about the psychology of poker players. Potential litigants will now
have to ask how much stronger will off-shore re-registration make the
hand of the accountancies in negligence claims?

As yet, nobody has sued partners in a firm for their homes and the
shirts from their kids' backs - and possibly no rational litigant ever
would. The fear is of the potentially irrational "rogue" litigant. In
future, if the Jersey law goes through, should any person ever think of
being a rogue, they will have to ask"is this worth it, now that the
deep pockets motive has gone?"

EARLY SIGNS OF UPTURN

Danish accounting firms are predicting sustained growth over the next
few years thanks mainly to an improvement in general economic
conditions. Sally Roden reports

ALTHOUGH FEE income growth is still quite modest, Danish accounting
firms believe they have turned a corner after recent years of
recession.

Demand from clients is on the increase, although few partners expect
auditing to drive the recovery. "Competition is still quite
substantial, but the economic recovery is beginning to influence the
profession in a positive direction," said Frank Jakobsen, international
contact partner with Grant Thornton Denmark/Grothen & Perregard.

"For the first time in several years, we are experiencing a lack of
skilled labour, indicating that firms are beginning to feel a rise in
demand."

That said, the latest batch of fee income figures are unlikely to set
pulses racing. Only two of the top ten firms reported revenue increases
of more than 5 percent, and one of those, BDO ScanRevision, said its
14.2 percent growth rate was partly the result of a merger.

"The economy has been improving in general but - at least among the
big, international firms - the audit market is affected by
rationalisation and technological changes, and in some areas is still
affected by keen price competition," said Torben Haaning, managing
partner of Coopers & Lybrand.

KPMG C Jespersen is still the top firm in Denmark with 1994 revenues of
DKr668 million ($120 million), a rise of 3.4 percent on the previous
year. For 1995, the firm estimates revenues will rise a further 2.5
percent to DKr685 million.

The 1995 figures will have been boosted by the merger completed at the
start of the year of KPMG's offices on the island of Funen with local
firm Edvin Munk. The merger gave KPMG a presence in three more towns on
the island and doubled the size of its office in Svendborg.

Among KPMG's major audit clients are shipping, manufacturing and retail
group AP Moller, electrical machinery maker Danfoss and in the banking
sector Den Danske Bank and Unibank.

Second-placed Deloitte & Touche, which changed its name from Schobel &
Marholt on January 1 of this year, reported revenues of DKr651.2
million for fiscal 1994, up 1.4 percent from a year earlier. D&T's
major audit clients include insurance company Topdanmark, for which it
also provides consulting services, and food and beverage producer
Danisco.

In third place in the rankings is C&L with 1994 revenues of DKr525
million, up 1.9 percent from a year earlier, followed by Ernst & Young
with fee income of DKr358 million, a rise of 3.2 percent.

The E&Y figures do not reflect two mergers which the firm completed
this year. On May 1, it teamed up with Borg og Green, an auditing firm
based in the northern Zealand area. The merger boosted the number of
partners in E&Y's Hillerod office to seven and increased its total
staff there to 52. Then on July 1, E&Y merged with RIO Partner, a four-
partner firm in Odense with annual revenues of DKr50 million.

E&Y managing partner Teddy Wivel said the firm has experienced a lot of
growth in management consulting and tax services and expects this to
continue in the current year.

Price Waterhouse/Seier-Petersen took fifth place with revenues of
DKr300 million in the year to June 1995. Morten Iversen, a partner at
the firm, said PW was not involved in any mergers during the year and
that its growth rate of 11.1 percent was entirely organic.

He said much of the revenue increase came from a rise in information
technology consulting and tax consulting business. "We have a very
strong tax practice and there has been a general increase in demand for
added-value tax services."

Among PW's major audit clients are pharmaceuticals group Novo Nordisk,
Tele Danmark, insurance group Trygg-Baltica Forsikring, and the local
subsidiaries of computer group IBM and oil giant Shell.

The highest revenue increase of any of the firms surveyed came from
sixth-placed BDO ScanRevision, with fee income rising 14.2 percent to
DKr297 million in the year to September. The firm said the impressive
increase was partly the result of a merger with auditing firm JRI,
which has offices in Aarhus, Skanderborg and Auning. Managing partner
Jens Rye said the merger doubled BDO's presence in Aarhus, a port on
the eastern side of Jutland.

Rye added that BDO has experienced some growth in the audit sector over
the last year. He said this was because the firm deals mainly with the
medium-sized corporate sector where price competition is less severe.

BDO has also begun diversifying into consulting. "Clients are more
willing to pay [for consulting services] because they see results,
which is not always the case in the audit sector," Rye said.

Arthur Andersen remains in seventh place, with fiscal 1995 revenues of
DKr234 million, a rise of 4 percent on the previous year. The firm's
audit business contributed 44 percent of revenues, while Andersen
Consulting accounted for 47 percent.

Andersen's country managing partner Torgny Pahle said trading
conditions in Denmark in the last year were characterised by a "very
weak audit market with no growth, fierce competition and a soft outlook
for the future". The consulting market, on the other hand, is growing
across the board, he said.

Most firms agreed with Pahle that competition in the audit market
remains strong. More and more audits are being put out to tender, and
clients are stepping up their demands for value for money, they said.

Wivel said E&Y has also noticed price competition spreading from the
audit sector into the consulting business, particularly from other Big
Six firms with strong consulting arms.

The poor outlook for the audit market is unlikely to be helped if the
government goes ahead with plans to drop the rule obliging listed
companies to appoint joint auditors. The government believes the joint
auditor system places too heavy a financial burden on the companies
concerned.

Although the proposal is still being considered, Bjarne Fabienke,
senior partner at KPMG, expects an amendment to the law before
Christmas. If it goes ahead, "the total audit market will be reduced",
he said.

As a result of the rule, the Big Six currently share many of Denmark's
largest companies as clients: brewing group Carlsberg is audited by
KPMG and PW; Bang & Olufsen, the electronics company, is audited by C&L
and PW; and the national postal service, Post Danmark, is audited by
Andersen and PW.

PW's Iversen believes the government is considering changing the joint
audit rule because Denmark is one of the few countries in Europe with
such a requirement. "In terms of the EU, it's a bit unusual," he said.

Last October, a law was passed which said no one audit client should be
allowed to contribute more than 20 percent of a firm's fee income.
Twelve months later, the general consensus among firms is that the
legislation has had little real effect.

Fabienke said the law does not apply to big firms in reality since one
client would never contribute 20 percent of total revenues. However,
problems might arise for smaller firms with lower overall fee income.

The aim of this legislation was to boost auditor independence, an issue
that was under the spotlight in recent years but now seems to have
moved off the agenda. "The profession's reputation was tarnished in the
late 1980s and early 1990s when there were a number of collapses and it
was automatically drawn into the debate," Iversen said. "That period is
behind us. The profession has regained its credibility."

Alongside the ongoing improvement in the Danish economy, the jobless
rate has fallen over the last year from over 12 percent to just above
10 percent. With this, some firms have reported problems finding
suitable staff. "When the market is growing it is inevitable that some
shortages arise," said Iversen at PW.

Wivel said E&Y has had problems recruiting in the Copenhagen area. It
has been doing presentations in the universities to encourage young
graduates into the firm with some success.

A more serious problem for the big international firms is insurance
cover. Legislation was introduced earlier this year requiring firms
with more than ten certified public accountants to take out national
insurance cover of DKr20 million. All the bigger firms already have
international insurance policies but the Danish authorities no longer
accept this. "We foresee extra cost to fulfil the national
requirements, even though we have international insurance with a more
extensive cover," said Haaning at C&L.

Denmark's traditional links to the Baltic have resulted in a number of
Danish accounting firms establishing a presence in the former eastern
bloc. KPMG, for example, at the request of the international firm,
established a practice in Lithuania. KPMG's Swedish and Finnish members
have set up practices in the other Baltic states, Latvia and Estonia,
respectively.

BKR International's RIR Revision owns a firm of the same name in
Poland, although earlier this year the Polish firm dropped the BKR link
and signed up with Moore Stephens. In Bulgaria, meanwhile, BDO's member
firm is owned by BDO ScanRevision.
