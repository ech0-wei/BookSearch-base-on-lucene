<H2>Testimony of Barry Steinhardt, associate director of the 
ACLU</H2>
<STRONG>April 1, 1996</STRONG> 
<PRE>


     7                    (Pause.)

     8                    MR. PRESSER:  For purposes of our written record --

     9           I am Stefan Presser -- 

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You better identify yourself.

    11                    MR. PRESSER:  I am Stefan Presser of the American

    12           Civil Liberties Union.  At this time plaintiffs would call

    13           Barry Steinhardt, who is the associate director of the

    14           American Civil Liberties Union, to the witness stand.  And as

    15           he makes his way forward we would also introduce -- or ask

    16           permission to introduce his signed declaration of March 27th,

    17           which was filed with this Court on March 28th, as the direct

    18           testimony.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have any objection?

    20                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Your Honors, Craig Blackwell again.

    21           Yes, the Government has a partial objection to the

    22           introduction of Mr. Steinhardt's affidavit.  There are

    23           certain paragraphs in the affidavit that report the substance

    24           of telephone conversations and meetings between Mr.

    25           Steinhardt and members of two commercial entities, New Media

                                                                           159

     1           Publishing and First Data Security.  I believe the paragraphs

     2           are 26, 27, 28, 29, 32 and 33, they're out-of-court

     3           statements offered for their truth and they are classic

     4           hearsay.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll accept it for what it's

     6           worth, consistent with our ruling throughout.  But continue

     7           to object, to the extent that you haven't, so it's on the

     8           record.

     9                    BARRY STEINHARDT, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

    10                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, you may be seated. 

    11           Please state and spell your name.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it's Barry, B-a-r-r-y,

    13           Steinhardt, S-t-e-i-n-h-a-r-d, as in David, -t, as in Tom.

    14                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    15           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

    16           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Steinhardt.  Could you state for the

    17           record your position at the ACLU?

    18           A   Associate director of the national office of the ACLU.

    19           Q   And you're also an attorney, correct?

    20           A   That's correct, yes.

    21           Q   The ACLU has two Internet sites, right?

    22           A   No, the ACLU has one Internet site, we also have -- we

    23           are also an information provider on America Online.

    24           Q   And your Internet site, it's a Worldwide Website,

    25           correct?

                                                                           160

     1           A   Yes.

     2           Q   And it's open to anyone with access to the Internet?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   You're site on America Online is open only to America

     5           Online subscribers, correct?

     6           A   That's correct, yes.

     7           Q   The material that the ACLU posts on its Website and

     8           America Online sites deal with civil liberties issues,

     9           correct?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 149, which should

    12           be in the binder in front of you?

    13           A   Okay.

    14           Q   That's the ACLU's home page on its Internet Worldwide

    15           Website?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   Now --

    18           A   Rather, it's its home page as it appeared at the time

    19           when this was downloaded, because the home page changes from

    20           time to time.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Please talk a little more clearly. 

    22           Sorry.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Rather, it's its home -- that is the

    24           home page as it existed at the time this particular image was

    25           downloaded, we do change the home page from time to time.

                                                                           161

     1           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

     2           Q   Has it changed since it was downloaded as it was

     3           reflected by Exhibit 149?

     4           A   Yes, it has.

     5           Q   In what sense?

     6           A   There is a second -- underneath the image, "Will justice

     7           prevail," where it says, "Tune in to debates," there is a

     8           second link; I don't remember precisely what that link is,

     9           but I noticed looking last night that there was a single link

    10           that had been added.

    11           Q   But everything else is the same?

    12           A   For the most part, yes.

    13           Q   Okay.  Now, on the right-hand side of the center icon

    14           there are numerous topics that make up the ACLU's content

    15           that it posts on the site, correct?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And the topics include, I'll name a few, separation of

    18           church and state?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   Criminal justice?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   Cyberliberties?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   Free speech?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           162

     1           Q   Lesbian and gay rights?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   Students rights?

     4           A   Yes.

     5           Q   And the rest of them are reflected there in that column

     6           on the right?

     7           A   Yes, they are.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me just for a minute.  To

     9           put the minds of those of you in the courtroom at ease as to

    10           what's going on, we have just received word that there may be

    11           a fire, but it's not in this building.

    12                    (Laughter.)

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the Marshals are here and

    14           presumably they'll come -- since they're not angry at all of

    15           us, presumably they'll come and get us or advise us if

    16           anything happens that we should know about it.  So, although

    17           it's a little -- you may have some concern or wonder.  I'm

    18           sorry to interrupt, Mr. Blackwell, but I saw Mr. Coppolino

    19           turn around.

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21                    MR. BLACKWELL:  I hope he's watching my back.

    22                    THE COURT:  He's watching all of you, my guess is.

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

    25           Q   Mr. Steinhardt, the material that the ACLU posts on its

                                                                           163

     1           Worldwide Website and America Online sites are in the ACLU's

     2           view educational, correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   And also in the ACLU's view the materials are

     5           informational?

     6           A   The -- yes, but we don't control all of the postings to

     7           our AOL site.

     8           Q   To the extent the ACLU posts content, it's in its view

     9           educational or informational -- and/or?

    10           A   Related to civil liberties, yes.

    11           Q   On the America Online site, but not on the Website, the

    12           ACLU also permits users to post messages on bulletin boards,

    13           correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And there are about a dozen bulletin board topics?

    16           A   There are actually, since we spoke at the deposition I

    17           checked, there are 20 of them.

    18           Q   20 topics?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   And the topics of the bulletin boards are designated by

    21           the ACLU, correct?

    22           A   That's correct, yes.

    23           Q   And those topics also relate to civil liberties issues?

    24           A   That's correct.

    25           Q   Which correspond roughly to the topics that are on the

                                                                           164

     1           right-hand side of Exhibit 149?

     2           A   Roughly speaking, yes.

     3           Q   Now, on the America Online site and, again, but not on

     4           the Website, the ACLU also has so-called auditorium events,

     5           correct?

     6           A   That is correct, although we do publish the transcripts

     7           of some of those auditorium events on the Website.

     8           Q   But the events themselves happen only on the America

     9           Online site, correct?

    10           A   At this point, yes.

    11           Q   Could you briefly explain for the Court what the

    12           auditorium events are?

    13           A   An auditorium event would be a session where a guest

    14           speaker would be brought in and would take questions from

    15           both a host, who is generally an ACLU staff person, and from

    16           subscribers through America Online who would post those

    17           questions by electronic mail essentially and then the

    18           responses would appear, they are real-time conversations that

    19           take place.

    20           Q   Now, the guests for these events are chosen by the ACLU,

    21           correct?

    22           A   That's correct, yes.

    23           Q   And the guest is responding to questions posed by America

    24           Online users?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           165

     1           Q   Now, there is a moderator for these events who is an ACLU

     2           employee who chooses what questions to pass on to the

     3           speaker, correct?

     4           A   It's either an ACLU employee or a volunteer who has been

     5           trained to be a moderator.

     6           Q   But the point is that the moderator passes -- chooses

     7           which questions to pass to the speaker, right?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   And the users that are participating in the auditorium

    10           events see only the question that the speaker answers,

    11           correct?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Now, the guests for these forums are nationally-known

    14           personalities who speak on civil liberties-type issues,

    15           right?

    16           A   That's generally true, yes.

    17           Q   I'm sorry?

    18           A   That is generally true, yes.

    19           Q   Guests have included the former Surgeon General of the

    20           United States, Dr. Jocelyn Elders, correct?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   Who spoke, among other things, about the reasons why she

    23           was dismissed by President Clinton?

    24           A   Yes, she spoke specifically about her references to

    25           masturbation, yes.

                                                                           166

     1           Q   And users participating in the forum discussed the

     2           appropriateness of the President's response to her comments

     3           about masturbation?

     4           A   Yes, they did, both there and in bulletin boards

     5           following Dr. Elders' appearance in this auditorium.

     6           Q   And you're concerned that those discussions about

     7           masturbation in the context of Dr. Elders' firing by

     8           President Clinton may be covered by the Communications

     9           Decency Act, correct?

    10           A   Well, there is language in certainly many of the bulletin

    11           board postings that's very similar to that which caused the

    12           FCC to bring action against Pacifica and Infinity

    13           Broadcasting.  So, yes, to the extent to which it is the

    14           Government's position that it is the same standard I am very

    15           concerned, yes.

    16           Q   You're concerned about the Elders comments?

    17           A   I am less concerned about the auditorium event than I am

    18           concerned about the bulletin boards where individual America

    19           Online subscribers discussed Dr. Elders' appearance and, in

    20           particular, masturbation and used street language, yes.

    21           Q   Now, also on the America Online site, but not on the

    22           Website, the ACLU has a chat room?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   Where users can discuss current events, right?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           167

     1           Q   And react to the events in other civil liberties issues?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   And sometimes the ACLU sets topics for discussion in the

     4           chat room, correct?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   And, again, those topics would be civil liberties issue

     7           oriented?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   Mr. Steinhardt, could you turn to Defense Exhibit 155?

    10                    (Pause.)

    11           A   Okay.

    12           Q   Now, the ACLU has posted on line the complete text of the

    13           United States Supreme Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica,

    14           right?

    15           A   That's correct.

    16           Q   And this is a downloaded version of that on-line posting,

    17           correct?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   Now, the full text of the opinion includes the Carlin

    20           monologue that was at issue --

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   -- as part of the Supreme Court's opinion?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   And the ACLU is concerned that by virtue of posting the

    25           Supreme Court's decision in Pacifica it may be subject to

                                                                           168

     1           liability under the Communications Decency Act, correct?

     2           A   Well, we have chosen to draw attention to those words as

     3           part of the -- part of the decision, yes, and they also

     4           reappear certainly in the America Online bulletin boards.

     5           Q   But you're specifically concerned about the Pacifica

     6           decision to the extent it repeats the Carlin monologue in the

     7           Supreme Court's decision, correct?

     8           A   It got Pacifica in a certain amount of trouble, yes.

     9           Q   So, you are concerned?

    10           A   Yes, certainly.

    11           Q   Now, if you could turn to Exhibit 158?  The ACLU has also

    12           posted on line an abridged version, I guess, of the amicus

    13           brief it filed in the United States Supreme Court in the

    14           Pacifica case, right?

    15           A   Yes.  It's actually the introductory portions of the

    16           brief, yes.

    17           Q   Right.  And this is what Exhibit 158 is, a downloaded

    18           version of that?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   And in that brief the ACLU sets forth the so-called seven

    21           dirty words from the Carlin monologue, right?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   And, again, the ACLU is concerned that by virtue of

    24           posting on line the brief that it filed in the United States

    25           Supreme Court in the Pacifica case it may be subject to

                                                                           169

     1           liability under the Communications Decency Act, right?

     2           A   Yes.  Again, we are concerned that by having drawn

     3           attention to that particular portion of the brief we may be

     4           subject to the Communications Decency Act, yes.

     5           Q   By drawing attention you mean having referenced the

     6           Carlin monologue in your Supreme Court brief?

     7           A   Well, we have as part of our Website a feature which

     8           allows individuals who are -- who visit our Website to in

     9           effect guess at the seven dirty words and then we take them,

    10           after they submit their answers we take them to the Pacifica

    11           decision.  So, yes, we have gone about -- attempt -- we do

    12           that for a purpose, the purpose is to illustrate that there

    13           is a changing view of what is a filthy word or what is an

    14           indecent word and that not everyone -- that everyone has a

    15           different understanding of that.  But, yes, we have chosen to

    16           draw attention to those seven words in the decision as

    17           opposed to other portions of the decision.

    18           Q   Now, the feature you're describing is in Exhibit 156 and

    19           157 of the Defendants' Exhibit notebook, right?

    20           A   Give me one second, please... yes.

    21           Q   And you're not specifically concerned that those two

    22           exhibits are in fact covered by the Communications Decency

    23           Act, right?

    24           A   Not the two exhibits themselves.

    25           Q   Now, the ACLU has also posted on line an abridged version

                                                                           170

     1           of the brief it filed in the U. S. Supreme Court in the Cohen

     2           v. California case, correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Is that at Exhibit 160, Defense Exhibit?

     5           A   That's correct, yes.

     6           Q   Now, again, the ACLU is concerned that this brief it

     7           filed in the Cohen case in the U. S. Supreme Court may be

     8           covered by the Communications Decency Act, correct?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   Now, the ACLU does not post or otherwise include in its

    11           on-line materials sexually-explicit pictures, does it?

    12           A   Well, not at this point, but that's simply because what

    13           we post relates to generally current controversies that are

    14           involved in.  So, for example, had this Website been up a few

    15           years ago when the Mapplethorpe exhibit, which was a matter

    16           that we worked on, was very much a live controversy we would

    17           not have hesitated to post those images, which as I recall

    18           were both were sexual nature and also some of them excretory.

    19           Q   You mean posting images of Robert Mapplethorpe's

    20           pictures?

    21           A   Yes, yes, we would not hesitate to do that if it were

    22           relevant to a current civil liberties controversy.

    23           Q   But just so I can get an answer to the question, the ACLU

    24           does not post sexually-explicit pictures at this point,

    25           correct?

                                                                           171

     1           A   Our Website has only been up for about six weeks, we

     2           haven't put any up yet, but we certainly don't have any

     3           policy or intention not to.

     4           Q   Okay.  And you also haven't posted pictures of sexual

     5           acts, correct, of couples engaged in sexual acts?

     6           A   No, but there are postings certainly to the AOL site

     7           which are textual descriptions, yes.

     8           Q   But you haven't posted pictures of couples engaged in

     9           sexual acts?

    10           A   No.

    11           Q   And you also haven't posted pictures of excretory

    12           activities, correct?

    13           A   No, although some of the -- I should add that we have

    14           links in our Website, also in AOL to some of the other

    15           plaintiffs in this case who do have at least illustrations

    16           which are sexual in nature.

    17           Q   And which plaintiffs are you referring to?

    18           A   Well, for example, Planned Parenthood of America has a

    19           image on its Website which shows how to properly place a

    20           condom on a penis, so that seems to be sexual in nature.

    21                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Can I have one minute, your Honor?

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

    23                    (Pause.)

    24           BY MR. BLACKWELL:  

    25           Q   You said your Website has only been up for six weeks?

                                                                           172

     1           A   Eight -- I'm sorry, if I think about it the date would be

     2           seven or eight weeks since it's been publicly announced, yes.

     3           Q   How about the AOL site?

     4           A   Approximately a year.

     5           Q   Now, individuals can apply for membership to the ACLU

     6           through the ACLU's Worldwide Website, right?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   And they can pay on-line with a credit card, correct?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   In the next few months the ACLU is going to offer

    11           merchandise for sale through its on-line site, right?

    12           A   That's correct, yes.

    13           Q   Things like books, posters, pamphlets, bumper stickers,

    14           things like that, right?

    15           A   That's pretty much the catalogue, yes.

    16           Q   And users will be able to buy the merchandise with a

    17           credit card?

    18           A   Yes, they will.

    19           Q   And the ACLU leases space on a secure server to handle

    20           these credit card transactions, right?

    21           A   Yes, we do.

    22           Q   And by secure we mean that the information, the credit

    23           card information that's transmitted is encrypted in some way?

    24           A   That's correct, yes, although not everyone has a browser

    25           which permits them to use a secure server, but about 70 or 80

                                                                           173

     1           percent do.

     2           Q   Now, in your affidavit, Mr. Steinhardt -- do you have it

     3           in front of you?

     4           A   If you'll give me a moment... okay.

     5           Q   Page 15, Paragraph 29.

     6           A   Okay.

     7           Q   You estimate there that assuming a level of traffic at

     8           the ACLU Website equivalent to that of February, '96,

     9           assuming that level of traffic at the site it would cost the

    10           ACLU approximately $144,000 per month to verify credit card

    11           information for visitors to the site, is that right?

    12           A   Well, I assumed it for that month since we don't have a

    13           great deal of experience so far with the Website, I'm not

    14           prepared to estimate the average monthly usage, so that this

    15           estimate is based on what it would have cost in that month.

    16           Q   And the cost was 144,000, correct?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Now, that figure assumes that the ACLU would be required

    19           to verify credit card information for every visitor to the

    20           Website, right?

    21           A   It does.

    22           Q   No matter what any particular visitor actually looks at

    23           at the site, right?

    24           A   We don't -- when a visitor enters the site we don't

    25           necessarily know what their intention is, which pages they're

                                                                           174

     1           going to want to access.

     2           Q   But the figure does -- would include an individual who

     3           just goes to the home page and goes no further, correct?

     4           A   That's correct.

     5           Q   That person would be included in your $144,000 figure,

     6           correct?

     7           A   That's correct, but we have no idea -- no -- at the

     8           outset when the person enters the home page whether or not

     9           they intend to go to a different page.

    10           Q   Not every visitor to the ACLU site presumably accesses

    11           the posting of the Supreme Court's decision in Pacifica,

    12           right?

    13           A   No, although a large percentage in that initial month

    14           did.

    15           Q   Now, you have participated in the creation of a Web page?

    16           A   I participated in the creation of the ACLU's Website,

    17           yes.

    18           Q   And you're generally familiar with HTML programming?

    19           A   Generally.

    20           Q   And that type of programming is becoming increasingly

    21           easy to do, isn't it, in your --

    22           A   In its simplest forms, yes.

    23           Q   Now, the ACLU plans to offer in the near future audio

    24           transmissions through its Website, correct?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           175

     1           Q   And it plans to offer transmissions of things like

     2           speeches and interviews, right?

     3           A   That's correct, yes.

     4           Q   And users will be able to hear actually the speech or

     5           interview on their home computer, correct?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   And the ACLU also plans to use audio capabilities for

     8           their chat rooms?

     9           A   At some point, yes.

    10           Q   So, users will be able to through their home computers

    11           hear themselves conversing in the chat room?

    12           A   At some point, yes.

    13           Q   And it also plans to offer in the near future video

    14           transmissions through its Website, right?

    15           A   Well, it depends how you define near future.  The three

    16           things you have mentioned, the audio transmissions would be

    17           first, and probably the video second, and ultimately the chat

    18           rooms would feature some audio capability.

    19           Q   But you do plan to offer video transmissions at some

    20           point through the Website?

    21           A   We're going to try to keep up with the technology as it

    22           evolves, yes.

    23           Q   And you're going to offer transmissions of things like

    24           speeches and interviews?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           176

     1           Q   I'm talking about video now?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   And users will be able to see a video of a speech while

     4           they're sitting at their home computer, right?

     5           A   Well, it's my understanding that at the moment the

     6           technology hasn't quite gotten there in terms of a good image

     7           that's available immediately.  We experimented, for example,

     8           on Martin Luther King Day with the possibility of showing a

     9           portion of the "I Have a Dream" speech, but at some point,

    10           yes, it will get there.

    11           Q   It will get there.  And you expect to offer interactive

    12           video features at some point as well, correct?

    13           A   We haven't discussed that, I don't know.  I would -- I

    14           don't know.

    15           Q   Thank you, Mr. Steinhardt.

    16                    MR. BLACKWELL:  I have no further questions at this

    17           point.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    19                    MR. PRESSER:  One or two, your Honor.

    20                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    21           BY MR. PRESSER:  

    22           Q   Mr. Steinhardt, in response to the Government's inquiries

    23           concerning whether or not we presently portray pictures on

    24           our Websites or on America Online you discussed that we might

    25           to the extent that we were involved in particular cases, has

                                                                           177

     1           the American Civil Liberties Union recently been involved in

     2           the Jake Baker case?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Can -- for the record --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What case?

     6                    MR. PRESSER:  For the Jake Baker case, your Honor.

     7           BY MR. PRESSER:  

     8           Q   And, for the record, can you describe for the Court what

     9           that case entailed?

    10           A   Jake Baker was a student at the University of Michigan

    11           who was involved in two controversies, which -- arguably

    12           which both -- both of which ultimately resulted in an

    13           unsuccessful prosecution:  He both posted stories, they were

    14           clearly fictional works, to some of the alt.sex bulletin

    15           boards and he also engaged in what appeared to many of us to

    16           have been a -- some fantasy conversations, E-mail

    17           conversations, private conversations with another individual

    18           who described himself as Arthur Ganda or Uganda, it was

    19           probably a pseudonym.  Baker was prosecuted in Detroit on

    20           charges essentially of conspiring to commit a kidnapping. 

    21           The ACLU did participate as amicus before the district court,

    22           the district court dismissed the charges.

    23           Q   Can I ask you to look at the Government's Exhibit 164 and

    24           would you identify that document for me, sir?

    25           A   Yes, this is a posting to one of our bulletin boards on

                                                                           178

     1           America Online in which the posters who described themselves,

     2           if you look at the from section, it says from the ACLU.  That

     3           is not the American Civil Liberties Union, that is another

     4           group which stands for Always Causing Legal Unrest, which

     5           regards itself as sort of a shadow of the ACLU, and we so far

     6           have chosen not to enforce our trademark rights.  The -- and

     7           what they have done, or an individual who says that he or she

     8           represents them, is to post one of Jake Baker's stories to

     9           the ACLU bulletin board.  It is -- we chose to -- and also in

    10           the opening paragraph to criticize the ACLU, the American

    11           Civil Liberties Union.  We chose to allow those -- that

    12           posting to stand.

    13           Q   And why did we do that?

    14           A   Because we believe that everyone has a right to free,

    15           speech even if we disagree with them, and it certainly would

    16           have made a very contrary point had we taken that off.

    17           Q   And what if any concerns as a result of this posting and

    18           as a result of the passage of the law that is in question

    19           here do we have about this posting and others of its ilk?

    20           A   Well, this posting is a very explicit discussion of not

    21           only sexual activity, but what I would describe as a rape,

    22           and it is -- it initially at least is what resulted in Jake

    23           Baker being investigated by the U. S. Attorney's Office in

    24           Detroit.  So, this goes I think probably -- arguably goes

    25           beyond indecency, but certainly could be regarded as -- by

                                                                           179

     1           some as indecent.

     2           Q   Can I get you to look at Exhibits 162 and 163 of the

     3           Government's submission?

     4           A   Okay.

     5           Q   Can you identify -- let's start with 162, can you

     6           identify that document for the Court?

     7           A   Again, 162 is a posting to one of our bulletin boards,

     8           the subject line there, "recently TOSsed," which the letters

     9           T-O-S are capitalized, I believe is a reference to America

    10           Online's terms of service.  This was a section of the

    11           bulletin board in which individuals discussed the America

    12           Online terms of service and posted some of them, posted

    13           material which either had been or they believe would have

    14           been subject to the terms of service.  In 162 it's a poem

    15           entitled "Jesus Wore High Tops," again it contains explicit

    16           sexual language and descriptions.  And I believe you asked

    17           about 163 as well?

    18           Q   163, Mr. Steinhardt.

    19           A   This is a post -- again, a posting, the subject of which,

    20           "Our words are words."  I don't recall specifically which

    21           topic area this was in, but I have a concern that the poem at

    22           the bottom of the posting, which uses a number of words which

    23           might be regarded as indecent, at least one of which I recall

    24           is among the seven words in the Carlin case, that goes on to

    25           Page 2, that those -- that the posting of this poem might be

                                                                           180

     1           regarded as an act of indecency.

     2                    MR. PRESSER:  I have no further questions, your

     3           Honor.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government have any

     5           redirect?

     6                    MR. BLACKWELL:  No, your Honor.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't have any question, do

     8           you, I mean, as somebody who has litigated in this field for

     9           a long time, that these last exhibits would be considered

    10           patently offensive to some parts of the community?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  I... I'm having difficulty

    12           understanding precisely what the statute is attempting to

    13           reach, but I certainly know that many -- there are many

    14           communities in which these postings would be regarded as

    15           patently offensive, yes.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  These particular ones?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, leaving these aside, because I

    19           guess my question was superseded by the last couple of

    20           questions of Mr. Presser, I think it might be fair to say

    21           that you are an expert in matters relating to free speech and

    22           legal affairs relating to free speech in this country, do you

    23           -- modesty not withstanding, would you accept that?

    24                    (Laughter.)

    25                    THE WITNESS:  I'm certainly familiar, very familiar,

                                                                           181

     1           yes, your Honor.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How realistic or maybe exaggerated

     3           do you think your concern and the concern expressed

     4           throughout is the concern that if you put Hamlet on line or

     5           the Bible on line, which came up in some colloquy between the

     6           Court and some witnesses for the plaintiff, that would

     7           subject them, one, to being prosecuted and, two, to being

     8           convicted?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's been our experience as an

    10           organization that represents many people who have been the

    11           victims of what we regard as censorship that community

    12           standards do vary and that not infrequently the kind of

    13           material that the Court and I might view as artistic or as

    14           having merit --

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, talk about yourself and the

    16           Court will talk about itself.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry.  The kind of material that

    18           you referenced, your Honor, has been the subject of efforts

    19           of censorship, that's the kind of material that has been

    20           removed from high school libraries, that is the kind of

    21           material that has been removed from public libraries or there

    22           have been attempts to remove it from public libraries.  There

    23           are many people out there who regard that kind of material as

    24           indecent.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How much does it cost, I'm not sure

                                                                           182

     1           you can give us an answer, how much does it cost for the ACLU

     2           to engage in litigation, were it required to, either on its

     3           own behalf or on behalf of somebody else to -- well, like

     4           this Jake somebody case --

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Baker.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- Baker case.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we were actually amicus in that

     8           case, but we have been direct in other cases, including the

     9           time for example of a staff attorney on such a case, a case

    10           like this one where we have several staff attorneys work --

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, this one you're a plaintiff

    12           in.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, but where we have represented

    14           other parties we could -- including the time of staff

    15           attorneys, the costs can be in the hundreds of thousands of

    16           dollars.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In one case?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, cases often go on for an extended

    19           period of time.  Our attorneys are underpaid compared perhaps

    20           to the private bar, but they still -- those of us who are

    21           employed in New York still make a fairly healthy salary.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, I was just reading your

    24           declaration and -- 

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  They don't think so.

                                                                           183

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- understanding that your

     2           admissions -- what was that?

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, that was whether they make a

     4           healthy salary.

     5                    (Laughter.)

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Counsel is not prepared to adopt that

     7           part of the testimony.

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I wanted the byplay on this

    10           healthy salary to continue, but --

    11                    (Laughter.)

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- that's all right.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  You can tell, your Honor, I'm an

    14           administrator.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    MR. HANSEN:  Labor-management problem.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, Judge Buckwalter was

    18           questioning.

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's all right.  I was reading

    20           your declaration about the mission and the purpose of the

    21           ACLU and that it's really contrary -- or that putting any of

    22           these defenses into the use is contrary to your mission, I

    23           believe you stated.  And you went on to state that if you

    24           were forced to bear the cost of restrictions on the use of

    25           the Website by the use of -- by a debit account or an adult

                                                                           184

     1           access code you would shut down the Website, for how long?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, I would --

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I can't -- I mean, you would

     4           certainly not envision that you couldn't come back and get

     5           the Website up and running again --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  If we were forced to go for example to

     7           credit card verification of persons who use the Website we

     8           simply could not bear the expense.

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You really do?  I mean, after a

    10           period of time don't you think you could get the money needed

    11           to do that sort of thing?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we --

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I mean, at first, sure, it's

    14           going to be an expense, but once you get the program

    15           together...

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there would be ongoing expenses.

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You're certainly not going to --

    18           want to close your Website entirely for that reason, would

    19           you?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  The problem, your Honor, is that there

    21           would be ongoing expenses, both to verify new users who wish

    22           to use the site and also to maintain a data base, a list --

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand that.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  -- of registrants.  And our site has

    25           proven to be so far relatively popular.  Given the cost

                                                                           185

     1           estimates that we have received, the yearly -- it's not

     2           possible to know precisely, but the yearly costs could be

     3           from our perspective extraordinary, it would dwarf the costs

     4           that -- of the site so far.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Extraordinary in what -- do you

     6           have a percentage of your --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, as I tried to illustrate in the

     8           example that appears in Paragraph 29 of my affidavit, in the

     9           first month alone just the transactional cost would have been

    10           $134,000, by which I mean the cost of verifying that each of

    11           those -- minimum of 67,000 persons who entered our site in

    12           fact had a valid credit card, and that does not include any

    13           costs that would have been imposed on us by the banks to do

    14           that kind of verification, which is something that we cannot

    15           estimate at this point because we have been unable to locate

    16           a bank which will regularly engage in the verification of

    17           non-financial transactions.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I suppose if there is a market

    19           for that type of thing wouldn't that -- a market for a bank

    20           to devise a verification system or something like that, won't

    21           the market forces more or less make that feasible in some

    22           way?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Adam Smith thought.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Adam Smith thought, yes, right.

                                                                           186

     1                    THE WITNESS:  If they do -- they don't exist now and

     2           I don't know what they would -- I don't know what they would

     3           cost.  I do know that they would cost something and I assume

     4           they would probably be a flat fee rather than a percentage,

     5           since there is nothing to take a percentage of, but I can't

     6           speculate at this point, nor could those persons in the

     7           credit card industry that I spoke with speculate about what

     8           those costs would be, but they would be -- even assuming that

     9           they were, say, a dollar, they would be more than we can bear

    10           at this point, significantly more than our entire on-line

    11           budget.

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  It just strikes me as

    13           being maybe exaggerating the suggestion, close down your

    14           Website forever and ever, I can't imagine in this world a

    15           cyberspace that you would do that, that you wouldn't be able

    16           to find a way to, you know, keep it going and incur -- and

    17           some way make the money for those additional costs.  But I

    18           understand the analysis you did seem to suggest at least

    19           initially it might be difficult for you to do it.

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we have limited funds, as do all

    21           non-profits, and we have to make decisions on how to spend

    22           those funds.  We made a decision that the current expenditure

    23           that we make on the Website and on the America Online site

    24           delivers a sufficient amount of program for the amount of

    25           expenditure.  This kind of expenditure at least at this point

                                                                           187

     1           would not be justified, we would find other things --

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  At least initially it appears

     3           that way, okay.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have a few -- are you done?  I'm

     6           sorry.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, I am, thank you.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A few questions about your

     9           materials.  I noticed, I think it was on the Website, that

    10           you had a request to your members to communicate with

    11           Attorney General Reno about this law?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you know, does she have an E-mail

    14           address?

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know if she has an E-mail

    17           address, but I can't resist telling your Honor that we

    18           actually at one point published a phone number which we

    19           believed was just a general line going into the Justice

    20           Department and at least on two occasions that I am aware of

    21           Attorney General Reno herself answered those phone calls.

    22                    (Laughter.)

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Not bad.  Well, what I'm getting as

    24           is I noticed in Senator Leahy's supplemental declaration that

    25           he has a Website, he has an E-mail address and he says he

                                                                           188

     1           conducts town meetings on the Internet.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are you aware in the course of your

     4           work as to whether other Representatives and Senators do the

     5           same thing?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  I couldn't give you an exact

     7           percentage at this point, but a significant number of members

     8           of Congress have E-mail addresses, some have Websites.  When

     9           we ask our members or users of these sites to communicate

    10           with members of Congress we offer them several possibilities: 

    11           One, if their member has an E-mail address we provide them

    12           with that E-mail address --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I was going to -- you

    14           give them the E-mail address?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Or we -- or if they have a fax

    16           number, they virtually all do, we would send them a fax.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So, as far as based on

    18           your personal knowledge, Senator Leahy is not unique in that

    19           respect?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  I think it's far from unique, yes.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  With respect to

    22           Paragraph 36 of your declaration, do I understand correctly

    23           that your Website provides abortifacient information?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  It provides links to such information,

    25           yes.

                                                                           189

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  About RU46 --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  46.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- and that sort of thing?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is that a recent service since

     6           February 1, 1996, or is that older?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, on the Website it is, but in our

     8           normal course of business litigating in this area we

     9           certainly have provided information to both clients, the

    10           general public providers, and they have provided information

    11           to us, discussing abortifacients and discussing abortion

    12           services in general.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, this is a service that you give

    14           on an ongoing basis via the Internet?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Not only by the Internet, but

    16           including the Internet, yes.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And, lastly, I don't know if

    18           you've been here for our discussion about the PICS idea --

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  For --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Assuming -- pardon me?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, your Honor, go ahead.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Assuming a PICS rating system

    23           becomes operational this summer, would the ACLU rate itself?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Well, as I understand the PICS

    25           proposal or the PICS system, it's in effect an empty vessel

                                                                           190

     1           into which third-party rating systems can be put.  And self-

     2           rating is not required by PICS, as I understand it, having

     3           read their literature.  I don't think the ACLU would choose

     4           to rate itself, but I am certain that there are others who

     5           would.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, the reason I ask is because,

     7           as I understand the stipulation and the testimony, that the

     8           default is that if you don't rate yourself you're blocked,

     9           isn't that what you have all agreed to by stipulation?  Well,

    10           assume it is --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  I have not read that particular

    12           stipulation, so I don't know.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- therefore, you wouldn't be

    14           accessed by -- if you don't rate yourself you won't be

    15           accessed by those who block via PICS, correct?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I'm just not certain about the factual

    17           predicate of that, I don't know the answer.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But your point, I take it you're

    19           high enough in the hierarchy that you can say with some

    20           authority that you would not rate yourself?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I had not understood that point

    22           that -- that we would be blocked if we failed to rate, but it

    23           is my understanding of PICS that there are -- that the user

    24           can employ any number --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But that's one of them --

                                                                           191

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is the default mode, that if you

     3           don't rate, you're blocked, assume that's true.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Assuming that's true?

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not high enough up to make that

     7           decision on the spur of the moment.

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If you were, though, what would it

    10           be?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  I can't answer that, I would have to

    12           think about it, it's the first time --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And if you had to rate yourself what

    14           would you rate yourself, using the motion picture rating

    15           system that we've been using here?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we think that we offer material

    17           that's of important educational interest to minors, so I

    18           suppose we would rate ourselves G, but I can imagine that

    19           there are other third parties who would rate us X.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  NC-17.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  NC-17.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, that's all I have.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I would imagine as a matter of

    24           principle, couldn't one deduce from the history of the ACLU,

    25           about which I don't know a lot, that you might object as a

                                                                           192

     1           matter of principle to rating yourselves, whether or not you

     2           would rate yourselves G or anything else?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we would object to being forced

     4           to rate ourselves, yes.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we're going to find out more

     6           about PICS, Mr. Coppolino promised us that he would educate

     7           us on that in due course, I assume.  So, we'll have to put

     8           that together with this.

     9                    Do you have any more?

    10                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I don't.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Counsel?

    12                    MR. PRESSER:  Nothing further, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Government?

    14                    MR. BLACKWELL:  Nothing further, your Honor.

    15                    (Witness excused.)

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do I understand, Mr. Coppolino, with

    17           respect to the abortifacient provision, which I think is

    18           1462(c)?

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, your Honor, 18 USC, I believe.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The Government -- that part at least

    21           of the statute the Government is conceding is

    22           unconstitutional?

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  That's what I stated at the TRO

    24           hearing and --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You did?

                                                                           193

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  -- Attorney General Reno has so

     2           stated in a letter I believe to both Speaker Gingrich and

     3           Vice President Gore, as President of the Senate.  I believe

     4           those are in the record, if not I can provide them to the

     5           Court.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we just wanted to --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I just want to confirm that for

    10           purposes of the preliminary injunction -- I know it was for

    11           the TRO, but for purposes of this hearing that that is not an

    12           issue, because the Government concedes the point.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We don't believe it is an issue

    14           because -- we have stated that the provision in the Justice

    15           Department's view is unconstitutional.  We also indicated,

    16           however, at the TRO stage that because the Attorney General

    17           has indicated that there would be no prosecutions there could

    18           be no demonstration of irreparable harm, and that would be

    19           our position as well at the PI stage and, therefore, no need

    20           for an injunction on the statute at this stage.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  Anything else?

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess not.  We will then adjourn,

    23           scheduled at the moment --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, we'll recess --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we'll recess --

                                                                           194

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- until the 12th, but I believe

     2           counsel would like to see me -- unless there is something

     3           else from the plaintiffs now?

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you, Mr. Steinhardt, you

     5           don't have to stay there.

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  No, your Honors, let me simply state

     7           that the plaintiffs do not rest because we are going to be

     8           calling Mr. Vaysa (ph.) during the time allotted for the

     9           Government's case, and there may be a couple of other

    10           housekeeping details to take care of then, but that would

    11           conclude our live witnesses.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, very good.  So, why don't

    13           we meet in 15 minutes in the robing room for a status

    14           conference, counsel?

    15                    ALL COUNSEL:  Thank you, your Honor.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And we'll see you on the 12th at

    17           9:30 for the Government's case.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Lawyers do not rest, period.

    19                    (Laughter.)

    20                    (Court adjourned at 2:54 o'clock p.m.)

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning, everyone.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have no preliminary, anything?

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I don't think so.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So we'll proceed with plaintiffs'

    18           case.

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  Good morning, your Honors, the

    20           plaintiffs call Professor Donna Hoffman.

    21                    THE COURT CLERK:  Will you please state and spell

    22           your name?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Donna L. Hoffman, D-o-n-n-a L. 

    24           H-o-f-f-m-a-n.

    25                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please raise your right hand.

                                                                             4

     1                    DONNA L. HOFFMAN, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

     2                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you, please be seated.

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, I'd move into evidence the

     4           declaration of Professor Hoffman which was signed on March

     5           15, 1996, and previously filed in this court as her direct

     6           testimony.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection from the

     8           Government?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Yes, we object, your Honor.

    10                    THE COURT:  Okay, then you better come forward and

    11           tell us why.

    12                    MR. BARON:  I'd appreciate the opportunity for voir

    13           dire.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, well, certainly to the extent

    15           you object, to the extent of you wanted some voir dire?

    16                    MR. BARON:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Mr. Hansen, I was curious

    18           myself.  Dr. Hoffman is offered as an expert in what area? 

    19           It doesn't say in her declaration.

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  I apologize, your Honor.  Dr. Hoffman

    21           is an expert in the marketing aspects of cyberspace and the

    22           nature of cyberspace as it relates to marketing and usage.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So that would be in the

    24           marketing of cyberspace and --

    25                    MR. HANSEN:  And the nature of cyberspace.

                                                                             5

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The nature of cyberspace.  Okay, by

     2           all means, Mr. Baron.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me just for a minute.  

     4                    (Discussion off the record.)

     5                    MR. BARON:  Good morning, your Honors.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning.

     7                    MR. BARON:  Good morning, Professor Hoffman.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Good morning.

     9                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   Your expertise is as a Professor of Marketing, is it not?

    12           A   Yes, I'm a Professor of Management in the Marketing

    13           Division at the Owens School at Vanderbilt University.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron, we know who you are but

    15           because it's a new day's tape, maybe you should tell the

    16           tape.

    17                    MR. BARON:  O for two on that.  Yes, my name is

    18           Jason R. Baron, B-a-r-o-n, U.S. Department of Justice.  Than

    19           you, your Honor.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   Professor Hoffman, you study strategic implications of

    22           commercializing new communications media, do you not?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   Your CV which is I believe Plaintiff's Exhibit 1 in this

    25           case lists no peer reviewed references concerning empirical

                                                                             6

     1           studies or surveys that you have conducted on the amount of

     2           pornography on the Internet, is that right?

     3           A   Yes, that's correct.

     4           Q   Nor are there any references on your CV to any surveys at

     5           all that you have conducted on the Internet, correct?

     6           A   There's no peer reviewed published studies of any surveys

     7           yet, that's correct.

     8           Q   Or non-peer reviewed?

     9           A   Yes.

    10           Q   Studies that you have conducted?

    11           A   Right, not yet, that's -- we're in the process of a paper

    12           right now but it is not submitted for peer review.

    13           Q   Your CV doesn't contain any references to studies you

    14           have done concerning the extent of pornography in

    15           communication media other than the Internet, is that correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   In fact, as you stated in your deposition this past

    18           Monday, you are not interested in pornography as a research

    19           area, correct?

    20           A   Yes, that's correct.

    21           Q   Would you turn to Paragraph 122 of your declaration which

    22           has been submitted in this action?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   You state in this declaration that it is your, quote,

    25           "impression," unquote, that there is a decreasing percentage

                                                                             7

     1           of the material in cyberspace that is sexually explicit, is

     2           that correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Let me turn to your deposition of Monday at Page 185.  In

     5           response to a question, this was starting around Line 13, in

     6           response to my question asking you that you will say that it

     7           is your impression regarding the amount of sexually explicit

     8           material in cyberspace, you answered: "Based on my own

     9           experience," this is Line 15, "and observation and the

    10           experience and observations of others who are Net veterans,

    11           that is the conventional wisdom."

    12                    Question:  "You're relying on conventional wisdom to

    13           make those observations?"

    14                    Answer:  "Yes, and experience."

    15                    Question:  "And experience?"

    16                    Answer:  "Yes."

    17                    Question:  "Including your experience in looking at

    18           particular sites on the Net?"

    19                    Answer:  "Right."

    20                    Question: "But not in a systematic matter?"

    21                    Answer: "Correct."

    22                    Question:  "Not in a scientific sample?"

    23                    Answer:  "Right.  And using -- that's correct,

    24           that's right."

    25                    Question:  "These are impressions?"

                                                                             8

     1                    Answer:  "These are impressions."

     2                    Question:  "Unquantified?"

     3                    Answer:  "Unquantified."

     4                    Did you state that testimony?

     5           A   Yes, I did.  And I --

     6                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.  

     7                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, I'd like the witness to be

     8           able to finish her response to that question.  I believe she

     9           thought that the question required or the answer required

    10           elaboration.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Go ahead.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  I've been studying the strategic

    13           marketing implications of commercializing emerging media like

    14           the World Wide Web on the Internet since 1983.  I've been co-

    15           director of a sponsored research center since 1994, so for

    16           the past three years I've been studying activity on the World

    17           Wide Web.

    18                    One of the papers that we have written, the

    19           commercial scenarios paper, "Opportunities and Challenges"

    20           which is published in a peer review journal, examines all of

    21           the commercial Web sites for the purpose of categorizing

    22           them.  In the process of preparing that paper and all the

    23           other papers that we have published I have extensive

    24           experience surfing the Web both professionally and personally

    25           and my impressions are based on that professional experience.

                                                                             9

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me, don't --  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you can sit back.  You don't

     3           need to get close to the microphone, it's extremely

     4           sensitive.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Sorry, okay.

     6           BY MR. BARON:   

     7           Q   Professor Hoffman, have you published any article on the

     8           subject of anonymous remailing on the Internet?

     9           A   No.

    10           Q   Have you conducted any studies on anonymous remailing on

    11           the Internet?

    12           A   No.

    13                    MR. BARON:  Your Honors, I would submit at this time

    14           that Professor Hoffman is an expert with respect to the

    15           commercialization of the Net and marketing questions. 

    16           However, to the extent she presents testimony today on her

    17           impressions regarding pornography on the Internet, they are

    18           as a lay person and not as an expert.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, well, that point is noted

    20           and I'm sure you'll develop it further in your cross-

    21           examination of Dr. Hoffman.

    22                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But I take it, based on what you

    24           said, you do not dispute that she is qualified as an expert

    25           in the marketing of cyberspace and the nature of cyberspace,

                                                                            10

     1           at least commercial cyberspace?

     2                    MR. BARON:  We don't dispute that.  Let me make it

     3           very specific.  When I objected to her declaration, parsing

     4           the declaration in terms of the area of her expertise and the

     5           area that she's giving lay testimony we would submit that

     6           Paragraphs 114 through 132 of her declaration are not expert

     7           opinion.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  114 through 132.  Well, you can

     9           certainly develop that in detail in your cross-examination if

    10           you'd like, but I see your point.

    11                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    13           BY MR. BARON:  

    14           Q   Good morning, Professor Hoffman.

    15           A   Good morning.

    16           Q   You have studied the Internet from a marketing

    17           perspective, correct?

    18           A   Yes, from a marketing perspective and from a

    19           communications perspective.

    20           Q   And you specifically studied the commercialization of the

    21           Net, correct?

    22           A   One of my research interest has to do with the

    23           commercialization of the World Wide Web on the Internet,

    24           that's correct.  Another one of my research interests has to

    25           do with how consumers behave in this environment and how

                                                                            11

     1           people communicate in this environment.

     2           Q   And you've coined a few terms along the way, have you

     3           not?

     4           A   Yes.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Not acronyms, I hope.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  No -- well, sort of.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    MR. BARON:  In part, your Honors, in part.

     9           BY MR. BARON:  

    10           Q   Would you turn to Page 25 -- sorry, Paragraph 25 of your

    11           declaration and could you please explain to the Court what

    12           you are referring to by the term in italics, "Hyper media

    13           computer mediated environment (CME)"?

    14           A   The term "hyper media computer mediated environment,

    15           which I agree is a mouthful, which is why we've shortened it

    16           to CME which is much easier to say has to do with the idea of

    17           defining a new medium like the World Wide Web on the Internet

    18           as a communications medium in which people can both provide

    19           an access, multi-media content that is also hyperlinked.  

    20                    So in other words, from the demonstration we saw

    21           yesterday, the information that's available on the Webpage is

    22           what we would call hypermedia because there's sound

    23           information there, there's textual information there, there's

    24           information contained in the context of these hyperlinks or

    25           hot links and all of this information is available in what we

                                                                            12

     1           call a distributed computer environment.  

     2                    So it's an environment in which people can

     3           communicate with each other but that communication is

     4           mediated or takes place through a computer.  So that's the

     5           context or the sense in which we mean computer mediated

     6           environment or CME because it's designed to illustrate the

     7           idea that when people are communicating, the communication is

     8           through the computer or when they're providing content

     9           through the medium, that computer mediates the content or

    10           mediates the way they access the content.  So, for example,

    11           the point and click with the mouse movement or putting the

    12           information on the computer.

    13           Q   Would one example of sound on the Internet be Internet

    14           Talk Radio?

    15           A   Yes, that would be one example of audio or sound.  Now--

    16           Q   And what's your understanding of Internet Talk Radio?

    17           A   Well, in a -- in a non-technical sense?

    18           Q   Yes.

    19           A   My understanding of Internet Talk Radio is that it is an

    20           application which is very much like radio but is served up or

    21           facilitated in a computer environment so that information is

    22           stored on someone's computer which is in the context of sound

    23           and then a person can click on a link which has to do with

    24           that talk radio and then listen to whatever has been

    25           programmed by someone.

                                                                            13

     1           Q   Thank you.  If you could turn to Paragraph 44 of your

     2           declaration, you have in italics the term "Telepresence

     3           View," unquote, of mediated communication.  Could you inform

     4           the Court what you're referring to there?

     5           A   Yes.  First I should say I did not invent the term

     6           "telepresence," that was attributed to Jonathan Steuer who

     7           wrote his doctoral dissertation at Stanford on that topic. 

     8           However, it's a very interesting concept and the idea is that

     9           there are two different ways that people can perceive that

    10           they're in an environment.  One way is what we might call the

    11           presence view, in other words, I perceive that I am in this

    12           physical environment and so I have a presence of being here. 

    13           The other way is that I can have a telepresence view, in

    14           other words, I can have a perception that I am in the

    15           mediated environment, in other words, that I am involved in

    16           what's happening on the World Wide Web.  And both of those

    17           perceptions can take place when people are interacting in a

    18           computer-mediated environment like the World Wide Web.

    19           Q   Could you also turn to now Paragraph 73 of your

    20           declaration, that's on Page 17, and --

    21           A   I'm sorry, would you repeat the paragraph, please?

    22           Q   Paragraph 73. 

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 17.

    24           BY MR. BARON:  

    25           Q   And inform the Court what you mean by the concept of,

                                                                            14

     1           quote, "flow," f-l-o-w, unquote, in terms of an individual's

     2           experience on the Net.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Why don't you put on that light, Mr.

     4           Hansen, so she can see better?  That little light.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The thing under the green.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Known as a lamp.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's very old-fashioned.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  L-a-m-p stands for nothing.

    10                    (Laughter.)

    11                    MR. BARON:  Don't be so sure, your Honor.

    12                    (Laughter.)

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Touche.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, the concept of flow was first

    15           developed by a psychologist who developed it in the context

    16           of activities like, for example, rock climbing, playing

    17           chess, dancing, listening to music and other sorts of

    18           activities like that.  And the idea -- and we have extended

    19           it to describe what happens in computer-mediated environments

    20           when people are engaging in interactive relationships in

    21           those environments.  

    22                    And it is a process or an experience that

    23           individuals engage in and the first thing that happens is

    24           people pay attention to what's going on in the environment,

    25           then they have an experience of being totally immersed in the

                                                                            15

     1           environment which they perceive as being very enjoyable.

     2                    As a consequence of engaging in this flow experience

     3           a number of nice things happen.  For example, people report

     4           increased learning in the environment, they report being very

     5           satisfied by the experience in the environment, they engage

     6           in more exploratory and participatory behaviors which means

     7           they're more likely to try to explore and find out more

     8           things in the environment and they perceive a sense of being

     9           in control in the environment.

    10                    So we have used the construct or the concept of flow

    11           to describe how people experience being in an environment

    12           like the World Wide Web.

    13           BY MR. BARON:  

    14           Q   And finally, Professor Hoffman, in terms of definitions

    15           what do you mean by these terms that you've referred to in

    16           your writings as information bank or knowledge base for

    17           future memory?  Are you familiar with those terms?

    18           A   Yes, you're talking about the external memory concept

    19           that we've developed, is that correct?

    20           Q   I believe so.

    21           A   The idea there is in an environment like the World Wide

    22           Web there is a unique facility for people to be able to

    23           remember things without having to write them down and that is

    24           through the Bookmark facility which is a feature of browsers

    25           like Netscape, for example.

                                                                            16

     1                    So as I am surfing, for example, through the World

     2           Wide Web and I move through cyberspace clicking on links that

     3           attract my interest or that I'd like to learn more about, if

     4           I see something that I want to remember because I might want

     5           to come back another time, I can store it in my Bookmark, as

     6           we saw our demonstration yesterday.

     7                    And in a marketing or consumer context that could

     8           lead to what we call external memory because in a, for

     9           example, a product purchase sense, if I see some information

    10           about an automobile and I want to go back at another time,

    11           maybe I'm interested in buying a Saab but today I'm just

    12           going to surf but get some information about it but maybe

    13           next week I want to go back because I don't remember where

    14           that link was, but the Bookmark facility allows me to

    15           remember without having to store it up here and we call that

    16           external memory.

    17           Q   Would it be fair to say --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me.

    19                    MR. BARON:  Oh, sorry.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is user net navigation as you use it

    21           in here synonymous with surf?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  One part, surfing is one part of the

    23           network navigation or user navigation experience.  We

    24           identify two types of network navigation, one which we call

    25           experiential which is browsing or surfing just for fun, just

                                                                            17

     1           to sort of see what's out there and it's something we would

     2           consider to be very ritualized, or in the psychological

     3           parlance something we call hedonic which means it's fun and

     4           we, you know, get a lot of pleasure from it.

     5                    The other type of user navigation or network

     6           navigation we refer to as goal directed and not that that

     7           wouldn't be fun, but in other words, I have a purpose, I am

     8           looking specifically for some information about Saabs today.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Got it, thank you.

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   Would it be fair to say, Professor Hoffman, that your

    12           work in this area involves how adults as opposed to children

    13           experience the World Wide Web and the Internet?

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   There aren't any studies, are there, on whether children

    16           have a similar flow experience in the context of a hypermedia

    17           computer mediated environment, correct?

    18           A   That's correct.

    19           Q   And so far as you are aware there has been no scholarly

    20           research done on children's ability to build an information

    21           memory bank or bookmarks, as you said, based on experiences

    22           good and bad while on the net, correct?

    23           A   That's correct.

    24           Q   Please tell the Court what you mean by Net surfing? 

    25           There was a question but why don't we go over it again.

                                                                            18

     1           A   By surfing I mean the process of, as I said before,

     2           experiential behavior or activities on the World Wide Web by

     3           browsing for information in which I have no particular goal

     4           to find a particular piece of information and there's two

     5           important components of the surfing process.  One could be

     6           I'm surfing or browsing because I have an enduring or an

     7           ongoing relationship with the computer, so it's the computer

     8           itself that I'm interested in and I just surf every day

     9           because I like the computer, for example.

    10                    The other type of surfing or browsing behavior could

    11           occur -- and these aren't mutually exclusive -- would be that

    12           I have an enduring or an ongoing interest with the sorts of

    13           things that I'm surfing for.  So those might be information

    14           about automobiles or information about stocks, financial

    15           information, information about companies, scholarly

    16           information, you know, there's an entire gamut of things.

    17                    And so maybe tomorrow I'm -- or today I would surf

    18           for information and see what was the latest information in an

    19           on-line magazine, for example, or I might want to find

    20           something about my favorite writer, that sort of thing.  And

    21           so it's not particularly direct and I'm not looking for

    22           something specific, I just want to see what's out there in a

    23           general sense.

    24           Q   Would it be fair to say -- well, let me read you a

    25           portion of your deposition and see whether you agree to it. 

                                                                            19

     1           This is on this point.  I'm paraphrasing from Page 72, Line

     2           3.  "If you are looking just to browse to just look for

     3           something for fun, say, because you're interested in cars,

     4           for example, but nothing specific, you might enter the word

     5           cars and then tens of thousands of documents would appear and

     6           you would choose one of those and you would click on it and

     7           off, click on and off, and that would take you to a

     8           particular Web site, whatever caught your fancy.  From there

     9           you could click on something else and go somewhere else, you

    10           can go using the back key, for example, or one of the browser

    11           navigation aids, a Netscape."

    12                    Tell the Court that in the deposition is a third

    13           tense rather than first tense, but is that statement correct?

    14           A   Yes, it's correct.

    15           Q   Okay.  Thank you.  Now, children under the age of 18 Net

    16           surf, don't they?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   At the deposition this past Monday however you stated

    19           that you know, quote, "next to nothing," unquote, about the

    20           behavior of children on the Internet, correct?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   You haven't studied what kind of use children make of the

    23           World Wide Web, correct?

    24           A   That's correct. 

    25           Q   Or any of the other Internet applications including FTP,

                                                                            20

     1           Usenet, Gofer, et cetera, correct?

     2           A   That's correct.

     3           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 57, the books are

     4           on your left at the bottom, and it's the second volume?  MR.

     5           BARON:  It's in the second volume, your Honors.

     6           BY MR. BARON:  

     7           Q   Do you see Exhibit 57?

     8           A   Yes, I do.

     9           Q   Could you describe for the Court what this is?

    10           A   This is a -- we might call it a newsletter or a summary

    11           example of some research that's being conducted at Carnegie

    12           Mellon University under the name of Homenet and it's a five-

    13           year or they're hoping five-year but right now it's multi-

    14           year field trial of residential Internet use in the

    15           Pittsburgh area.

    16           Q   The Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie

    17           Mellon is a respected research center and institution,

    18           correct?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   If you would turn to what is Subpart 4.4 on Page 3 of

    21           this exhibit?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   The subsection says "Teens Lead the Family," do you see

    24           that?

    25           A   Yes, I do.

                                                                            21

     1           Q   Is it correct to say that the study found that the

     2           heaviest use -- users of the Net in 48 families studied were

     3           teenage children?

     4           A   Yes, that's correct.

     5           Q   Do you rely on this study in your own research as what

     6           you consider to be the first credible study of the

     7           consumption experience in the home regarding the Internet?

     8           A   Yes.  I use this study as background information for both

     9           the empirical work that we're conducting and our theoretical

    10           work because it is the first study that has actually put

    11           computers in the home.  However, the study has to be

    12           qualified on a number of important dimensions.  One is it's

    13           taking place in the Pittsburgh area which is a major urban

    14           center in the United States.  Another is that it only has 48

    15           families and so that is an extremely small sample, so we have

    16           to be very careful about drawing broad conclusions about

    17           behavior.  However, I think the results are very interesting

    18           and can be useful for suggesting some trends.

    19                    Another qualification or limitation is that the

    20           families were solicited on the basis of locating high school

    21           students who were on the school papers at the high schools

    22           that they attended so you would expect that these journalism

    23           students in high school and being editors of the paper or

    24           else writers for the paper would be lead users of the

    25           computer.  So in that sense the results will suggest what's

                                                                            22

     1           happening with lead users or pioneers and are not indicative

     2           of the general population.

     3           Q   May I ask that you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 44 which

     4           may be in the first volume by your side?  My apologies, I

     5           think your exhibits are in both volumes so we're going to go

     6           back and forth. 

     7           A   That's okay.

     8                    (Pause.)

     9           A   Okay.

    10           Q   Do you recall my showing you what are statistics from the

    11           Census Bureau?

    12           A   Yes, I do.

    13           Q   If you would turn to page 2 of the exhibit, do you see

    14           the Table A, "Level of Access and Use of Computers: 1984,

    15           1989 and 1993," where the numbers are in thousands?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   Maybe it would be helpful, can you summarize just what

    18           this table is attempting to get at?

    19           A   Yes.  This -- this is from the CPS or the current

    20           population census from 1993, I believe, and what it is

    21           attempting to show are the trends in access and use of

    22           computers in the United States over the last decade or so for

    23           children and for adults.  Would you like me to say more?

    24           Q   You stated in your deposition that while you didn't

    25           dispute these figures, to you they represented an upper

                                                                            23

     1           bound, correct?

     2           A   Yes, that's correct.  I do research on the use and access

     3           of the Internet and am engaged right now in an empirical

     4           study of those aspects and in fact a very interesting

     5           research question from my perspective is what it means to ask

     6           someone if they have access to a computer and what are they

     7           thinking when you ask them that question and what sort of

     8           information do you get.  And also what does it mean when you

     9           ask someone if they use a computer and what sort of

    10           information you get.  And one conclusion we are coming to is

    11           that the access question is an upper bound on use because it

    12           tends to evoke an awareness type of response.

    13                    When you ask someone if they have access to

    14           something it seems to suggest in their minds, oh, well, I

    15           know about it, I'm aware of it, yeah, I have access because

    16           my neighbor down the street has a computer and so in that

    17           sense I believe I might have access.

    18                    The use question tends to be more, a little bit more

    19           specific because now you're actually asking somebody do you

    20           actually use a computer and so as you can see from the table

    21           here for 1993 the access figures are higher than the use

    22           figures.  And so you expect to see this winnowing down effect

    23           as you get more specific in the type of usage questions you

    24           ask someone and in fact I would expect -- and these data do

    25           not show it because they're so aggregate -- that if we say

                                                                            24

     1           well, do you use a computer every day the number would be

     2           much, much smaller.

     3           Q   All right, well, thank you.  These --

     4           A   You know, I have a point to make about this table which I

     5           noticed which is -- I'm sorry, may I?

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, excuse me.  

     7                    (Discussion off the record.)

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, there's no objection.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I'm sure --

    10                    MR. BARON:  I have no objection, your Honor.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You have an objection?

    12                    MR. BARON:  I have no objection, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, he has no objection.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, go ahead.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I -- the point that I want to make, I

    17           think, illustrates the difficulties involved in trying to

    18           measure access and use of computer networks or use of

    19           computers or use of the Internet.  For example, if you'll

    20           look at column -- the first set of numbers under "Number" and

    21           you'll see 1993, it says "Do you have access to a computer,"

    22           it's for three to 17 year olds, and the number given is

    23           17,829,000 people in the United States in 1993 between the

    24           ages of three and 17 are estimated to have access.  And yet

    25           and then you look at do you use a computer and you see that

                                                                            25

     1           12 million say they use a home computer, 28 million say they

     2           use a computer at school and then 32 million say they use it

     3           at anyplace and the figure seems somewhat out of whack

     4           because it's so much higher that they would use it anyplace

     5           and you wonder what those other places are, particularly for

     6           three to 17 year olds.  And so it just reflects some of the

     7           difficulties, I think, involved in trying to tap these --

     8           using these sorts of statistics for anything more than

     9           looking at trends, at least at this point in time.

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   All right, well, thank you.  Now, you state in your

    12           declaration that the Internet is unique, that it's very

    13           different than other media, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   As one of the ways that you pointed out that the Internet

    16           is unique is that it's essentially a 24-hour a day, seven day

    17           a week medium?

    18           A   Yes, that's correct.

    19           Q   URL's are always there in cyberspace, correct?

    20           A   Well, they're there as long as the computer behind them

    21           hasn't shut down, that's correct.

    22           Q   Okay.  And one of the features you've emphasized here

    23           today in your deposition that is how easy and sometimes how

    24           fun it is to Net surf, correct?

    25           A   Yes, that's correct.

                                                                            26

     1           Q   There's a popular search engine for Net surfing called

     2           "Alta Vista," correct?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Could you turn to Paragraph 66 of your declaration? 

     5           Paragraph 66 which is on Page 15 at the bottom, I'll read the

     6           first two sentences:

     7                    "The Web differs from broadcast media like

     8           television and radio in two important respects.  First on the

     9           Web individuals must seek out the information they want to

    10           consume, individuals do not passively receive information nor

    11           does information suddenly appear surprising them."

    12                    That's your statement, correct?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   Let's say a child or a teenager was performing a surf,

    15           surfing the Net in response to let's say a book project in

    16           school, okay?

    17           A   Okay.

    18           Q   Let's say the book that they were interested in learning

    19           more about because either they had read the book or because

    20           they had seen the book was Little Women by Louisa Mae Alcott,

    21           okay?

    22           A   Okay.

    23           Q   What would the child or the adolescent do in terms of

    24           surfing the Net in terms of a simple search using Yahoo or

    25           Infoseek or Alta Vista or some other search engine, what

                                                                            27

     1           would they do?

     2           A   Well, first of all, it would depend on the child.  If we

     3           go back to the concept of flow for a moment, it's a very

     4           important idea to recognize that in computer mediated

     5           environments there is a competency issue that is introduced

     6           that is not relevant in the physical world, particularly for

     7           the use of other media.  And so this competency issue

     8           involves the idea that people have a set of skills that they

     9           have to bring to the environment in order to be able to

    10           facilitate navigating through it.  And the environment itself

    11           also presents challenges to the individual as they're trying

    12           to navigate.

    13                    And so what a child would do would depend on the age

    14           of the child, the child's characteristics and particularly

    15           their competency to navigate through this environment.

    16           Q   Assuming that the child knew how to type words into a

    17           browser or search engine?

    18           A   So we're talking about a child that's literate, computer

    19           literate --

    20           Q   Right.

    21           A   -- and old enough to understand the Netscape browsing

    22           concept?

    23           Q   Right.

    24           A   And the concept of search agents?

    25           Q   To search for Little Women what words do you put into the

                                                                            28

     1           browser or what do you type into Infoseek or Alta Vista?

     2           A   If I were -- if I were instructing my child, for example,

     3           on a book report -- my child is too young to do this but if

     4           my child were older -- then we would go to Netscape, we would

     5           go Alta Vista and then in advanced search cause I would help

     6           him do this we would enter "Little" plus "Women" plus

     7           "Louisa" plus "Mae" plus "Alcott."  Actually we would use the

     8           "and" key and then we would get all of the documents from the

     9           22 million documents that are referenced in Alta Vista, we

    10           would get the documents that satisfy that criteria.  That's

    11           what I would do with my child.

    12           Q   Can you turn to what -- now we've marked this as Exhibit

    13           13A and with the Court's indulgence, it does not have a

    14           separate tab in these books, it's found as the second

    15           document under Tab 13.

    16                    (Pause.)

    17           Q   Do you see that document?

    18           A   Yes, I do.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's the one that has "Win a trip to

    20           Hawaii" on it?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Yes, correct, your Honor.

    22                    (Laughter.)

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   Are you generally familiar with this form of document as

    25           produced by Infoseek?

                                                                            29

     1           A   Yes, I am.

     2           Q   Would you take a look at the fifth entry on this

     3           document?

     4           A   Yes, I see it.

     5           Q   This document was produced by typing in the words "Little

     6           Women" correct?

     7           A   Yes, that appears to be the case because at the top it

     8           says "Search for" and then in the bold, the two words,

     9           "Little Women" and that had produced a search for all

    10           documents on the Internet that have the words "little" in

    11           them or have the words "women" in them in the title in the

    12           URL.  

    13           Q   And what does the fifth entry represent?

    14           A   You want me to read it?

    15           Q   Yes, please.

    16           A   "See hot pictures of naked women," exclamation point.

    17           Q   Isn't it possible, Professor Hoffman, that a child might

    18           be surprised in stumbling across that entry in the context of

    19           an on-line search?  Isn't it possible?

    20           A   It's possible if the -- I -- it's possible that that

    21           child would be surprised.

    22           Q   Thank you.  Why don't we turn to the concept of hits when

    23           you're conducting a search.

    24           A   Okay.

    25           Q   Could you explain to the Court what a hit is?

                                                                            30

     1           A   Yes, a hit is a measure, it's a, literally it's an entry

     2           recorded in the server log of the computer that is the Web

     3           server that says a file has been accessed when someone comes

     4           to that particular page.  But the hits, there's quite a bit

     5           of controversy about the hits because, for example, on the

     6           home page for our center, Project 2000, when someone comes to

     7           that front page or the front door of our virtual research

     8           center, that counts as say ten hits.  

     9                    And the reason it counts as ten hits is because we

    10           have an image map, in other words, we have a picture on the

    11           front with some nice drawings on it and on the map itself you

    12           can click in different places and go to my curriculum vitae,

    13           go to Professor Novak's curriculum vitae, go to the Owens

    14           School's home page.

    15                    And so on and then there's a set of links that you

    16           can go to our research papers, you can go to some other

    17           people's research papers or whatever.  

    18                    In the process of serving up that front page, that

    19           records approximately ten hits on my server log.  So the hit,

    20           and that's the reason there's so much controversy over Web

    21           measurement, hits are not an accurate measure of how many

    22           people are coming to the Web site because depending on how

    23           many images I have on my front page or how many links I

    24           choose to put on the front page, I can inflate the number of

    25           hits.

                                                                            31

     1                    But a hit literally is a file served on that

     2           computer server.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let me interrupt you for a second. 

     4           What if you came in the back door?  

     5                    THE WITNESS:  You mean to another page?

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In other words, if you came in

     7           through another link --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- rather than hitting the front

    10           page of your home page you found, for example, I mean what

    11           Mrs. Duvall gave us yesterday with the fragile X, as I recall

    12           it.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  If you came in the back door to the

    15           fragile X foundation that way, would that be a hit?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that would also be a hit.  So,

    17           for example, fragile X has a home page but fragile X has many

    18           sites that are enduring and have lots of content on them,

    19           they might have thousands of pages.  Some very deep sites

    20           might have 10,000 pieces of information.

    21                    So each of those pages has a URL associated with it

    22           and then if someone were to come in, as you say, through one

    23           of these back doors because you knew the URL directly and you

    24           went directly to that page rather than going through the

    25           front door, that page itself could be served up at least as

                                                                            32

     1           one hit but again depends on how many things are on that

     2           particular page.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So in Project 2000's count, if

     4           someone comes in by what I call the back door and I think we

     5           agree it's called the back door to, say, Page 17 --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there's --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- if there is a Page 17.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, there's not really a concept of

     9           Page 17 because one of the unique features of the Web is that

    10           it's not a linear.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, I understand that, but if you

    12           were to print it out in hard copy it would be Page 17, each

    13           screen.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, not necessarily because unless I

    15           particularly marked it to say Page 17, but --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  But it's a page, it's another page. 

    18           Not the, you know, cause there's lot-- literally think of it

    19           as a web and there's lots of different ways to meander

    20           through either a particular site in a non-linear fashion or

    21           through the entire Web.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, when you measure the hits,

    23           whatever their --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- inaccuracy may be, that also

                                                                            33

     1           includes the back door --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it does.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- accesses, correct?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  In fact that's why we don't measure

     5           hits and that's why there's been for particularly for

     6           commercial purposes because this is a very hot topic with

     7           advertisers right now and advertising agencies.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  They want to know hits per thousand,

     9           right?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Right, and it's been completely, I

    11           mean there's very few firms now that either will sell space

    12           on a Web site on the basis of hits or will even talk in the

    13           context of hits because in the last year there's been so much

    14           attention, people have done a lot of work including the

    15           Project 2000 discussing why this is a very bad idea.

    16                    So instead what people do, there are several things. 

    17           So hits are really the upper bound.  I mean there's no more

    18           than the hits as the measure of what's happening on your Web

    19           site, but it's a completely useless measure from my

    20           perspective as a measure of activity from a consumer

    21           perspective.

    22                    The lower bound is what we call unique domains.  The

    23           server log also records when someone comes to the site

    24           there's their domain name attached to it.  So, for example,

    25           if I'm visiting a Web site I have my own domain and IP

                                                                            34

     1           address because I have my own machine connected directly to

     2           the Internet.  My address at Vanderbilt is

     3           Collett.OGSM.Vanderbilt.EDU, so whenever I go somewhere with

     4           my browser from my machine to another Web site anywhere in

     5           the world, the server log of those sites that

     6           Collett.OGSM.Vanderbilt.EDU went to the site.  It doesn't say

     7           Donna Hoffman went because they don't necessarily know it's

     8           me, they just know that machine went.  That is a domain.

     9                    So the server log for a particular site will record

    10           all those domains and it's very possible and very easy to

    11           write computer programs to count how many domains came in a

    12           day, in an hour to a page, to all the pages, to the home page

    13           and so on and then throw out the ones that are multiples.

    14                    So, for example, our site gets hit a lot by

    15           Gateway.Senate.GOV and -- but if they come more than once,

    16           first of all, I have no idea who it is, but if they come more

    17           than once I'll discount it once and say I had a unique visit

    18           today from Gateway.Senate.GOV and then I can count over time

    19           how many of those unique domains I had in a single day.

    20                    So the Project 2000 site gets anywhere from a

    21           thousand to two thousand or so, maybe 1800, unique domain

    22           visits a day.  It probably gets tens of thousands of hits,

    23           but that's irrelevant. What's much more important to know is

    24           how many lower bound people actually came to my site.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sorry to interrupt.

                                                                            35

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I get just one little

     2           clarification while we're doing it?  On this exhibit that

     3           doesn't have a page -- well, it does, it's one of two in 13A

     4           that you called our attention to, would any of these

     5           references be a hit even if the user, searcher, surfer 

     6           didn't click on them, if the page has come up would these be

     7           considered, would they all be considered hits or would none

     8           of them be considered hits until the person wants to link

     9           with the little hand?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, which one?  There's an

    12           either/or--

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, they would not be -- they would

    14           not be considered hits because for these search engines,

    15           Infoseek is not a -- is a directory.  And so when I go to

    16           Infoseek to search, for example, in this case or when he went

    17           to search for Little Women, that created a hit on Infoseek

    18           because somebody went to Infoseek and let's say you went and

    19           you had a domain associated with your computer, which you

    20           would, it would record that you were there.

    21                    Now, this page is served up from Infoseek's

    22           directory so there is no hit recorded for the WWW Women's

    23           Sport Page by Amy Lewis and so on.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  However, if you then choose to click

                                                                            36

     1           on one of these links you will be taken to that site and that

     2           would record a hit.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And you would have

     4           instructed your son, if you were helping your -- is it

     5           correct that you would have instructed your son if you were

     6           looking for Little Women to put "little" with an and?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I would.  Well, first of all, I

     8           probably wouldn't use Infoseek, I would use -- but whatever. 

     9           But even Infoseek, I believe, allows you to use term -- I am

    10           blanking on the name, but symbols that allow you to refine

    11           your search because I would know, being an experienced user

    12           of the computer, that searching for the two words, "Little

    13           Women" would produce many more things than I would be

    14           interested in.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But is it true that a child might

    16           not know?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  It's true, but I think the reason is

    18           that I would be with my child educating him on how to use the

    19           computer and how to engage in these search processes, at

    20           least until I felt he was -- knew how to do it on his own.

    21                    So I would not let him sit there and do this.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But if your son were 12, let's say,

    23           and by now an experienced surfer, isn't it a fair assumption,

    24           as Chief Judge Sloviter is suggesting, that he would just

    25           type in Little Women?  That is the natural search.

                                                                            37

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Actually, I believe that if he were 12

     2           and an experienced surfer, particularly on the basis of my

     3           tutelage, he would know that it would be a waste of time to

     4           type in Little Women and because by then he would have moved

     5           through the processes we described in our search and he would

     6           have moved from being a browser to a more goal-directed user,

     7           he would be much more experienced.  

     8                    And if he knew what he was looking for he would know

     9           how to get to it. 

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But the point is the more naive the

    11           searcher, the more likely they are to pick up what Mr. Baron

    12           has called your attention to, isn't that the point?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe that's true, the more

    14           experienced they are, the more likely they would be to not

    15           know how to do sophisticated searches.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's particularly true of

    17           children, isn't it, who don't have the benefit of a parent

    18           who is an expert in this area?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, that would be more true, yes,

    20           that's true, but then there are also schools that instruct

    21           children on how to use the computers in the Internet and how

    22           to go through searching facilities and teach them the tools

    23           necessary to use the Internet as a communications tool.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think Mr. Baron was probably

    25           getting at the -- he was trying to get to the number of hits,

                                                                            38

     1           so while we'll let you go back to that then.

     2                    MR. BARON:  Well, this is an interesting discussion,

     3           but --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, thank you.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We aim to please.

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    MR. BARON:  I want to add a layer of complexity to

     8           the subject of hits and I was going to go off on a different

     9           tangent which is to ask you to tell the Court what are "Bots"

    10           and what are "Spiders."

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Bots?

    12                    MR. BARON:  B-o-t-s.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's an acronym, right?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Not really.

    15                    MR. BARON:  I'll let Professor Hoffman describe it.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Bots or Robots, Bots for short.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A contraction.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  And Spiders and Intelligent Agents are

    19           a class of software programs that are tools that enable

    20           people to perform specific tasks on the World Wide Web, for

    21           example, seek out specific types of information or URL's or

    22           whatnot.

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   Does Alta Vista employ a Bot?

    25           A   Yes, I don't know if they call it a Bot or a Spider, but

                                                                            39

     1           Alta Vista employs software that allows it to traverse the

     2           Web to find the URL's that exist on the Web so they can store

     3           them in a database so that when you go there to search you

     4           can find what you're looking for.

     5           Q   And you stated in your deposition that you thought there

     6           were about 10 to 20 directories and search engines that are

     7           popularly used today, correct?

     8           A   Yes, it's correct.  For example, if you go to the

     9           Netscape Homepage and go to their Searchpage, Netscape which

    10           is the most popular browser on the Internet for use in the

    11           World Wide Web has a page which provides for its customers

    12           the ability to go search.  And so they have a page with all

    13           the search engines there and all the directories.  And I

    14           think the directory page may list 10 to 15 directories or so

    15           and the search engine page may list another 10 to 15 or so,

    16           so maybe there's 10 to 20, maybe there's 30 and they're

    17           changing all the time.

    18                    There's probably about 250 directories and search

    19           engines all over the Web but I don't think that they're all

    20           equally popular.

    21           Q   Well, you told me at your deposition, didn't you, that

    22           for the 10 or 20 major ones that they're all employing Bots

    23           or some other software to search the Web for URL's to

    24           incorporate in their database, correct?

    25           A   Yes, I told you that and also we have to make an

                                                                            40

     1           important distinction because some of the directories also

     2           employ human beings who will go out and search for

     3           information and then make a determination on whether it

     4           should be included in their directory.  

     5                    And there's a very important distinction between a

     6           search engine and a directory because search engines like

     7           Alta Vista, for example, do not discriminate.  If it's on the

     8           Web and they can find it, it will go in the database.  And

     9           they currently catalogue 22 million unique URL's.  

    10                    So that's considered to be right now our best guess

    11           at the universe of information available on the World Wide

    12           Web.  They also catalogue about 11 billion words and that's

    13           considered to be the universe of information right now on the

    14           World Wide Web.  

    15                    However, a directory, for example, Magellan which is

    16           also referred to as the McKinley Index, these are -- this is

    17           a directory where people have made a choice about what URL's

    18           to include and then they look at the site and then they rate

    19           it using a star system where four stars is the best.

    20                    So on these directories you find a much smaller

    21           universe of URL's from which you can search.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And your testimony is that the best

    23           guess at least at some recent time was that there are 22

    24           million URL's out there or were?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's not a guess, it's just that

                                                                            41

     1           we know that Alta Vista indexes 22 million unique URL's in

     2           its database.  The thing that is interesting is last month

     3           they indexed 21 million, so it's grown by one million unique

     4           URL's in about the last four weeks.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What does a typical directory, how

     6           many do they --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  It -- it depends.  It might be 5,000,

     8           it might be a few hundred, it might be 10,000.  They're

     9           typically smaller, especially if they have to go through and

    10           somebody has to like look at these things and make some

    11           determination about them.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So the difference between the

    13           directory and the search engine is the search engine

    14           encompasses all?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  It could, that could be a difference,

    16           yes.  For like -- yes, for Alta Vista which is a search

    17           engine or Lycos which is a search engine, right, those

    18           encompass all, they do not discriminate.  If it's out there

    19           and the software finds it, it will store it in a database. 

    20                    Yahoo, for example, to use a very prominent

    21           difference, Yahoo is a directory and Yahoo catalogues, Yahoo

    22           has a person, a human being who sits there and she decides

    23           this URL will go in, this URL will not go in.  She also

    24           decides how to catalogue them so the main distinction between

    25           directories and search agents is a directory catalogues or

                                                                            42

     1           otherwise structures the information for you.  

     2                    So like if you go to Yahoo, you can look -- let's

     3           say you're interested in information about sports.  There's a

     4           sports heading and you can click there and there will be all

     5           the links on sports.  And Alta Vista --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just all the links that Yahoo gives

     7           you?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  All the links that Yahoo has

     9           determined should be included in its directory under the

    10           heading sports, yes.

    11                    There's another well known directory open -- Yahoo,

    12           like for example, I don't know how many URL's Yahoo has, it

    13           has a lot, but as an example, in their company's directory

    14           which is the commercial portion of Yahoo there's over 50,000.

    15                    In -- but if I were to search for companies on Alta

    16           Vista I would get millions, so it would be many more.  Open

    17           Market, another popular directory, lists about 22,000

    18           entries, so it's a little -- it's much smaller than Yahoo but

    19           they go through a more detailed process in order to register

    20           your information.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Alta Vista is growing at about

    22           one million URL's a month?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, last month it grew one million

    24           URL's.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Because it was cold and people had

                                                                            43

     1           nothing else to do.

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3           BY MR. BARON:  

     4           Q   Well, let me just ask a couple more questions about this

     5           topic of search for hits.  Individuals are also employing

     6           Spiders to go out and traverse the Web looking for

     7           information, correct?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   And the server log on a Web site records that access

    10           having been made to that page, correct?

    11           A   That's correct.

    12           Q   For Spiders and for Bots?

    13           A   The server log records whenever another computer comes to

    14           its Web site so the Spider or this Intelligent Agent or the

    15           software program had to come from somewhere just as if I were

    16           visiting and the server log records that access as a domain

    17           visit, yes.

    18           Q   Even without any real human person looking at that site?

    19           A   Yes, that's true.

    20           Q   And the major directories or search engines, the ten or

    21           twenty you've described or more, go out and search at least

    22           one, once a day and probably much more often, correct?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   And they go back to sites that they've already visited to

    25           see what's new, correct?

                                                                            44

     1           A   Yes, that's correct.

     2           Q   Okay.  There are lots of directories out there in

     3           cyberspace that have URL's, correct?

     4           A   Well, yes, by definition if it's a directory on the Web

     5           it must have a URL.

     6           Q   You said in your deposition that there are hundreds if

     7           not thousands of examples of individuals who have put

     8           together indexes on particular topics of interest to other

     9           individuals in cyberspace, correct?

    10           A   Yes, that's correct.

    11           Q   And one of the ways that directories come into being or

    12           one of the ways that one can communicate in cyberspace is to

    13           fill out forms, correct?

    14           A   Uh --

    15           Q   Why don't you explain to the Court what a form is, a Web

    16           form?

    17           A   A fillout form is a page on someone's Web site which has

    18           the facility to take information from you if you would care

    19           to give it.  So, for example, sort of a classic use of a

    20           fillout form in a commercial context would be to give your

    21           name, demographic information and maybe your credit card

    22           number.  So there would be little spaces there for you to

    23           type in your name, there might even be little sort of virtual

    24           bubbles, if you will, that you could use a mouse to click and

    25           say what gender you were and it would say male, female, maybe

                                                                            45

     1           a little button and you'd click whether you were a male or

     2           female.  Then there would be another box to enter some

     3           information that the firm might like to know about you and

     4           that would be captured through what is called a fillout form.

     5                    And there would be many other uses.  We use them on

     6           the Project 2000 site to get information about people that

     7           visit so we can put them on a mailing list, for example.

     8           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 40?  You mentioned earlier Open

     9           Market?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   Is this -- is Defendant's Exhibit 40 an example of an

    12           Open Market page?

    13           A   Yes, that's an example of an Open Market page.

    14                    Excuse me, could I have more water, please?

    15           Q   Oh, sure.

    16                    (Pause.)

    17           Q   Are you ready?

    18           A   I'm ready.

    19           Q   Professor Hoffman, you stated a few minutes ago in

    20           testimony that Open Market has a, I believe I got this right,

    21           a more detailed process for registering entries in their

    22           directory, correct?

    23           A   Yes, that's correct.

    24           Q   Could you just explain for the Court what Exhibit 40

    25           represents in terms of the commercial sites index listing

                                                                            46

     1           submission?

     2           A   Yes, this is --

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Excuse me, I think counsel misspoke. 

     4           Do you mean to say Exhibit 41?

     5                    MR. BARON:  No, I'm referring to Exhibit 40.

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Oh, all right.  

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which is headed "Open Market's

     8           Commercial Sites Index," correct?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Correct.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  And then it says "Commercial Sites

    11           Index Listing Submission."

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, this is the page if you were to

    14           go to the Open Market homepage or maybe someone told you this

    15           URL directly and you entered it directly.  But in any event

    16           let's just say you found your way to this page deliberately

    17           because you knew it existed and you wanted to register your

    18           commercial site with Open Market.  

    19                    You would have to go to this page, you would follow

    20           the instructions on this page and, even though you can't see

    21           it from this hard copy printing, it's a fillout form where

    22           so, for example, see where it says "New Listing Update Old

    23           Listing," those are choices and you would click on one of

    24           those to indicate to Open Market whether you wanted to update

    25           a listing you already had in their directory or you wanted to

                                                                            47

     1           enter a new listing.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Why do you say you can't see it? 

     3           Isn't it on the next page?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, I mean you can't tell from this

     5           hard copy printout --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, it's on this and the next page.

     7                    THE WITNESS:   -- what it would really look like on

     8           the World Wide Web on a computer because it would be

     9           highlighted and it would be obvious that you would have, you

    10           know, there would be an action required on your part which

    11           would be to click.

    12                    Then if you saw where it says "Listing name," that

    13           would be a text box.  It hasn't come out here on the print,

    14           on the printer, but there would be a -- that would be the

    15           place where it would be obvious for you to type the name that

    16           you wanted the listing to appear as in the directory, and so

    17           on.

    18                    And so you would go through this process on line,

    19           filling out this fillout form, it would be stored directly in

    20           their database, they might do some processing of it and then

    21           they would -- I do not know if Open Market screens these or

    22           makes some determination on what's appropriate or not.  I do

    23           know that they have 22,000 or so listings and since that's

    24           half the size of Yahoo's listings, I infer there may be some

    25           sort of selection process involved or either that or not

                                                                            48

     1           everybody wants to list with Open Market.

     2           BY MR. BARON:  

     3           Q   And when someone wants to list with Open Market, then

     4           individuals in cyberspace can search against the Open Market

     5           directory of the sites that are listed?

     6           A   Yes, that's correct.

     7           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 41?

     8           A   Yes, I see it.

     9           Q   Do you recall my showing you this page at your

    10           deposition?

    11           A   Yes, I do.

    12           Q   Could you explain for the Court what this page

    13           represents?

    14           A   Yes.  This is -- this appears to represent someone typing

    15           in on a previous page which asked you to search which gives

    16           people the opportunity to search for particular listings in

    17           the Open Market directory.  Someone has performed a search of

    18           listings that contain the word p-o-r-n or porn.  And the

    19           search appears to have returned 23 items.

    20                    Now, I'm going to assume that because they're from A

    21           to Z that that's an exhaustive list of the sites on Open

    22           Market out of the 22,000 or so sites that contain the word

    23           porn and that's 23 items.

    24           Q   And could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 42?         

    25           A   Yes, I see that.

                                                                            49

     1           Q   What would this represent, this page?

     2           A   Well, this appears to represent what would happen if the

     3           person who had searched for porn clicked on the first entry

     4           which was Triple A Adult Entertainment, then that would take

     5           you directly to a page, it appears to be still on the Open

     6           Market site which then gives you more information about the

     7           Triple A Adult Entertainment commercial site and then

     8           there's, that's obvious from underlining that that's a

     9           Hypertext link, so if you then chose to go to the Triple A

    10           Entertainment, Adult Entertainment site, you would click on

    11           that link and then you would be what we call off site, you

    12           would now be somewhere else in cyberspace.

    13           Q   But the point here is that the Triple A Adult

    14           Entertainment site has essentially gone through a

    15           registration process with the Open Market directory, correct?

    16           A   Yes, they have listed their business with the Open Market

    17           commercial directory.

    18           Q   All right, thank you.  Let me turn to a separate subject. 

    19           Is it -- is it your testimony, as you state in your

    20           deposition, that there are approximately 12 to 15 million

    21           subscribers to AOL, Compuserve and Prodigy?

    22           A   Yes, and all of the commercial on-line services, not just

    23           the top three, because Microsoft Network is rapidly

    24           approaching one million subscribers by itself.

    25           Q   You agree, do you not, that it is in the interest of the

                                                                            50

     1           marketplace to adopt parental controls?

     2           A   Yes, I do.

     3           Q   Could you turn to Exhibit 48 which I believe would be in

     4           the second volume?

     5                    (Pause; discussion off the record.)

     6           BY MR. BARON:  

     7           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit in your

     8           deposition?

     9           A   Yes, I do.

    10           Q   Could you generally describe for the Court what it

    11           represents in terms of a Web page? 

    12           A   Yes, it's an advertisement for an adult bulletin board.

    13           Q   It appears to state that one calls a 900 number to get a

    14           user name and a password and there will be a $20 charge on a

    15           phone bill and then after you call that number --

    16           A   Oh, right, yes, I'm sorry.  This is the other one you

    17           showed me.  This is not an advertisement for an adult

    18           bulletin board, this is a -- the homepage of a commercial Web

    19           site that contains sexually explicit material and this is the

    20           process by which they register you.  You must, rather than

    21           using a fillout form, you go off line with a telephone number

    22           and give your credit card information.

    23           Q   Could you read for the Court in the small  print what it

    24           says, starting with the word "due"?

    25           A   "Due to the passage of the Telecommunication Act of

                                                                            51

     1           1995," -- which is wrong -- "which includes provisions

     2           banning indecent material on the Internet, the material here

     3           has been temporarily removed while we bring it into

     4           compliance.  The member area is not affected."

     5           Q   Do you have any idea what might have been on the site

     6           prior to the words here?

     7           A   No, I have no idea.

     8           Q   Okay. It would have been a pornographic image?

     9           A   It could have been a --

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Objection, she says she has no idea.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sustained.

    12           BY MR. BARON:  

    13           Q   Okay.  Would you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 49?

    14                    You stated at your deposition on Monday that you

    15           were generally familiar with a site called Bianca's Smut

    16           Shack, correct?

    17           A   Yes, correct.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Bianca's what?

    19                    MR. BARON:  Smut Shack, S-m-u-t.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   You would, turning from the material beyond the first

    22           page, you would agree, would you not, that the text of the

    23           materials on this site are sexually explicit?

    24           A   You mean in general?

    25           Q   The text of the various pages at the end of this exhibit,

                                                                            52

     1           correct?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   Okay.  Now, just concentrating on the first page of the

     4           exhibit, you see where it's titled "The Rules of the Game?"

     5           A   Yes, I see that.

     6           Q   Would you read for the Court in the third paragraph, can

     7           you read to the Court what the third paragraph states?

     8           A   The paragraph starting second?

     9           Q   Yes.

    10           A   "Second, Bianca Trol Productions recognizes its

    11           responsibility under current U.S. law to take, 'in good

    12           faith, reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under

    13           the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors

    14           to,' this site which may contain adult language and

    15           situations.  We are also taking, 'appropriate measures to

    16           restrict minors from such communications, including any

    17           method which is feasible under available technology.'"

    18           Q   Could you look at Point 2 which follows where it's

    19           described as Technology Measure No. 1, and could you, after

    20           you've had a moment to look at it, inform the Court what

    21           Bianca is stating here?

    22           A   Well, the site is stating that there is a way to block

    23           people from coming to the site by means of blocking the IP

    24           addresses which represent this particular site, so that you

    25           can block at the user site by saying the -- by not allowing

                                                                            53

     1           the browser to go to sites that have particular IP or

     2           Internet protocol addresses which are those numerical

     3           addresses you see there, the 204.62.13.6, that's the locate--

     4           that's the address of this particular site in cyberspace and

     5           there's another address associated with it.  And if I know

     6           the address, I can block it so that my particular computer

     7           could not go to that address.

     8           Q   You would agree, would you not, that Technology Measure

     9           No. 2 is an effective measure with respect to blocking

    10           individuals who access that ISP?

    11           A   It's -- I agree that it's an effective measure of

    12           blocking particular computers or people's access who use

    13           those computers to particular sites, yes.

    14           Q   Would you look at Technology Measure No. 2 which is

    15           listed at Point 3?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And inform the Court what the site is instructing to do?

    18           A   Well, you can also do the reverse.  If you give your IP

    19           address, if I were to send my -- my address to this

    20           particular site, then it would also block me that way.  So I

    21           would -- I could go there but it wouldn't let me in because

    22           then it would know that I was coming in and say uh-oh, you

    23           know, Professor Hoffman not allowed at this site, as

    24           identified by my IP address on my computer.

    25           Q   All right, thank you.  Your testimony and your

                                                                            54

     1           declaration-- that will be the end of the use of that -- your

     2           testimony in your declaration is that the act in question

     3           here, the Communications Decency Act, will have negative

     4           consequences for the new medium of the Internet and

     5           specifically the World Wide Web, correct?

     6           A   Correct.

     7           Q   You will -- you concede, will you not or you do concede,

     8           do you not, that the exhibit that was 48 which was the

     9           Cybersex City exhibit with the 1-900 number?

    10           A   Mm-hmm.

    11           Q   The fact that the material that's been removed with that

    12           disclaimer about the Telecommunications Act, whatever that

    13           material was, you would concede would you not that the

    14           removal of that material does not have a profound adverse

    15           consequence in terms of the growth of the Internet or the

    16           ease of use of the World Wide Web, correct?

    17           A   In that particular instance on that particular site I

    18           would concede that, yes.

    19           Q   You would also concede, would you not, Professor Hoffman,

    20           that the site that's Bianca's Smut Shack's decision to

    21           include a rules of the game homepage complete with tagging

    22           and registration requirements as set forth in those two

    23           technology measures will similarly not have a profound

    24           adverse effect on the growth of the Web or the ease of use of

    25           the Internet, correct?

                                                                            55

     1           A   On that particular site, that's correct.

     2           Q   Could you explain for the Court what Anonymous Remailers

     3           are?

     4           A   Yes, Anonymous Remailers and their -- and a related

     5           service called Pseudonymity Servers are computer services

     6           that privatize your identity in cyberspace.  They allow

     7           individuals to, for example, post content for example to a

     8           Usenet News group or to send an E-mail without knowing the

     9           individual's true identity.

    10                    The difference between an Anonymous Remailer and a

    11           Pseudonymity Server is very important because an Anonymous

    12           Remailer provides what we might consider to be true anonymity

    13           to the individual because there would be no way to know on

    14           separate instances who the person was who was making the post

    15           or sending the E-mail.

    16                    But with a Pseudonymity Server, an individual can

    17           have what we consider to be a persistent presence in

    18           cyberspace, so you can have a pseudonym attached to your

    19           postings or your E-mails, but your true identity is not

    20           revealed.  And these mechanisms allow people to communicate

    21           in cyberspace without revealing their true identities.

    22           Q   I just have one question, Professor Hoffman, on this

    23           topic.  You have not done any study or survey to sample the

    24           quantity or the amount of anonymous remailing on the

    25           Internet, correct?

                                                                            56

     1           A   That's correct.  I think by definition it's a very

     2           difficult problem to study because these are people who wish

     3           to remain anonymous and the people who provide these services

     4           wish to remain anonymous.

     5           Q   You would agree, Professor Hoffman, that the Alt Binary's

     6           hierarchy of Usenet News groups contains pornographic

     7           imagery, correct?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Objection, I'm not sure the word

     9           "pornographic" has any meaning in the legal meaning.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, does it to you?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  I agree it contains sexually explicit

    12           material, yes.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, overruled.

    14           BY MR. BARON:  

    15           Q   You also agree, do you not, that pornographers are using

    16           Usenet News groups to advertise, correct?

    17           A   Yes.  But can I clarify that?

    18           Q   Sure.

    19           A   What I have seen on Usenet News groups is that operators

    20           of adult bulletin boards are in some cases, although it's

    21           sometimes difficult to tell because it could just as well be

    22           individuals who have downloaded content and are re-posting it

    23           on Usenet News, but there are cases of images from adult

    24           bulletin boards which are re-posted on Usenet News groups and

    25           there's some idea that the operators of the adult bulletin

                                                                            57

     1           boards are using this as a mechanism to advertise their

     2           service.

     3           Q   Now, we've already gone over Paragraph 122 of your

     4           declaration where you said that it is your, quote,

     5           "impression," unquote, that there is a decreasing percentage

     6           of sexually specific material in cyberspace as a proportion

     7           of the total amount of packet traffic or hosts or however one

     8           counts the Internet in terms of how big it is, correct?

     9           A   Well, I didn't, no, that's not correct.  My declaration

    10           doesn't say that.  It says that it is my opinion based on my

    11           experience and my research in this medium that when

    12           considered as a percent of the total information, so I'm

    13           thinking of it particularly in terms either of postings for

    14           example on Usenet News groups or in terms of URL's, for

    15           example, on that portion of the Internet known as the World

    16           Wide Web that the amount of sexually explicit material

    17           available is actually constant and so as a percent of total

    18           is decreasing because the total amount of information on the

    19           Internet is increasing at a very rapid rate.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So it's that deduction is behind

    21           Paragraph 122?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's correct.

    23           BY MR. BARON:  

    24           Q   But you can't say, can you, Professor Hoffman, in terms

    25           of packet traffic on the Internet whether the sexually

                                                                            58

     1           explicit material consists of 10,000 packets or a million

     2           packets or a billion packets, correct?

     3           A   No, I can't say that, no one can say that.

     4           Q   You have given no absolute number in terms of what the

     5           quantum of pornography or sexually explicit material is in

     6           cyberspace, correct?

     7           A   Correct.

     8           Q   Could you turn to Paragraph 129 of your declaration?

     9                    You state that digital Alta Vista's search engine

    10           currently indexes over 21 million unique URL's and 10 billion

    11           words on the World Wide Web?

    12           A   Correct, except now it's -- I just checked yesterday,

    13           it's now 22 million unique URL's and 11 million words -- 11

    14           billion words, I'm sorry.

    15           Q   All right.  Now, as a hypothetical if just one percent of

    16           cyberspace on the Web contains sexually explicit material,

    17           that would translate, under your new numbers, as 220,000

    18           unique URL's and 110 million words by your calculation,

    19           correct?  It's one percent of these figures.

    20           A   If you assumed it was distributed uniformly that would be

    21           a correct mathematical calculation, yes.

    22           Q   Would you consider that to be a large amount under that

    23           hypothetical?

    24           A   I would not consider it to be a large amount as percent

    25           of total.  I think it's very difficult to make absolute

                                                                            59

     1           statements about numbers unless they are referenced in a

     2           framework.

     3           Q   Well, you've testified that the Web is growing

     4           phenomenally, right?

     5           A   The Web as measured in the number of servers is growing,

     6           is doubling approximately every two and a half months.  The

     7           Internet as measured in the number of hosts computers

     8           connected to it is doubling annually and has been so since

     9           about 1981 or 1982.  So that we consider these to be

    10           exponential and phenomenal rates of growth, yes.

    11           Q   Well, given that phenomenal growth, just to be clear

    12           about what your declaration is saying, a number can grow in

    13           absolute numerical terms but still represent a smaller

    14           percentage of a larger total if that total is growing

    15           phenomenally, correct?

    16           A   I don't understand what you just said. 

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You can make that argument.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think we understand the basic laws

    19           of mathematics.

    20                    MR. BARON:  All right, I have no more questions,

    21           your Honors.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, this is a good time to take

    23           the ten-minute break and it will be a ten-minute break.

    24                    THE COURT CLERK:  All right, please.

    25                    (Court in recess; 10:45 to 11:00 o'clock a.m.)

                                                                            60

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, we'll hear the plaintiffs on

     2           redirect.

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

     4                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     5           BY MR. HANSEN:  

     6           Q   Professor Hoffman, you had some discussion with the

     7           Government concerning the definition of hits and unique

     8           domains of methods of measuring the number of people who are

     9           actually traveling in cyberspace.  Does the -- would you

    10           explain again what a unique domain is?

    11           A   Yes.  A unique domain is, very simply stated, the address

    12           of the computer.  Every computer has associated with it a

    13           particular address and that address can be in words, so, for

    14           example, gateway.senate.gov, or it can be in numbers, the

    15           numerical address or sometimes called the IP address, which

    16           stands for Internet protocol.  However, the situation becomes

    17           a little bit more confusing or complicated, because there are

    18           various types of systems that computers can be assigned

    19           addresses, which makes it very difficult to know what --

    20           which particular computer might be coming to your site.  So,

    21           for example the -- let's just take an example of AOL, the

    22           commercial on-line service which is a gateway to the

    23           Internet, the address for AOL is aol.com, that's a domain

    24           name, and it has an IP address associated with it, which I

    25           don't know what that is.  However, AOL has a series of

                                                                            61

     1           machines that it uses for its users to get onto the Internet

     2           and they might be called, for example, aol1.aol.com,

     3           aol2.aol.com, and so on.  But AOL has about five million

     4           users, but AOL does not have five million unique domains, it

     5           only has a much smaller number.  So, for example, on the

     6           Project 2000 site we get many visits from AOL presumably, but

     7           they only -- from people who use AOL as their gateway to surf

     8           the net, but it shows up in our server log as, say,

     9           aol1.aol.com and that's a hit, a visit.  What I don't know is

    10           how many people were associated with that domain, because

    11           when I count -- when I have a program that runs and goes

    12           through the server log and counts up how many times

    13           AOL1.AOL.com came I have no idea who it was behind that

    14           machine or how many.  So, it could have been a child, it

    15           could have been an adult, it could have been the same adult

    16           on repeated occasions, because there might be ten listings in

    17           the server log that say aol1.aol.com coming in, say, at 10:00

    18           a.m., and then maybe at noon aol1.aol.com came in again, and

    19           then at 4:00 p.m. in the log it might show aol1.aol.com

    20           again, but I would have no way of knowing who it was or how 

    21           -- or anything.

    22           Q   So, when you try to determine the number of unique

    23           domains that have visited your Web site would that

    24           underestimate or overestimate the number of actual people who

    25           have come and looked at your Web site?

                                                                            62

     1           A   Well, it's clearly a lower bound, because what it really

     2           estimates is the number of unique computers that came to the

     3           site, it does not give anything but a lower bound on how many

     4           -- on the minimum number of people who could have come.  And

     5           in fact that's one of the impetuses for our research on

     6           counting the number of users, because up until the time that

     7           we started our research on Internet measurement people were

     8           trying to estimate the number of computer users worldwide by

     9           counting the number of machines connected to the Internet and

    10           multiplying by a number.  So, for example, the rule of thumb

    11           factor or the number was some number between five and ten,

    12           because the conventional wisdom was many years ago or even

    13           five years ago that there were about five to ten people

    14           associated with each computer domain, but over time that's

    15           clearly become untrue because -- for a number of reasons;

    16           one, because of hosts like AOL, which have five million users

    17           but only a very small and finite number of domains; hosts

    18           like Compuserve, compuserve.com, for example; and through a

    19           procedure called, for example, dynamic allocations, so at

    20           Universities and other businesses IP addresses are assigned

    21           dynamically on the moment you log in and those numbers can

    22           change and are not necessarily the same number associated

    23           with the same computer --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  When you say dynamically, a word you

    25           use fairly frequently in your declaration, what do you mean?

                                                                            63

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I mean at that moment, in real time,

     2           so, in response to something happening in the environment. 

     3           In this context of dynamic allocation of IP addresses, that

     4           means at the moment that someone needs to connect to the

     5           Internet from, say, a computer in a computer lab at a

     6           university that computer is assigned a free domain name and

     7           IP address at that moment --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  On the spot?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  -- on the spot, right.  So, dynamic

    10           means in real time something is happening.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And does the number come back, is

    12           it used and then never used again?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  No, it could be used again, but it

    14           might be by another machine in the lab on another day,

    15           another time, another moment, whatever.  So, the best you can

    16           do if you're trying to count -- and the reason obviously I'm

    17           interested in this is from a commercial perspective.  So,

    18           it's very important to get as good a count as possible of the

    19           people in front of the machines, not the machines.  And, so,

    20           we have tried to move away or make arguments that we must

    21           move away from counts of host and then multiplying by a

    22           factor of five or ten, which is now meaningless because some

    23           hosts are single-user hosts.  In other words, my machine,

    24           collette.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu just has me on it, so that's

    25           called a single-host machine or a single-user machine, but

                                                                            64

     1           other hosts, as I've already said, have thousands of people

     2           associated with them.  So, what we have to do is count the

     3           users.  So, the only way to know how many people are coming

     4           to your site and, particularly because of other problems like

     5           the spiders and Bots that go out searching and hit the site

     6           and count as hits, the only way to know is to count the

     7           people on the other side.

     8           BY MR. HANSEN:  

     9           Q   And if we took your computer and ran the number of hits

    10           that your computer received on a particular day, and then

    11           also ran the number of unique domains that had been to your

    12           site on a particular day, the number of actual human beings

    13           would likely be somewhere between those two numbers?

    14           A   Right, but in my particular case, on our server, much

    15           closer to the number of unique domains and that's because we

    16           do not serve, you know, tens of thousands of pages, we're a

    17           research center site and we put up our research papers and we

    18           have thousands of pages.  But a site like Pathfinder, for

    19           example, Time Warner's site, which consists of many of its

    20           on-line magazines and lots of content, they report that they

    21           get like two million hits a week.  So that's clearly a

    22           meaningless number from a commercial perspective, because all

    23           it says is that many files and pictures and images are being

    24           served up, but says very little about who is coming, how many

    25           are coming, how often they're coming and to which pages

                                                                            65

     1           they're coming.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how long they're on?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  And -- exactly.  Duration, we believe,

     4           is one of the critical variables for measuring the value of a

     5           visit to a Web site in this environment and that hits are

     6           meaningless, unique domains are a lower bound, but nothing

     7           else and just useful as a starting point, and that the key

     8           issues are visits and behavior in a network navigation

     9           context, which includes duration in the Web site.

    10           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    11           Q   Professor Hoffman, are hits meaningless in this context: 

    12           If you are at your Web site in Vanderbilt required to screen

    13           every person who comes to your site and, indeed, every one of

    14           the thousands -- each time anyone goes to any one of the

    15           thousands of pages on your site and determine whether that

    16           person is above the age of 18 or under the age of 18, is hits

    17           a meaningless number in that context?

    18           A   Completely meaningless.  Hits, even unique domains are

    19           just completely meaningless, there is no way to determine

    20           from the server log file, which contains information on the

    21           hits and the unique domains, who is coming to my Web site.

    22           Q   But you would nevertheless have to screen the -- the

    23           number of times you would have to check to see if someone is

    24           18 or not 18 would be roughly measured by the number of hits,

    25           the number of actual times you would have to look and see is

                                                                            66

     1           that person 18 or not?

     2           A   Yes, roughly speaking, by some -- divided by some factor

     3           for how many hits were on a particular page, but, yes, if I -

     4           - let's just say I have a thousand pages, for sake of

     5           argument, on the Project 2000 site, every single one of those

     6           pages of those 1,000 pages would have to have some sort of

     7           screening device, otherwise I would not be able to prevent

     8           them from coming to those pages or determining who was coming

     9           to those pages.

    10           Q   When you run the unique domain list of the number of

    11           unique domains that have come to your site on a particular

    12           day does it also show the country from which someone has come

    13           to access your site?

    14           A   Well, it could, it's -- it could in the sense that unique

    15           domains have identifiers associated with them.  To understand

    16           this idea we can introduce the notion of what we'll call the

    17           top-level domain.  So, again, to use my example,

    18           collette.ogsm.vanderbilt.edu, that's my entire address or

    19           host name or domain name, the top level is edu and that

    20           identifies my machine as coming from an educational

    21           institution, because it has the .edu address.  Now, the most

    22           common addresses in cyberspace are the .com for commercial,

    23           that's the top level. So, aol.com or timewarner.com or

    24           openmarket.com and so on.  Edu is the second most common,

    25           followed by .net, which represent Internet service providers

                                                                            67

     1           and other gateways to the Internet.  There's .org for

     2           nonprofit organizations, .gov, for government organizations. 

     3           So, the domain name here almost certainly has a .gov at the

     4           end of it, and so on.  So, it is -- and then there are many

     5           other domain names, like .ca at the top would represent

     6           Canada, .es would represent Estonia and so on.  So, in theory

     7           it is possible to run a program and count, using a table for

     8           lookup, say, which would say, well, I know how many came from

     9           Spain, I know how many came from Finland, I know how many

    10           came from the Netherlands and so on, because in the

    11           Netherlands they usually use a .nl as the top-level domain. 

    12           So, you can get -- but that only gives you an underestimate,

    13           because increasingly the .com address is being used abroad

    14           and that didn't used to be the case, but is now increasingly

    15           the case, and the .com host is about 26 percent of all hosts

    16           on the Internet.  So, right now the Internet has -- it was

    17           just recently measured in January, it's measured every six

    18           months by Mark Lottor, and his latest measurements show that

    19           the Internet has 9.47 million hosts, about, give or take.  Of

    20           those nine and a half million, let's round it for ease of

    21           discussion, about 26 percent are .com, about 19 percent are

    22           .edu, and we know that -- so that the .coms represent not

    23           just U.S. commercial enterprise, but also overseas commercial

    24           enterprise.

    25           Q   And using this system --

                                                                            68

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, what percentage are .org?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I think it's about three percent, a

     3           little less than three percent.  The .net, .org and .gov are

     4           all running a little below three percent.  If we look at a

     5           host distribution by country, though, that was in -- the

     6           latest measurements for that were taken in July of 1995.  So,

     7           we don't have the figures for Mr. Lottor's most recent

     8           calculations, because they haven't been done yet; however,

     9           those distributions show that 60 percent of hosts were

    10           thought to originate from the United States and 40 percent of

    11           those hosts, and in July, '95 the hosts were running a little

    12           over six and a half million, now it's almost ten million, so

    13           it was about 60-40 U.S., non-U.S., and the distribution -- I

    14           don't remember exactly, it was United States followed by --

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the source you're citing is

    16           what?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Lottor.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Lottor?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Lottor, L-o-t-t-o-r, Mark Lottor, he

    20           runs a company called Network Wizards and as a service to the

    21           Internet community he runs a program which counts the number

    22           of hosts on the computer every six months.  I don't -- I

    23           cannot find my... oh, here it is, I found it.  My listing is

    24           United States had a little over 60 percent, followed by

    25           Germany, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, Japan, the

                                                                            69

     1           Netherlands, France, Finland and Sweden, and those are the

     2           top ten.  Now, the distribution now is thought to be 60-40,

     3           even though we don't know yet, but we believe it's moving

     4           towards 60-40 and it was at 64-36.  So, it's clearly moving

     5           toward parody and that seems -- is also borne out by counting

     6           the number of networks connected to the Internet, which is

     7           now moving toward a parody distribution of about 50-50,

     8           meaning about 50 percent of networks connected to the net are

     9           in the U.S. and about 50 percent of networks connected to the

    10           Internet are non-U.S.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that also Mr. Lottor's work?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  That is also Mr. Lottor's work, with

    13           also John Quarterman, who provided some of these statistics

    14           based on reanalyses of Mr. Lottor's data.

    15           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    16           Q   Professor Hoffman, you were present in court yesterday

    17           when Ms. Duvall did her demonstration?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   And you saw her take us all to a site that was in London,

    20           is that correct?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   Is it fair to say that it takes just as many clicks to go

    23           a site in London as it does to go to a site in Philadelphia?

    24           A   Yes, or just as few, as the case may be.

    25           Q   Now, I'd like you to -- I'd like to refer you back to

                                                                            70

     1           Defendant's Exhibit 13-A, which was the Little Women search. 

     2                    (Pause.)

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   Now, the particular entry on that page that you were

     5           questioned about, the see-hot-pictures-of-naked-women page,

     6           do you know whether that particular site if I clicked on it

     7           would be blocked by Surf Watch?

     8           A   I don't know.

     9           Q   Let's look at Defendant's Exhibit 49, which was the --

    10           which was Bianca's site which you were questioned about.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Now, Mr. Baron asked you to read Technology Measures 1

    14           and 2, he didn't ask you to read Technology Measure 3, would

    15           you read that?  It's Number 4, but Technology Measure 3,

    16           would you read that one, please?

    17           A   Yes, Technology Measure Number 3:  "We heartily support

    18           all self-imposed Internet content selection solutions, such

    19           as Surf Watch and PICS."

    20           Q   Now, the three technology solutions that are suggested on

    21           this site, do they have anything in common?

    22           A   Yes, they're all user-oriented solutions, because their

    23           activity and control all would reside in the hands of the

    24           user or the people who are accessing the content or

    25           interested in accessing the content.

                                                                            71

     1           Q   Does this site suggest any method by which the content

     2           provider could insure that no one under the age of 18 was

     3           visiting their site?

     4           A   No, and I believe that's because no such solutions are

     5           possible.  And in fact I think it's instructive that they are

     6           requiring you to tell them when you don't wish to be able to

     7           go there, because that's the only way that they can know is

     8           if you tell them.

     9           Q   Thank you.

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, given the objection that

    11           was raised at the beginning of this, I just want to make sure

    12           that her declaration went in as her direct testimony?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Absolutely.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think so --

    15                    MR. HANSEN:  Okay, thank you.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- if it didn't, it does now.

    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do you have any --

    19                    MR. BARON:  Subject to our objection, your Honor.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Pardon?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Subject to our objection on the

    22           paragraph.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you have any recross?

                                                                            72

     1                    MR. BARON:  No, your Honor.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Judge Buckwalter?

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I just have a very few questions. 

     4           Throughout your -- well, not throughout your declaration, but

     5           in your declaration, as well as others, there's reference to

     6           the Internet as being a truly democratic information flow and

     7           I think you say in 24 a democratic form of communication,

     8           what do you mean by that when you say that?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  I mean that the Internet, particularly

    10           as compared to traditional communication media and even some

    11           other forms of new media, like other interactive media, is

    12           truly a revolution in the sense that for the first time in

    13           the history of communication media users or individuals can

    14           provide content to the medium.  So, in addition to accessing

    15           information or content they can also provide information to

    16           the medium.  And the other unique feature is coupled with

    17           this idea of interactivity, so that not only can you and I

    18           communicate with each other through the medium, something we

    19           call person interaction, but I can communicate directly with

    20           the medium, something we call machine interactivity, and

    21           that's the idea where I can both access content and provide

    22           it.  So, for the first time there is an opportunity for all

    23           people or any person who has access to the medium to put

    24           their opinion on the medium or in essence to have a voice in

    25           society as represented by the Internet.

                                                                            73

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Without any government

     2           interference, does that --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Without any --

     4                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- have something to do with your

     5           the -- the --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  No, not really.  No, I meant it in the

     7           sense that there was no -- no, I meant it more that the

     8           medium does not discriminate on the basis of the individual's

     9           either accessing or providing the content.  So, for example,

    10           if I put a site up, which I did, the Project 2000 site, my

    11           site has just as much chance or is just as likely to be

    12           visited by people as a site by a communications conglomerate

    13           like Time Warner, because there is nothing inherent in the

    14           medium keeping someone from coming to Project 2000, there are

    15           no barriers, there are no gateways, they don't have to pay to

    16           get there --

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But there is a -- there is a Big

    18           Brother overlooking the media -- or overlooking the Internet

    19           in a sense, isn't there?  If it's not the government it's the

    20           people who for example have the -- in these directories

    21           you're talking about who make choices as to what goes in the

    22           directory?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't look at that -- I don't

    24           think of that as Big Brother --

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, no, I mean maybe not as Big

                                                                            74

     1           Brother, but there's somebody out there.  And on the on-line

     2           discussion forums, for example, isn't there somebody who

     3           steers the discussion in some way?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, not necessarily.  On UseNet news

     5           groups, there are two types of UseNet news groups, if that's

     6           what you're referring to?

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah, I mean --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  And those -- there are moderated --

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- on some discussion forums

    10           isn't there somebody who steers and focuses the discussion?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it depends what you mean by --

    12           no, I am not aware of anyone --

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  It's not an open --

    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- on un-moderated discussion lists

    15           like UseNet news groups, for example, who steers or focuses

    16           the discussion.  The people themselves determine the content

    17           and the focus and the positioning of the discussion, but

    18           there is no person on the shoulder of the UseNet news group

    19           if it's un-moderated saying now we will talk about X and

    20           tomorrow we will talk about Y.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I only raise that question

    22           because I was surfing or browsing magazines, which is what we

    23           used to do --

    24                    (Laughter.)

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- and The Atlantic magazine, in

                                                                            75

     1           this month's article -- that's on something called paper --

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- raised this, suggesting that

     4           the most popular on-line discussion forums tend to be not

     5           purely democratic by quasi-authoritarian in spirit, with an

     6           active systems operator who both steers and stimulates

     7           debate.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Maybe you put on the record --

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  On the record, that's --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- where you're --

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- the -- that's attributed to

    12           James Fowell (ph.), the Washington editor of The Atlantic

    13           magazine and it's their April issue.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And his position was that for the

    16           time being that the editors and other data winnowers are

    17           becoming important in this whole scheme of things, because

    18           they do actually overlook the system in some way and --

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there is no question that there

    20           are a number of gatekeepers, if you want to think of it from

    21           that perspective.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Gatekeepers, okay.  Well, that's

    23           the terminology, I --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  However, they are definitely not, at

    25           least from my perspective -- or have a Big Brother component

                                                                            76

     1           to them.  And particularly on the UseNet news groups, just to

     2           use that example, it really -- if they're not moderated

     3           people are free to say and post and do what they like, if

     4           other people don't like it then they will respond by saying,

     5           I don't like that, a process we sometimes refer to as

     6           flaming.  But the whole behavior on the group is very organic

     7           with no one necessarily determining now we will do this and

     8           then we will do that.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What does organic mean in that

    10           context?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it flows -- it evolves

    12           naturally, there is no one in charge of the process, it is

    13           allowed to grow and flow naturally as events unfold.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Like a conversation at a cocktail

    15           party.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly.  Now, there are 

    17           gatekeepers --

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But it's not that exactly though,

    19           is it?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think it's more like that --

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, okay, we won't debate that.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  -- than like the way that you

    23           proposed, because the Internet is composed of -- for example,

    24           on UseNet news there are approximately 15,000 UseNet news

    25           groups and, by and large, I would say that the behavior is

                                                                            77

     1           very open and democratic with access to all, you can say what

     2           you like, other people can respond in kind or not, you are

     3           not required to respond, and really there is no one in charge

     4           in a broader sense.  The same is true on the Web, there are

     5           many indexes, there are not just one index and that's it and

     6           that's the only one you can list in and if you don't list

     7           there, forget it, you're no one.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand the point you're

     9           trying to make.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did you have any more questions?

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I think that's all then.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have a number of questions.  First

    14           of all, these -- this hierarchy you referred to, the point

    15           that .com means commercial, that .edu means education, these

    16           are self-given names?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  No, they are -- there is a

    18           registration process that you have to go through for

    19           addresses --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I thought.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  -- through an organization called

    22           Internick (ph.) and domains have to be registered so that

    23           they can be connected to the Internet.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And also so that they're not

    25           duplicated?

                                                                            78

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's the most important point,

     2           so that you have a unique identifier in cyberspace for your

     3           host computer to be connected to the Internet.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And so Internick, somebody at

     5           Internick makes a judgment, correct?  For example, if my

     6           daughter wanted to register and say I'm an edu somebody there

     7           would say that's ridiculous, you're just a kid?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, there are specific rules for --

     9           which are fairly broadly defined, but rules nonetheless

    10           governing the use of the top-level domains, particular for

    11           .com, .edu, .net, .org and .gov.  I think there are other

    12           organizations besides Internick that register and the rules

    13           are different, particularly for some of the European or

    14           overseas addresses, because it could also be the case that it

    15           might say .es, which stands for Estonia, but it's not

    16           necessarily the case that those hosts originate in Estonia. 

    17           So, it's very complicated.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Referring now to your

    19           declaration, in Paragraph 31, Footnote 1 there has a number

    20           of statistics and the footnote begins by saying, "The most

    21           recent figures, decisionmakers are using for business

    22           planning and research purposes," do you see that?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And then it makes reference to the

    25           "so-called total core economy for electronic commerce on the

                                                                            79

     1           Internet will approach $45.8 billion by the year 2000," et

     2           cetera.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm, yes.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Where do those numbers come from?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  The first source -- these all come

     6           from analysts --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Pardon me?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Analysts.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, Wall Street analysts?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Or research analysts who specialize in

    13           the Internet.  I put them here just to -- first of all to

    14           show the enormous range in the estimates, from very small to

    15           very large, I think by and large reflecting that we really

    16           don't know what's going to happen in the long run.  The first

    17           estimate comes from Forrester Research, the second estimate I

    18           believe comes from Alex Brown and Sons, and then the third

    19           one comes from Hamberg & Quist (ph.), and these are different

    20           analysts who are involved in assessing the business

    21           opportunity for the Internet.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Who are advising -- for the purposes

    23           of advising investors on where to put their money?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  As one example, yes.  In the case of

    25           Forrester Research no, they do -- their clients, they do

                                                                            80

     1           research for their clients on, say, strategic opportunities

     2           on the Internet, in which case it's still important to know

     3           from an investment perspective, say if I wish to open up a

     4           commercial enterprise on line, you know, what -- you know,

     5           how much money could I make, for example.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Page 10, Paragraph 40, just

     7           so I'm absolutely sure I understand what you're saying here,

     8           when you say, and now I'm quoting, "because network

     9           navigation is nonlinear," when you use the word nonlinear

    10           there what exactly do you mean?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Exactly what I mean is that the

    12           navigation process is not strict ordered and sequential.  So,

    13           for example, it's not a rough linear menu, meaning things

    14           fall in a line in order, first one, then you must go to two,

    15           then you must go to three, then you must go to four, as if

    16           they were literally ordered on a line and I had to proceed in

    17           that fashion.  The network navigation experience on the

    18           Worldwide Web is nonlinear in the sense that either I might

    19           be presented with a set of choices on a Web page which are a

    20           list, but I can go anywhere on the list I want, I don't have

    21           to go in order, or, as increasingly is the case, they might

    22           be presented to me graphically in means of different images

    23           or maps or pictures, and I simply move my mouse and point to

    24           the particular area on the map on which I want to go and then

    25           I'm off.

                                                                            81

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, that's very helpful,

     2           thank you.  You also say on Page 21 in Paragraph 93, you make

     3           what seems to me to be an extraordinary statement and I just

     4           want to draw you out on it a little bit.  You referred to the

     5           -- I assume the Internet and the capacity for many-to-many

     6           decentralized communication at --

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I'm sorry, would you repeat the

     8           paragraph, please?

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  93.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You refer to it as, quote, "the most

    12           important innovation to human society since the development

    13           of the printing press," close-quote.  Now, that's a pretty

    14           extravagant statement, wouldn't you agree?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  I do -- yes, but I do believe --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But do you stand by it, or is it

    17           just --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I believe that the Internet is

    19           the most important communications innovation to human society

    20           since the development of the printing press.  So --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Because it allows for -- because of

    23           it's many-to-many nature it allows for a level of

    24           communication and interactivity among human beings which is

    25           unprecedented in our society, and it also allows for

                                                                            82

     1           individuals in our society to have the opportunity to

     2           contribute information in a mechanism that was never before

     3           possible.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  In Paragraph 101 on Page

     5           22 you make the statement, "The act will have a negative

     6           impact on commercialization, because many providers will

     7           either exit the market or simply never enter."  I'm not quite

     8           sure why you say that.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I believe there is already a lot

    10           of evidence that the act will have negative consequences on

    11           commercialization of the Internet.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What evidence are you aware of in

    13           your area of expertise?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  From commercial providers and other

    15           people who are considering becoming commercial providers who

    16           are very concerned about the impact of the act either on

    17           their business or on potential for their business.  And --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you know that?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  How do I know --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you know that they're

    21           concerned?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Because they have told me.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And they have told you that

    24           they haven't entered the business or --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  They have told me that they're

                                                                            83

     1           considering -- I have had conversations with providers who

     2           are considering exiting the business, providers who already

     3           have, for example, removed material because they are

     4           uncertain of its impact on people, and people who were

     5           thinking of getting on line and are now very concerned.  For

     6           example, women who are considering getting into commercial

     7           enterprises.  I participated in a forum on Compuserve in a

     8           section devoted to women and business, and I was presented as

     9           an expert that the women could interact with -- or men too,

    10           but it largely drew women who were very interested in

    11           starting up enterprises that in some way involved the

    12           Internet.  And for women the Internet can represent a very

    13           interesting business opportunity because it presents the

    14           potential to work at home, for example, so you could still be

    15           involved in the rearing of your children and you could still

    16           potentially run a very profitable business yet out of your

    17           house, which is another example of how it's democratic

    18           because the entry barriers are very low, you don't need a lot

    19           of capital investment in order to set up a site on the

    20           Worldwide Web.  However, the women are very concerned about

    21           not only the technical issues involved or some of the more

    22           maybe conceptual issues with how would I use this medium, but

    23           also the legal issues of what will it mean for me, this is

    24           now too complicated, I won't be able to figure it out, you

    25           know, I'm just not going to get involved in this.  And, so, I

                                                                            84

     1           do see in my work an enormous amount of concern on the part

     2           of providers or potential providers, and in fact I would

     3           suggest that the concern is even more potent for the small

     4           providers.  And, so, from the perspective of, say, the small

     5           business or an individual business person or what we might

     6           refer to as a mom-and-pop that the fear is very real.  It

     7           might be less of a concern for Time Warner who may feel, oh,

     8           well, we will have the legal resources to deal with these

     9           issues as they arise, but for small providers that's not the

    10           case.  And, so, in that sense the democratic, open, low-

    11           barrier nature of the net becomes at risk.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And lastly, just to make sure

    13           I understand your testimony, Paragraphs 107 through 111, the

    14           figures in those paragraphs, do they all come from Mr.

    15           Lottor?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  No, they come from a number of

    17           different sources.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, could you briefly

    19           summarize for us where they come from?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  The source in Paragraph 107 --

    21           well, actually I should clarify that most of these numbers if

    22           we were to trace them back come from Mark Lottor's analysis

    23           of host counts on the Worldwide Web, the data are then

    24           reanalyzed by primarily two different individuals, the first

    25           individual is Tony Rutkowski, he was --

                                                                            85

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you spell that, please?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, R-u-t-k-o-w-s-k-i.  He was

     3           formerly the director of the Internet Society and he is now

     4           with General Magic, a software company in California.  And

     5           Mr. Rutkowski performs reinterpretations or reanalyses or re-

     6           parsings of Mr. Lottor's data, which is just presented in a

     7           tabular form, it is not particularly interesting from a

     8           commercial perspective.  And, so, these data come from him or

     9           from Mr. Quarterman, who runs a strategic consulting firm for

    10           Internet use in Austin and also performs reanalyses for

    11           strategic purposes.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, are those in articles that have

    13           been published?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  No, they're on the Internet, they are

    15           not in -- do not appear in peer-reviewed journals.  These

    16           numbers change the next day.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Dr. Hoffman, do the -- let

    19           me take you to the concept of flow that you talk about in

    20           your declaration and a little bit in your examination here

    21           today.  Do the experts in the field of psychology accept the

    22           concept of flow?  In other words, is it a recognized concept

    23           by respected scientists in the field?  I'm not sure that's

    24           exactly the Daubert standard, but we'll --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, the answer is yes.  The

                                                                            86

     1           concept was developed by a psychologist, Mahayli Gezens (ph.)

     2           Mahayli, and he has done some work on his own, with his wife

     3           and many other co-authors, all of it published in peer-

     4           reviewed, refereed scholarly journals in the psychological

     5           literature.  And he has actually written several popular

     6           books on the topic, one of the best known is Flow:  The

     7           Psychology of Optimal Experience, which is a book not exactly

     8           for the lay person, but more popular than his other scholarly

     9           work.  He has developed the concept in a very generic

    10           context, in other words, that flow is a construct that

    11           describes people's experiences in situations I described

    12           previously, for example playing chess, rock climbing,

    13           dancing, things of that nature.  Additionally, the concept

    14           has achieved recognition in the organizational studies

    15           literature by workers who are studying human-computer

    16           interaction and believe that the concept also has merit and

    17           utility there.  So, for --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, was -- then is this concept

    19           of flow as related to this interactive computer relationship,

    20           is that also accepted in peer-review articles?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, yes, I'm happy to say now that

    22           it is, because that is our concept and our paper on that

    23           topic will appear in July in the Journal of Marketing, which

    24           is the top journal in the marketing field and is peer-

    25           reviewed, refereed and double-blind.

                                                                            87

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, but if you remove the

     2           concept of flow or you set it aside and this state called the

     3           pleasure of intrinsically motivated experiential flow state,

     4           all of which I gather means that people feel good --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- when they use a computer, so

     7           that -- when it goes back and forth, you know --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes -- or -- well, yes.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  But if you set that concept

    10           aside at the moment would you still reach the bottom line,

    11           which I gather is the bottom line of some of your

    12           declaration, that it's important for users to be able to jump

    13           from hypertext link -- one hypertext link to another in a

    14           seamless fashion because it facilitates the use of the

    15           Internet or Worldwide Web as a goal-directed approach, by

    16           which I understand you are saying that this is a way of

    17           getting information, if you want information, it's the same

    18           as going to a library; a different method of going, but it's

    19           still important because it facilitates that kind of research,

    20           let us say.  Is that basically what it comes down to?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, that's -- no, that's exactly

    22           correct because, as we state in our research papers, the flow

    23           experience is not necessarily achievable by every person who

    24           gets on line --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I can understand that.

                                                                            88

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I mean, there might be -- I assume

     3           there might be frustrations as well.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes -- no, in fact we -- the reason

     5           that the flow concept is of interest is because it allows us

     6           to study precisely frustrations and the things that might

     7           keep people from having a good time or enjoying themselves. 

     8           Nevertheless, whether we could get into flow or not on any

     9           particular occasion or whether even I could ever get into

    10           flow, because we believe some people will never get there,

    11           the concept of network --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's like nirvana maybe.

    13                    (Laughter.)

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's related to peak experience,

    15           but not the same, yes.  Whether we --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I'm more interested in the

    17           concept of getting information, which I think --

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we -- I completely believe that

    19           the -- 

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- is an entirely different

    21           concept.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, network navigation, the

    23           process exists regardless of whether you will achieve flow or

    24           be in the flow state or not during that process.  And network

    25           navigation is the process of self movement or direction

                                                                            89

     1           through cyberspace and that process is impeded or is

     2           potentially impeded by the idea of a necessity to register or

     3           to say, here I am now at yet another site, because

     4           potentially then I no longer can move seamlessly through

     5           cyberspace.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And then when you say seam -- what

     7           do you mean by seamlessly?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Seamlessly meaning from click to

     9           click.  There is a lot of evidence that the explosive growth

    10           of the Worldwide Web is due to word of mouth, which means

    11           that people see how exciting it is and then they tell someone

    12           else.  And the nature of that excitement comes from being

    13           able to one minute I'm in Paris, the next I'm in Finland.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but if you set aside

    15           excitement, because I must -- I mean, set aside that concept

    16           and go to the information-retrieval sort of concept, then you

    17           would put seamless -- is it fair -- because I'm just trying

    18           to understand what you're saying in language I can

    19           understand, is it fair that you analogize seamlessness to

    20           walking into a public library without having to register?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, exactly.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, then I understand.  Thank

    23           you.

    24                    Did our questions elicit -- evoke any questions by

    25           counsel?

                                                                            90

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But you're saying that from, as it

     2           were, a marketing analysis point of view that the

     3           seamlessness of going from hyperlink to hyperlink is itself

     4           what has attracted so many people to use this innovation?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Well, not even from a marketing point

     6           of view, I'm suggesting from a human communication point of

     7           view.  So, it's much broader than from a commercial

     8           perspective, because we also study the behavioral aspects of

     9           being in cyberspace.  And it is this ability to move

    10           seamlessly through the Worldwide Web that we believe has

    11           contributed to its explosive growth, yes.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, you're saying they get a high

    13           when they can jump from one link to another like I or Judge

    14           Dalzell or Judge Buckwalter might get a high just by going

    15           into a library and being able --

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- being able to look at the books?

    18                    (Laughter.)

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Other people might not, but we

    20           might.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  But some people will, that's right. 

    22           And notice that your high of being able to look at the books

    23           is very nonlinear.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But it's more than a high, isn't it? 

    25           I mean, it's a little more mundane than a high, it's just

                                                                            91

     1           easy, it's just easy?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  It's easy, yes, it's easy; you might

     3           get high, you might not, but it's easy.

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron, I apparently evoked some

     6           questions -- or maybe Judge Dalzell did from you.

     7                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

     8           BY MR. BARON:  

     9           Q   Professor Hoffman, in response to Judge Dalzell's

    10           questions you mentioned some out-of-court statements of women

    11           being concerned or others being concerned about the effect of

    12           the act and you hearing them say that to you, correct?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   And you stated that some of these women or others

    15           represent mom-and-pop businesses or small business providers,

    16           correct?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   Do any of these mom-and-pop businesses or small business

    19           providers, are they in the business of providing sexually

    20           explicit materials?

    21           A   I don't know, I mean, some of them might be.  Some of

    22           these conversations take place on an on-line community called

    23           "the Well" and, while I know the people's names, I don't

    24           necessarily know the nature of their business.

    25           Q   You can't give any concrete examples of the nature of the

                                                                            92

     1           businesses where people are concerned about the effect of the

     2           Communications Decency Act?

     3           A   You mean do I know the particular lines of work?  Well,

     4           in the case of people that are thinking about getting into

     5           the business they are very vague in the sense that they are

     6           thinking of providing some sort of information.  And in fact

     7           a lot of times we get calls from people who would like us to

     8           consult on projects in which they say what would the

     9           opportunities be and, so, part of the work is to try to

    10           identify, here are some opportunities for providing

    11           information in cyberspace that might be profitable.  In other

    12           cases, like, for example, there are people who sell T-shirts

    13           on line, things of that nature, people who sell posters.  I'm

    14           trying to think of ones that I know about, things -- those

    15           are what I would consider small providers or mom-and-pops,

    16           people selling catalogues to information, stuff like that.

    17                    MR. BARON:  I have nothing further.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Hansen?

    19                            FURTHER REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    20           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    21           Q   Professor Hoffman, I would first like to follow up on

    22           Judge Buckwalter's question about moderated news groups.  Do

    23           you know what percentage of UseNet news groups are moderated

    24           in the way Mr. Fowell was suggesting in the Atlantic article?

    25           A   No, I have no idea.

                                                                            93

     1           Q   Do you think that the percentage of moderated UseNet news

     2           groups is a relatively small percentage?

     3           A   I -- well, out of 15,000 I would guess that it is,

     4           because I believe it to be the case that most of the news

     5           groups on UseNet news are not moderated.

     6           Q   I would also like to follow up just a second on the Chief

     7           Judge's question when she asked you about is it like getting

     8           into the library without having to check in at the front

     9           desk.  Is the nature of the hyperlink process such that you

    10           can go effortlessly from the fourth floor of Widener Library

    11           in Boston to the third floor of Carnegie Mellon's library

    12           in...

    13                    UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER:  Pittsburgh.

    14                    MR. HANSEN:  Pittsburgh, I'm sorry.

    15                    (Laughter.)

    16           BY MR. HANSEN:  

    17           Q   In Pittsburgh without ever having to travel back and

    18           forth, is that the nature of what hyperlinks are all about?

    19           A   Yes.  And even more than that though, if we -- once we

    20           went from a library in one city and one state to a library in

    21           another city and another state through one click, it's also

    22           the case that it would be as if every single book on every

    23           single shelf you had to register, because every single page

    24           would require some sort of registration process.  So, it

    25           would be much more onerous than simply checking in at the

                                                                            94

     1           door, it would be every single book I wanted to select I

     2           would have to go through a process to determine whether I

     3           could select it or not.

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any more?  The Court would like the

     6           plaintiffs at some appropriate time to annotate Dr. Hoffman's

     7           declaration with the sources that she gave us in testimony,

     8           because I think maybe many of us did not have an opportunity

     9           to put them down.  Is there any objection to that?

    10                    MR. BARON:  No, your Honor.

    11                    MR. HANSEN:  We would be happy to do so, your Honor.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, thank you.  Thank you

    13           very much.

    14                    (Witness excused.)

    15                    (Discussion held off the record.)

<PRE>


    16                    MS. KAPPLER:  Good morning, your Honor, it's Ann

    17           Kappler from Jenner and Block for the ALA plaintiffs.  Please

    18           excuse my voice, I have a little cold.  At this time the

    19           plaintiffs would like to call Robert Croneberger.

    20                    THE COURT CLERK:  Good morning, sir.  Would you

    21           please state and spell your name?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Robert, R-o-b-e-r-t, B., Croneberger,

    23           C-r-o-n-e-b-e-r-g-e-r.

    24                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please raise your right hand.

    25                    ROBERT B. CRONEBERGER, Plaintiffs' Witness, Sworn.

                                                                            95

     1                    THE COURT CLERK:  Thank you.  Please be seated.

     2                    MS. KAPPLER:  At this time plaintiffs move into

     3           evidence the supplemental declaration of Mr. Croneberger as

     4           his direct trial testimony.  Mr. Croneberger executed the

     5           supplemental declaration on March 19th and it was previously

     6           submitted to this Court.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection?

     8                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No objection.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then it will be accepted.

    10                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor.  I would like

    11           to make one correction, if I might, in Mr. Croneberger's

    12           declaration, and this is a clerical error on the part of my

    13           office.  In Paragraph 21 there is a reference to Plaintiffs'

    14           Exhibit 203, this is his discussion of the RIM study as it

    15           appears on their server, that should be a reference to

    16           Exhibits 203 and 204.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    19                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you.  The Government has

    20           previously --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government have that

    22           change?

    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, thank you.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.

    25                    MS. KAPPLER:  The Government has previously

                                                                            96

     1           indicated that they did not have any cross-examination for

     2           Mr. Croneberger, so we are presenting Mr. Croneberger for the

     3           Courts' questions.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, but we're going to give the

     5           Government a chance to say that.

     6                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Actually the Government will have

     7           cross-examination.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There you go.

     9                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    10           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    11           Q   Good morning, Mr. Croneberger, how are you?

    12           A   Good morning.  Fine, thank you.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you on the tape today?

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I will reintroduce myself.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  My name is Patricia Russotto, I'm an

    17           attorney at the Department of Justice, representing the

    18           Department of Justice in this action.

    19           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    20           Q   Now, Dr. Croneberger, you are director of the Carnegie

    21           Library, correct?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   In Pittsburgh?

    24           A   Yes.

    25                    (Laughter.)

                                                                            97

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll never forget it.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  But not Carnegie Mellon Library.

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, I understand.

     4           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

     5           Q   Now, the Carnegie Library has available on line a variety

     6           of materials, is that right?

     7           A   Correct.

     8           Q   And included in the on-line materials that are available

     9           you have a computerized card catalogue system, right?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   Which has all of the materials that are available in the

    12           Carnegie Library collection -- well, I'll back off on that,

    13           we went through this in your deposition.

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   It has about two million of the items that are available

    16           in your collection, correct?

    17           A   That's right, yes.

    18           Q   And you also have available on line some of the full

    19           texts of journal articles that the library subscribes to,

    20           correct?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   And would that also include -- do you also have some

    23           books available in full text as well on line?

    24           A   No, except through the Internet.

    25           Q   Right, okay.  Now, your electronic card catalogue

                                                                            98

     1           contains information about these two million -- some two

     2           million of the items that you have in your collection, right?

     3           A   Yes.

     4           Q   And some of the catalogue entries do contain references

     5           to sex, right?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   And some of them contain four-letter words, correct?

     8           A   Correct.

     9           Q   And what we would characterize as the seven dirty words,

    10           for purposes of this examination, right?

    11           A   Correct.

    12           Q   And when these references to sex or these references to

    13           the seven dirty words do appear in your card catalogue those

    14           words are a part of the title of the work or part of a

    15           content description of the work, is that right?

    16           A   Yes.  It could possibly be headings or subject headings

    17           or cross-references or footnotes that the cataloguers have

    18           added, yes.

    19           Q   Okay.  But some of these, for example, if we're talking

    20           about the title of a book that appears in your card

    21           catalogue, perhaps The Joy of Sex would be one where sex

    22           comes up, right?

    23           A   Correct.

    24           Q   And I believe you also have in your collection

    25           videotapes, right?

                                                                            99

     1           A   Correct.

     2           Q   So, perhaps "Sex, Lies and Videotape" would be one of the

     3           titles that would come up in your card catalogue, right?

     4           A   Correct.

     5           Q   And when we're talking about music, you have a collection

     6           of CD's as well, correct?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   And I believe you've gone through in your declaration

     9           some examples of the types of CD's that would have some of

    10           the seven dirty words either in the title or in the

    11           description of the contents of the CD, correct?

    12           A   Correct.

    13           Q   But these all appear in a card catalogue, right?

    14           A   That's right.

    15           Q   And after finding a reference to these works in the card

    16           catalogue the library patron generally has to then go

    17           physically to your stacks and either select the book or pick

    18           out the CD or take the videotape off the shelf to take it

    19           home, right?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   They don't just go directly from your electronic

    22           catalogue to the text of whatever it is that they have

    23           selected that they would like to take a look at, right?

    24           A   Except in the case of on-line journals of course, yes.

    25           Q   Right, okay.  Now, the catalogue entries themselves are

                                                                           100

     1           not actually prepared by Carnegie Library for the most part,

     2           are they?

     3           A   Not for the most part.

     4           Q   For the most part you get them from the Library of

     5           Congress, is that right?

     6           A   Yes, we get them electronically through the Ohio Center

     7           for Library Cataloguing, and they're downloaded that way

     8           electronically.  Most of -- the majority of those entries, at

     9           least the popular ones come directly from cataloguing from

    10           the Library of Congress, which is loaded electronically into

    11           the OCLC center.

    12           Q   So, you get it electronically, it's already been prepared

    13           and you get it electronically and simply insert it into your

    14           catalogue system?

    15           A   That's correct.

    16           Q   Now --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me a second.  Is it your

    18           testimony that the Library of Congress gives the information

    19           to this Ohio center and then the Ohio center puts it in

    20           machine-readable form or --

    21                    THE WITNESS:  No --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- in electronic form?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  No, the Library of Congress puts it--

    24           transfers it electronically.  All -- many large libraries,

    25           even I understand Harvard --

                                                                           101

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- contribute, as does the Carnegie

     3           Library of Pittsburgh, to this electronic data base that's

     4           gathered and collected in Ohio, and we all download, for a

     5           fee, through this center electronically.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, the Library of Congress, as well

     7           as --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  They're one of the partners --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- other providers --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  -- yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that's the central source is this

    12           Ohio center?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that Ohio University or

    15           something, or University of Ohio?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  It started at Ohio University, but it

    17           has now split off into an independent organization and it

    18           split off to provide that kind of electronic services.

    19           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    20           Q   Now, your card catalogue that you have on line, that can

    21           be searched by key words, can't it?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   And I believe that in Paragraph 32 of your declaration

    24           you have indicated that you would have to hire some 180

    25           additional staff in order to search all two million items

                                                                           102

     1           that are in your catalogue, correct?

     2                    MR. MORRIS:  Could I give a copy of --

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Oh, I'm sorry.

     4                    MR. MORRIS:  -- this declaration --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, by all means.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And could you give a paragraph

     8           citation?

     9                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  It's Paragraph 32.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

    11                    (Pause.)

    12           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    13           Q   So, you have said that you would have to hire about 180

    14           additional staff in order to search all two million items in

    15           your card catalogue, is that right?

    16           A   Yes.  If we had to search them manually and if we had to

    17           employ professionals or paraprofessionals, yes, that's

    18           correct, of our current -- just of our current collections.

    19           Q   Right, but you did say that you could do a key-word

    20           search though through the card catalogue for words related to

    21           sex or the seven dirty words, isn't that right?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   And if you do a key-word search then not all two million

    24           of your catalogue entries are going to contain any reference

    25           to sex or to the seven dirty words, are they?

                                                                           103

     1           A   Well, it entirely depends, certainly that's one of our

     2           confusions under the Act, it entirely depends on what one

     3           means by indecent or how it is described or what terminology

     4           is being used or, indeed, to what level of extent the search

     5           might be, that is, whether it's on content pages or whether

     6           it's on chapters, it would be very difficult to know.

     7           Q   Well, for example then a key-word search on the topic of

     8           sex, for example, for everything that's in your card

     9           catalogue, all the entries in your card catalogue that have

    10           the word sex in them, a key-word search like that is not

    11           likely, do you think, to turn up books about gardening, for

    12           example?

    13           A   I certainly wouldn't know, but I would doubt it.

    14           Q   You do have books about gardening at the Carnegie

    15           Library, right?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And a key-word search for the term sex isn't going to

    18           turn up books about physics?

    19           A   Excuse me --

    20           Q   Not very likely anyway?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   You agree with that, that it's not likely to turn up

    23           books about physics?

    24           A   Well, it's likely to turn up -- obviously plants

    25           proliferate and flowers grow, and it depends entirely upon

                                                                           104

     1           the kind of terminology you're using, sure.

     2           Q   Okay.  Well, what about a biography of Abraham Lincoln,

     3           do you think that would turn up in a key-word search using

     4           the word sex?

     5           A   I certainly have written -- I mean I certainly have read

     6           some articles and some journal entries about Abraham

     7           Lincoln's supposed or lack of sex life, yes.

     8           Q   Okay.  What about books about travel, would they turn up,

     9           do you think, in a book about -- in a key-word search for the

    10           word sex?

    11           A   Certainly possibly, but not likely.

    12           Q   What about books about geology, for example, would they

    13           turn up in a key-word search for the word sex?

    14           A   Probably only if the rock is put together with roll and,

    15           in that case, yes.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17           Q   Okay.

    18           A   I'm sorry, your Honors, I apologize.  Probably not.

    19           Q   Probably not, thank you.

    20                    (Laughter.)

    21           Q   Well, would you agree that a key-word search for the word

    22           sex is likely to turn up something less than all two million

    23           of your card catalogue entries?

    24           A   Yes, if that three-letter word were the only key word

    25           being used, of course, yes.

                                                                           105

     1           Q   Well, would you agree also that a key-word search for the

     2           seven dirty words are also likely to turn up something less

     3           than all two million entries at the Carnegie Library?

     4           A   Indeed.

     5           Q   Now, I think you have also said, and I'm referring to

     6           Paragraph 22 of your declaration, that you have the full text

     7           of some magazine articles on line as well, correct?

     8           A   Correct.

     9           Q   And I believe the specific examples that you gave in your

    10           declaration were Cosmopolitan, Vanity Fair and Playboy.  The

    11           Cosmopolitan magazine that you have on line I'm assuming is

    12           the same Cosmopolitan magazine that one can buy at the

    13           grocery store check-out counter, is that right?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   And the same Vanity Fair is the same Vanity Fair that you

    16           can pick up at the newsstand, right?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   And Playboy is the same Playboy you would pick up

    19           anywhere, I assume?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   Do you carry the pictures from Playboy as well?

    22           A   Not at the present time, the -- all of these on-line

    23           magazines come through a commercial vendor called the

    24           information access corporation and at the present time only

    25           the abstracts and indexes for Playboy is part of that

                                                                           106

     1           licensing agreement that they have with IAC.

     2           Q   I see.  So, someone who is accessing or trying to get on

     3           line and get the text of a Playboy article wouldn't find the

     4           pictures then?

     5           A   Not through our on-line magazine access, correct.

     6           Q   Now, referring to Paragraph 11 of your declaration, you

     7           said that it is one of the missions of the Carnegie Library

     8           to provide, quote, "the widest array of information to the

     9           widest possible audience, both adults and minors," correct?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   But you don't provide your library patrons with every

    12           type of information that might be available in the world, do

    13           you?

    14           A   No, of course not.

    15           Q   You do exercise some discretion over what is selected to

    16           become part of the collection at the Carnegie Library?

    17           A   Yes.  And then those discretionary things are made up a

    18           lot of different reasons and parameters, yes --

    19           Q   Yes.

    20           A   -- one of them is economics and one of them is -- all

    21           different kinds of things, sure.

    22           Q   And we talked about some of those when we took your

    23           deposition on I believe it was Saturday, correct?

    24           A   Right.

    25           Q   And I believe that during your deposition you identified

                                                                           107

     1           some of those selection criteria as community standards and

     2           value of the material, right?

     3           A   Correct.

     4           Q   And in fact I believe that you told me in your deposition

     5           that you, quote, "try to" -- I will show you the page

     6           reference actually before I quote this.

     7                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  May I approach, your Honor?

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you may.

     9                    (Pause.)

    10           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    11           Q   Well, let me ask you it a different way, since I do not

    12           seem to have a copy --

    13                    MR. MORRIS:  We have a copy of it.

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Do you have a copy of it?  Oh, thank

    15           you.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I apologize.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, it's consistent with the

    20           relationship that we've noted throughout.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And commend.

    22           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:  

    23           Q   I was referring to Page 35 of your deposition and it is

    24           the end of one of your responses where you had said, quote,

    25           that in fact when you select these materials you try to

                                                                           108

     1           reflect what you perceive to be the community standards of

     2           your community, is that right?

     3           A   Correct.

     4           Q   So, that is a correct statement of one of the criteria

     5           that you would use in selecting materials?

     6           A   Yes.  And I think if I -- that I say in addition to that

     7           statement right at the same time that it's not -- it isn't

     8           and cannot ever be the only criteria and that -- I go on to

     9           say that I have an informal definition of a public library as

    10           a place with material that offends every one and that's our

    11           task, our job.

    12           Q   Right, I understand that, thank you.

    13           A   Sure.

    14           Q   But you don't have Penthouse and Playboy in your

    15           collection, do you?

    16           A   Well, we have Playboy, yes.

    17           Q   But you don't have the magazine available in hard copy,

    18           do you?

    19           A   That's correct, we do not.

    20           Q   You don't have Penthouse, right?

    21           A   That's correct.

    22           Q   And you don't have Hustler, correct?

    23           A   That is correct.

    24           Q   And among your video selections you don't have sexually

    25           explicit adult films either, do you?

                                                                           109

     1           A   That's right, we do not.

     2                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I don't have anything further, your

     3           Honor.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Any redirect?

     5                    MS. KAPPLER:  Thank you, your Honor, yes.

     6                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     7           BY MS. KAPPLER:  

     8           Q   Mr. Croneberger, you mentioned that as currently now

     9           provided Playboy appears in simply an abstract form that you

    10           put it on line?

    11           A   Correct.

    12           Q   If the commercial provider who provided this information,

    13           these journals to you were to provide Playboy in full text

    14           would you post that magazine on line in full text?

    15           A   Of course, certainly.

    16           Q   And if it included Playboy magazine, delivered it to you

    17           in full text including pictures, would you post it in that

    18           form on line?

    19           A   Yes, we would.

    20           Q   Have you made a determination with your computer staff as

    21           to whether you could use a simple key-word search in order to

    22           ferret out the material that you post on line that might be

    23           subject to the Act?

    24           A   Yes, we have certainly discussed it at some length and we

    25           think it's not feasible, it's simply not possible to do given

                                                                           110

     1           the nature of communication and the nature of words and the

     2           difficulty of coming up with all of the parameters that seem

     3           to be, at least to us, a part of this Act, it would be

     4           extremely difficult to do, impossible to do.

     5           Q   And I'd like --

     6           A   Because we're talking -- I'm sorry, we're talking not

     7           only about tables of contents, but we're also talking about

     8           each edition of each magazine, each edition of each

     9           periodical.

    10           Q   And am I correct that if you were to devise some kind of

    11           a key-word search do you feel you could assure yourself that

    12           you had located every item that you posted on line that might

    13           be subject to the Act?

    14           A   No, we could not.

    15                    MS. KAPPLER:  I have no further questions, your

    16           Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Any recross, Ms. Russotto?

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I'm sorry.

    20                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  None, your Honor.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, a few questions.  You say that

    22           about a third of the cardholders of your library are minors?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you also say that you have no

    25           limitations in the library, those who actually go to the

                                                                           111

     1           library physically, that anyone of whatever age can go

     2           anywhere?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  There is no restrictions based on

     5           age?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Many libraries have different library

     7           cards, one type of card for a minor and other for adults, we

     8           do not do that and many libraries do not.  In a way it's very

     9           deliberately -- taking a look at society as it evolves and as

    10           it changes, on the one hand there's a great need for easy-to-

    11           read material on the part of adults and so, in order to

    12           promote access to that material for adults, many libraries,

    13           particularly in branch libraries in urban areas are

    14           interfiling adult and juvenile material together, so that

    15           there is no stigma attached to the adult who wants to get

    16           some easy-to-read information.  Conversely, the same thing

    17           happens in the sense that many children are far more mature

    18           in their reading levels than in the past and we openly

    19           provide access to anything that that child wants.  We feel

    20           very strongly that it's the parent's decision on what reading

    21           level is available for a child.  So, if a child comes into

    22           our library and wants to take out a seven-million-page legal

    23           text that even adults can't understand, if that child -- we

    24           certainly will try to steer that child to something far more

    25           appropriate, but if that's not successful, if the child says

                                                                           112

     1           that's what he or she wants we certainly would give it to

     2           them, yes.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And you say in Paragraph 16,

     4           you list, shall we say, some colorful titles, and at the end

     5           you say in the carryover from Page 6 to 7 that these are

     6           popular titles in our collection, how do you know?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, we certainly can electronically

     8           just know how many times a particular book is checked out or

     9           how many times a CD is checked out; we don't know who has

    10           checked that out, but we know --

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, okay.  So, these -- for

    12           example, these music titles, these are each CD's?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's -- you're just keeping

    15           track that way?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you know the next

    18           sentence, "In fact the book by Ice T and the rap music CD's

    19           are particular popular with teenagers," how do you know that?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Well, there are two methods I guess,

    21           one is the popularity in terms of waiting lists.  When we

    22           don't have enough copies of material people sign up on a

    23           reserve kind of basis and they're waiting to know.  It's

    24           simply our experience -- those particular books or that

    25           particular book was written with teenagers in mind and it has

                                                                           113

     1           a great deal to do with race relations in inner city areas

     2           and it's a popular item among teenagers.  We have some staff

     3           particularly at the main library who are called young adult

     4           librarians and it's their task specifically to relate both in

     5           terms of programs and collections to that population.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  And Paragraph 18,

     7           talking about contemporary community standards, which Ms.

     8           Russotto was getting at with you.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You say, "I have no clear

    11           understanding of what materials would be considered indecent

    12           or patently offensive for minors by some communities."  Isn't

    13           the only community you have to worry about the Three Rivers

    14           area?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't think so for a couple of

    16           reasons.  In the first place, the -- we know that a city like

    17           PIttsburgh -- well, that Pittsburgh has many different

    18           communities within it, ethnic groups that have lived in a

    19           particular neighborhood, third and fourth generations in the

    20           same homes, we know that there's stability about those ethnic

    21           neighborhoods.  We know that there are many different levels

    22           of communities within the public housing communities, for

    23           instance, in Pittsburgh.  We know that there are religious

    24           organizations and religious groups who have one level of

    25           standard which is terribly, terribly different from another

                                                                           114

     1           level of standard which also might be religious.  So, when we

     2           talk about community standards, we serve communities.  But

     3           even more so with the electronic information, and this is

     4           precisely why I'm concerned about this Act, because our

     5           material is now simply available around the world at any

     6           time, both the on-line journals, the RIM study, the kinds of

     7           projects that we're putting on line, like the early

     8           photographs of Pittsburgh we're putting all on line linking

     9           them with text, historic text, and then we're even adding

    10           audio tapes, we're adding oral history tapes into that

    11           segment, so that an old-time resident talks about the way a

    12           neighborhood has changed over that period of time.  Now,

    13           that's material that we're producing ourselves, so that we

    14           become an on-line provider, a content provider, a distributor

    15           and all of those kinds of things, that's happening more and

    16           more with libraries.  And the kinds of things that we have in

    17           our collections that we're making available to the world's

    18           population, we for instance have that one exhibit I think

    19           that we have about the RIM study, we have the number of

    20           specific domains that have contacted that study over a

    21           certain period of time.  So, it's not just our community or

    22           the local folks.  For whatever reason, this Act specifically

    23           says that -- libraries are mentioned in it as content

    24           providers or as information providers and that gives me great

    25           pause, because our collections are now available worldwide.

                                                                           115

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Two other -- two last questions. 

     2           First of all, you are active, I surmise from your vitae, in

     3           the American Library Association?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Are you in a position to answer this

     6           question, therefore:  Is the use of on-line card catalogues

     7           superseding the hard copy that I grew up with and --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Right, me too.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- I suspect you grew up with --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is that the trend in public

    12           libraries?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, indeed, it is.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is it also a trend in public

    15           libraries that where you have no copyright problems, e.g.

    16           plays of Shakespeare, are those going full text on line in

    17           libraries?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, they're on -- what was happening

    19           is that there are providers on the Internet putting specific

    20           titles like the works of Shakespeare on, so that not every

    21           library does that individually, so that we all link

    22           immediately to those kinds of things, those texts, and we all

    23           can share them and all have them.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, you can hyperlink to that?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

                                                                           116

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  My question, Mr. Croneberger, is,

     3           as I understand your 18-page declaration, the two problems

     4           you have with the Act -- and maybe you have more than that,

     5           but two of them are that first of all it's technically

     6           impossible to comply with it and, even if it were technically

     7           possible, it would be financially impossible to comply with

     8           it; and, secondly, the definitions are simply impossible, I

     9           mean, you just can't ascertain what patently offensive and

    10           indecent mean.  If you had all the money that you needed and

    11           had -- that you wanted and if there were definitions of

    12           indecent and patently offensive could you devise a system

    13           that would prevent access to people under 18, given those 

    14           two -- 

    15                    THE WITNESS:  You mean provide --

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Could you provide a system that

    17           would prevent access for people under 18 of indecent and

    18           patently offensive material?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't think we could.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Because why?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Because our definition of what that

    22           might be -- I mean even --

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, no, no, no, I'm just --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, you've given me the definition.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- giving you a hypothesis, I

                                                                           117

     1           just want to know if it's possible given the --

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Given the world's --

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- I mean, given that you have

     4           all of the money you need and, secondly, given a definition

     5           that we all agreed upon, could you devise a system then that

     6           would prevent people under 18 from getting what we have

     7           defined and agreed upon as indecent and patently offensive

     8           material?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly I could not, because I'm not

    10           an expert of anything, but I think it could be done, but it

    11           certainly would contradict the mission of public libraries in

    12           the country.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Oh, I agree, I agree with you, I

    14           was just trying to find out whether you felt a system could

    15           be --

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, sure, I would think so.

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- it is possible to do that.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't mean you necessarily

    19           agree with him that -- well, on the bottom line?

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, right.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I wanted to make that clear,

    22           that still hasn't been decided.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes, that hasn't been decided,

    24           absolutely.

    25                    (Laughter.)

                                                                           118

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I think part of our problem, if I may,

     2           with that is simply that we have parents who are very

     3           concerned about a child, a young child looking at a picture

     4           book which may show a dog urinating against a fire hydrant

     5           and to them that signifies the term indecent, or at the same

     6           time another picture book, a very famous one called 'Twas the

     7           Night Before Christmas, which at the end of the whole thing,

     8           when Santa has gone around the world and done all of the

     9           marvelous work he has done he is exhausted and takes a nip of

    10           brandy before he crawls into bed for a long sleep, and

    11           certainly we have parental objections to that sort of thing. 

    12           So that we're -- you know, we're concerned about a lot of

    13           different levels of stuff here.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me -- Judge Buckwalter tells me

    15           he's done, so I wanted to follow up, because that was my

    16           question also.  And you'll have to bear with me on this

    17           because I didn't expect to ask it, but late last night when I

    18           was working here and reading some of this material, in

    19           something that I read last night there was listed seven --

    20           and I can't remember now whether it was -- and I can't bring

    21           it up, so -- on the computer quickly, it was seven categories

    22           of material and what I can't remember is whether this

    23           material was the kind of thing that groups like Surf Watch

    24           would get out or whether it came up in some other category,

    25           but one of them was alcoholism and it dealt with where -- and

                                                                           119

     1           it made it -- it was kind of where you could get that.  And

     2           at the same time it just happened to come to my mind that

     3           what would Ray Milland and "The Lost Weekend" be, would you

     4           feel that if that -- would you -- as a librarian feel that a

     5           movie like that would then have to be removed from

     6           availability to people under 18?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I think that's one of my primary

     8           concerns, because we don't know, we would certainly be afraid

     9           so.  We would be afraid that the parameters of the

    10           terminology that might be searched if we're going into slang,

    11           if we're going into who knows, foreign languages, if we're

    12           going into visual images, our concern I think that library

    13           feels and feel pretty strongly is that there is a great deal

    14           of information that's terribly valuable.  If for instance we

    15           removed everything under the word sex we miss all of the sex-

    16           education material that's terribly important that teenagers

    17           have access to, because that's who it was written for, or

    18           that kind of material.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But going back to my question, on

    20           the other hand there are materials -- well, are there

    21           materials that deal with excessive alcoholism which you think

    22           would be pretty clearly on the other side of the line like,

    23           for example, "Leaving Las Vegas," or maybe you don't think

    24           that that is on that side of the line?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  I guess I don't -- the librarian part

                                                                           120

     1           of me doesn't want that line to exist, you see, because I

     2           think that it's a parental decision.  I certainly know what

     3           affects my 11-year-old and I know how to steer him, but I

     4           think that if we as libraries are put in the position of

     5           having to make those decisions for other people's children we

     6           will fail miserably, we will not do well.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And if you were -- or felt obliged

     8           to use something like Surf Watch or another group or

     9           mechanism like that to exclude from availability to children

    10           under 18 books or material that had, I think she said, the

    11           hundred -- the list of hundred words, would that exclude much

    12           of Shakespeare or some of Shakespeare?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  And the Bible and on and on, I think. 

    14           Public libraries would love to have net-blocker software

    15           available, so that we could loan them to parents free of

    16           charge and have the parental responsibilities there.  It's

    17           something that we do not think we can do, physically do or

    18           legally do or technically do, inside a library.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But as an expert you agree that

    20           net-blockers are available?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely, absolutely, and --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And feasible?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  And a wonderful parental-supervise

    24           tool, absolutely.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, I understand.  Thank you. 

                                                                           121

     1           Did that evoke any more questions, any of ours?

     2                    MS. KAPPLER:  No, your Honor.

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  

     5                    (Witness excused.)

     6                    (Discussion held off the record.)

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before we -- we are going to break

     8           now until 1:30, but we would like to know from counsel your

     9           best estimate of how long you think you will be with the

    10           returning witness, Dr. Bradner?

    11                    MR. MORRIS:  It's my understanding that the

    12           Government is finished its initial cross-examination --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, that's what they told us.

    14                    MR. MORRIS:  -- and --

    15                    MR. BARON:  That's correct.

    16                    MR. MORRIS:  -- and the plaintiffs, I would

    17           anticipate perhaps 20 to 30 minutes of redirect at the most,

    18           I would be surprised if it went longer than that.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Very good.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.  Then 1:30 --

    22           maybe -- let's make it 1:20, can we?

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, 1:20.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right, 1:30.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  1:30.  Counsel, could I ask that --

                                                                           122

     1           I don't know if you've done this already, but could you order

     2           expedited transcript?  It would be very helpful to us --

     3                    COUNSEL:  We have, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- so we could have it next week.

     5                    COUNSEL:  We have, your Honor.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you very much.

     7                    (Court in recess at 12:20 o'clock p.m.)

     8                    (The following occurred in open court at 1:30 p.m.)

     9                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  All rise, please.

    10                    Court is now in session.  Please be seated.

    11                    MR. MORRIS:  Good afternoon, your Honors.

    12                    THE COURT:  Good afternoon.

    13                    (Discussion off the record.)

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Going back to Dr. Bradner?

    15                    MR. MORRIS:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  I'm John

    16           Morris, again, counsel for ALA plaintiffs --

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And still.

    18                    MR. MORRIS:  And still.  (Laughter.)

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Dr. Bradner, you're still under

    20           oath.  Do you understand that?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Very good.

    23                    MR. MORRIS:  Just to clarify the record, Mr. Bradner

    24           is not a Dr. Bradner, although --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, Mr. Bradner, all right.

                                                                           123

     1                    THE WITNESS:  I may sound like one.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You fooled us.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure did.

     4                    SCOTT BRADNER, Previously Sworn, Resumed.

     5                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     6           BY MR. MORRIS:

     7           Q   Mr. Bradner, I really just want to go back over a very

     8           few points that you just talked about yesterday.  Mr. Baron

     9           asked you about the Internet Protocol Version 6.  Can you

    10           tell me, will the user of the Internet, typical user of the

    11           Internet, notice a significant change in how the Internet

    12           operates when Version 6, the next generation, is rolled out?

    13           A   The IP Version 6 itself is just a replacement for the

    14           wheels, the bit -- the packet format of the packets that go

    15           across the net.  The applications do not change in general by

    16           changing the underlayment which goes over.  There is a

    17           possibility in the long term to get some increased

    18           functionality to do with the ability to do real time

    19           processing, telephone over the Internet kind of things, but

    20           this is research work and development work yet to be done. 

    21           But basically the applications will remain the same

    22           applications you're currently using, and you wouldn't see any

    23           different -- the user would not see any difference.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So what is the change in some?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  The change in some is that the

                                                                           124

     1           individual packet can address far more nodes, so therefore --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, so it's the 32 to the 128

     3           bits.

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     5           BY MR. MORRIS:

     6           Q   And, Mr. Bradner, in your declaration submitted as direct

     7           testimony here, you describe a number of structural and

     8           operational issues raised by the Communications Decency Act. 

     9           Would those issues still be in play and still be raised under

    10           Internet Protocol Version 6?

    11           A   The issues here referred to are the inability of the

    12           speaker or the poster of some information to be able to

    13           determine whether the recipients are all qualified non-

    14           minors, is that the --

    15           Q   Right.

    16           A   And no, they would not change.

    17           Q   Okay, let me ask you, the inability of speakers that you

    18           described in your direct testimony, would that significantly

    19           change at all if you accepted Mr. Baron's proposal of placing

    20           a tag in an HTML file or a tag in a URL?  Would the speaker's

    21           ability to ensure that minors didn't have access to speech

    22           significantly change?

    23           A   I would not think it would make any difference to my

    24           level of comfort that my speech was so protected, because in

    25           order to agree that it was, I would have to hypothesize that

                                                                           125

     1           all of the possibly affected minors were using web browsers

     2           which supported this tagging, and they all had been

     3           configured to have that configura -- the exclusion features

     4           turned on.  And I would think that that would be a bit of a

     5           hard push to make the -- for me as a speaker to make that

     6           assumption, particularly since the pervasiveness from what I

     7           read of the statute which is tedious to read, though I've

     8           read it a few times, it doesn't constrain me to insure only

     9           within the United States.  So I would have -- since all of my

    10           speech on news groups and things go worldwide, I would think

    11           that I would have to be assured that worldwide that every

    12           minor who happened to have -- might potentially have access

    13           would have such a browser and have it configured in a way

    14           which restricts access.  And I think that would be a very

    15           difficult thing for me to assume, and I wouldn't want to

    16           assume that.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How about if you limited it to the

    18           United States?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  It's still something where the

    20           individual user, or the user's parent, if that be the case,

    21           would have to insure that each individual minor who has

    22           access through whatever means, through school, through

    23           libraries or through the home, would have a compliant browser

    24           and have that browser configured.  And there's no way for me

    25           as a speaker to know whether that in fact is the case.  And

                                                                           126

     1           that's my -- the substance of my direct deposition was that,

     2           that I as a speaker have no mechanism by which I can go out

     3           and examine the capabilities and feature sets of what the

     4           listeners are using to listen to my speech.  So I don't know

     5           whether they would have that restriction in.  I could not

     6           know whether they had that restriction in.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  While we're on that point, I'd like

     8           to ask a question so that we don't have to come back to it. 

     9           On page 33 of your declaration, you, in discussing tagging,

    10           you said it is impossible to imbed such flags or headers in

    11           many of the documents made available by anonymous FTP gopher

    12           and the Worldwide Web without rendering the files useless.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which paragraph was that?

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, it's on page 33.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, page 33.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, page 33.  Is that part --

    17                    MR. MORRIS:  It's paragraph 79.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.  Is that part of the same

    19           matter that you're talking about?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  No.  This is a somewhat different

    21           matter.  The matter I was just speaking of is whether I as

    22           the speaker could tell whether a user was operating a browser

    23           that would inhibit -- that would watch those tags.  What I'm

    24           speaking of in the deposition here and I also spoke of

    25           yesterday for a minute was that there are certain kinds of

                                                                           127

     1           files, whether there be voice files or picture files or

     2           executables programs, computer programs, which you couldn't

     3           actually go in and modify by adding some character stream

     4           which would be these tags, without making them inoperative

     5           just simply because they are a particular format.  And they

     6           expect to be in that format and if they're not in that format

     7           and the format would be destroyed by adding some tags, then

     8           they wouldn't work.

     9                    That doesn't mean that a new format couldn't be

    10           derived.  But the existing ones would not work.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Technologically.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Technologically, yes.

    13           BY MR. MORRIS:

    14           Q   Yesterday, at least on our side of the table, a little

    15           bit of confusion arose in terms of the definition and the

    16           explanation of links on the Worldwide Web.  Could you just

    17           take a moment and explain the relationship between a link,

    18           kind of a link -- the linkee and the linker.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In simple language.  (Laughter.)

    20                    No, I really think that it is necessary if Judges

    21           are supposed to decide matters, then it is necessary for the

    22           parties and the witnesses to present it in intelligible form.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Well, that's a strong challenge, but I

    24           will try.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, but it's a necessary one.

                                                                           128

     1                    THE WITNESS:  And if I fail, you will let me know, I

     2           am sure.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, yes, and the people for whom

     4           you are testifying will know, so I think it's very important.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Basically the way I would refer to a

     6           link in this context is simply a pointer.  It is a piece of

     7           text, and it's just a character string, it happens to have

     8           some format to it, but it's a character string which

     9           specifies a particular computer on the Internet, and a

    10           particular file within that computer that is being pointed

    11           at.

    12                    It also has some structure at the beginning which

    13           says what program do you use to go point at that.  So I can

    14           say, use the Web or use FTP or use Telnet or use some other

    15           application-level program to go look at this file.  So the

    16           file itself is -- although I used an example of one in my

    17           deposition of E2EVF12.IP which is one of the data files

    18           that's on my machine that's referring to the performance of

    19           some network device.  That's a file name.

    20                    The pointer to that would include the name of my

    21           machine, that's at NDTL.HARVARD.EDU and then the path to that

    22           file and then that file name itself.  So all it is is it's a

    23           way to globally say this is the file that I'm interested in. 

    24           It's not relevant to where the viewer sits.  It is an

    25           absolute reference to the particular piece of data, and the

                                                                           129

     1           particular piece of data is always a file of some kind,

     2           although with a reference of what program to use to do that.

     3                    Now, I think that the question you're asking is --

     4           or the implication you're coming up with is do I have to

     5           know, if I'm the provider of a file, if I have a file on my

     6           computer, do I have to be involved with somebody pointing at

     7           that file, and the answer is no.  I have no way of knowing

     8           whether somebody has a URL, one of these pointers, which

     9           refers to one of my files or refers to my computer.  It can

    10           be -- other people do that.  I know they do, I don't know

    11           who, but I do know that computer manu -- vendors of these

    12           devices have given out pointers to their data within my

    13           system.  But I don't know who did it.  I have no way of

    14           knowing.  There's no involvement on my part.  It is simply

    15           that somebody has said, if you're interested in finding out

    16           about the performance of this product, here is the URL of the

    17           file.  And so there is no relation, there is no implied

    18           relationship between the pointer and the pointee, to use your

    19           semi-technical words. 

    20                    Was that clear enough?

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, finally.  (Laughter.)

    22           BY MR. MORRIS:

    23           Q   Just as I understand it then, someone else, a company can

    24           point to your computer and point to a file on your computer. 

    25           Do they have to point to your home page, or can they point to

                                                                           130

     1           other files on your computer?

     2           A   As I mentioned yesterday, they can point to the specific

     3           file that they're interested in, bypassing any structure that

     4           I have, including my home page or any subsidiary pages or any

     5           directory structure.  They specify the particular file that

     6           they want people to look at.  It is irrelevant to what

     7           sequence I might want them to go through, if I had a home

     8           page and subsidiary pages, they would be bypassed entirely if

     9           the pointer so chose.  If the pointers chose to specify a

    10           particular data file, it would bypass all of that.

    11           Q   And so if you placed some HTML flag or tag in your home

    12           page, that would be bypassed by someone linking to one of

    13           your lower pages?

    14           A   That is correct.  This page, the home page, would not be

    15           loaded, would not be observed, would not be accessed, would

    16           no be hit, to use the parlance that was talked about this

    17           morning by the person who was accessing the data file.  It

    18           just wouldn't be seen.

    19           Q   And say -- in a lower page, say you placed a flag in a

    20           lower Web page, and that Web page included a reference to an

    21           image on your computer.  You didn't place a flag on the image

    22           because you had a flag on the page that gave immediate access

    23           to the image.  Could someone link to that image without

    24           linking to the page that you have intended to be the

    25           presentation of that image?

                                                                           131

     1           A   Yes.  You can configure browsers such as Netscape such

     2           that when you are selecting an image or something like that,

     3           selecting a URL, it will show up in a screen, a little window

     4           in the page.  So if you type that down, type down, write down

     5           that information, you have the literal pointer to a file. 

     6           And if the file happens to be a picture file which is

     7           imbedded in -- which I would normally embed in one of my

     8           pages, then you can reference it directly.  It is just

     9           another point to another file.  There is nothing special

    10           about it in the context of the way things are organized on

    11           the computer, it's just another file that happens to have a

    12           pointer to it or more than one pointer to it, however many

    13           pointers that people, including me or others, have created.

    14           Q   Okay, there's been a fair bit of discussion today and

    15           yesterday about the concept of a hit.  In terms of you as a

    16           speaker being able to control access or screen access in some

    17           way to who's getting your files, does the -- if someone comes

    18           to your Web page and initiates ten hits by getting an HTML

    19           file and a graphic image and an audio file, to keep content

    20           from that person, would you need to screen just once, or

    21           would you need to screen each request for each different

    22           file?

    23           A   Making the assumption which is implied in your question

    24           that there is a way that I can identify the originating query

    25           by using its IP address, and I want to somehow decide that

                                                                           132

     1           this person or this computer where the query is originating,

     2           and that's what I'm using to filter on, then from the

     3           server's point of view I would have to make a check for that

     4           query every time a query -- a check for that address every

     5           time a query came in and a query is a hit.  So for every hit,

     6           my server would have to verify that address.

     7           Q   So if a thousand people on a given day visited your site

     8           and generated let's say 4,000 hits by looking around your

     9           site, then do I understand that you would have to -- one

    10           would have to screen 4,000 times or just 1,000 times?

    11           A   The actual mechanism would require the screening 4,000

    12           times.  Now, just the software puts things in the temporary

    13           storage called cashing, such that the second look-up is

    14           quicker than the first one, but it still has to look up each

    15           one individually.

    16           Q   Okay.  Let me just run over a few little loose ends on

    17           some of the other areas that you were asked about yesterday.

    18                    With listserves, can you just explain that there's

    19           an individual or perhaps a company that decides to create a

    20           mail exploding program, like Listserve or Major Domo.  and

    21           then who actually speaks through that listserve?  Is it just

    22           the company, just the individual who created the listserve,

    23           or who speaks to that?

    24           A   Most listserves are for discussion.  Some listserves are

    25           for propogation of information like advertising.  In the

                                                                           133

     1           latter case then the organization that creates it, it's just

     2           a mailing list for that organization, and in which case just

     3           somebody from that organization speaks.  But for the vast

     4           majority of listserves or mail exploders, it is a

     5           communications mechanism between the people on that

     6           listserve.  Anybody who sends mail to the listserve will --

     7           the mail will be forwarded to all members of the listserve,

     8           all addresses which are in the listserve.  

     9                    There are some listserves set up so that only people

    10           who have subscribed can send mail to it, and others that are

    11           set up so that anybody can send mail to it, but only people

    12           who have subscribed will see that mail.  But there is in most

    13           cases, although than the moderated listserves where the mail

    14           will go to a moderator and then be forwarded, anybody who has

    15           the address of the listserve can send mail to it and it will

    16           be forwarded to all of the folks whose addresses are listed

    17           in the list.

    18           Q   So it's a fairly open means of communication.

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   Let's briefly discuss news groups, Usenet news groups. 

    21           There was actually a little uncertainty today, I believe you

    22           probably were in the courtroom, about number of moderated

    23           news groups.  Do you have any information that you could

    24           provide the Court, any estimate of moderated news groups

    25           versus unmoderated news groups?

                                                                           134

     1           A   I can only estimate based on when I ran the news server

     2           at Harvard, which I stopped running about two years ago.  The

     3           number of moderated news group was in the ten percent or

     4           maybe a little bit less range.  My guess today, and this is

     5           mostly a guess, would be that it would be a significantly

     6           smaller amount.  As I think I've talked yesterday, news

     7           groups and the number of people on the news groups are

     8           growing quite rapidly, so the requirement of effort of a

     9           moderator is also growing.  So that to find people who are

    10           willing to wade through thousands of messages a day to decide

    11           to forward them is getting harder and harder.  We don't have

    12           that many masochists, I guess.  And therefore the number of

    13           moderated news groups is dropping.  A number of news groups

    14           that used to be moderated are no longer moderated because

    15           they can't find somebody with the right degree of gumption to

    16           moderate it.

    17           Q   And moderators are usually volunteers?

    18           A   In most cases where it's not a news group that's set up

    19           by a particular organization to talk about their product,

    20           they are volunteers, yes.

    21           Q   Okay.  Yesterday there was also -- you were asked about

    22           the creation of new news groups.  I believe you said the Alt

    23           hierarchy was fairly free, people could create things

    24           individually.  But the other hierarchies, could you explain

    25           again who creates that?  Is there one entity or organization

                                                                           135

     1           that approves the creation of a new news group within a --

     2           say, for example, the Biz hierarchy?

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The what?

     4                    MR. MORRIS:  Biz, B-I-Z, as in business.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  One of the hierarchies I mentioned

     6           yesterday.  Somebody within a news group, taking for example

     7           the one that I used yesterday, the REC.AUTO (ph) news group,

     8           the traffic got large on the REC.AUTO news group, and a

     9           number of people proposed to the news group that the news

    10           group be broken up into subcategories for people of different

    11           interests.  A discussion ensued amongst the people who

    12           subscribe to the news group, and a proposal was worked out as

    13           a democratic back and forth process and a suggestion was sent

    14           off to a particular news group which is called NEWS.NEWS

    15           GROUPS or something like that, which is a specific news group

    16           set aside to discuss the creation of new news groups, and a

    17           discussion occurred on there.  Then a call for a vote is

    18           given.  And then whoever is doing the proposing for this news

    19           groups, which is just somebody of interest, somebody who's

    20           interested in it, collects up the E-mail votes that they get,

    21           and posts a list of all of the votes.  It's this many votes

    22           in favor of this proposed news group and this many votes

    23           opposed, over some duration of time.

    24                    If the votes are more than a certain amount, and it

    25           used to be that you had to have 100 votes in favor and no

                                                                           136

     1           more than 25 against, -- I don't know what the numbers are

     2           today, that was what it was three years ago, and I suspect

     3           the numbers are much higher today -- then it's declared that

     4           that news group is a legitimate news group.  And by declared,

     5           it's just the yes, it met -- everybody agrees it met the

     6           requirements so therefore it's legitimate, and whoever put in

     7           the original proposal would then issue the news group

     8           creation command and it would go off and create the propagate

     9           the creation of news group.

    10                    Then the one other thing is that, as I mentioned

    11           yesterday, there are volunteers who maintain lists of

    12           approved, in the sense of this process approved news groups,

    13           within different portions of the hierarchy of the news

    14           hierarchy, like within the Biz hierarchy, and a volunteer

    15           will add it to their list.  Then this list is periodically

    16           sent out and some news servers are configured to delete any

    17           news group in a hierarchy that doesn't appear on the list. 

    18           So it's a democratic ad hoc process.

    19           BY MR. MORRIS:

    20           Q   Okay.  Briefly, could you just explain the process of

    21           registering a domain name with the Internet, at least in the

    22           United States, as I understand it.  Has your domain name been

    23           registered with the Internet?  The NEWDEV.HARVARD.EDU(ph)?

    24           A   No.  The domain name is divided up in different sections,

    25           as was explained this morning about the .EDU and .HARVARD and

                                                                           137

     1           then NEWDEV is my particular machine.  The portion of the

     2           domain name which is registered is the organization's domain

     3           name.  So in this case it's HARVARD.EDU is what gets

     4           registered.  Within HARVARD I have registered NEWDEV, but

     5           this doesn't get registered with the Internet, it is entirely

     6           within HARVARD.  I have a domain name of my own for my little

     7           consulting company and I have registered that.  But the

     8           computers within that I register with myself and I rarely

     9           complain so I get them registered quickly.  (Laughter.)  But

    10           that's only within my own domain.

    11                    The domain in the simple case, it is something like

    12           HARVARD.EDU, it would be a little more complicated if we have

    13           a domain such as the .USTOPLEVEL domain which was also

    14           mentioned this morning, that two-level country codes are one

    15           of the types of top-level domains along with EDU and ORG.  In

    16           the U.S. these are divided geographically. 

    17                    So for example the Web page that I mentioned

    18           yesterday of IETF -- WWW.IETF.ORD is actually on a computer

    19           that's run by a company in Western Virginia, and the

    20           company's name is CNRI, Corporation for National Research

    21           Initiatives.  And their domain name is CNRI.RESTON.VA.US. 

    22           And then there's computers within that.  So it's

    23           IETF.CNRI.RESTON.VA.US.  The CNRI.RESTON.VA.US is what was

    24           registered as the domain name but the machine within it is

    25           not.

                                                                           138

     1           Q   Okay, just one last question.  Judge Buckwalter earlier

     2           asked Dr. Croneberger if he had all the money in the world

     3           and a clear definition of the patently offensive and

     4           indecent, would it be possible to develop a system.  And I'd

     5           be interested if you could tell the Court, is that possible? 

     6           Do you think that's possible?

     7           A   As a theoretical exercise, I think it probably is

     8           possible.  But for me as a speaker to be able to be insured

     9           that this was being met, the only thing I can think of, and I

    10           have thought about this a little bit, is we would have to

    11           have a mechanism by which all of the listeners, in every

    12           category, listeners to news groups, listeners to listserve,

    13           listeners on the Web, all of the listeners, all of the people

    14           retrieving information, would have to be able to provide some

    15           form of identification.

    16                    Now, the identification wouldn't have to be more

    17           than a "Yes, I'm over 18" kind of identification, but in

    18           order to insure that that's reliable, you would have to have

    19           a mechanism by which you could create this identification

    20           such that it couldn't be easily forged.  There is a concept

    21           that is being worked on that is called Digital Signatures,

    22           and the U.S. Post Office as an organization is looking into

    23           doing an identification check at post offices whereby someone

    24           would come in and identify themselves and they would get a

    25           bit pattern, a digital signature, which they could then use

                                                                           139

     1           to identify themselves in commerce and in correspondence,

     2           perhaps even at some point legal correspondence.  One could

     3           in theory add to that identification some flag in there to

     4           indicate whether they were over or under 18.  

     5                    But that would assume the mechanism were actually

     6           installed and in place of going -- of people going to the

     7           post office and getting these identities, and that you would

     8           have to have the identity before you could surf the Web. 

     9           Without that kind of structure, without making the assumption

    10           of something in place so that I could be sure that a

    11           listserve could be created that would only accept

    12           subscriptions from those over 18, and I could query that

    13           listserve to be sure that it was one which was doing that, I

    14           think it would be hard.

    15                    But in theory I could imagine a scenario by which

    16           this could be done, but it wouldn't take quite all the money

    17           in the world, as in the proposition, but I would have fun if

    18           it were a cost plus contract.  (Laughter.)

    19                    MR. MORRIS:  We have no further questions.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Is there recross?

    21                    MR. BARON:  Yes, your Honor.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Baron.

    23                    MR. BARON:  Good afternoon, your Honors.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good afternoon.

    25                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

                                                                           140

     1           BY MR. BARON:

     2           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Bradner.

     3                    Mr. Bradner, I'm going to give you a hypothetical. 

     4           Let's assume you have a simple Worldwide Web Web site on a

     5           Web server with a home page.  And the home page has a URL

     6           associated with it.  And for purposes of this example, we'll

     7           just name it this generic name.  The URL is

     8           HTTP://WWW.WEBSITE.  Are you with me on that?

     9           A   So far it's simple.

    10           Q   Okay.  Now, let's assume that the home page also has

    11           pointers to ten files on that Web site or Web server.  And

    12           each of those files has a separate URL which is an extension

    13           of the home pages URL.

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   And let's just for the purposes of this hypothetical say

    16           that the URL for each of those ten files is

    17           HTTP://WWW.WEBSITE/FILE1 and then iteratively FILE1...

    18           through FILE10.  Still with me?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   Now, you have admitted in your prior testimony that it is

    21           a trivial matter for an owner of a Web site to imbed a tag or

    22           label in HTML source code in the header of that source code

    23           on the home page, correct?

    24           A   On any particular page, whether it be the home page or

    25           not, as long as it's an HTML page that would be easy to

                                                                           141

     1           augment it, yes.

     2           Q   And as a technical matter, it would also be possible to

     3           imbed a unique tag or label in HTML source code for each of

     4           the files 1 through 10 with those separate URL extensions in

     5           my hypothetical, correct?

     6           A   I'm a little confused here, because to me you may be

     7           mixing two things.  One is the files themselves, and I just

     8           said that any file you could put -- any HTML file you could

     9           put such a tag in.  And the URLs which are different things. 

    10           You could put tags in the URLs also.

    11           Q   I'm not speaking about the tags in the URL, but the tags

    12           in the files.  So each of those files with a separate URL

    13           address would have HTML source code associated with that file

    14           and a tag could be put in for file 1, file 2, iteratively,

    15           file 10.

    16           A   If indeed they were HTML files, yes.

    17           Q   And the operation of that tag on any one of those files

    18           on that site would, assuming that it's a tag that's set up to

    19           be coordinated with parental blocking mechanisms, would

    20           operate to block that URL extension, that particular file on

    21           that Web site, that unique file, 1 through 10.

    22           A   Assuming that it was A, as you speculate, set up to do

    23           so, and B, that the user was using a browser so configured to

    24           do that blocking, yes, all files are equivalent in that

    25           context.

                                                                           142

     1           Q   And any browser set up to look at the URL for a

     2           particular file 6 or file 8 or file 10 would be blocked if

     3           there was that mechanism for tagging and the browser was set

     4           to look?

     5           A   Well, to be very specific, just to not be confusing here,

     6           what would happen is in your scenario that the browser would

     7           go off and it would retrieve the file, file 1, file 2,

     8           whatever, it would retrieve that file.  It would actually go

     9           off and start to retrieve the file, perhaps even retrieving

    10           the whole file, then look at the HTML if it's an HTML file,

    11           then make the decision.  So the fact that it has a URL is

    12           independent.  It just happens that all files that are on Web

    13           servers have either real or implied or constructed URLs

    14           simply because as I just said, the URL is really just a way

    15           to identify a file.  So we want to make sure that we're

    16           talking about two different cases, because yesterday we were

    17           talking about putting tags in URLs and we're talking about

    18           putting tags in the files, and I want to be sure that we've

    19           got those separated because they're different concepts.

    20           Q   Okay.  And in paragraph 30 -- sorry, paragraph 79 of your

    21           supplemental declaration at page 33, you mention the concept

    22           executable programs.  Could you explain with some concrete

    23           examples what executable programs are?

    24           A   The example I used yesterday was a screen saver, which

    25           would draw pretty pictures on your screen instead of burning

                                                                           143

     1           your logo into the screen when the screen's been idle for a

     2           while.  Many of those exist on the net, and you can retrieve

     3           them anonymously FTP or over the Web for free.  They are

     4           there because the screen saver will come up and advertise

     5           some product or it's just because somebody thought that the

     6           picture they did was cute, or the function they did was cute. 

     7           It was an intellectual exercise or a class exercise.  So many

     8           of these are out.  Hundreds of these screen savers exist and

     9           you can go retrieve them, but they are binary files.

    10           Q   Do they usually have a .EXE suffix?

    11           A   The .EXE is for a particular kind of binary file that's

    12           used on PCs.  There are other extensions for other kinds of

    13           computers, for other types of binaries.

    14           Q   Now, to the best of your knowledge, are any of the home

    15           pages of any of the plaintiffs in this lawsuit, do they

    16           comprise executable programs or files?

    17           A   Since I don't know the list of the plaintiffs by heart or

    18           even by remembering having read it, the full list, it seems

    19           to be quite an extensive list, I couldn't answer, but it

    20           would seem to be unlikely that a home page would be a binary

    21           per se, though possible, because it could be a graphical

    22           image, but it wouldn't seem to be very likely.

    23           Q   If one had an executable program in a file, is there

    24           anything about that mere fact that it's an executable program

    25           that would prevent the owner of the Web site from registering

                                                                           144

     1           or otherwise making known the page where the executable

     2           program was to the many tens or hundreds or thousands of

     3           directories in cyberspace or to any of the companies that

     4           operate browsers or parental control mechanisms.  Is there

     5           something special about executable programs?

     6           A   An executable program when viewed by the Web is just

     7           another page.  It happens that when the browser goes to try

     8           and retrieve it, it uses a different retrieval mechanism than

     9           it does when it's trying to retrieve text or HTML.  But it's

    10           just another page, and one can -- and that page has a unique

    11           URL, and yes, one could register in theory any URL pointing

    12           to any file that was on any server, and there is nothing

    13           special in that context about a binary, no.

    14                    MR. BARON:  I have no further questions.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any more from the plaintiffs?

    16                    MR. MORRIS:  No, your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Judge Dalzell.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.  I wonder in paragraphs 73

    19           through 76 you talk a good deal about cashing, and I must say

    20           I really don't follow it.  Would you just, using the standard

    21           that Chief Judge Sloviter put so well, could you just

    22           rehearse for us exactly what you mean by cashing?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  That standard was that it should be

    24           understandable?

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You'll forgive the expression, yes.

                                                                           145

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Well, let's take the example I think I

     3           used.  But the basic idea is you would like to minimize the

     4           number of times that you go off and you retrieve something,

     5           that you actually have to go to the actual server to retrieve

     6           something.  Cashing is not a new concept.  It's used in

     7           computers between the processor and disk so that if you want

     8           to reload the same file off of disk between the processor and

     9           memory if you want to reread some portion of memory into the

    10           processor, instead of going to the relatively slow memory or

    11           the relatively slow disk, it goes and gets it out of the

    12           cash.

    13                    In the case of cashing Web servers, which is what I

    14           was speaking of in there, the same concept applies.  Many

    15           universities, many organizations have as a function built

    16           into their firewall or built into a device sitting between

    17           their network and the rest of the Internet, they have an

    18           ability to watch the HTML requests go by and see what comes

    19           back and save a temporary copy of what comes back.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How temporary?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  That's usually locally configurable

    22           and it's frequently done based on how much disk space you

    23           have.  Once you start getting low on disk space, you throw

    24           away the things which haven't been accessed for the longest

    25           period of time.  And --

                                                                           146

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you give in paragraph 73 the

     2           hypothetical of cashing when a user in Europe requests access

     3           to a Worldwide Web page located in the United States?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     5                    MR. MORRIS:  Your Honor, could I --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, sure, sure.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, do I understand correctly that

     9           the first time that the European user accesses the American

    10           information page, it is put somewhere in cyberspace on the

    11           east side of the Atlantic?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  In this particular hypothetical, to

    13           use a word that was just being used at me, what would happen

    14           is that the people who operated the transatlantic link, and

    15           it happens that in the real world of data networking the

    16           Europeans have to pay for their links into the U.S.  The U.S.

    17           doesn't pay for the links because everybody thinks we're more

    18           important and so far the Europeans have agreed with that.  I

    19           think that may change in time, but they want to minimize the

    20           utilization of that link.  They don't want to have it

    21           retrieve the same file again and again and again from some

    22           U.S. site.  So they would put on their end of the link a

    23           cashing Web server.  So that when a request came in from

    24           Europe, if it wasn't in the cash it would go do the request

    25           across the Atlantic, across the relatively small and very

                                                                           147

     1           expensive link, retrieve that file and then store it in the

     2           cashing Web server and pass a copy onto the requester.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But storing it in the Web server in

     4           your hypothetical in Europe?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now let's reverse the hypothetical

     7           because we're told a significant percentage of the sexually

     8           explicit material comes from abroad.  I mean I know you're

     9           not an expert on that, but that's what we're told.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know from personal experience,

    11           no.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right, but that's what we're told. 

    13           Let's assume that's true, okay.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So the American server, the American

    16           user types in "sexy European girls," okay.  Now, that goes to

    17           Europe, pulls it back and it's held for a time in somewhere

    18           on this side at the west side of the Atlantic so that it

    19           could be accessed again for some finite period of time?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  The European, in this case because the

    21           transatlantic link as operated -- as paid for by a European

    22           company, if the European company put such a server on this

    23           side in order to preserve the band width coming the other

    24           direction, which they could easily do, then yes, it would be

    25           stored for a time on this side and it would be identified by

                                                                           148

     1           the URL, that's basically -- URL being index into it.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Same hypothetical except the

     3           provider of the sexually explicit material is in Thailand. 

     4           Any difference in your answer?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  It's probably more likely to have a

     6           Web cashing server there because the transpacific links are

     7           very, very expensive, million dollars a month for a good-

     8           sized link from the U.S. to Japan, for example.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And who is paying for that link?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  The Japanese Internet service

    11           providers.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Collectively.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  There are a number of different links. 

    14           I was quoted the million dollars a month quote by somebody

    15           involved in the Asian-Pacific Network Information Center a

    16           couple of months ago, and I'm not sure if that was from a

    17           particular Internet provider in Japan, or whether that was

    18           some conglomeration.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Judge Sloviter wants to ask about

    20           cashing.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, given now that you have

    22           explained cashing in terms that maybe we can understand,

    23           thanks to Judge Dalzell and to your willingness to do so,

    24           what happens, what is the effect?  Now that we know the

    25           concept, what is its relevance to the issues before us in

                                                                           149

     1           this case?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  The primary relevance, the reason that

     3           I brought it up in the statement is that once this is cashed,

     4           you know when someone asks to see it, the original server

     5           does not see the request.  The original server's request --

     6           the user's request is fulfilled by the cashing server and

     7           that request is not passed on to the originating server, so

     8           the originating server has no way of knowing who or how many

     9           or anything else.  We were talking about hits earlier.  The

    10           originating server would have no way of knowing how many

    11           times this file was retrieved because it wouldn't get the

    12           hits.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the file would be identified

    14           though as coming from the original server?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  It would -- remember that in the -- we

    16           were talking -- I missed yesterday afternoon, but I was told

    17           about your adventures in cyberspace --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And never get it back.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Everything is just a URL.  There is

    20           nothing particularly in that URL that tells you really where

    21           it came from.  There's some names in it which if given some

    22           work we could figure out where some particular site exists,

    23           but we don't know where SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS.COM might be, the

    24           server might be.  That actually might be in the U.S., it

    25           might be in Europe, could be anywhere.  There's just the URL,

                                                                           150

     1           which is, as I explained a minute ago, it's the application

     2           followed by a site name followed by a file name.  What is

     3           saved in the server, in the cashing server, is the URL and

     4           the file associated with it.  So that's all that's there.  We

     5           don't have any way of tying anything else together than that.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So you don't -- you can't identify

     7           either the pointer or the pointee, is that the point?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  It's not so much that, it's that if

     9           somebody in Europe were retrieving a data file from my

    10           server, let's say one of my newspaper columns, and they

    11           retrieved that, I would see a retrieval from the local end of

    12           the -- the cashing server in Europe or in the U.S., however

    13           it was done, I would see one retrieval from that.  There

    14           could be many other people who might want to read it --

    15           that's not borne out by what my editor says -- but there

    16           might be other people.  I would never know whether anybody

    17           else read it, retrieved it within the time period of how long

    18           the cashing server kept it.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And would the cashing server know

    20           how many people retrieved it?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  As long as it in turn wasn't behind

    22           another cashing server.  Because organizations put cashing

    23           servers on their boundaries to minimize the link, the

    24           utilization of their link to the rest of the Internet because

    25           those links are expensive, and if they're keeping, retrieving

                                                                           151

     1           the same files, they're making use of the link that they

     2           wouldn't otherwise need to.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You see, this is why I think this

     4           may be important to our consideration.  Whoever it is who

     5           created the Web page, let's say SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS, let's

     6           hypothesize in Luxembourg, does not think or may not be

     7           thinking about complying with Title V of the

     8           Telecommunications Act of 1996, but the cash server in the

     9           United States, as I understand your testimony, effectually

    10           domesticates that Luxembourg Web page, does it not?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  If indeed there is such a server

    12           there, but again, it could be a server there, it could be a

    13           server that's on the boundary of a corporation or a school. 

    14           There could be many servers up and down the line.  Each one

    15           of those, if they're within the U.S. could yes, be

    16           domesticating it.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could Mr. Coppolino and his troops

    18           find that domestic cash server to prosecute them?  And if so,

    19           how would they do it?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  You can -- actually there's nothing in

    21           the information that you retrieve when you -- when somebody

    22           goes to retrieve it, there's nothing to indicate where that

    23           came from.  So if indeed for example the servers have been

    24           tweaked so that they didn't save copies of files from

    25           SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS.COM, then you wouldn't as someone reading

                                                                           152

     1           from this side of the Atlantic, you wouldn't be able to tell

     2           that it was or was not cashed anywhere along the line.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And there would be no way for me to

     4           know that and therefore no way for Mr. Coppolino and his

     5           troops to know that?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  But nonetheless I would see

     8           an untagged SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS; correct?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  You could see that.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Even if all domestic information

    11           providers agreed, yes, let's tag all our URLs, the folks in

    12           Luxembourg don't give a darn what our law says, but

    13           nonetheless their information may come to my son, who's ten.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  The other worry that I have in that

    17           actually is a little bit perhaps even the other way.  From

    18           what I understand, we went through this process of the CD

    19           providers agreeing to tag rap songs with parental guidance. 

    20           And the experience was that those CD's so tagged sold better

    21           than the ones that were not.  (Laughter.)  I would have some

    22           worry that people would actually, SEXYEUROPEANGIRLS.COM would

    23           actually be quite happy to put tags on and then make sure

    24           that there were browsers readily available that would seek

    25           out sites that had such tags.

                                                                           153

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, that's very helpful.  A couple

     2           technical questions.  FTP and gopher.  Are they forms of

     3           search engines?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  No, they're just file retrieval

     5           devices.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do they differ from a search

     7           engine like Alta Vista (ph)?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Alta Vista builds up a database which

     9           when you send a query to it, it looks into its local database

    10           to see whether it has entries that match that query, and

    11           return to you the pointers, URLs, that correspond to those

    12           matches.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As I understand, FTP and gopher or

    14           Alta Vista, if I type in Scott Bradner, they're all going to

    15           go looking for anything mentioning you, won't they?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  FTP -- no, FTP is an interactive

    17           program with which you can tell it to retrieve a particular

    18           file.  So if I gave you the name of a file on my machine,

    19           there is a process by which you could interactively go

    20           through and retrieve that one file.  It is not the kind of

    21           thing -- FTP is not the kind of thing, nor is gopher the kind

    22           of thing which by itself you can say, go find every file

    23           which has Scott Bradner in it.  All it does is say, here is a

    24           file name.  Here is a URL.  Here is the extended URL.  In the

    25           case of FTP, you actually give it the machine name separately

                                                                           154

     1           and the file name separately, and you have to do all kinds of

     2           --

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But in Alta Vista I could just

     4           search Scott Bradner?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  It has been done.  (Laughter.)

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm sure of that, maybe by people in

     7           this room.  (Laughter.)

     8                    Lastly, you talk in paragraphs 70 and 71 of your

     9           declaration about common gateway interface or script, a CGI

    10           script?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that you say is an option that

    13           is at least possible on the Worldwide Web where the -- if you

    14           had the resources you could screen out users?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  It's basically -- and we were talking

    16           this morning, we were talking about forms type interface

    17           where you have little boxes to fill in, one of the things

    18           that can happen when you fill in those little boxes is you

    19           can fire up, you can start up a program and CGI is one of the

    20           ways you can start up a program, which takes as its input

    21           information in the boxes.

    22                    So for example it could take as input somebody's

    23           credit card number.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  And then if mechanisms existed to

                                                                           155

     1           verify that credit card number purely electronically or over

     2           the Net, it could go ahead and do that in theory.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, that's very good.  Thank you

     4           very much.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I'll ask a question while you're

     6           thinking.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, you go ahead.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When you used the term "trivial"

     9           yesterday a number of times, and I'd have to go back and

    10           retrieve and I don't have it all here and we don't have daily

    11           transcripts so I don't know, do you mean by trivial, trivial

    12           to somebody with your expertise, or technologically trivial,

    13           or do you mean trivial because it doesn't take a lot of money

    14           or because it doesn't -- I didn't quite understand what you

    15           meant, and you used it at different times, so you may have

    16           used it differently.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I believe most of the time that I used

    18           it it was in response to a direct question from Mr. Baron who

    19           used it in -- when we spoke last week.  But be that as it

    20           may, I did use it and by that I really meant that it was

    21           really easy to do, given -- I think in the deposition what I

    22           said was -- or in the discussion we had last week, I said

    23           something along the line of given a sample home page with a

    24           fill in the blank of how you would designate naughty stuff

    25           below, anybody could take that sample and modify it for their

                                                                           156

     1           own environment just trivially, because all it is is an

     2           editing task.  It's just like editing a letter to one's

     3           mother.  It's just characters.  And as long as you have a

     4           model to follow and a set of instructions to follow, it's

     5           easy to do.

     6                    So I think in most of the contexts that I was

     7           referring to yesterday, in that it's easy to do, not

     8           necessarily for somebody with a great deal of expertise but

     9           given the right environment, it would be easy for anybody to

    10           do.  It would be difficult for me to do it today because I

    11           don't happen to be an HTML expert.  I went out -- after our

    12           discussion the other day I went out and bought a book because

    13           he asked me some embarrassing questions I should have known

    14           the answer to.  But it would take me some time and it would

    15           be untrivial, both in terms of time and at my normal billing

    16           rate expense for me to set up a home page to do this.  But if

    17           I were given a sample home page with, if you fill in your

    18           name here, everything will be fine, it would be truly trivial

    19           to do.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I was thinking of carrying Judge

    22           Sloviter's example being simple maybe to the ridiculous, I

    23           hope not, but maybe my analogy would help me, when I was a

    24           young man I wanted to be a user of the local bar when I was

    25           in college.  But the provider (laughter) was by law forbidden

                                                                           157

     1           to serve me if I were under the age of, I think it was 21

     2           back then.  Do I understand that it's somewhat analogous that

     3           if the provider puts up a sign there that says no one under

     4           21 allowed to drink that that's a tag?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  That would be -- that would be an

     6           equivalent to a tag, yes.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That would be equivalent to a

     8           tag.  And do I further understand that if that sign were in

     9           Japanese, I wouldn't be configured to understand that tag or

    10           -- is that what we mean by being configured?  Make the

    11           assumption that I don't understand Japanese language, but --

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think that's a common

    13           assumption in this room.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yes.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Certainly an assumption that falls

    16           with me.  Actually what I think I was referring to was a

    17           little bit different than that --

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  -- in that it was more along the line

    20           of yes, I guess, am I configured to be able to read and

    21           understand that sign.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Me, the user, I'm not configured,

    23           so on --

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah, can you read the sign.

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- that point, that tab would be

                                                                           158

     1           no good to me.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right now, I'm configured to

     4           understand English so the tab would be good.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  That's what standards are useful

     6           for.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  However, it wouldn't be

     8           sufficient to guarantee that I wouldn't get in the bar and

     9           get a drink, right?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  In the context of the law, I think

    11           what we're to extend this simile to probably ridiculous

    12           levels, it would appear to me that the provider of liquor to

    13           that bar has to insure that the bar doesn't serve underage

    14           people.  And that's the paradigm.  It would seem to follow

    15           from the law that it's the provider of the materials that has

    16           to insure, --

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Right.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  And the liquor provider of the bar

    19           can't be sure that they're checking IDs at the door and --

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  He can have a gateway though

    21           which is the bouncer at the door who checks the ID or the

    22           password of the --

    23                    THE WITNESS:  But would the liquor provider have to

    24           have that bouncer, or would the bar's owner have to --

    25                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, under the example I'm

                                                                           159

     1           giving and the way it worked back then, the liquor provider

     2           had to have the bouncer.  And isn't that what we're talking

     3           about here under this law, that the Government is saying the

     4           provider has to have the bouncer?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  The liquor, the Jim Beam has to have

     6           the bouncer, not the bar has to have the bouncer, and that's

     7           the difference -- that's my extension of your scenario to

     8           this law.

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  Now, extending my scenario

    10           further, are you saying that that's very difficult to --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  It's very difficult for Jim Beam to

    12           know that the bouncer is there and to know the bouncer is

    13           following the rules set which will result in underage people

    14           not being allowed into the bar.

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  I don't want to go any

    16           further with this, because it takes up too much time and

    17           might not be particularly helpful, but thank you.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have one more basic question for

    19           him.  While you were willing to do some explaining, and if

    20           we've done this twice, let me know, but I was trying to

    21           understand the use of the password system rather than the

    22           anonymous system.  We haven't gone over that today, have we?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  No, we haven't.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  In different language -- which you

    25           talked about in your declaration.

                                                                           160

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I think you say that use of the

     3           password system rather than the anonymous system

     4           automatically would give the user access to the entire

     5           system.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  I do say that, yes.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  And if you would just quickly

     8           explain that, if possible, and then tell us why couldn't the

     9           access be restricted also?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  What I was explaining there was the

    11           existing software.  Certainly software can be changed to do

    12           anything that you want it to do, given sufficient money and

    13           motivation.  But the existing software for FTP which is what

    14           I was specifically referring to, anonymous FTP when you log

    15           in as anonymous, which is if you wanted to retrieve a file

    16           from my system and I gave you the name of the file, you could

    17           just go in using FTP, log in as anonymous, and then go to the

    18           directory the file is in and retrieve it.

    19                    But when you do that, the FTP server, the demon, the

    20           server itself automatically restricts you to a subset of the

    21           information that's available on my machine.  It's a

    22           subportion of the directory tree.  So you can only see that,

    23           and you cannot change directory out of that.  There's just --

    24           the software prevents you from doing that.  It's called

    25           rehoming.  It gives you a new home that's very, very

                                                                           161

     1           restricted.

     2                    In the currently available software, the FTP demons,

     3           that if you go and you log in as a regular user, which is

     4           what you do when you're logging in with a user name and a

     5           password, a legitimate one, my own user name and my own

     6           password, for example, if I were to do that, then it gives me

     7           access to the machine as if I had logged into the machine as

     8           a terminal.  It gives me the same view of the machine.  And

     9           that view of the machine is all of the files on the machine

    10           with whatever protections those files have for every user. 

    11           So that if a file is publicly readable for all users, then it

    12           would be publicly readable for the FTP who was coming in on a

    13           log name and password basis.  If it's not publicly readable,

    14           then it wouldn't be.

    15                    What I was referring there was that it lays open for

    16           potential abuse the entire structure of the server site.  In

    17           my case --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Of the server.  What was --

    19                    THE WITNESS:  The server computer, the server site.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you concluded from that in

    21           terms relevant to this case, because I'm not sure which side

    22           that goes for, but what do you conclude from this?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  There were two messages I was trying

    24           to convey there.  One was that it would be an administrative

    25           burden for me to maintain a log name and password file for

                                                                           162

     1           all of the very many people, individual users, who would want

     2           to come and look at and retrieve information from my site. 

     3           So it's just purely an administrative nightmare to do that. 

     4           And the other is that it would pose to me a security risk to

     5           make all of these files open, because I know that in my

     6           machine as in almost all machines I have not been perfect in

     7           setting the machine up, and I may have made some errors, and

     8           some files which should have been protected are not

     9           protected, or there is bugs in some of the software.  And

    10           people could use the visibility they have into my machine to

    11           circumvent the security on it.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And you're not saying that software

    13           couldn't be created that would do that, would take care of

    14           this problem, --

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely not saying that.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- but it just hasn't been right

    17           now.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  It is not -- the current software does

    19           not do this.  Future software wouldn't change the

    20           administrative burden tremendously, but --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, unless future it may do that,

    22           too.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  The future is unseeable.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.

    25                    Mr. Baron?

                                                                           163

     1           BY MR. BARON:  

     2           Q   I have just a couple questions.  The record may be clear

     3           on this point, Mr. Bradner, but we were talking about the

     4           trivialness or the ease by which a tag can be put in HTML

     5           source code.  And do I understand it from your testimony that

     6           those individuals who know HTML source code who would be

     7           designing Web pages, for that class of individuals it would

     8           be an easy, straightforward trivial task to imbed a tag in a

     9           header?

    10           A   Actually I was going further than that and saying that if

    11           you gave me a sample of what it's supposed to look like, even

    12           if I don't know HTML, it would still be trivial.

    13           Q   Okay.  And this is a very important point that your

    14           Honors have raised about conventions and standards for

    15           looking at tags and headers.  And so my question is that you

    16           recall your testimony yesterday about Netscaping

    17           approximately 80 percent of the browser market, correct?

    18           A   As I recall my testimony yesterday was that Netscape

    19           claimed to be 80 percent of the market.

    20           Q   I stand corrected.  If -- and we spent a lot of time

    21           yesterday at the beginning of your testimony talking about

    22           the IETF and the fact that the Internet is a standards-rich

    23           environment, do you recall that?

    24           A   That's a standards development group rich environment.

    25           Q   Okay, all right.  (Laughter.)

                                                                           164

     1           A   Which is slightly different.

     2           Q   There are lots and lots of standards.

     3           A   Yes, some of them conflicting.

     4           Q   And draft standards, proposed standards, we covered all

     5           that.

     6           A   Consortium standards, the end of the month club. 

     7           (Laughter.)

     8           Q   Now, if a Government agency or alternatively if in a

     9           consortium of private parties got together and adopted a

    10           convention or a standard for tagging in HTML code, that would

    11           essentially operate, like the movie rating system, be an

    12           adult tag, that is a technical matter, the browser market as

    13           just is a matter of technical feasibility the browser market

    14           represented by Netscape and Microsoft and others, could

    15           certainly pick up that tag that would be adopted as a

    16           standard or a convention, isn't that correct?

    17           A   Yes, and they could even program the browsers to accept

    18           more than one standard for the same sort of information.

    19                    MR. BARON:  I have no further questions.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Any further questions?

    21                    MR. MORRIS:  No, your Honor.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But I want to follow up on that. 

    24           You said and Dr. Hoffman said that the Worldwide Web was not

    25           created here, it came out of Czern (ph), right?

                                                                           165

     1                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And so what Mr. Baron just asked you

     3           about hypothesizes that there is a plenary group that sets

     4           standards and by setting standards, doesn't that then exclude

     5           the possibility of new technologies such as the Worldwide Web

     6           which arose spontaneously, not even in these shores?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  That is a very insightful question. 

     8           (Laughter.)  That happens to be one of the subjects of the

     9           meeting I was at yesterday and couldn't be here on.  

    10                    The tension between standards bodies is a very

    11           serious issue.  I made light of it just a second ago, but it

    12           is a very serious issue and there are many places in the

    13           globe where the development of standards and the control of

    14           the standards development process is seen as a strategic

    15           necessity on the part of some governments.  And so the

    16           defining of what standards to use, how to develop them and

    17           what -- the level the mandating of those standards is seen as

    18           strategic.

    19                    And it is absolutely true that a too-strong

    20           environment saying all standards must come from standards

    21           group number two has a serious impact on innovation.  The Web

    22           rose out of a hole.  The whole concept of the Web rose out of

    23           a need that we didn't know we had.  We didn't know we had

    24           this lack of ability to do easy browsing because we didn't

    25           have the concept of easy browsing.  This was something that

                                                                           166

     1           sprung out of innovations on some parts of some individuals. 

     2           It was not part of a standards effort.  It was people doing

     3           something.  It caught on because people wanted the -- saw it

     4           as useful.

     5                    There are other holes in the Net.  We don't know

     6           what they are.  There are other needs that we don't know we

     7           have.  And certainly being too reliant on "we only do those

     8           things which are standard" will stifle that innovation and it

     9           would be very bad for us.  We went through many years of

    10           telecom where we did not have, let's say, rapid innovation

    11           because of that kind of centralized standards development

    12           constraint.

    13                    So in the context though of what Mr. Baron was

    14           asking, if a consortium were to develop a tagging structure,

    15           it wouldn't have to be the same consortium that would develop

    16           future extensions on HTML.  I met with somebody on Tuesday

    17           where the IETF is going to actually have a document which is

    18           the extensions on HTML and this is being put together with

    19           the W3 consortium.  It's a nice conglomerate effort.

    20                    But a group putting together a standard for labeling

    21           within HTML or within URLs or within copies of any text that

    22           happens to be around wouldn't necessarily have to cooperate

    23           with any other standards body in doing so.  It could just

    24           create it.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And indeed, isn't the whole point

                                                                           167

     1           that the very exponential growth and utility of the Internet

     2           occurred precisely because governments kept their hands out

     3           of this and didn't set standards that everybody had to

     4           follow?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's actually even a little bit

     6           more contorted than that because the governments tried to. 

     7           The U.S. Government and many other governments attempted to

     8           mandate a particular kind of protocol to be used on worldwide

     9           data networks, and this is the OSI protocol suite.  The U.S.

    10           Government mandated its use within the U.S. Government and

    11           with purchasing material with U.S. funds.  This was mandated

    12           in many European countries and in Canada and many other

    13           places around the world.

    14                    That particular suite of protocols has failed to

    15           achieve market success.  What achieved success was the very

    16           chaos that the Internet is.  The strength of the Internet is

    17           that chaos.  It's the ability to have the forum to innovate. 

    18           And certainly a strong standards environment fights hard

    19           against innovation.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    22                    I'm sure counsel would like to continue the

    23           dialogue, but are you content to let it be at the moment?

    24                    MR. MORRIS:  We are, your Honor.

    25                    MR. BARON:  Yes, your Honor.

                                                                           168

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess you are.  I'm not

     2           (laughter)...

     3                    We'll close now to resume on the 1st of April --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  On the 1st at 9:30.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Although counsel is I gather going

     6           to meet with Judge Dalzell.  Do they know that --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could we do that at 3:00 o'clock in

     8           the robing room, if that's convenient?

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay?  All right.  Thank you all

    10           very much, and have a good week until then.

    11                    THE CLERK:  All rise.

    12                    (Proceedings concluded at 2:40 o'clock p.m.)

     3                    CLERK OF COURT KUNZ:  Oyez, oyez, oyez, all manner

     4           of persons having any matter to present before the Honorable

     7           Buckwalter and the Honorable Stewart Dalzell, Judges of the

     8           United States District Court for the Eastern District of

     9           Pennsylvania may at present appear and they shall be heard. 

    10           God save the United States and this Honorable Court.  Court

    11           is now in session, please be seated.

    12                    COUNSEL:  Good morning, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good morning.  This is the hearing

    14           before the statutory Three-Judge Court on the request for a

    15           preliminary injunction in the consolidated action of American

    16           Civil Liberties Union and its co-plaintiffs versus Reno, No.

    17           96-963, and American Library Association and its co-

    18           plaintiffs versus Department of Justice, No. 96-1458.

    19                    Judge Buckwalter and I want to thank Judge Dalzell

    20           for his case management of all preliminary matters and all

    21           three Judges want to thank the parties for their concerted

    22           efforts to expedite the proceedings by entering into

    23           stipulations and we want to thank the plaintiffs for

    24           presenting their testimony in chief by affidavits which are

    25           available for public and press view.


                                                                             4

     1                    We -- now, there have been various requests for

     2           photographing the proceedings and I thought it might be, we

     3           thought it might be appropriate to make a statement at the

     4           inception.

     5                    In September 1994 the Judicial Conference of the

     6           United States voted not to permit the taking of photographs

     7           and radio and television coverage of proceedings in the

     8           United States District Courts, whether those proceedings are

     9           civil or criminal.

    10                    When the Judicial Conference voted last week to

    11           permit each Court of Appeals to decide whether and under what

    12           circumstances to permit the taking of photographs and radio

    13           and television arguments of appellate arguments it reiterated

    14           its prior policy with respect to the District Courts.

    15                    This proceeding is a three-judge District Court

    16           proceeding.  I am a member of the Judicial Conference of the

    17           United States and Chief Judge Cahn of the Eastern District of

    18           Pennsylvania is a member of the Judicial Conference.

    19                    Whatever the views of individual members of the

    20           Eastern District on the issue of cameras in the Federal

    21           courtroom or the collective views on that issue of that

    22           District Court which was one of the pilot courts during the

    23           project and whatever the personal views of the Judges on this

    24           panel on that issue, we will abide by the vote of the

    25           Judicial Conference of the United States, whether binding or


                                                                             5

     1           hortatory.

     2                    We are privileged to be part of the great

     3           institution that is the Federal Judiciary of the United

     4           States.

     5                    Okay, we will proceed with cross-examination of the

     6           plaintiff's witness by the Government and we ask the

     7           Government at the inception is there any -- we understand

     8           that the first witness is -- and we'll ask the Government,

     9           whom are you calling?  The Government.

    10                    (Laughter.)

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court of Appeals, go ahead.

    12                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry, your Honor, your

    13           question?

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your first witness?

    15                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Would be Scott Bradner, I believe,

    16           your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And do you accept Mr.

    18           Bradner as an expert?

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes, we do, your Honor.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, thank you.  Then proceed.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:   Oh, yes, Mr. Coppolino, just one

    22           housekeeping, important housekeeping matter.  We were most

    23           grateful to the parties for the extensive stipulations that

    24           were submitted that will probably save us a week of testimony

    25           but there was -- and I don't criticize you for this -- there


                                                                             6

     1           was a qualification at the beginning of the stipulating

     2           having to do with the fact that discovery of the plaintiff's

     3           case was not concluded and therefore it says that no party

     4           waives its right to submit information inconsistent with its

     5           terms should it learn thereof through discovery, disclosure

     6           or other investigation.

     7                    Now, I take it that by April 1st, that is to say

     8           when the plaintiffs complete their case, that the Government

     9           will be in a position to tell us yea or nay whether it indeed

    10           accepts every paragraph of those stipulations.

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I believe I can

    12           represent that the purpose of the stipulation on the part of

    13           both parties was to indicate that it was applicable to the

    14           entire PI hearing.  And I believe that the specific purpose

    15           being addressed here is that as the case proceeds beyond the

    16           PI stage of the merits and discovery is taken at that time

    17           which indicates that some of the statements in here are

    18           incorrect or inaccurate upon further testing that at that

    19           point these particular stipulations would not apply.

    20                    That's my understanding.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So therefore you can

    22           represent to us now that for purposes of this preliminary

    23           injunction hearing that we may take the stipulation without

    24           qualification.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes.

                                                                             7

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine, that's very helpful. 

     2           Thank you.

     3                    Okay, do you want to -- it's Mr. Bradner, is it?

     4                    MR. MORRIS:  Yes, your Honor, my name is John

     5           Morris, co-counsel for the ALA plaintiffs and plaintiffs call

     6           as their first witness Scott O. Bradner.

                                                                             7

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine, that's very helpful. 

     2           Thank you.

     3                    Okay, do you want to -- it's Mr. Bradner, is it?

     4                    MR. MORRIS:  Yes, your Honor, my name is John

     5           Morris, co-counsel for the ALA plaintiffs and plaintiffs call

     6           as their first witness Scott O. Bradner.

     7                    MR. KMETZ:  Your Honor, Mr. Jason Baron will be

     8           handling the cross-examination.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And it's our understanding that

    10           there will be only one lawyer per witness.

    11                    MR. KMETZ:  That would be our understanding as well.

    12                    MR. MORRIS:  That's certainly our understanding.  If

    13           the Court would indulge at the conclusion of any redirect we

    14           might have, I will confer just momentarily among ourselves to

    15           make sure that we're all on the same page.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We don't mind your conferring as

    17           long as you don't mind our conferring --

    18                    (Laughter.)

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- because a three-judge court is

    20           something new for all of us, three-judge District Court.

    21                    THE COURT CLERK:  Sir, will you state and spell your

    22           full name for the record?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Scott Bradner, S-c-o-t-t 

    24           B-r-a-d-n-e-r.

    25                    THE COURT CLERK:  Will you place your left hand on

                                                                             8

     1           the Bible and raise your right hand?

     2                    SCOTT BRADNER, Plaintiffs' Witness, Affirmed.

     3                    MR. MORRIS:  And at this point the plaintiffs would

     4           move into admission the evidence of the previously filed

     5           declaration of Mr. Bradner as sworn to on the 19th of this

     6           month as his trial testimony.

     7                    And Mr. Bradner is available for examination by the

     8           Government and certainly any questions the Court may have,

     9           I'm sure he'd be happy to respond to.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Is there any objection

    11           to-- 

    12                    MR. BARON:  No objection, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- accepting that as evidence,

    14           fine.  Proceed.

    15                    MR. BARON:  Good morning, your Honors.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Good morning.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good morning.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Good morning.

    19                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   Good morning, Mr. Bradner.  You state in your decla--

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me.  In the Court of Appeals

    23           we always identify ourselves, we ask the counsel to identify

    24           themselves for the record.  Maybe that would be a good idea.

    25                    MR. BARON:  My apologies, your Honor.

                                                                             9

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's all right.

     2                    MR. BARON:  I'm Jason R. Baron, B-a-r-o-n, counsel

     3           to the U.S. Department of Justice.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

     5                    MR. BARON:  Thank you, your Honor.

     6           BY MR. BARON:  

     7           Q   Mr. Bradner, you state in your declaration that you are

     8           co-area director of something called the IETF.  Could you, in

     9           a nutshell, tell us what the IETF is and what does it do?

    10           A   The Internet Engineering Task Force is a self-organizing

    11           group which developed out of some U.S. Federal Government

    12           networking initiatives many years ago and it is the group

    13           which now is primarily responsible for developing standards

    14           for use in the Internet protocol which is the basis upon

    15           which the Internet runs.

    16           Q   The IETF has been in existence for about ten years,

    17           correct?

    18           A   That is correct.  I'd be clear that it predates my

    19           involvement so I'm taking that from what others have said.

    20           Q   Okay.  Would it be fair to say that the IETF defines

    21           standards for the Internet Protocol suite?

    22           A   That is -- yes, it would be fair to say that.

    23           Q   Could you explain for the Court what is the Internet

    24           Protocol, otherwise known as IP?

    25           A   The Internet itself consists of many networks connected

                                                                            10

     1           together by other networks.  The Internet Protocol is that

     2           part of the protocol suite, that part of the language which

     3           is used on the network which allows a piece of information

     4           called a packet on one network to find its way to identify a

     5           separate network and find its way to that separate network. 

     6           So the IP is the Internet Protocol that allows movement of

     7           data between networks.

     8           Q   Different protocols make up IP suite, correct?

     9           A   That is correct.

    10           Q   Can you name a few for the Court?

    11           A   Well, the underlying protocol is the Internet Protocol or

    12           IP.  Riding on top of that are protocols such as TCP, the

    13           Transmission Control Protocol, UDP, the Unreliable Datagram

    14           Protocol, ICMP, the Internet Control Message Protocol. 

    15           Riding on top of TCP are protocols such as Telnet on the

    16           World Wide Web, HTTP Protocols.  It's a layer cake of various

    17           different concoctions.

    18           Q   Well, we'll get into some of those in a few minutes.  Who

    19           comprises the IETF?

    20           A   As I said, the IETF is a self-organized group, we have

    21           meetings three times a year.  The membership is those who

    22           attend the meetings and those who are on the mailing lists. 

    23           There are some 80 or so working groups, each of the working

    24           groups maintains a mailing list and anybody who joins any of

    25           those mailing lists is de facto part of the IETF. 

                                                                            11

     1                    There is an organizational structure within the IETF

     2           which divides the working groups up into areas and then the

     3           area, each area is managed by one or more, one or two area

     4           directors.

     5           Q   We're going to get into that as well.  People doing the,

     6           quote, "standards work," unquote, on the IETF, are they

     7           normally paid by corporations and businesses?

     8           A   Or they are paid by corporations or businesses or

     9           universities or their private consultants.

    10           Q   Okay.  Could you explain to the Court what an RFC is?

    11           A   RFC came from the original process of asking for

    12           comments, it stood for request for comments, asking for

    13           comments on thoughts on how to do some proposal.  It is

    14           progressed past that point now and RFC stands for RFC.  It no

    15           longer is a vehicle for comments.  There is a new vehicle for

    16           the comments which are called Internet drafts and they pre--

    17           precede RFC's, but RFC's are the basic standardization

    18           document series for the IETF.

    19           Q   RFC's exist that define a standards process for the

    20           Internet, correct?

    21           A   There are a series of RFC's which have progressively

    22           defined the standards process.

    23           Q   And some of the RFC's establishing a standards process

    24           for the Internet are well established, correct?

    25           A   There is -- the original standards process was defined in

                                                                            12

     1           RFC-1310, that has been superseded by RFC-1602 which has been

     2           in effect for a few years, I don't remember exactly what. 

     3           And within one of the working groups within the IETF is

     4           called the Poise Working Group -- and don't ask me what that

     5           stands for cause I don't know -- and that is in the process

     6           of refining a third revision of the standards process.  It's

     7           now known as 1602 BIS because it has not gotten its own RFC

     8           number yet.  That should happen within a few weeks.

     9           Q   You're editing at least one RFC at the present time

    10           having to do with Internet standards, correct?

    11           A   I am editing two of them; co-editing one and editing

    12           another one.

    13           Q   Now, you mentioned an area within IETF, what is an area

    14           within the IETF?

    15           A   An area is a grouping of working groups, normally trying

    16           to make the -- it's normally tried to be done in a way which

    17           is logical so that the working groups which are working on

    18           security-related matters are grouped in the security area. 

    19           Working groups that are working on network management related

    20           efforts are in the network management area.

    21           Q   Would it be fair to say that the area of operational

    22           requirements that you are co-area director of has to do with

    23           developing standards for the next generation of software for

    24           the Internet?

    25           A   No, it would not be.  The operational requirements area

                                                                            13

     1           is a little bit of a confusion point on the IETF in that one

     2           of the things that we feel we must have is some kind of

     3           feedback from the operation of a protocol to the protocol

     4           developers and the operational requirements area does two

     5           things: one, tries to make sure that when standards are

     6           developed they can be done so, the resultant standards can

     7           actually be operated in the real world rather than just in

     8           the theoretical world.  And then, second of all, if indeed

     9           when these standards are deployed that there is any lessons

    10           to be learned which should go back to the standards

    11           developers that they are fed back.

    12                    I think what you may be referring to is the ad hoc

    13           or the temporary IP Next Generation or IPNG area which is,

    14           was working on and is currently working on extending for the

    15           new generation of the IP protocol itself.

    16           Q   Well, you have also been the co-area director of the IP

    17           Next Generation area, correct?

    18           A   That's correct.

    19           Q   It sounds a little bit like Star Trek; what does that

    20           area consist of?

    21           A   It was purposely it sounds a little like Star Trek,

    22           actually.

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24           A   It consists of the -- Allison Menkin and I were asked by

    25           the -- by Phil Gross, the chair of the IETF, to put together

                                                                            14

     1           a temporary area to -- to group together all of the

     2           activities involved, all of the proposals for a successor

     3           protocol to IP to deal with scaling issues and the like and

     4           to resolve the question of what should be "The Proposal" out

     5           of the IETF-4 and IP Next Generation.  There were a number of

     6           proposals on the books when we were assigned the task of

     7           forming this temporary area, we have made a recommendation on

     8           what the next generation should be, that recommendation has

     9           been accepted and the area right now is closing down because

    10           it's very close to have finished publishing the initial set

    11           of RFC's, the initial set of standards for IP Next

    12           Generation.

    13           Q   Would it be fair to say, to summarize what you've just

    14           said, that the IP Next Generation group is working on a new

    15           generation of the IP Protocol itself?

    16           A   That is correct.

    17           Q   Does it have -- does the IP Next Generation group have

    18           recommendations regarding a specific architecture of the

    19           packet traffic on the Internet, including the format of the

    20           packet?

    21           A   It has a recommendation on the format of the packet

    22           itself that's actually the basic recommendation is the format

    23           of the packet traffic itself.  You used the word

    24           "architecture" in your question and that's potentially

    25           confusing because architecture could mean the way the

                                                                            15

     1           networks are put together, it could mean the concept of how

     2           the packets are flowed through the network, it could mean a

     3           number of different things, so I would prefer to say that

     4           we've defined the packet format itself and we have looked at

     5           architecture in various areas but not come to a specific

     6           recommendation on architecture.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sir, when you -- excuse me.  When

     8           you use the word "architecture" and it's in all -- a number

     9           of the declarations, there's no -- that's not a term of art

    10           that means one thing in this area?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  It means -- it means one thing for

    12           each of the areas that it's in.  And it's as a security

    13           architecture which ties together a unified view of how one

    14           should do security.

    15                    There is a routing architecture which ties together

    16           a unified view of how one should do routing which is the

    17           keeping track of where networks are.  So there are a number

    18           of architectures depending on what particular topic we're on. 

    19           There isn't an overall architecture because at the moment

    20           it's too complex a network with too many functions going on. 

    21           You have to look at the individual functions and do an

    22           architecture on those.

    23                    We have done some work in that area, there is an

    24           architecture for security, an IP Next Generation Security

    25           which is now the general IP Security architecture and we have

                                                                            16

     1           looked at architecture in other areas, but it's difficult to

     2           do to unify all of the thoughts together.

     3                    One of our recommendations in the -- in our

     4           recommendation for IP Next Generation was to appoint an

     5           individual to be an architect for IP Next Generation. 

     6           Unfortunately, there aren't many people who could do that

     7           task and fewer of them with enough time to do it.  So we in

     8           the -- as Allison and I have acted as architects to make sure

     9           that there's a consistent view of what IPNG, IP Next

    10           Generation looks like across the various activities creating

    11           protocols for it, the TCP Next Generation, the ICNP Next

    12           Generation, the routing, security, all of these different

    13           working groups working on different aspects of it, we're

    14           trying to keep their view of what IP Next Generation looks

    15           like as consistent.

    16                    So we in that context are acting as architects, but

    17           it's architects is one of those words which depends on the

    18           beholder.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Depends on?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  On the beholder.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  But you consider yourself

    22           one?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  In a real sense, no, I do not. 

    24           Architects tend to be more visionary than I tend to be in

    25           this environment, intend to be more on intuitive feeling of

                                                                            17

     1           how the incredibly complicated world of the networking fits

     2           together and what the implications are of making a change

     3           some place. 

     4                    I think that I can understand architecture, but I

     5           would not go so far as to say that I am an architect in the

     6           context of, for example, Dave Clark of MIT, Dr. Dave Clark,

     7           who is -- who was the original IP architect and the one who--

     8           and the person that unfortunately didn't have enough time to

     9           be the IP Next Generation architect.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But, for example, in the stipulation

    11           and we hear a lot about the packet switching, for example. 

    12           Now, would that be like, to continue the metaphor, a brick

    13           that is commonly used in all forms of architecture?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  It's -- maybe it's more of a fact of

    15           life of the forms of architecture, but --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because that's unchanging, the

    17           packet switching concept, that's not going to change?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  One of the areas that we specifically

    19           addressed in working on IP Next Generation was what are the

    20           paradigms which we want to follow in IP Next Generation and

    21           one of them was we wanted to preserve what is called the

    22           Datagram mode which is the packet mode.

    23                    The alternative to that is circuit switching like a

    24           telephone where you do a call setup, you do initialization

    25           and all of the traffic flows down a particular path.

                                                                            18

     1                    The original IP that designed when it was originally

     2           designed was designed to deal with adverse events.  The

     3           colloquial story is it was designed to deal with atomic war

     4           which is an adverse event.  And --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I think we can agree on that.

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7                    THE WITNESS:  And so the ability for IP to survive

     8           that kind of environment, the kind of hostile environment we

     9           felt was very important to maintain, Datagram mode means that

    10           the individual units of the data that move over the network

    11           which are packets have full identify-- source identifiers and

    12           destination identifiers in each packet and are separately

    13           routed, separately handled by the computers which comprise

    14           the network, therefore being resilient to individual failure.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And that is -- but that is not

    16           subject to change right now, that's not in the NG, the IPNG?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  We specifically, specifically chose to

    18           require the support for Datagram mode in IPNG.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.  Sorry to interrupt.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   Mr. Bradner, are all IETF documents public?

    22           A   It is a -- it is a matter of pride and honor in the IETF

    23           that all documents are public documents available for free

    24           over the net.  We used the paradigm to develop the paradigm.

    25           Q   And that includes all RFC drafts or proposals for

                                                                            19

     1           standards, right?

     2           A   That is correct, they are called Internet Drafts and they

     3           are publicly available.

     4           Q   And they're put up on web sites and are available to the

     5           world at large, correct?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7           Q   Can we pause here and define what a URL is for the Court?

     8           A   URL is a term which means Uniform Resource Locator, a

     9           pointer.  It's the best -- the best way to identi-- to

    10           consider it is it's sort of like a combination of all of the

    11           things you might have in a phone directory listing,

    12           somebody's name and address, and it is where something is on

    13           the Net, not relative to you but in an absolute sense.

    14                    You don't go three buildings over to the left and

    15           two stores down, it is here is the absolute location of

    16           something ir-- independent of where you happen to be sitting

    17           in the network.

    18           Q   For the IETF itself, am I correct that the URL is

    19           something known as HTTP://WWW.EFF.ORG?

    20           A   That is incorrect.

    21           Q   Oh.

    22           A   Now, I'm sure that --

    23           Q   Please correct me.

    24           A   -- you -- you meant that to be incorrect.

    25           Q   Oh, I see, yes, no, I'm sorry, I -- I did not have the

                                                                            20

     1           right URL.  Why don't you give the right URL?

     2           A   HTTT -- HTTP://WWW.IETF.ORD.

     3                    MR. BARON:  Yes, your Honors, I think I've been

     4           reading the EFF site on the Web too much.

     5           BY MR. BARON:  

     6           Q   Okay.  Could you explain what these domains in that URL

     7           represent for the IETF URL?

     8           A   The -- the part which is relative to the IETF is the

     9           WWW.IETF.ORD.  The part which precedes that, HTTP, is the

    10           protocol, the function in which one should retrieve, should

    11           access this site.  Different options there are, for example,

    12           FTP for File Transfer Protocol or Gofer, are different kinds

    13           of concepts, different kinds of application programs to use

    14           to access this site.

    15                    In this particular case where you can access that

    16           particular site with FTP with anonymous FTP or with the Web,

    17           WWW, the URL you specified is one which is using the Web to

    18           access this site.

    19           Q   What's the difference between the current IP Version Four

    20           and the Next Generation Version Six of the protocol?

    21           A   How much detail would you like that answer in?

    22           Q   Oh, just -- just sort of a summary for the Court.

    23           A   The reason to undertake the effort, and it was some

    24           significant effort to develop a new generation for IP

    25           revolved around three basic issues:

                                                                            21

     1                    The first issue was that the IP address itself which

     2           is the field, I mentioned in the packets themselves there is

     3           this source identifier and a destination identifier, a source

     4           address and a destination address.  In IP Version Four which

     5           is the current version, those fields are 32 bits long, each

     6           of which could in theory identify four billion individual

     7           posts or computers on the Network, but because of address

     8           assignment inefficiency we're beginning to run out of those

     9           and we're beginning to run out at a rate which caused a great

    10           deal of consternation, particularly in the press back in the

    11           early 90's, '92 and '93, that investment in IP was probably

    12           not a good idea because we were running out of addresses. 

    13           It's like going to the phone company and saying I'd like a

    14           phone and they say they don't have a number.

    15                    So the first thing was to try and fix the problem of

    16           running out of addresses.  The second thing was to try and

    17           fix the problem of that there was too much routing

    18           information, this is the information within the computers

    19           that tie the Internet together, they're called routers,

    20           they're special purpose computers.  And in each one of those

    21           computers in the backbone, in the more central locations

    22           within the network must keep track of where every network in

    23           the world is, every -- the network which is the one which

    24           connects this computer here has to be kept track of by those

    25           computers and the routers in the backbone.

                                                                            22

     1                    The size of the routing table, the size of that

     2           information was growing faster than memory technology,

     3           doubling every nine to ten months and memory technology was

     4           doubling every 11 to 24 months and in the long run those two

     5           lines will never intersect.  And so we had to do something.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, it's doubling every nine

     7           to twelve months?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  In nine --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's doubling every nine to --

    10                    THE WITNESS:  The size of the Internet, yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Nine to twelve months?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  It's been tending towards the

    13           nine month area of doubling.

    14                    And then the third area was want to be able to deal

    15           with improving some aspects of the current Internet, security

    16           aspects, real time or flow control or quality of service

    17           metrics and things like that, so those were the three areas

    18           which we were focusing on.

    19                    In the first area the IP Version Four address, as I

    20           said, is 32 bits long.  The IP Version Six which is what IP

    21           Next Generation is, is 128 bits long.  Now, that's four times

    22           the number of bits, but that's actually four billion times

    23           four billion times four billion times the number of hosts. 

    24           That turns out to be a very large number, yet somebody

    25           estimated that even under the absolute worst efficiency, the

                                                                            23

     1           least efficient method of allocating them it still works out

     2           to 1500 computers per square meter of the earth's surface,

     3           including the oceans.

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5                    THE WITNESS:  We think that we have -- we think that

     6           we have aimed for the future in the expandability of this.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8           BY MR. BARON:  

     9           Q   Sounds like a pervasive number of bits.

    10           A   Okay.  The second, the second area was dealing with the

    11           routing table space and we've made the addresses aggregatable

    12           so that instead of having to articulate and list every

    13           individual network, you can list a group of networks together

    14           as one entry and this allows us to summarize the information

    15           so that we don't have as many entries.

    16                    And then the third one, which was the other aspects,

    17           we've identified some strong security mechanisms and we have

    18           a field in the packet header which will allow future use for

    19           flow control, quality of service and metrics of that type.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask a lay question, very

    21           basic?  If you go to this four times as many bits is it going

    22           to increase four times everybody's address?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  The -- that's a very good question and

    24           actually that's something that a lot of people get confused. 

    25           There are two ways that you look at addresses on the

                                                                            24

     1           Internet.  One is that bit pattern, currently the 32 bits, so

     2           the address of the computer sitting on my desk at Harvard is

     3           128.103.65.15.  Now, I don't expect you to remember that, I'm

     4           surprised that I do most of the time.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I don't intend to write to you

     6           that way cause I wouldn't know how.

     7                    (Laughter.)

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.  It's now in the record so

     9           you could look it up, but that's not the way that you should

    10           know about my computer.  You should know about my computer by

    11           using its what is called domain name, which is a people

    12           friendly name, and that name is NEWDEV, as in the New

    13           Development Machine, dot Harvard dot EDU.  As long as you're

    14           using that what is called the domain name, the size of the

    15           actual address, the number of bits in the address is not

    16           reflected back to something that the user has to deal with. 

    17           I would not want to try to remember the 128 bit version of

    18           what my -- my computer's address is, but the domain name,

    19           NEWDEV.Harvard.EDU will remain the same.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    21                    Sorry.

    22           BY MR. BARON:  

    23           Q   Mr. Bradner, you also said on something called the IESG,

    24           the Internet Engineering Steering Group, correct?

    25           A   That is correct.

                                                                            25

     1           Q   You've -- this is the Standards Approval Board of the

     2           IETF, correct?

     3           A   That is correct.

     4           Q   Take us through, very briefly, if you would, the

     5           standards track in terms of the three stages of standards,

     6           proposed, draft and full?

     7           A   Actually, I would like to start a little bit before that. 

     8           All documents which are going to be proposed for

     9           consideration for standardization within the IETF must first

    10           appear as one of the Internet drafts that you mentioned

    11           earlier that are publicly available ideas.  And so somebody

    12           who wishes to, somebody or some working group or some group

    13           of individuals who wish to make a standard or have a document

    14           considered to be a -- for standardization creates a Internet

    15           draft.  Usually that is the product of a working group or is

    16           that, you know, a working group is formed to look at that

    17           proposal, but not always.

    18                    After working group consideration, the working group

    19           chair would propose to the area director within the area that

    20           this document be considered by the IESG for the standards

    21           process, for the standards track.

    22                    The first step, the IESG then reviews that and does

    23           an internal vote and approves or does not approve of the

    24           document based on its technical quality, its clarity and all

    25           of the other things that one should consider when approving a

                                                                            26

     1           standard. 

     2                    The first step in the standards process is, as you

     3           mentioned, the proposed standard status.  A proposed standard

     4           is a document which is felt to be useful, i.e. has a

     5           constituency usually within a working group and within the

     6           IETF itself, and that constituency believes that this is of

     7           value to the community and that it has no known errors, no

     8           known flaws.  If something is discovered in the process of

     9           evaluation by the IESG or the working group which is a flaw,

    10           then it should be returned to the working group and reworked.

    11                    Six months after a document has been approved as a

    12           proposed standard it can then be considered for being a draft

    13           standard.  To achieve draft standard status, a document, a

    14           specification must have multiple interoperable

    15           implementations, you know, it's got to be proven to work, and

    16           it's got to -- all of the individual aspects of it have to be

    17           proven to work, all of the individual functions have to have

    18           been shown to be implemented and interoperable.

    19                    This is unlike some other standards bodies which

    20           just say this is a good idea and it's a better idea now than

    21           it used to be because we've thought about it longer.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could you give us an example? 

    23           Bring us down to earth, give us an example of a standard like

    24           a proposed standard.  What are we talking about?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  A proposed standard, for example --

                                                                            27



     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- an example of one is in the IE --

     3           in the Inter-- in the IET -- IP Next Generation there is a

     4           proposed standard which is the basic packet format and how

     5           that packet is handled by routers as it goes through the

     6           network.  It defines the fields in the packet, the 128-bit

     7           addresses, what routers do when they encounter this packet,

     8           how they process it, all of that kind of aspect, all of those

     9           aspects surrounding defining a packet of IP Version Six IP

    10           Next Generation and how to move it through the network are

    11           part of a proposed standard.

    12                    Another proposed standard would be -- well, a full

    13           standard is Telnet which is a, Telnet is the remote access

    14           protocol where you -- I can sit at this machine here and log

    15           into as if I were local to my computer sitting back on my

    16           desk at Harvard and that's a standard.

    17                    So a proposed standard is: we think this is a good

    18           idea, we don't see any problems with it; draft standard is

    19           people have implemented it and it works and we don't see any

    20           problems with it still and more than one is implemented and

    21           they interoperate.  And then four months after a document has

    22           been approved as a proposed standard, it can then be

    23           considered for full standard and full standard has to have

    24           the same implementation rules but it also has to be proven

                                                                            28

     1           that people want to use it so that there is significant

     2           deployment.  So we don't make something a full standard

     3           unless people are going to use it.

     4           BY MR. BARON:  

     5           Q   It is true, is it not, that apart from the IETF and the

     6           IESG, that there are other standards for the Internet that

     7           come from submissions by outside individuals or groups,

     8           correct?

     9           A   There are, there are a number of bodies who make

    10           specifications, most of them call them specifications for

    11           some minutiae of legal ease that I don't quite understand,

    12           rather than standards.  A number of --

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now you know how people feel if

    14           they don't quite understand when somebody says something.  Go

    15           ahead.

    16                    (Laughter.)

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I fully do understand, actually.  I am

    18           a fish out of water here, so...

    19                    There are many bodies who purport to make standards

    20           or specifications that are for use on the Internet.  The IETF

    21           is the longest established of these and the one which has the

    22           most international flavor and the one which is the, well, I

    23           think anyway, since I'm a member of it, has the most

    24           credibility as an open forum for development of standards. 

    25           We allow literally anybody who wants to participate.

                                                                            29

     1                    Many of the other groups have a membership mechanism

     2           where somebody purchases a membership or pays a membership

     3           fee and at the access to the standards either during

     4           development or when they're done are restricted, you have to

     5           pay for them.  But there are a dozen or more different groups

     6           developing specifications for protocols to be used over the

     7           Internet, those groups are open, large consortia such as the

     8           W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium, or very focused ones such

     9           as the Master Card and Visa just announced a payments

    10           protocol to encrypt credit cards over the Net, and that is a

    11           small consortium and they have come up with a standard.

    12                    And so there's a wide range of standards.  Things in

    13           the Internet as in things in real life are standards only in

    14           the extent that people actually use what you've done.  We can

    15           create something we say is a standard and if nobody uses it,

    16           well, we're whistling in the wind but it's not really a

    17           standard unless people use it.

    18                    So the Web itself is something which did not develop

    19           out of the IETF standards process, it developed out of

    20           scientists wanting to avail the technology for use in over

    21           the Internet and this was -- this was developed outside the

    22           IETF, though now there's an activity within the IETF to

    23           codify and clarify the Web standards, the HTTP Standards. 

    24           But, yes, there are many standards processes.

    25           BY MR. BARON:  

                                                                            30

     1           Q   There are 53 or so full standards that have made it

     2           through this process?

     3           A   Over the years, yes.

     4           Q   These are common protocols -- 

     5           A   Something around that number.

     6           Q   These are common protocols in widespread use on the

     7           Internet, correct?

     8           A   They were at the time they were adopted.  Not all of them

     9           are still in widespread use, some of them are quite historic.

    10           Q   And there are some two dozen draft standards in the

    11           works, correct?

    12           A   Somewhere around that number, yes.

    13           Q   And about two or three more dozen proposed standards,

    14           correct?

    15           A   That is correct.

    16                    MR. BARON:  Your Honors, I'm going to, with the

    17           Court's indulgence, approach the witness and provide him with

    18           an exhibit.  We have provided --

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's in our binder?

    20                    MR. BARON:  They're in black binders.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In the black binder.

    22                    MR. BARON:  In the Defendant's Exhibits 1 through

    23           45, for the Court.  I will hand the witness a volume as well.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And this is going to illustrate

    25           everything he just said in black and white?

                                                                            31

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2                    THE WITNESS:  In a little bit more detail, I think.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Which exhibit is this again?

     4           BY MR. BARON:  

     5           Q   I wanted to turn to Exhibit 6, Mr. Bradner, I wanted to

     6           give a concrete example of something that the IETF is working

     7           on.  You're familiar with this document, Mr. Bradner?

     8           A   Make sure we're on the same page.  This is --

     9           Q   It's --

    10           A   -- the charter for the address auto configuration working

    11           group?

    12           Q   That's correct, marked as Defendant's Exhibit 6?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   Your name appears on the first page of the document,

    15           correct?

    16           A   That is correct.

    17           Q   Could you explain how this document which is with title

    18           "Address Auto Configuration" will help unsophisticated

    19           computer purchases -- purchasers like myself to essentially

    20           plug and play when they buy computers?

    21           A   The document itself won't help you a great deal.

    22           Q   Okay.

    23           A   But the -- this is, the document is a charter for a

    24           working group within the IETF, within the IP Next Generation

    25           area which is designed for to allow computers when they're

                                                                            32

     1           taken out of a shipping carton and plugged into the wall to

     2           come up with that globally unique 128-bit address so that you

     3           don't have to type it in.  You thought that remembering was

     4           bad, defining the right one and typing it was going to be

     5           awful.  So this is a mechanism by which the computer can

     6           figure out a globally useful unique address and work with

     7           other technologies, particularly what is called Dynamic Host

     8           Configuration Protocol which is a way where a central

     9           administrator can control what address some particular

    10           computer gets.  This is one of the activities of the IP Next

    11           Generation area.

    12           Q   If I could re-formulate that, in other words, an

    13           individual does not have to obtain an IP address from some

    14           central source like Internet but an auto configuration will

    15           assign a globally unique address, correct?

    16           A   It will assign a globally unique address but within

    17           constraints of and a range of addresses which has been

    18           provided from some central source, either directly or

    19           indirectly.  It doesn't just go pick a number out of the air,

    20           it says that this network, this physical wire can have

    21           addresses 1 through 99 within this sub, sub-grouping of

    22           addresses and it will pick the one within that sub-group

    23           which uniquely identifies this machine but it does not affect

    24           what is called the high order bits or the more -- the more

    25           general part of the address which is supplied to it from a

                                                                            33

     1           router on the local network, a computer on the local network.

     2           Q   Am I correct in saying that each IP address is unique on

     3           earth?

     4           A   That is incorrect.

     5           Q   Let me, maybe I misphrased something from your deposition

     6           in the last week, let me quote from Page 55, Line 18.  I'd be

     7           happy to supply the witness with a copy of the deposition

     8           transcript.

     9           A   You can read it and --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would you like the written

    11           deposition?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Well, why doesn't he read it, if I'm

    13           still confused then I'll ask for a copy.

    14           BY MR. BARON:  

    15           Q   I asked a question that went:  Question:  "In lay

    16           person's terms it would mean that a person such as myself who

    17           may have difficulty loading in software or loading in

    18           whatever is required to put a computer -- to get it to go

    19           would have an easier time."

    20                    You answered at some length, but at one paragraph

    21           you said "It will negotiate over the network for an address

    22           automatically and" -- here's the key section -- "assign an

    23           address which is globally unique and will uniquely locate

    24           this computer on the global Internet."

    25                    Did I misstate the point?

                                                                            34

     1           A   Your question was whether every IP address in the world

     2           is unique and the answer is no.  The -- the answer to the

     3           question on the address auto configuration is if the address

     4           auto, the node which is being configured is part of a

     5           network, part of a network which is directly connected on the

     6           Internet, then, yes, it will come up with a globally unique

     7           address.  But there are very many, thousands and thousands of

     8           networks which are not connected to the global Internet and

     9           they are using addresses which may be the same as somebody

    10           else on the global Internet but it doesn't make any

    11           difference because they're not part of the same picture.

    12                    And then there's a whole 'nother class which is

    13           getting increasingly common where an organization such as a

    14           university or a corporation, more likely a corporation, picks

    15           addresses which are convenient to it and then has what is

    16           called a fire wall between itself and the rest of the

    17           Internet and that fire wall translates the addresses which

    18           are local within its own corporation to addresses which are

    19           unique on the internet, but it does so not one address per

    20           node within the corporation but one address per speaker.

    21                    So if I am -- want to just talk within the

    22           corporation, I never get an address which is unique on the

    23           Internet.  If I want to go out and make a connection out on

    24           the Internet then I will be assigned the next address in the

    25           row of the ones available that are unique on the Internet. 

                                                                            35

     1           Normally there are very much fewer addresses on the window of

     2           the Internet than there are inside the corporation and the

     3           addresses on the window are reassigned by dynamically every

     4           time somebody connects and disconnects, makes a section

     5           through this fire wall and disconnects.  This is because of

     6           the pressure of addresses on the Internet, we are still in a

     7           situation where the 32 bit IP Version Four address is under

     8           some stress in terms of availability, so in order to make it

     9           easier on corporations which may have very large internal

    10           networks but may not be able to obtain an address, a globally

    11           unique address, routable, globally unique address for every

    12           one of their internal nodes, they get a small subsection,

    13           maybe 500, maybe a thousand addresses which are reachable all

    14           over the Internet to deal with the 100,000 internal

    15           computers.  It just means they can only have a thousand

    16           communications going on at once.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me ask, could I follow that

    18           through?  I had a question on that as I read his original

    19           affidavit.  Let me give you an example and see if it has any

    20           relevance to this.

    21                    The Federal Courts, the whole Federal Court system

    22           is in this circuit interconnected on what we call CC Mail and

    23           is in the process of becoming interconnected with Federal

    24           Courts throughout the country.  But it's not currently on the

    25           Internet for various reasons, although there may be, I

                                                                            36

     1           believe, several Internet addresses or -- I'm not sure that's

     2           the right technical way to put it -- that Courts or libraries

     3           within the Federal Court system are getting so that they can

     4           get the information available generally without compromising

     5           the security of the Federal Court communications.

     6                    Now, is there a fire wall between -- is fire wall

     7           the right term that insulates the Federal Courts from the

     8           rest of the Internet?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  It could be and isn't necessarily, it

    10           could be simply that you have E-mail gateways such that

    11           Electronic Mail, and CC Mail is a product name, by the way.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That Electronic Mail and CC Mail goes

    14           to a computer which then reconverts it from the CC Mail

    15           format into the Internet format so it can be forwarded out on

    16           the Internet.  And then E-mail from the outside world can be

    17           reformatted and forwarded inside, without having the ability,

    18           for example, as I said Telnet, I could Telnet from here to my

    19           desk at Harvard.  Without have-- the E-mail gateway would not

    20           permit the passage of Telnet packets so that somebody from

    21           outside couldn't try and connect up and use one of the

    22           internal court machines.

    23                    So there are different ways to get that isolation. 

    24           Fire Walls is one of them, Application Gateways is another

    25           one.  The modern Fire Walls tend to be Application Gateways

                                                                            37

     1           built into a single box, a number of different application

     2           gateways, a Telnet Gateway, an FDP Gateway, a Web Gateway,

     3           and an E-mail Gateway all built into the same box and many of

     4           them do this address translation.

     5                    In your case it's more likely, speaking just as a

     6           general indication, that the addresses inside are not even

     7           translated to addresses outside, that the message is received

     8           by the Gateway and retransmitted as if it were an entirely

     9           new message using the address of the Gateway when it's going

    10           out on the Internet, nothing related to the individual source

    11           node where the message came from.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And there would be then, is it

    13           correct that if you use such a gateway or whatever the

    14           communication process is, there would be no way outside to

    15           know what's really -- what's coming in inside or where it's

    16           going inside?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  That -- that actually is a key point. 

    18           We don't -- the Fire-- one of the aspects of Fire Walls is to

    19           try and protect the knowledge of the structure of the inside

    20           network from the outside, it's to hide the inside structure.

    21           So from the outside, if I have an -- if I had your E-mail

    22           address, I could send you E-mail but I wouldn't know how that

    23           would get to you once it got past this gateway.  I wouldn't

    24           know, wouldn't be able to determine from the outside anything

    25           to do with the structure of the Court network nor what

                                                                            38

     1           computers were there, where you read your E-mail or anything. 

     2           It's one of the functions of Gateways is to protect the

     3           internal structure from visibility.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So then it has at least two

     5           objects.  One is because there are a multiplying number of

     6           addresses and there are just or may not be enough addresses

     7           and the other or many others are for other purposes?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay. 

    10           BY MR. BARON:  

    11           Q   Just a couple more questions on standards.  You would

    12           agree that a number of organizations are responsible for the

    13           development of communications and operational standards and

    14           protocols used on the Internet, correct?

    15           A   A number of organizations believe they are, yes. 

    16           Q   The Internet wouldn't exist today as we know it without

    17           some standards or some rules of the road, correct?

    18           A   That is correct.

    19           Q   And you recall saying in your deposition to me that we

    20           are in a, quote, "standards development rich environment,"

    21           unquote, on the Internet and you stand by that?

    22           A   Yes, or sit by it or whatever.

    23           Q   You stated in your supplemental declaration that you

    24           have, quote, "A complete understanding of how communications

    25           are accomplished on the Internet today, including

                                                                            39

     1           communications such as E-mail use, Net and World Wide Web,"

     2           correct?  Why don't we break down the Internet and start with

     3           World Wide Web since most of the plaintiffs in this case in

     4           the lawsuit have Web pages.

     5                    Mr. Bradner, can you describe for the Court what the

     6           World Wide Web is?

     7           A   The World Wide Web is basically two things:  it's the URL

     8           that you mentioned earlier which is a pointer, a way to -- a

     9           way to identify a particular location and piece of

    10           information within that location on the Net and software that

    11           interprets those pointers and goes off and retrieves the

    12           documents that's been referenced by the URL.

    13           Q   You testified at your deposition last Friday and I'm

    14           paraphrasing this, but correct me if I misstate something,

    15           that the World Wide Web is a concept more than anything else,

    16           it is comprised of a number of servers which can provide

    17           information about requests in the same general concept as

    18           other servers, new servers, FTP servers and the like and a

    19           descriptive language which allows you to embed in a piece of

    20           text locators defined to point to other documents.

    21                    Is that a good statement?

    22           A   The World Wide Web uses a --

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You have to say yes or no so they

    24           can get that.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes, sorry.  Yes.

                                                                            40

     1                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.

     2           BY MR. BARON:  

     3           Q   The World Wide Web uses a graphical user interface,

     4           correct?

     5           A   The -- the World Wide Web client applications that I have

     6           seen use a graphical user interface.

     7           Q   Why don't you describe for the Court what a graphical

     8           user interface is?

     9           A   The early computer interfaces tended to be character

    10           lined, lined character type interfaces where you typed words

    11           and commands like if you've used DOS, it's a DOS interface,

    12           it's where your view of the Net or your view of the command

    13           into the computer is one which is a character stream, you

    14           type in words with varying degrees of meaningfulness and

    15           asking it to do something.

    16                    A graphical user interface tends to be a full screen

    17           application where you have a -- an ability to, with a mouse

    18           or with cursor, those little arrow keys on the keyboard,

    19           locate something on the screen and tell it to activate a

    20           program or to fetch a file or do something because you're

    21           selecting something on the keyboard -- something on the

    22           screen, rather than typing the name of something in on the

    23           keyboard.

    24           Q   The graphical user interface was designed to be user

    25           friendly, correct?

                                                                            41

     1           A   The hope of the designers of graphical user interfaces is

     2           that they're user friendly.  The definition of "user" and

     3           "friendly" are to the mind of the beholder.

     4                    (Laughter.)

     5           Q   In fact, the Web's user interface was designed to allow

     6           people with a wide variety of computer skills, indeed even

     7           with some -- some with minimal computer skills to access vast

     8           quantities of information, correct?

     9           A   That is correct. 

    10           Q   And the language for creating Web pages on the World Wide

    11           Web was designed in a way that makes pages easy to write,

    12           makes it easy to put up pages on servers and makes it easy to

    13           distribute information around the world, correct?

    14           A   That is -- that was the statement of the people who

    15           designed the language but I do notice that many of the books

    16           on HTTP which is this language tend to be in the one to two-

    17           inch or three-inch thick variety.  So again this might, it

    18           somewhat depends on one's interpretation of the word "easy."

    19           Q   HTTP or HTML?

    20           A   Oh, HTML, sorry.  Right.  I get those --

    21           Q   You stated last week in your deposition --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  HTML.

    23                    MR. BARON:  That was going to be my next question,

    24           your Honor.

    25           BY MR. BARON:  

                                                                            42

     1           Q   Why don't you state for the Court what HTML is?

     2           A   Hypertext Markup Language or something of that general

     3           ilk.  There's -- 

     4           Q   Were --

     5           A   There's too many acronyms in this business.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  May I be the first to agree with

     7           you?

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I'll be the second.

    10                    MR. BARON:  We're going to get to HTML, Judge

    11           Dalzell.

    12           BY MR. BARON:  

    13           Q   You stated last week in your deposition that you've

    14           looked at thousands of Web pages and that there are probably

    15           tens of thousands of Web pages in existence.  That's correct,

    16           right?

    17           A   Well, the tens of thousands would be a -- what I meant in

    18           when we're speaking of that is there are tens of thousands of

    19           locations where Web pages exist.  The actual number of Web

    20           pages in the sense of a screen image that you could retrieve

    21           is certainly in the millions.  I know I have on my own site

    22           which is one server, one Web server with one home page, there

    23           are thousands of screens that you can retrieve.  So if you're

    24           talking about Web pages in terms of images on a screen, then

    25           there are millions of them.

                                                                            43

     1           Q   Okay.  Now, apart from individuals --

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Excuse me, you say you have a Web

     3           page?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  I have a Web server.  One of the

     5           things that I do at Harvard is to run a test lab which

     6           examines the performance of routers and things like, network

     7           devices like that.  And I put all of the information that

     8           I've gotten from this examination up on line for anybody to

     9           take a look at and there is thousands of pages, mostly of

    10           numbers and some of pictures of performance curves available

    11           from the Web server which is running on the computer sitting

    12           on my desk.

    14           Q   Apart from individuals, Mr. Bradner, it would be a fair

    15           statement to say that organizations including commercial

    16           organizations such as companies selling potato chips or

    17           pencils or cars use the Web as a way to provide information,

    18           correct?

    19           A   Correct.

    20           Q   And to sell their products, correct?

    21           A   At this point, more to provide information.  In the

    22           future, in the near future I trust, more will be in the

    23           business of selling their products over the Internet.  Right

    24           now because of concerns of security and things of that

    25           nature, few, relatively few companies are actually doing

                                                                            44

     1           retail over the Net, going and buying a bag of potato chips

     2           over the Net is not something that is readily available today

     3           although you can order a pizza if you happen to live in Santa

     4           Clara, California.  Delivery is a big problem if you're doing

     5           it from here, but --

     6                    (Laughter.)

     7           A   -- that -- soon you'll be able to do that.  So I'm just

     8           nuancing on the word you use of selling because right at the

     9           moment it's more providing information than it is selling.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because you can't close the sale?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Actually you can and you can by

    12           putting your credit card number in and actually the credit

    13           card transaction over the Internet today is more secure than

    14           giving your credit card to the waitress at the local

    15           restaurant, but there is a feeling that it is not as secure. 

    16           And so there aren't many --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I thought there was a problem of

    18           verification?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  The -- it's the same --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Or so we're told.

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Well, it's the same level of problem

    22           of verification as what happens when someone calls up and

    23           orders something from L.L. Bean over the telephone. L.L. Bean

    24           has to go through a process with which they call up the

    25           credit card company and say is this a valid credit card.

                                                                            45

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is it not true that you still

     2           have to go outside the Internet to do that process?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Today that is true.  I would hope that

     4           in the relatively near future --

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Defined as?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Well, Master Card and Visa did define

     7           a language for moving of information about credit cards over

     8           the Net, they said it would be, that this definition would be

     9           available I think this month or next month.  So in the next

    10           six to nine months the function set to be able to send a

    11           secure credit card to Master Card to ask whether it's a valid

    12           card and whether the person has enough money to pay two

    13           dollars or whatever your fee is going to be should be there,

    14           but this is a projection rather than a statement from

    15           knowledge of who is developing these.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  How could phoning tell or assure

    17           that it's a valid card?  It might show or how can phoning

    18           assure that X, that Judge Dalzell who gives the card number

    19           is in fact Judge Dalzell rather than Judge Buckwalter?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Actually, it does not.  And that's --

    21           it does not now when you call up for one of these mail order

    22           houses.  They do it on a basis generally of two things.  One

    23           is that in general when you order something you order it,

    24           particularly if it's going to be shipped to you, you order it

    25           shipped to you so that in some cases like American Express,

                                                                            46

     1           if it's a valuable shipment, will verify it's being shipped

     2           to the billing address.  And if it's not being shipped to the

     3           billing address, you have to call them up and tell them no,

     4           this is a special case and I want it to go someplace else.  I

     5           know because I had to do that.

     6                    Other credit card just ship -- know because they

     7           have the shipping address of where it's going to, they have

     8           an audit trail so in case somebody protests that this wasn't,

     9           it wasn't me who placed this order, they can then do some

    10           kind of tracking to try and figure out who it was who placed

    11           the order.  And the same thing would be true over the

    12           Internet.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But would that be time consuming or

    14           now that we have computers could that be easy and

    15           instantaneous?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, in a real way ordering something

    17           over the Internet over ordering something from a mail order

    18           house over the telephone isn't going to change any of the

    19           mechanisms involved other than how do you do it.  You sit

    20           there with a Web page and do some clicking on with your mouse

    21           versus you call up on the telephone and tell the nice person

    22           who answers the phone that you want an item on Page 67.

    23                    The rest of this, what happens behind the scenes,

    24           works the same way today.  There will be an increase in

    25           efficiency when the verification process for verifying the

                                                                            47

     1           card, instead of requiring a separate communication normally

     2           by a phone line with Master Card or Visa or American Express

     3           could be done with electronic communication over the

     4           Internet.

     5                    That will be a change in efficiency, but it doesn't

     6           change the basic functionality which is they're depending on

     7           you or your knowledge of the credit card number as your

     8           identifier to identify yourself and the fact that they can

     9           trace where the order was sent to as sort of a second guess

    10           to figure out what happened when something goes awry.

    11           BY MR. BARON:  

    12           Q   Putting aside actually ordering merchandise by use of a

    13           verified credit card via the Internet, it's certainly true,

    14           isn't it the case that both individuals and companies can

    15           have Web pages and that have a phone number on them or an 800

    16           number or a toll free number for people to call to buy things

    17           that they see advertised on the Net, isn't that correct?

    18           A   Yes, that is true.

    19           Q   Okay.  Before we get into what individuals and nonprofit

    20           organizations other than corporations can or cannot do, let's

    21           talk about some technical matters including some --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean we haven't been?

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24                    MR. BARON:  Some more technical matters.

    25           BY MR. BARON:  

                                                                            48

     1           Q   Including some descriptive language used for the World

     2           Wide Web.  Mr. Bradner, could you tell the Court what a Web

     3           server is?

     4           A   A Web server, a server in general in computer jargon is

     5           software which is running on a computer which is waiting

     6           patiently for a command to be sent to it over a network and

     7           that command, if it's an FTP server, it would be an FTP

     8           command, FTP stands for File Transfer Protocol.  If it's a

     9           server which returns phone numbers it's going to be a phone

    10           number query.  If it's a database server, so lots of

    11           different servers, they have the same basic function which is

    12           just software running in the computer waiting for a query.

    13                    A Web server is one which is waiting for a query

    14           which is in -- over the Net which is formed in Webese, in the

    15           right format for a Web query.

    16           Q   You told me last week that the World Wide Web is sewn

    17           together with URL's, is that a fair statement?

    18           A   Yes.  Sorry.

    19           Q   Now, on a particular Web page there can be pointers to

    20           other pages on the Web, correct?

    21           A   Those are the URL's of which we were just speaking.

    22           Q   And the pointers -- all right, they can be pointers to

    23           other URL's.  And Web pages can also have --

    24           A   The pointers are the URL's.

    25           Q   Oh, the pointers are the URL's, okay, I stand corrected. 

                                                                            49

     1           Web pages can also have pointers to files which contain audio

     2           or sound, correct?

     3           A   That is correct. 

     4           Q   In fact, Web pages can contain pointers to files in any

     5           one of a number of forms containing any one of a number of

     6           things such as text, sounds, still graphics or motion

     7           graphics, correct?

     8           A   That is correct.

     9           Q   One can take a home movie on a Camcorder and digitize it

    10           and transpose it in a way that would be viewable by clicking

    11           on a pointer on a Web page, correct?

    12           A   Assuming that the person who had the client who had the

    13           Web browser had the right software installed which allowed

    14           them to download and then view motion graphics and assuming

    15           that the motion graphics were stored in a format compatible

    16           with the browser that the individual had.  Both of those are

    17           not assumptions you can make a hundred percent, but still

    18           given that qualification, yes.

    19           Q   Could you tell the Court what a browser is?

    20           A   A browser is the jargon term for a Web client.  The

    21           client is the software running on a user's computer to access

    22           some server and a Web browser is the software running on the

    23           user's computer to access a Web server.

    24           Q   And what is a search engine?

    25           A   A search engine in this -- in the context of the Web is a

                                                                            50

     1           piece of software which, when given a query, it's a database

     2           query responder, it's a server for database queries, it --

     3           you give it some information about something that you wish to

     4           find and it goes to its database and tries to find it in that

     5           database.

     6                    Search engines have fine degrees of sophistication

     7           of ability to take just single words or words in context or

     8           concepts in the sense of you can give some search engines a

     9           piece of text, a newspaper article, and say this is

    10           interesting to me, find other things that look like this. 

    11           And it's quite -- some of them are very sophisticated.  They

    12           look at their internal database to try and find other things,

    13           other references in that database which are compatible with

    14           the query that you gave it. 

    15           Q   Let's get to the heart of things, Mr. Bradner, by

    16           discussing something called HTML.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before we do that maybe we should

    18           let the witness have a break and we should all have a break. 

    19           Okay?

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I agree.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Ten minutes, I'm told.

    22                    THE COURT CLERK:  Please rise.

    23                    (Court in recess; 10:40 to 10:55 o'clock a.m.)

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, Mr. Baron.

    25                    MR. BARON:  Excuse me, your Honor, we were just

                                                                            51

     1           taking care of some housekeeping functions.

     2                    (Pause.)

     3           BY MR. BARON:  

     4           Q   Mr. Bradner, we were about to discuss HTML, could you

     5           tell the Court what HTML is?

     6           A   It's a language, a descriptor language which is used to

     7           define within a Web server how a document should appear on

     8           the screen of the Web client, the browser.

     9           Q   Perhaps an example of HTML code would be helpful here. 

    10           Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit that's marked 14 in the

    11           black binder?

    12                    (Pause.)

    13           Q   Do you have that?

    14           A   Yes, I do.

    15           Q   Mr. Bradner, does this appear to you as the same exhibit

    16           that I showed you at your deposition last Friday?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   This represents the Worldwide Web home page of an

    19           organization entitled Stop Prisoner Rape, which is one of the

    20           plaintiffs in this lawsuit.  And you will note -- and you

    21           would agree, would you not, Mr. Bradner, that the first four

    22           pages represent Web pages in their usual format and behind

    23           those four pages is a series of pages which represent the

    24           same text but in HTML code format, is that correct?

    25           A   That appears -- that is what it appears to be, yes.

                                                                            52

     1           Q   Looking at the immediate page behind the usual format Web

     2           pages, the top of the page says --

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  These aren't paginated, are they?

     4                    MR. BARON:  No, they are not, your Honor.

     5                    (Discussion held off the record.)

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You're talking about the first page

     7           following the conventional --

     8                    MR. BARON:  That's correct, the --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- conventionally arranged text?

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, the one that says --

    11                    MR. BARON:  That's correct and the --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's right, okay.

    13                    MR. BARON:  That's correct, your Honor.

    14           BY MR. BARON:  

    15           Q   You see the bracket HTML and bracket Head, correct, Mr.

    16           Bradner?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   The designation Head represents the head of this HTML

    19           document, correct?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   And you see the term Meta in the third and the fifth

    22           line?

    23           A   Yes.

    24           Q   What does the Meta represent?

    25           A   As I said in my deposition and when we talked last

                                                                            53

     1           Friday, I did not and do not represent myself as an expert in

     2           HTML.  So, I would suggest that if you want to investigate

     3           the details of HTML it would probably be better to ask

     4           somebody who is.

     5           Q   But looking at it you're certainly more expert than I,

     6           that the key words here are words that are in a field in a

     7           Meta tag in the header, correct?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   Okay.  And there's a body to an HTML document, correct?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   And down at the bottom of this page there is a reference

    12           to a URL.  The HTML source code includes references to

    13           particular URL's as a usual course, correct?

    14           A   Most of them do, yes.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh --

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The very bottom, the very bottom.

    17                    MR. BARON:  The very bottom of the page, your Honor,

    18           it says "Bracket A-HREF equals," and then A-URL, which

    19           represents another Web site.

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Actually all you can tell about that,

    21           URL, is that it represents a particular document someplace

    22           which may or may not be on another site.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Where does it says URL?

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He said that is the URL.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, okay.

                                                                            54

     1           BY MR. BARON:  

     2           Q   Yes, that's a better description, Mr. Bradner.  Now, in

     3           your deposition last week you indicated that the type of

     4           parental control rating scheme you preferred would be one in

     5           which an individual's browser could be configured to send a

     6           copy of a particular URL, including a URL in a document, to a

     7           third-party rating service with a query to the rating

     8           service, asking for information about the contents of the

     9           URL, correct?

    10           A   Actually, to be very precise, about the contents of the

    11           file or document pointed to by the URL.

    12           Q   Okay.  Now, this would be one of the methodologies

    13           suggested by the PICS scheme, P-I-C-S, which is a parental

    14           control rating scheme being worked on by the W-3 consortium

    15           located at MIT, correct?

    16           A   That's correct.

    17           Q   And that's the scheme that's embodied in Defendant's

    18           Exhibit 15, if you could turn to that, the document which

    19           says, "PICS:  Internet access controls without censorship"?

    20           A   Yes, this is a document you showed me last week.

    21           Q   It is true, is it not, Mr. Bradner, that a browser under

    22           this model of parental controls could look to the specific

    23           header information in HTML source code for a tag or a label

    24           that's put in the header by the content provider as part of

    25           the overall rating scheme, isn't that correct?

                                                                            55

     1           A   To be clear, you had just asked me about my preference

     2           for a third-party rating service, it appears that you're

     3           asking me now about PICS as a general concept, I just want to

     4           be sure what it is that you're asking me.

     5           Q   Well, I'm asking PICS as a general concept.

     6           A   Okay.  So, in PICS as a general concept you -- PICS

     7           defines tags that you can place into a document, into the

     8           header of a document, HTML document and other documents,

     9           which can be used to convey information about the -- some

    10           content of this document, that is correct.

    11           Q   And on Exhibit 15 at Page 6 of 9, at the bottom left-hand

    12           corner, that's where the pages are identified, the second

    13           full paragraph, if you would read along with me --

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, where are you?

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 6 of 9.

    16                    MR. BARON:  It's Exhibit 15 and it's Page 6 of 9,

    17           you can see at the bottom left hand of the document.

    18           BY MR. BARON:  

    19           Q   I'm going to concentrate on the second full paragraph,

    20           starting with "Since," the word, "Since."  And the second

    21           sentence says, "The first is to" -- the first methodology of

    22           PICS, is that correct, Mr. Bradner?

    23           A   That's actually a third sentence.

    24           Q   Well, it says, "The first is to embed labels in HTML

    25           documents.  This method will be helpful for those who wish to

                                                                            56

     1           label content they have created."  That's one of the

     2           methodologies embodied in the PICS parental control rating

     3           standard, correct?

     4           A   That's one of the -- that's one of the methods in their

     5           proposal, yes.

     6           Q   Okay.  Indeed, you believe that as a technical matter one

     7           can embed a character stream which could be interpreted by

     8           browsers or other software if it is so desired, correct?

     9           A   In certain documents, certain types of files and

    10           documents that is correct, in other types of files and

    11           documents it's incorrect.

    12           Q   Well, it's your view, is it not, Mr. Bradner, that as a

    13           technical matter of ease or difficulty that it is trivial to

    14           embed a tag or a label in HTML source code, correct?

    15           A   It's a matter of typing a few characters, so, yes, in

    16           concept; in implementation, if you have thousands of pages of

    17           source code then it might be a little difficult, but in

    18           concept it's easy, you just type in the character string.

    19           Q   You told me last Friday in your deposition that for your

    20           own Web site, your own Web pages, the home page it would be

    21           trivial to embed a tag, you could do it in five minutes,

    22           correct?

    23           A   Well, actually it's a little more -- I said a little bit

    24           more than that.  My current Web server I do not happen to

    25           have a document which is a home page.  The Web server points

                                                                            57

     1           to a part of my -- the directory tree in my computer and it

     2           has automatically created a home page, because I haven't

     3           gotten around to creating one myself.  So, it would take more

     4           than five minutes, because I would have to create the

     5           document in which to embed the string before embedding the

     6           string and I couldn't tell how long that would take, it would

     7           depend on how anal I got and how pretty a picture I wanted on

     8           it.

     9           Q   Well, you said at Page 223 of your deposition -- 

    10                    MR. BARON:  -- I'd be happy at any appropriate point

    11           to hand the witness the deposition if it will be --

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Whenever you want it, you just say

    13           so.

    14                    MR. BARON:  -- helpful for the record.

    15           BY MR. BARON:  

    16           Q   You said at Page 223, Line 8, "Certainly on my site it

    17           would be trivial for me to do," correct?

    18           A   Once I created a home page it would be trivial for me to

    19           do it, yes.

    20           Q   Could you turn to Defendant's Exhibit 16?  This exhibit

    21           is one that I showed you last week, correct?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   It's titled, "Safe Surf Internet Rating Standard," are

    24           you familiar with Safe Surf?

    25           A   As to the extent that you showed it to me last week.

                                                                            58

     1           Q   Okay.  On the second page of this exhibit at the top, the

     2           first full sentence says, "If a majority of them spent five

     3           to ten minutes to implement the system by marking their site

     4           then a child-safe Internet could be realized in a matter of

     5           weeks."  Do you see that statement?

     6           A   I see that statement.

     7           Q   And do you agree with it?

     8           A   No.

     9           Q   You could build PICS compatible software into existing

    10           browsers, correct?

    11           A   One could, I wouldn't proclaim to be a good enough

    12           programmer to in any particular case.

    13           Q   That's technically feasible, correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   Back to Exhibit 15, looking at the bottom of the Page 5

    16           of 9 in the document.  It's the page with blue Figure 4 at

    17           the top, but I'm going to concentrate on the bottom of the

    18           page.  Do you see the sentence that starts, "Anything"?

    19           A   Yes, I do.

    20           Q   Let me read it to the record:  "Anything that can be

    21           named by a URL can be labeled, including resources that are

    22           accessed via FTP, Gopher or Net News, as well as HTTP."  You

    23           agree, do you not, Mr. Bradner, that you may extend URL's to

    24           provide labeling in some form across these applications on

    25           the Internet, correct?

                                                                            59

     1           A   To be very specific and concrete, you can extend the

     2           format of URL's themselves to include additional information,

     3           which could be used by a browser to decide on whether to

     4           implement -- to instigate a particular application.  You

     5           would not actually do anything in the application itself, for

     6           example FTP, you wouldn't modify FTP, you would modify the

     7           browser to decide on whether or not to start up FTP based on

     8           additional information in the URL.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I want to get very concrete on this,

    10           because it's an important issue.  The Carnegie Library, Mr.

    11           Croneberger is here for the Carnegie Library, it's card

    12           catalogue is on line.  Now, I take it the card catalogue is a

    13           site, correct, it has a URL -- if I want to get to it it has

    14           a URL, does it not?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  The -- I can speak with knowledge

    16           about the Harvard University College --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right, fine, take that.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  -- Library.  The Harvard University

    19           College Library, which is called Holis (ph.), is available as

    20           an interactive program.  So that you would Telnet to a server

    21           at Harvard and then it presents a screen wherein you can do

    22           an author search or a title search or things like that.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, what I'm getting at is what I

    24           think Mr. Barn is asking you, is the idea here that Harvard

    25           or the Carnegie Library would rate its card catalogue?

                                                                            60

     1                    THE WITNESS:  In the context of Harvard's, Harvard's

     2           Holis system, what would have to happen is any place where

     3           somebody referenced Harvard's Holis system, a URL which

     4           referenced it, any place where that any URL existed the

     5           reference Holis would have to be extended to include a rating

     6           of Harvard's system.  

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I mean.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  This wouldn't be Harvard rating it,

     9           because Harvard isn't creating the URL's that might be placed

    10           at Brown or at the National Library Association or any place

    11           else, because that is a pointer to Harvard and it's the

    12           pointer in this concept which is modified, not the site

    13           itself.  In this particular case you do not get to Harvard 

    14           -- the way you access Harvard doesn't give an interactive way

    15           for a browser to ask Harvard what its PICS rating is.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, then I'm not understanding

    17           this at all.  The PICS rating -- assume that everybody adopts

    18           this PICS system, okay?  Will the Harvard card catalogue

    19           that's on line, will it be rated or will just subsets of it

    20           be rated?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  There --

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And who has to do that rating?

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Exactly, and who has to do the

    24           rating?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  All right.  I think using the Harvard

                                                                            61

     1           catalogue is exactly the kind of case where we can look at

     2           it.  The current technology, the current way the Harvard

     3           catalogue is implemented is that you interact with the

     4           Harvard catalogue with the same program that I would use to

     5           interact with my computer sitting on my desk, which is

     6           Telnet, it allows you to remotely be connected to that

     7           computer and remotely interact with that computer as if you

     8           were a local terminal; this is not a Web interface, it is a

     9           local terminal interface.  In that context Harvard has no way

    10           of rating -- have no way of handing back a rating to anybody,

    11           because what would have to happen instead is -- it's like you

    12           would put ratings in T.V. Guide of T.V. shows, it's not that

    13           the ratings are embedded in the shows, it's every place where

    14           somebody pointed at Holis you would have to have that place

    15           which did the pointing have the rating in it.  So, Harvard

    16           wouldn't have control over that.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, but what I think Mr. Baron is

    18           getting at is the feasibility of if you are going through a

    19           card catalogue on line, which Mr. Croneberger describes in

    20           detail in his declaration, would this marker be right next to

    21           "Rebecca of Sullybrook Farm," and that's G rated, but then

    22           when it has an Ice T lyric it would be NC-17?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Again --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm not being facetious here.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  No, no, I agree.  Under the current

                                                                            62

     1           Harvard system we wouldn't be able to implement this, I'm

     2           saying under the current Harvard system that the pointers are

     3           outside of Harvard's jurisdiction because they're pointers to

     4           Harvard, not pointers within Harvard.  So, other people would

     5           rate Harvard.  Another interface to this -- the same facility

     6           which does not currently exist, but could be made to exist,

     7           would be a Web Browser-type of interface to the Harvard

     8           College library system.  In that case the browser could be

     9           able to see a rating and the rating would be actually buried

    10           in the URL, when you said Ice T the URL, which specified

    11           where the file was if you're going to retrieve it, then that

    12           URL, you could embed in that URL the PICS parental warning

    13           symbol.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But my point, and it's a very

    15           important point to this case, is since we know at least at

    16           the Carnegie Library, and I would think that's in the

    17           Carnegie Library would be up at Harvard, that they have the

    18           Ice T lyrics, is the whole card catalogue NC-17, to take the

    19           MPAA rating --

    20                    THE WITNESS:  In the --

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- because there is some dirty words

    22           there, in some people's view?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  The question that I was asked a little

    24           while ago, whether it was easy -- the statement in the

    25           exhibit here of whether it was easy for everybody just to do

                                                                            63

     1           this, assumes the very assumption -- the question you just

     2           asked, which is that, yes, Harvard would have to rate its

     3           entire catalogue as questionable because of some references

     4           within that catalogue.  The effort to go through and rate

     5           every individual reference within the catalogue -- Harvard's

     6           -- Carnegie Mellon's catalogue is a subset of Harvard's, of

     7           course --

     8                    (Laughter.)

     9                    THE WITNESS:  -- it's some six or seven million

    10           references in the Harvard catalogue, though I think on line

    11           is three or four million at the moment, this would take

    12           considerable effort to go through and --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And rate them.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- rate every single one of them.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If we started -- if nobody had ever

    16           put Shakespeare into this -- ever at all put it into the

    17           system and somebody, a third party or somebody else went

    18           through Shakespeare before they did this and began to rate

    19           Shakespeare plays, is there some feasible method where

    20           anybody, any library that then have Shakespeare could absorb

    21           that rating?  Or if Judge Dalzell, who has a younger person,

    22           unlike mine, who can read anything, but would he be able to

    23           find some mechanism whether she or he, I don't know, looked

    24           at Shakespeare, wherever it might be?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  There's two aspects to that and

                                                                            64

     1           actually something I should clarify.  On the Harvard College

     2           Library this is the library card catalogue, not the materials

     3           itself, there are other libraries with materials itself on

     4           line.  For example, I was researching for a column that I do

     5           and I was looking up Flatland, which is a -- some of you may

     6           have read that, it's from the late 1800's, it's about a world

     7           of two dimensions --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I read it in geometry.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, well, you should read it at least

    10           there.  And I wanted to look at it, because I was going to do

    11           a column which happened to be based on that.  So, I did a Web

    12           search and I came up with a site where the text for that book

    13           was on line, and I went on off and I read it.  And this was a

    14           library which provided this, it's one of the university

    15           libraries, I forget which one, where that material was on

    16           line.  And I think the questions you were asking are more

    17           related to places where the material is on line --

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Exactly.

    19                    THE WITNESS:  -- rather than the Harvard University

    20           catalogue, which is just saying, well, the rap songs are

    21           available by going to the stacks and looking in Bin 3.  So,

    22           in the areas where the material is on line that's a much more

    23           complex issue, that -- certainly the Harvard -- I don't think

    24           the Harvard catalogue, the catalogue per se would be ever

    25           considered verboten, but certainly some of the items within

                                                                            65

     1           that the catalogue references could be.  There is a mechanism

     2           where one in theory could do this.  A lot of college

     3           libraries, a lot of libraries in generally actually use

     4           external sources when they create their card catalogue, they

     5           send a list of titles to a commercial firm which has expanded

     6           information about titles.  So, you send -- you say I've got

     7           Shakespeare's Hamlet and Edition 14, give a little bit more

     8           information, they return to you the information block, which

     9           includes the key words for use in searches and all of the

    10           other information that you might want for your on-line

    11           reference to this document, rather than you having to enter

    12           all of this -- the individual university library having to

    13           enter all of this information they go off to this third

    14           party.  And in theory that third party, if the rating has --

    15           if a rating has been done that third party could include that

    16           rating in that block of information that they return when the

    17           university or other library says tell me about Shakespeare's

    18           Hamlet, 1912 Edition from whatever.

    19           BY MR. BARON:  

    20           Q   Well, I'd like you to return, however, to the methodology

    21           that I pointed you to in Defendant's Exhibit 15, which is

    22           that one of the methodologies in PICS, is it not, to -- that

    23           the content creator, the content provider embed the tag in

    24           their document rather than a third-party rating organization,

    25           correct?

                                                                            66

     1           A   As I said before, that is a feasible and reasonable thing

     2           to do for some document, it is not possible for others; it is

     3           not possible for binary files, for executables, for example,

     4           you can't embed something in there because it would destroy

     5           the integrity of the file itself --

     6           Q   All right, but for --

     7           A   -- it would make the file itself useless.

     8           Q   But for the Web pages that represent, for example, the

     9           Stop Prisoner Rape Web page, that doesn't have a binary or an

    10           executable file, so far as you know?

    11           A   As far as I know.  It could put at the top of the page --

    12            embed in the HTML a coding, that is correct.

    13           Q   It is also technically feasible to tag a portion of a Web

    14           site, correct?

    15           A   There is no -- in the Web there is nothing which -- there

    16           is no structure which says this is a portion of a site and

    17           this is not.  Going back to your question earlier about the

    18           URL that was at the bottom of the page, I made the point of

    19           saying that this was a pointer to a file some place on some

    20           server, there is nothing to say that this is structurally on

    21           this server or any other server.  So that if you are -- if

    22           all of the access to some subsection of your disk is through

    23           a particular home page and there are no URL's that exist any

    24           place else in the world which have a more explicit pointing

    25           down inside of a sub-subdirectory then, yes, if you put some

                                                                            67

     1           kind of labeling on the home page, on the first page of this

     2           sub-tree you could imply something about the rest of the

     3           tree.  But that would only be making, again, the assumption

     4           that nobody had a URL which pointed further down into that

     5           tree, if they did they would never even look at that page,

     6           they would go directly to the more specific document.

     7           Q   Well, I'm at a point where I think it's reasonable to

     8           read a portion of your deposition last Friday and see if we

     9           can seek clarification here, I'm at Page 222.  Let me read

    10           into the record --

    11                    MR. BARON:  -- and, with the Courts' indulgence, I

    12           think it would be appropriate to show the witness the

    13           deposition.

    14                    (Pause.)

    15           BY MR. BARON:  

    16           Q   I'm at Page 222 and around Line 17.

    17                    MR. BARON:  If the Court wishes, I have copies of

    18           some format of the deposition, but I do intend to read a few

    19           sentences here.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   You're answering me and you say, the witness, this is at

    22           222, Line 17:  "I could make a label and I could see that

    23           most people could make a label and what, for a lack of a

    24           better term, home page for the site which in some way

    25           characterized the contents of the site and do that quite

                                                                            68

     1           economically, yes.  It gets a little more complicated, the

     2           site is like a library site that are flat laying on board,

     3           where the characterizations of the contents vary on a per-

     4           file basis."

     5                    Going down to Line 8:  "Certainly on my site it

     6           would be trivial for me to do, once I got the software and

     7           got everything else and got a sample page to put up it would

     8           probably take me five minutes to do that after I got all of

     9           the crap in line, a technical term." 

    10                    Moving on to Line 14:  "And so, yes, it would be

    11           economically feasible if indeed somebody" --

    12                    MR. MORRIS:  Your Honor, I would just ask that Mr.

    13           Baron read the entire page, he is leaving out some important

    14           points that -- and place the --

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you can get that --

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, you get cross-examination and

    17           the witness has got the entire testimony in front of him.

    18                    MR. MORRIS:  Okay, that's fine.

    19           BY MR. BARON:  

    20           Q   Continuing at Line 14:  "And so, yes, it would be

    21           economically feasible if indeed somebody were to distribute a

    22           sample.  Everything below here is fine file, putting that

    23           into my environment would be actually quite easy to do."  Is

    24           that still your testimony, Mr. Bradner?

    25           A   Yes, and that -- and that's absolutely true and I think

                                                                            69

     1           that's what I just said.  But it makes one assumption, which

     2           I did not state when we talked last week which I did just

     3           state, which is it makes the assumption that anybody

     4           referencing my site would only have a reference to my, quote,

     5           "home page," rather than a more explicitly reference to some

     6           subsection point, which actually in my particular case I know

     7           is not true.  In my particular case some individual vendors

     8           of equipment provide URL's pointing to their results, which

     9           point down inside of my site, bypassing my home page and they

    10           are saying, go and look at this file, which is underneath

    11           this directory, underneath this directory, underneath this

    12           directory, and go look at the results there.  So, yes it is

    13           true that I could modify a -- put in a home page, but that is

    14           only effective if people look at -- are actually stopping at

    15           the home page on the way to what they're looking for and that

    16           may or may not be true.

    17           Q   The concept of coming up with some form of a standard way

    18           to tag or label a warning sign is perfectly reasonable,

    19           correct?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   And it's technically possible, correct?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   Assuming that there was software or browsers in the

    24           marketplace that could read the tag or label in HTML source

    25           code that Web site would be blocked, correct?

                                                                            70

     1           A   Again, it would be blocked if indeed that particular Web

     2           page was one that the browser referenced on its way to the

     3           document that it was seeking.  In my case, I included in my

     4           news column a URL for Flatland and that URL specified the

     5           file which is Flatland's home page, not the file which is the

     6           home page of the library system itself.  So, if I -- if

     7           somebody used the URL that I provided in the column they

     8           would bypass any home page of the entire site and would go

     9           directly to the Flatland file and would not see any tags that

    10           happen to a site-wide tag, because their browser would never

    11           read that page.

    12           Q   You stated in your supplemental declaration filed on

    13           Tuesday at Paragraph 79 that, quote, "To my knowledge no

    14           Internet access software or Worldwide Web browsers are

    15           currently configurable to block material with such tags."  Do

    16           you recall that statement?

    17           A   Yes, I do.

    18           Q   You stated in the deposition that, however, the Netscape

    19           owns the lion's share of the browser market, around 80

    20           percent of the market, correct?

    21           A   I think I stated that Netscape has stated that they own

    22           80 percent of the market.

    23                    (Laughter.)

    24           Q   Last Friday --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And they're not under oath.

                                                                            71

     1                    (Laughter.)

     2           BY MR. BARON:  

     3           Q   Last Friday at your deposition I asked you specifically

     4           how difficult would it be for Netscape to tweak its browser

     5           to understand a tag or a label embedded in a header in HTML

     6           that said adult, was in fact a site that was adult, and you

     7           responded that, quote, "I certainly don't think it would be

     8           an inordinate burden to do something of that form."  You

     9           stand by that statement?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   You also agreed as a matter of technical feasibility that

    12           Microsoft could do the same, correct?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   And programs could be changed at AOL, Compuserve and

    15           Prodigy to do the same, correct?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And Surf Watch and Cyber Patrol and the world of that --

    18           of parental control software, they could change their

    19           software programs to pick up the tags or labels, correct?

    20           A   They can pick -- they can -- software can be changed to

    21           pick up the labels whenever they examine a page that has

    22           labels in it.

    23           Q   Okay, we're going to leave tags and labels.  Let's turn

    24           to directories and registers in cyberspace, particularly on

    25           the Web.  You recall at your deposition that I asked you

                                                                            72

     1           whether you agreed with the statement that many people

     2           believe there should be a white pages directory for the

     3           Internet and you at least conceded that many people do

     4           believe that, correct?

     5           A   Yes, that's correct, I conceded that.

     6           Q   Even if a comprehensive index to the net is impractical

     7           in some sense you surely agree, do you not, Mr. Bradner, that

     8           a white pages subset of cyberspace is technically feasible,

     9           correct?

    10           A   It's more than technically feasible, there are a number

    11           of organizations claiming they are providing just such a

    12           thing.

    13           Q   In fact aren't there, as you said, many neutral places or

    14           sites that exist where URL's can be picked up in a kind of

    15           index or directory, correct?

    16           A   Neutral and non-neutral, yes.

    17           Q   Indeed, you told me last Friday that a URL is a URL is a

    18           URL and that no technical issues are involved in creating

    19           pages which list URL's, correct?

    20           A   That is correct.  That actually is the point I was making

    21           earlier, that if there is a URL pointing to a -- pointing to

    22           the Harvard College Library that -- and we're making the

    23           assumption that we're controlling access by putting PICS-type

    24           tagging in the URL's, it's wherever that URL exists, whether

    25           it's on Harvard-owned machines or anybody else's machine,

                                                                            73

     1           which is where that labeling would have to be done.  And if

     2           there is 10,000 places around the world which have URL's

     3           pointing to Harvard, all of those 10,000 places would have to

     4           rate -- would include the ratings for Harvard in their URL's,

     5           it would not be under Harvard's control to make them do such

     6           a thing.

     7           Q   Aside from indexes or directories, if you have content --

     8            if you are a content provider and you have content you wish

     9           to restrict, for whatever reason, you could call Surf Watch

    10           or other parental-control products to let them know about

    11           your site in cyberspace, correct?

    12           A   We had a long discussion of this last Friday and the

    13           clear statement is yes, of course, I could call Surf Watch

    14           and do so, but Surf Watch would have very little way of

    15           knowing whether I had the authority to make a statement about

    16           a particular site, they would have to have some ability to

    17           resolve that this person had some relationship to the site

    18           that was being spoken of.  So, if I'm a do-gooder and wanted

    19           to talk about some other site I may or may not have the

    20           authority or maybe I'm just trying to be mean to somebody or

    21           they are a competitor of mine, Surf Watch would have to go

    22           through some mechanism to insure that I had the right to

    23           speak of that site.  So, in a true literal sense, sure, I

    24           could call up Surf Watch and say the Reuter (ph.) vendors

    25           think that the information about their products on my site is

                                                                            74

     1           dirty because it paints them in a bad light and you should

     2           block that, I could do that, but I would suspect Surf Watch

     3           would be a little curious as to why -- whether I had the

     4           right to do that.

     5           Q   Well, I'm concentrating on the good-faith actions of

     6           content providers and you have conceded that they could

     7           certainly call Surf Watch -- you can E-mail Surf Watch,

     8           right?

     9           A   I don't know their E-mail address, but I assume that

    10           they're on the net --

    11           Q   You could fax --

    12           A   -- it would be silly if they were not.

    13           Q   You could fax Surf Watch?

    14           A   Again, I don't know their fax number, but I assume you

    15           can.

    16           Q   You could hyperlink Surf Watch from your site, correct?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What would this -- let's get back

    18           to the question and what would it say, if you faxed Surf

    19           Watch what is your question, so we can --

    20                    MR. BARON:  The question is whether a content

    21           provider could take an affirmative action if they had a site

    22           that they wished to block because of whatever reason, for

    23           example, that it was not appropriate for minors, and they

    24           wanted to inform the parental control software companies that

    25           are out there, and Surf Watch is my example, could they take

                                                                            75

     1           an easy, simple action to E-mail, fax, telephone or hyperlink

     2           that parental control software company to let them know that

     3           the site in cyberspace exists, that's what these questions

     4           are.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And your answer is yes?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Except for the last one, hyperlink,

     7           I'm not sure what he means by that.

     8           BY MR. BARON:  

     9           Q   You can just put a click on a Web site and click it to

    10           the Surf Watch and they would -- it would be a link to them.

    11           A   That would bring up Surf Watch's home page, I'm not sure

    12           what that would gain us.

    13           Q   All right.  Well, putting that aside, wouldn't doing any

    14           of these affirmative actions cure the reliability problems

    15           that you yourself have stated with respect to Surf Watch?

    16           A   the reliability problems I believe that you're referring

    17           to are where I said that there was a window of vulnerability,

    18           if a primary method by which one of these blockers is working

    19           is that you have a list of sites which is distributed at some

    20           periodicity to update the local copy of the browser, there is

    21           a window between the time that a site comes on line and the

    22           time the site is discovered and the time that this update

    23           occurs, there's a window of vulnerability wherein Surf Watch

    24           wouldn't block a site that it otherwise would.  And if indeed

    25           there were some reliable methodology for getting a message to

                                                                            76

     1           Surf Watch indicating that this site is a funny site, and I'm

     2           in control of this site and I tell you it's a funny site and

     3           Surf Watch can verify that it's me and all that kind of

     4           thing, then sure, this would allow the window of

     5           vulnerability to be zero.

     6           Q   Let me just, because this is such an important point,

     7           read you what you said last Friday in your deposition and

     8           whether you would still agree, it's on Page 165, Line 10:  "I

     9           feel that there is some reliability problems in terms of

    10           using an exclusion list," that's with respect to parental

    11           control software, "keeping that exclusion list up to date is

    12           the biggest issue.  Until the exclusion systems that I have

    13           seen are updated on a weekly or a monthly basis for their

    14           exclusion lists, and new sites are being generated all the

    15           time, and between the time when a new site is generated and

    16           the time the exclusion list update comes in there is a period

    17           of vulnerability," that's the period you're speaking to

    18           today, correct?

    19           A   Yes.

    20           Q   Okay.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But the technical feasibility is

    22           there?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And the only question is, I gather,

    25           the --

                                                                            77

     1                    MR. BARON:  The lag time.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- comprehensiveness of it?

     3                    MR. BARON:  That's correct, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, and the desire.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And the what?

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And the desire.  I mean, many of the

     7           plaintiffs in this case who some reasonable people might

     8           think are purveying, we'll use the motion picture parlance,

     9           NC-17 say we're not doing that at all, we're giving safe sex

    10           information, okay?  Now, in the questions you're asking

    11           should they advise Mrs. Duvall we're NC-17 even though they

    12           don't think they should?

    13                    MR. BARON:  I am establishing through this --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that what you're getting at?

    15                    MR. BARON:  Your Honor, that's a different legal

    16           issue and it is, I would submit, a legal issue.  I am asking

    17           questions to the witness about a technical issue on the safe

    18           harbor provisions.

    19                    THE COURT:  Okay, fine.

    20           BY MR. BARON:  

    21           Q   Let's turn to another area of cyberspace and I regret

    22           that there's a whole new terminology associated with it --

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, you'll go slow.

    24                    (Laughter.)

    25           BY MR. COGAN:  

                                                                            78

     1           Q   UseNet, what is it?

     2           A   I won't go into the history that I did when we talked

     3           last Friday, suffice it to say, it's a outgrowth of a

     4           distributed bulletin board system that started with computers

     5           calling each other up over the telephone and has migrated to

     6           providing the communication over the Internet.  There's a few

     7           hundred thousand UseNet servers, they're just computers

     8           around the world running UseNet server software.  They

     9           receive news group articles, which are just messages like E-

    10           mail messages, there's a characterization of a news group at

    11           the top of the article.  News group articles are

    12           hierarchically organized, so it's -- one that I happen to

    13           read is rec.autos.sport.F1, because I happen to be a Formula

    14           One car racing fan, and so this is articles about car racing,

    15           about Formula One car racing, and it's put into a separate

    16           directory on the server.  And then as I as a client can -- I

    17           as an observer can fire up a news client, which would then go

    18           off and I could tell it I want it to look at this subset, and

    19           it would show me the articles in the Formula One subsection.

    20           Q   Okay, thank you.  And what is known as NNTP?

    21           A   Network News Transfer Protocol is the language which is

    22           used for the UseNet servers to talk to each other over the

    23           network itself, it's a handshaking mechanism by which a

    24           server tells another server I've got Article Number 1234 from

    25           Site 7, do you want it, and the other server can say yes or

                                                                            79

     1           no.

     2           Q   And what are ISP's?

     3           A   Jumping around in technology a little bit here.  ISP is

     4           the term that was actually coined by the National Science

     5           Foundation, it refers to Internet Service Provider, it's a

     6           company or an organization which is providing connectivity,

     7           Internet connectivity.  It may or may not also include

     8           services such as news services or time services or E-mail

     9           forwarding or things that, but the fundamental service that

    10           it's offering is connectivity, the ability for Internet

    11           protocol packets to get from your local network to out into

    12           the Internet to -- theoretically to some other local network

    13           some place else.

    14           Q   Are there approximately 15,000 global UseNet news groups?

    15           A   There are somewhere -- there is actually probably

    16           considerably more than that news groups, as far as global

    17           news groups, it's a very hard number to determine because it

    18           depends on one's definition.  I ran the news server at

    19           Harvard for a long time and I was getting Japanese news

    20           groups.  Now, I would have stopped them except there were

    21           some people at Harvard who wanted to read the Japanese news

    22           groups, they were in transcribed Japanese, which I couldn't

    23           read at all, it looked like encrypted text to me.  So, there

    24           -- it's hard to define.  I would say that because I was

    25           getting those in Boston and they were being generated in

                                                                            80

     1           Tokyo those are global news groups.  If we're using that kind

     2           of definition there are at least that and probably more, but

     3           I don't know for sure.

     4           Q   Would you say there are approximately 100,000 articles

     5           posted today?

     6           A   That's a reasonable estimate for the ones which go out on

     7           the -- in that set of, quote, "global news groups."

     8           Q   Now, this is a simple question, but how do you post an

     9           article on UseNet?

    10           A   You compose a message, textural message usually on your

    11           UseNet client, which many of the browsers now include, and

    12           you say -- you tell that client which list of news groups you

    13           wish to post it to.  The client then contacts the local

    14           server and says here is an article for news group

    15           rec.sport.autos.F1, and then hands it off to the server.

    16           Q   Is there any difference with moderated news groups in

    17           terms of how an article is posted to UseNet?

    18           A   There is no difference on how it's posted, what happens

    19           after it's posted is different.  In an unmoderated news group

    20           when I do that posting to rec.autos -- rec.auto.sport.F1 my

    21           server would then automatically distribute it to all other

    22           servers which it had a communication with, which is at

    23           Harvard there may be a dozen different servers that it

    24           interacts with, so there would be about a dozen different

    25           computers it would send off this article to.  And they would

                                                                            81

     1           then propagate across the world, servers talking to their

     2           adjacent servers, just distributing it in an ad hoc

     3           interconnection mode, nobody controls that.  In a moderated

     4           news group the posting would then go to my local server and

     5           then on that server it looks up and says, oh, this is a

     6           moderated news group, there is a list of moderators which is

     7           maintained on a few dozen sites which allow -- which would

     8           support the service of providing this forwarding list.  My

     9           server doesn't maintain one now, I used to but I'm no longer

    10           in charge of that server, so I don't do this anymore.  But

    11           the server that I would deal with would then look at it and

    12           say it's a moderated news group, I need to send it off to a

    13           server which contains a list of moderators, so it sends it

    14           off to one of these sites around the country -- around the

    15           world which contain the list.  It would then go -- that site 

    16           would then go through the list, forward this posting, which

    17           is really a textural message in my case, off to the

    18           moderator, which would then do whatever the moderator wanted

    19           to, including just automatically forward it into the news

    20           group or put it in their in box and read it, doing whatever

    21           the moderator wants to do and that would depend on the

    22           moderator, there is no set set of procedures or rules or

    23           software to support moderator functions.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  When I read your direct testimony I

    25           wondered about this, when you say a moderator you mean a two-

                                                                            82

     1           legged, regular person?

     2                    (Laughter.)

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Anybody --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  To wit, a human.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Anybody who is willing to sit through,

     7           in the case of rec.autos.F1 it's now two or 300 messages a

     8           day, anybody who is willing to sit through two or 300

     9           messages a day to decide whether they should be out I

    10           wouldn't necessarily call a regular person, but --

    11                    (Laughter.)

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I guess I asked for that.  Who pays

    13           these people?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  These are -- almost all of these are

    15           voluntary efforts.  There may be -- there are moderated news

    16           groups which are provided by corporations.  For example, a

    17           company building some product may have a moderated news group

    18           which speaks -- talks about that product as a subset of the

    19           news group hierarchy which is specifically for business and

    20           it's a bus., dot, company name, dot, product, and they --

    21           those companies may pay a moderator to cut out redundancies

    22           or to answer the questions that show up in the mailing,

    23           whatever they want to do.  But the vast majority of the

    24           moderators are volunteers.  And there are quite a few

    25           moderated news groups, but the busy ones tend not to be

                                                                            83

     1           because it's just too much of an effort for a volunteer to

     2           do.

     3           BY MR. BARON:  

     4           Q   But to summarize here, the moderator's role is to decide

     5           what messages are forwarded to the news group, correct?

     6           A   That is correct.

     7           Q   Could you describe the term hierarchy as it applies to

     8           the UseNet groups?

     9           A   Hierarchy is just as the -- what I said, that the Formula

    10           One news group is in rec.autos.sport.F1.  Rec. is a

    11           subsection of the news groups which are for recreation, autos

    12           is a subgroup of the recreational, which is dealing with

    13           autos; there's also sky diving and things like that in that

    14           same recreational.  Within autos there's people who want

    15           sports, which is what I'm interested in, but there's also

    16           folks who do restorations of antique cars and there's a

    17           subgroup for them.  And then within the sports category

    18           there's half a dozen or so different categories and the one

    19           that I happen to be interested in is Formula One.  So, the

    20           hierarchy is that listing of -- it's the tree which winds up

    21           with a specific pointer to a specific news group.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's a vehicle by which you

    23           get to precisely that which you're interested in?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  That is in theory the case.  In

    25           practice people are a little less discriminate in what they

                                                                            84

     1           post to news groups than perhaps they should be, but the aim

     2           is to make it so that the subgroup -- the news group is as

     3           closely focused on the topic you're interested in as

     4           possible.  When I first started out doing this news group

     5           stuff it was -- rec.autos was the division and in rec.autos

     6           there may be two dozen messages a day.  And then when that

     7           built up so that the volume was high they broke it up into 

     8           -- under autos they put sport and restoration and et cetera

     9           to further subdivide it, in order to try and make it more and

    10           more focused.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But the reliability is dependent

    12           upon whoever is labeling it -- I'm not sure that's the right

    13           word in --

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Posting it.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Posting it, thank you.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Posting.  Whoever puts down on their

    17           browser, when they say post it they write down what news

    18           group it should group -- news group or news groups it should

    19           go into and it's entirely dependent on that person making the

    20           correct choice, that is correct.

    21           BY MR. BARON:  

    22           Q   So, let me just try to recap that.  You said that some

    23           individuals might post indiscriminately to news groups that

    24           are sort of off-topic, but the point is that the individual

    25           poster controls where he or she will post the article to

                                                                            85

     1           whatever the UseNet group is of the 15,000 --

     2           A   That's correct.

     3           Q   -- and all of the hierarchies therein?

     4                    We discussed the K-12 hierarchy in our -- last

     5           Friday, could you just tell the Court what a K-12 hierarchy

     6           is?

     7           A   I know about the K-12 hierarchy only because they started

     8           -- they started it up at a time when I was running the

     9           Harvard news server, it's a sub-hierarchy that's specifically

    10           designed for people in the kindergarten through 12th grade

    11           with specific classes or specific topics.  K-12, dot, one was

    12           for the first grade and they had topics relevant either to

    13           teachers or to students within first grade.

    14           Q   Could you describe for the Court what the difference

    15           between the alt. hierarchy and the other hierarchy is?

    16           A   Alt. hierarchy is the one which is, let's say, more --

    17           more traditional in the Internet sense of chaos.  The other

    18           hierarchies, the rec. hierarchy, the science hierarchy, the -

    19           - there's a few dozen, K-12 hierarchy, et cetera, are

    20           hierarchies where there is an agreement amongst the people

    21           running the servers, on the main servers that they will have

    22           a controlled method for creating new news groups.  And the

    23           controlled method is that somebody proposes a news group to a

    24           particular news group, which is about discussing proposing

    25           new news groups, and it's discussed on there and if there's

                                                                            86

     1           enough support indicated by E-mail to the proposer that this

     2           particular news group should exist then the proposer can put

     3           in a news group creation request, which will then propagate

     4           across the net.  One of the things that happens is there is a

     5           few places which maintain lists of, quote, "legitimate news

     6           groups" within different hierarchies and these lists are

     7           periodically posted to UseNet, to the UseNet as another

     8           article.  The UseNet software can be configured to

     9           automatically review that list of legitimate news groups and

    10           delete any non-legitimate news groups, any news groups which

    11           do not appear in this list.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What would be a non-legitimate news

    13           group then, just because it doesn't appear?

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's considered irrelevant?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  It's -- the structure is that, let's

    16           say, I wanted to create a news group on rec.auto.sport.F2,

    17           which is Formula Two.  Well, there doesn't happen to be a lot

    18           of Formula Two activity these days.  And after some

    19           discussion on the group -- on the new group list it was

    20           determined there isn't much support for that, and I go create

    21           it anyway, then the maintainer of the official list would

    22           say, well, that didn't get enough support, it didn't go

    23           through the right process to get that news group created, so

    24           that's an illegitimate news group, so I won't put it on the

    25           check list that goes out periodically.  So then automatically

                                                                            87

     1           when this check list goes out, some sites have set it up to

     2           automatically delete those unapproved news groups, others

     3           send mail to the news group operator or whatever.  Alt. news

     4           groups do not have somebody who is maintaining that list of,

     5           quote, "legitimate," which means that news group are created

     6           ad hoc-ly by anybody, literally anybody in the hierarchy. 

     7           So, there is a news group that's alt., dot, Swedish, dot, f,

     8           dot, borg, dot, borg, dot, borg, dot, borg, which I kept

     9           trying to remove, but it kept coming back.  But there's

    10           nobody making any kind of check as to what -- any kind of

    11           list of what is a legitimate one.  So, the alt. hierarchy is

    12           the old chaos of the Internet, free-will kind of hierarchy.

    13                    MR. BARON:  It might be helpful to look at an

    14           exhibit, if you would turn to Defendant's Exhibit 10 and see

    15           what we're talking about in terms of the alt. hierarchy.

    16           BY MR. BARON:  

    17           Q   I concentrate on the last two pages of this exhibit.  The

    18           exhibit is from something called the Internet Yellow Pages,

    19           Second Edition; you've seen that book, haven't you, Mr.

    20           Bradner?

    21           A   You showed me this same thing last week and I have seen

    22           earlier editions of this publication.

    23           Q   Would it be fair to say that within the alt. hierarchy

    24           there's an alt. binaries sub-hierarchy?

    25           A   That's one of many in the alt. hierarchy, yes.

                                                                            88

     1           Q   And there's an alt. sex sub-hierarchy

     2           A   That's correct?

     3           Q   Any particular ISP can decide whether to include the alt.

     4           sex hierarchy or the alt. binaries hierarchy, correct?

     5           A   This was a question that you asked me last week and I

     6           maintained that you were using the term ISP incorrectly in

     7           this context.  Any operator of a news server can determine

     8           what news groups that that news server will and will not

     9           maintain -- will and will not accept, and will and will not

    10           maintain.  Some ISP's run news servers, some ISP's do not run

    11           news servers.  So, to say that an ISP does this is an

    12           incorrect characterization, a news server operator can make

    13           that choice.

    14           Q   Okay.  Could you tell the Court what binary files are?

    15           A   Binary is the computer jargon for a bit pattern which is

    16           used to represent any one of a number of things, for example

    17           an executable program, if you want a new helper AP, a new

    18           thing which draws pretty pictures on your screen when the

    19           screen is supposed to be idle, a screen saver, there are

    20           binary programs available to do that, you download them.  In

    21           actuality UseNet only transmits printing characters, so in

    22           order to deal with the binary nature, the nature of non-

    23           printing characters, because the actual executables in the

    24           computer are stored in a eight-bit bit pattern which turns

    25           into gibberish when you try and print it, they actually

                                                                            89

     1           translate each eight-bit character into two printing

     2           characters and then retranslate it back into -- you can

     3           retranslate it back into a printing -- into a binary pattern

     4           at your local site, on your local client.

     5           Q   Just to be clear, can binary files include graphical

     6           image files, and I'm using that in the lower-case sense of

     7           the term?

     8           A   Binary files can be, as you pointed out before when you

     9           were talking about URL's, they can include graphics files,

    10           motion pictures, sound, program -- pieces of program, sub-

    11           routines, but it can be -- you can get your voice mail via E-

    12           mail by including it in a binary file.

    13           Q   Individuals can post binary files to any UseNet news

    14           group, correct?

    15           A   In -- anybody can post --

    16           Q   Other than moderated groups, I don't mean it to be a

    17           trick question, I'm sorry.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean you'll let him know when

    19           you do?

    20                    MR. BARON:  Right.

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I was going to catch you on that

    23           anyway.  Anybody can post any file to any news group; if it

    24           is moderated, the moderator can control what goes in there. 

    25           All files look the same, because they -- as long as they have

                                                                            90

     1           the formatted point at the top, the formatted text at the top

     2           indicating a news group name and an article I.D., then

     3           they're in the correct format and the news servers know how

     4           to deal with them.  The contents after that just look like

     5           printing characters, some of which are -- have sense to them

     6           and some of them don't, the ones that are binary tend not to. 

     7           But so do the ones, for example, that are slightly distorted

     8           in order to make them not easily -- not trivially readable

     9           because it's, I don't know, a dirty joke or something, they

    10           have a very simple encrypting mechanism called Rot 13 or

    11           Rotate 13, it comes from one of the ciphers that Caesar used,

    12           as I recall.  You just substitute its -- you take every

    13           letter in the alphabet and take the 13th one in a round trip

    14           -- or further along in the alphabet.  And, so, that looks

    15           like gibberish too, but in actuality it's a one-character-

    16           per-one-character substitution.

    17           Q   But it's an encryption scheme?

    18           A   It's an encryption scheme.

    19           Q   Let me -- forgive me if I'm being redundant, but you can

    20           also post graphical image files to any UseNet group, correct?

    21           A   I think I just said that.

    22           Q   Okay.  Therefore, one makes a conscious choice when you

    23           post graphical image files or binary files whether you're

    24           going to post them to the alt. sex hierarchy, the alt.

    25           binaries hierarchy or any other place on UseNet, correct?

                                                                            91

     1           A   Just as one makes a choice when posting any article.

     2           Q   Okay, thank you.  

     3                    May we turn to Defendant's Exhibit 12?

     4                    (Pause.)

     5           Q   Do you recall my showing you this exhibit on Friday?

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   Could you best characterize this, maybe you can do it

     8           better than I as to what this sort of artificial construct

     9           represents in terms of header information in UseNet?

    10           A   It represents the basic UseNet header, which is present

    11           on all UseNet news messages -- articles, plus some things

    12           which are not in the basic.  The ones labeled "mime version"

    13           and "content type" and "content transferring coding" and "X

    14           mailer" are ones which are not part of the basic set that's

    15           part of UseNet, it's the UseNet format itself.  The others,

    16           the path is the sequence of computers that this article went

    17           through, and that path can be 30 or 40 or 50 computers long;

    18           the from is the stated name and E-mail address of the source

    19           of the message; the news groups is the list of news groups

    20           that the message was for; the date is the date; organization

    21           is the stated organization of the poster; the message I.D. is

    22           an important thing, because it is what is used to

    23           undifferentiate two messages which otherwise may look the

    24           same and make sure that messages don't loop around in the

    25           network forever, a data base is maintained of message I.D.'s

                                                                            92

     1           which is relative to -- the message I.D. includes the source

     2           post's name, so Message 13 from this host is not repetitively

     3           posted to the news group accidentally.  And the NNTP posting

     4           host is also not part of the original basic code, it's

     5           something that was added when NNTP came into play.

     6           Q   Can we just hold that as a place holder here and explain

     7           for the Court what a news reader is?

     8           A   A news reader is a piece of client software that -- in

     9           current environment most of them go off and speak NNTP to a

    10           news server, a UseNet server.

    11           Q   Am I correct that some news readers are embedded in

    12           browsers?

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   And some news readers have the ability to do what you

    15           term threading, i.e. they follow articles based on the

    16           subject line of the posting, correct?

    17           A   That's correct.

    18           Q   Back to this exhibit, in theory an enhanced protocol for

    19           UseNet could include an extra line which essentially embeds

    20           content information, correct?

    21           A   Yes.

    22           Q   Thank you.

    23                    Let me turn more quickly to other applications on

    24           the Internet.  You have described IRC, could you explain for

    25           the Court what Internet Relay Chat is?

                                                                            93

     1           A   Internet Relay Chat is a way by which if I type on my

     2           keyboard it can appear on the screens of many people around

     3           the world simultaneously, and when they type on their

     4           keyboards it appears on my screen and other screens.

     5           Q   I just have one question for you, Mr. Bradner:  There are

     6           moderators or channel operators on IRC, correct?

     7           A   In some cases there are, in other cases there are not.

     8           Q   And those are human moderators, human channel operators,

     9           correct?

    10           A   The only ones that I know of are.

    11           Q   Okay.

    12           A   Some I have question about, but...

    13                    (Laughter.)

    14           Q   All right, let's move to List Serves, could you explain

    15           briefly for the Court what they are?

    16           A   List Serve is a -- actually a product name, it would be

    17           better to refer to it as an E-mail exploder.  You send E-mail

    18           to a piece of software which then re-sends this piece of E-

    19           mail to a list of recipients, that list can be quite

    20           extensive.  The ones I run on my local machine, I have an E-

    21           mail exploder for one of the IETF working groups, it has two

    22           or 300 -- maybe it's 180 now, I pruned it a little recently,

    23           different addresses that I have -- any message sent to that

    24           address, BMWG at Harvard, dot, EDU will be in turn forwarded

    25           to this list of addresses.  List Serve is a particular

                                                                            94

     1           product that implements this kind of E-mail exploder.  It has

     2           some fancy features because it can deal with -- it can talk

     3           with other List Serves over the network and some con --

     4           regulation of what's -- which -- who -- which exploder has

     5           which addresses to forward to.  But basically what you really

     6           mean is an E-mail exploder.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  So, once again, it's a vehicle by

     8           which one expands the recipients without the sender -- or the

     9           source necessarily knowing where it's going?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Specifically that is the case.

    11           BY MR. BARON:  

    12           Q   I just have one question, Mr. Bradner:  There are

    13           moderators on List Serves or E-mail exploders, correct?

    14           A   I would say on the majority of them there are not.

    15           Q   But there are some?

    16           A   There are some.  I actually currently, personally do not

    17           deal with any E-mail exploders that do happen to have

    18           moderators, all of the ones that I deal with are ones where I

    19           send mail to the exploder itself and it just forwards it.  A

    20           moderator, I would send the mail to the moderator and then

    21           the moderator would in turn send it to the exploder list.  I

    22           don't happen to deal with any, I know that some exist.  All

    23           of the ones in the IETF, for example, for all of the working

    24           groups are unmoderated.

    25           Q   Let's turn to E-mail and I just have one question:  It's

                                                                            95

     1           true, is it not, that some E-mail user agents allow you to

     2           separate out the mail based on the source of the message, the

     3           subject line of the message or a combination of those,

     4           correct?

     5           A   That is correct.

     6           Q   Have you heard of Eudora?

     7           A   Yes, I have.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's that?

     9                    MR. BARON:  Eudora.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As in wealthy?

    11                    (Laughter.)

    12           BY MR. BARON:  

    13           Q   You have an extensive background in FTP, file transfer

    14           protocol, correct?

    15           A   I'm not sure that it's an honor to say that, but, yes.

    16           Q   You told me that last Friday.  Conceptually, it is

    17           possible to block access to an FTP site, is it not, on an a

    18           priori basis by means of a password, correct?

    19           A   Yes, if FTP is a way that I can sit at a client and ask

    20           to access to a server, an FTP server, and there are two ways

    21           to do that:  One is what is called anonymous FTP, by which I

    22           give the log name anonymous when asked for my log name, my

    23           user name, and then I give my name as a password just to

    24           indicate for tracing purposes who I am, but of course that

    25           depends on who I say I am.  This is the way that a huge

                                                                            96

     1           percentage of the large data files, including for example the

     2           version of Flatland that I referred to earlier and all of the

     3           material on my machine are provided, they're provided by FTP. 

     4           There is an alternate way, which is if I don't want to

     5           provide general access to some files then I can -- I can

     6           restrict that access to a password -- a user name and

     7           password protected, just as I restrict access to my local

     8           computer to people with -- that I have given accounts on the

     9           local computer to.

    10           Q   The FTP protocol was standardized through the IETF RFC

    11           process, correct?

    12           A   It was standardized very, very early, I wouldn't say that

    13           it was -- it was standardized early on, so I'm not sure that

    14           you could characterize it as going -- it definitely didn't go

    15           through the proposed and draft and full standard kind of

    16           process, it was one of the very first protocols on the

    17           Internet a long time ago.  So, it way predates my

    18           involvement, so I couldn't speak with expertise on exactly

    19           how it was standardized, but my guess is some people got --

    20           sat down and said this is the way we're going to do it and,

    21           bingo, that's the way it was going to get done.

    22           Q   Now, let me switch gears here.  You told me last Friday

    23           that at Harvard there are many individuals who download to

    24           older versions of Netscape browsers for free, correct?

    25           A   They download the version that is free.

                                                                            97

     1           Q   Okay.  You stated last Friday in your deposition that the

     2           Internet is, quote, "becoming pervasive," unquote, do you

     3           stand by that statement?

     4           A   And by pervasive I mean omnipresent, it is available

     5           anyplace.  I can call from my hotel room, which I did this

     6           morning, and log in to read my E-mail.  Soon I will be able

     7           to plug into a jack in the wall and identify myself and have

     8           Internet connectivity in the hotel room.  So, it is avail --

     9           it will be -- it's becoming available wherever I want to go

    10           in and plug in and ask -- and identify myself -- connect to

    11           my home computer and then identify myself to the home

    12           computer with a log name password combination.  And in that

    13           con -- the context in which I said pervasive I meant that it

    14           was becoming omnipresent, an ability for me to get it

    15           wherever I am.

    16           Q   The Internet is also changing, correct?

    17           A   Oh, at least.

    18           Q   You recall that I asked you a visionary question last

    19           Friday, correct?

    20           A   You asked me to make a speech and I did.

    21                    (Laughter.)

    22           Q   And I asked you to discuss with me where you saw the

    23           Internet going in the 21st Century, right?

    24           A   Yes.

    25           Q   And you expressed the view that there is not going to be

                                                                            98

     1           an Internet as we know it today in the year 2000, correct?

     2           A   The year 2000 or shortly thereafter, that's correct.

     3           Q   Let me quote you from the deposition and ask whether you

     4           stand by this statement, you said, I'm quoting your speech,

     5           "Will there" -- it's Page 312, Line 19 -- Line 18, you said

     6           that you were giving a talk.  "Will there be an Internet in

     7           the year 2000?"

     8                    Line 19:  "My conclusion is that in the year 2000 or

     9           shortly thereafter there will not be an Internet and by that

    10           I mean the Internet of today, that which people see and

    11           understand as the Internet is a differentiable data service. 

    12           It's something that you see that is different than your

    13           television service, it's different than your telephone

    14           service, it's different than your fax service, it's a

    15           different thing than what you have, what you use for doing

    16           other functions.  I believe that in the year 2000 or shortly

    17           thereafter we will have a unified general data service.  In

    18           certain parts of the country already we have had a crossover

    19           between the amount of information carried as voice for the

    20           voice telephone network and the amount of information carried

    21           as data."

    22                    And skipping down to Line 20:  "This will become

    23           universal in the U.S. within the next half dozen years and

    24           there won't be something that you would say that's the

    25           Internet."

                                                                            99

     1                    Do you stand by those statements?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   Thank you, Mr. Bradner.  

     4                    MR. BARON:  I have no more questions.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But this unified general data

     6           service would act in similar ways that you have described

     7           both this morning and in your declaration, would it not?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  And what I meant by saying what

     9           I did was that right now you go and you go and buy telephone

    10           connection and telephone service from this vendor, and you go

    11           and you buy your cable service from that vendor, and you may

    12           go buy your electric utility from some other vendor, I

    13           predict in the future that you won't be able to differentiate

    14           between vendors, you will have a pipe into the house or maybe

    15           competition for pipes into the house and you plug this

    16           instrument onto it, onto this pipe and you get telephone and

    17           you plug this instrument onto the pipe and you get cable T.V.

    18           and you plug this instrument onto the pipe and you get

    19           whatever is the successor to the Web.  And I believe there's

    20           a successor to the Web, I don't know what it is, but I

    21           believe that there will be some other way, some additional

    22           ways for a user to find things and interact with services

    23           around the globe and, in particular, doing that in a way

    24           which -- right now a great deal of the Internet is dependent

    25           on the voluntary efforts of individuals to provide material

                                                                           100

     1           and I believe that in the long run that this -- the

     2           facilitating of this global, global and ubiquitous data

     3           service, one of the facilitating factors would be mechanisms

     4           for making it economically reasonable for content providers

     5           to provide content.  That -- it's a real mixed bag though, I

     6           mean, one of the big things about a universal service like

     7           this is that it doesn't get controlled very easily.  So,

     8           those environments where governments would like to control

     9           content, for example Singapore and China both have announced

    10           recently that they are working on figuring out ways to

    11           control content that their citizens can get over the net,

    12           over the Internet, the current Internet, this is a very big

    13           threat to that kind of their perception of what the social

    14           order should be.  And I see this -- the Internet of the

    15           future being both a combination of a promise of tremendous

    16           reachability of availability of knowledge, availability of

    17           interaction, people interacting with people, and a threat to

    18           -- perceived threat to the ability to control what citizenry

    19           get, and that it is the balance between the perception of

    20           that threat and the reaction to the perception of that threat

    21           and the promise.  I personally would rather focus in on the

    22           promise.

    23                    MR. BARON:  Thank you.

    24                    (Discussion held off the record.)

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thought that we would

                                                                           101

     1           break now before you begin your redirect, to give you the

     2           opportunity to catch your breaths.

     3                    MR. MORRIS:  Your Honor, that would be fine.  We

     4           have a somewhat unexpected scheduling problem, both the

     5           Government and we anticipated that Mr. Bradner's testimony

     6           would take a much shorter time than it has now.  Mr. 

     7           Bradner -- 

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We didn't anticipate that.

     9                    (Laughter.)

    10                    MR. MORRIS:  Mr. Bradner has a very important

    11           meeting relating to some international protocols

    12           negotiations, he -- in Washington, D.C. late this afternoon. 

    13           He would absolutely be able to return first thing in the

    14           morning and, if it would be acceptable to the Court and the

    15           Government, we would suggest that we break for lunch and ask

    16           Mr. Bradner to return first thing in the morning.

    17                    THE COURT:  Is that congenital to the Government?

    18                    MR. BARON:  In theory, your Honor, it would be

    19           acceptable, but depending on the length of the questioning,

    20           it may be just for a few minutes and therefore it can be

    21           done.

    22                    THE COURT:  Well, what's your anticipation, Mr.

    23           Morris?

    24                    MR. MORRIS:  I think we probably would only go for

    25           15 or 20 minutes.  I don't know how many questions the Court

                                                                           102

     1           might have...

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning?

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's fine.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I will have some questions.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right with you?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that all right with you?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay?

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Even if you come back to lovely

    12           Philadelphia just for 15 minutes, you don't mind?

    13                    (Laughter.)

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's on the way to Harvard.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will resume at 1:30.

    17                    (Luncheon recess taken at 12:10 o'clock p.m.)

     1           might have...

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning?

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's fine.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  The Court thinks tomorrow morning.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I will have some questions.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right with you?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We will resume at 1:30.

    17                    (Luncheon recess taken at 12:10 o'clock p.m.)

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's now time to say good

    19           afternoon.

    20                    ALL:  Good afternoon.

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Judge Sloviter, my name is Bruce Ennis. 

    22           I'm counsel for the ALA plaintiffs.  We wish to call as our

    23           second witness Ann Duvall, the president of Surfwatch

    24           Software, Incorporated.

    25                    Before I do that, may I take care of one brief

                                                                           103

     1           housekeeping matter?  I'd like to move into evidence the

     2           plaintiffs' exhibits, which was filed a few days ago, and to

     3           which the Government did not object.  That would be the ACLU

     4           Exhibit Numbers 1 through 67, and the ALA plaintiff Exhibit

     5           Numbers 200 through 289.

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  We call --

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Accepted.

    10                    MR. ENNIS:  Thank you, your Honor.

    11                    (Whereupon ACLU Exhibit Numbers 1 through 67 and ALA

    12           Plaintiff Exhibit Numbers 200 through 289 were admitted into

    13           evidence.)

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We call Ann Duvall.

    15                    THE CLERK:  Would you please state and spell your

    16           name for the record?

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Ann Duvall, A-N-N, D-U-V-A-L-L.

    18                    ANN DUVALL, Sworn.

    19                    THE CLERK:  Thank you.  Please be seated.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Does the Government concede the

    21           expertise of this witness?

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  In the area she's proffered for.

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We conceded only in the area that

    24           she is proffered for.  I do expect to have some questions

    25           with respect to technical issues that would clarify the

                                                                           104

     1           matter.  

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you.

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honors, at this point, I would move

     5           the admission into evidence of the declaration of Ann Duvall,

     6           previously filed.  It was sworn to on March 19th of this

     7           year, as her trial testimony.

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  It is accepted.  

    10                    (Whereupon the declaration of Ann Duvall was

    11           admitted into evidence.)

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are we on mike?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  You can hear us, can't you?

    14                    ALL:  Yes.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, we can be heard anyway.

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  As the Court is aware, Mrs. Duvall is

    17           going to demonstrate for the Court some uses of the computer

    18           in an interactive computer system.  

    19                    Briefly, she is going to demonstrate how you can

    20           access the Internet and move around in the Internet.  And

    21           then she is going to demonstrate how parents can use software

    22           technology, which would make it possible for parents to view

    23           whatever they want on the Internet, and yet for parents to

    24           block or filter material they consider inappropriate for

    25           their children.

                                                                           105

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  That's at least a thesis on

     2           which she's going to testify.

     3                    MR. ENNIS:  That's the objective, your Honor.  

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  She -- the testimony will take

     6           approximately 30 minutes, and I wish to emphasize that

     7           because the point of the demonstration is to explain how this

     8           works, if there are any questions from the Court at any

     9           point, please feel free to interrupt and ask.

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think the Court is not bashful.

    11                    (Laughter)

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  Thank you, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  As you may have detected.  Did you

    14           want the lights down?

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  Your screens would flicker less if

    16           we turn off just the fluorescent lights.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  I think that's about to take

    18           place.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Now, does counsel have -- oh, you

    20           have it up there?

    21                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.  I don't have a monitor, and I

    22           might need at some point, to approach the witness, if that

    23           would be acceptable.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it's all right with the witness,

    25           it's all right with the Court.

                                                                           106

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Good afternoon, your Honors.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Good afternoon.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  I'd like to take and spend some time

     4           with you exploring a little of the Internet, and putting in

     5           front of you, something you can see that will perhaps explain

     6           some of the very technical explanations that you saw this

     7           morning.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Uh-huh.

     9                    THE WITNESS:  I'm going to start at a very basic

    10           level, so if I'm repeating things that you already know,

    11           please forgive me.  But please feel free to ask questions, if

    12           you have any, along the way.

    13                    Before a parent can connect to the Internet, they

    14           have to purchase a computer.  That's the first place that a

    15           parent makes a decision about whether or not they want their

    16           child to see things on the Internet.  

    17                    The computer I'm going to be using this afternoon is

    18           a MacIntosh computer.  It actually -- the actual computer is

    19           sitting right there on the floor, inside the little box

    20           there.  And -- I can point to that?  Right.  It's inside the

    21           little box.

    22                    That is actually a portable computer.  And when I

    23           leave this computer, I can actually remove the whole computer

    24           from this set up, so that the child wouldn't have any access

    25           at all to the computer, if that's how I chose to set up my

                                                                           107

     1           home with this portable computer.  So it's another way I can

     2           make a decision to choose what my child sees on the Internet.

     3                    Many computers have keys and locks that you actually

     4           can use to lock up a computer.  Before you can actually turn

     5           it on, you have to have a key to open it.  And so that's

     6           another parental control that you can use when you're using a

     7           computer.

     8                    Now I'm going to go ahead and turn my computer on by

     9           pushing one button over here, and as it's starting to get

    10           warmed up, another means that I have used often is to have a

    11           private password when my computer starts up.  It's a password

    12           that I know, that I have to type in, in order for this

    13           computer to begin and to actually boot up as they call it.

    14                    So as we're waiting for this to start, you will see

    15           that a screen will come on, and I want to make sure you all

    16           have a blank white screen right now?

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.  Yes.  

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  It says, Welcome to MacIntosh? 

    19           Okay.  

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  At least two members of the panel

    21           are MacIntosh friendly.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Oh.  Good.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I can't say I'm friendly.  I'm

    24           there.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  So as this computer begins to start,

                                                                           108

     1           there will come a point where it will stop, actually

     2           starting, and ask me for my private password, which I need to

     3           type in from my keyboard, which is right now.  So I type that

     4           word in, and then it will continue to load.  

     5                    Once the parents -- just because a parent has bought

     6           a computer, doesn't necessarily mean they're connected to the

     7           Internet automatically.  You can buy computers to do word

     8           processing, or whatever.  But in order to connect to the

     9           Internet, you must purchase additional hardware and software. 

    10           You probably have to buy a modem that will allow you actually

    11           to make that connection to the Internet.

    12                    Once you've bought the modem, then you need to find

    13           your ISP, which Mr. Bradner mentioned this morning, your

    14           Internet Service Provider, which is the person who will

    15           provide that connectivity to the Internet.  

    16                    Most homes use modems.  I happen to be connected

    17           here, this afternoon, with a special line that was brought

    18           into the courthouse, called a T1 line.  That's a kind of a

    19           line that a lot of businesses tend to use today.  But in most

    20           homes, they use modems and what's called a dial up

    21           connection.

    22                    Once I've established my modem and my connection, I

    23           still need some software that will allow me to view the

    24           Internet and to connect to the Internet, software that Mr.

    25           Bradner mentioned this morning.

                                                                           109

     1                    I'm going to take a little tour right now of the

     2           Worldwide Web, which is one section of the Internet.  It's

     3           the most popular, fastest growing, the one I think that

     4           children use the most often today.

     5                    In order to see the Worldwide Web, I need what's

     6           called a browser, which we talked about quite a bit this

     7           morning.  I have a choice of many different browsers, one of

     8           which is Spy Glass Mosaic, the other which is Netscape

     9           browser.  

    10                    I'm going to use Netscape this morning.  And the way

    11           I start it up is I move my mouse to the center of the

    12           application.  By double clicking, it will 

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I stop you here?  Do you have

    14           to buy these browsers, or does one ordinarily have to buy

    15           these browsers in order to install them?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Many times when you actually go to an

    17           Internet Service Provider, they will, as part of the package,

    18           provide you with a browser.  But most of the browsers have

    19           been available, free.  What happens in the future is somewhat

    20           difficult to determine.  But now, you can get most of them

    21           free over the Internet.

    22                    So I am now connected to the Internet.  And when you

    23           first start up a browser, you go to what's called your home

    24           page.  And each person can have their own individual home

    25           page.  My home page happens to the home page for the company

                                                                           110

     1           Surfwatch, which gives you information about our company. 

     2           This piece of information is actually located on a computer

     3           in California, on what's called our server.  But I actually

     4           can view this information here, in Philadelphia.  

     5                    At the same time I'm viewing this information,

     6           thousands of people could also be viewing the same piece of

     7           information on their computers in their homes or their

     8           offices.  

     9                    The -- this is the Netscape area that we're looking

    10           at.  And what you're looking at up top on this bar -- does my

    11           mouse move back and forth on your screen also?

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, it does. 

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Very clear.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Are some commands that I perhaps may

    16           be using later on.  But this bar down below is really a fun

    17           place to go to.  It always gives you access to What's New and

    18           What's Cool, according to Netscape on the Internet.  So let's

    19           go -- the way I can go there is just by clicking in the

    20           what's cool area, and depending on how quickly that 

    21           connection will take us there, we will go to the area that's

    22           called What's Cool.

    23                    On the What's Cool page, and I'm going to move the

    24           page up a little bit, it tells me it was last updated on

    25           March 16th, so it's something that's constantly changing.  If

                                                                           111

     1           I move up a little bit, you can see all sorts of short pieces

     2           of description of various places that might have information

     3           I was interested in.  

     4                    And if you notice that the cursor, which is now an

     5           arrow, when I bring it over one of the blue lettered items,

     6           it turns into a little hand.  That means that I can click on

     7           that and go to another location and get that information. 

     8           And I will do that in a minute and show you how that works.

     9                    One of the ways that you can find information on the

    10           Internet is to know the address, to actually know ahead of

    11           time what the location is, where you want to go.  

    12                    Before I came here, I did a little research on

    13           Philadelphia, and I found out the location of a page with

    14           information on Philadelphia.  So if I choose to go there, I

    15           go up under the file menu, select open location, then I type

    16           in the address.  And again, now is the case where I'd have to

    17           use those letters that we learned about this morning,

    18           HTTP:\\WWW.Phila.Com.  And that's the address of the location

    19           I've known about ahead of time.  So I say I'm ready, let's go

    20           there.  

    21                    What I get welcomed to is Philadelphia's Newest Web

    22           Site, the Key to the City.  So if I scroll a little bit

    23           further down, I see that I have three keyholes, one for

    24           business, one for pleasure, and one for service.  So, since

    25           this is mostly business here, I'm going to go to the pleasure

                                                                           112

     1           one right now.

     2                    (Laughter)

     3                    THE WITNESS:  And now I get an even more interesting

     4           picture.  It's a room with many doors, the key to the city. 

     5           I have different kinds of doors here with numbers above it,

     6           and with numbers down below that correspond to the doors.  So

     7           I have the choice of either clicking or actually going.  So I

     8           thought I'd go to the Sports Door, which is actually a locker

     9           room, so I can click right on that door, and it will take me

    10           to some more information.

    11                    So I come to a sports page about Philadelphia, and

    12           if I'm a Phillies fan interested in what the Phillies'

    13           schedule might be, or want to go to the games -- Mmm.  Well,

    14           we just had a little crash of the computer, so... I'm going

    15           to start Netscape up again.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I thought that only happened to me.

    17                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'm going to reboot the

    18           computer.  It didn't happen yesterday.  But that does happen

    19           with computers, so you just kind of start over.

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  While this is happening, are there any

    21           questions the Court has that she could be explaining?

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No.  

    23                    THE WITNESS:  This will take a few minutes again for

    24           it to start up, and it will again ask me for my password, and

    25           then we'll just get back to where we were.

                                                                           113

     1                    (Pause in proceedings.)

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  We'll try it again.  I'm going

     3           to go back into Netscape.  One of the things that -- if

     4           you've actually been to a location, and you know that you

     5           like that location and you want to go back there, you can

     6           actually ask the computer to remember that location, put it

     7           into what's called a bookmark, and so I actually did that the

     8           other day when I was looking in Philadelphia.  So now I can

     9           just go back to the Key to Philadelphia, instead of retyping

    10           the name.  I'm still choosing where I want to go, but I've

    11           also chosen to remember where I've been, so I can return to

    12           that same location.  And we can just repeat the steps that I

    13           did before.  

    14                    MR. ENNIS:  I apologize to the Court.  We've ran

    15           through this twice before, and did not have these

    16           difficulties.  If we might ask a more technical person to

    17           approach here, we might be able to figure --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.  

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    20                    MR. ENNIS:  -- out a way around that.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  By all means.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you need one of ours to help,

    23           we'll send one down.

    24                    MR. ENNIS:  We may, your Honor.  

    25                    (Pause in proceedings.)

                                                                           114

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  While -- while we have a few

     2           minutes, we'll talk to counsel.  We have a motion on behalf

     3           of amici curiae to file --

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I'm sorry.  I didn't hear that, your

     5           Honor.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We have a motion on behalf of the

     7           Author's Guild, et al, to --

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Leave.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- file -- leave to file a brief in

    10           support of plaintiffs' motion.  And I understand there's an

    11           objection by the Government, and if so, I wanted to find out

    12           when you could file your opposition, that's all.

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, maybe I don't have an

    14           objection anymore then, your Honor.  I -- I said that I would

    15           reserve the right to object.  

    16                    My view was consistent with the decision I think

    17           that Judge Dalzell made a few days ago, to not have amicus on

    18           the grounds that counsel for ACLU and for Jenner and Block

    19           (ph) are very well and capably representing the positions of

    20           the plaintiffs.  I thought that -- in fact, I hadn't even

    21           seen that amicus request before.  So that was our

    22           disposition.  If the Court feels otherwise -- I don't think

    23           we want another brief to write.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.  

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Well, then we'll look at it. 

                                                                           115

     1                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Fine.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  I mean we weren't

     3           backpacking --

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We just got it this morning,

     5           ourselves.  

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And we were told that you objected,

     7           and that was the only reason that I thought we'd ask.

     8                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I reserve the right to object,

     9           solely on the basis of what I read in Judge Dalzell's order,

    10           assuming that the Court might not want to consider an amicus

    11           brief for the reasons stated in that order.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.  Well, we're not encouraging

    13           extra briefs either.  We have a lot to read.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Why don't we just defer?

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.  We'll defer ruling on

    16           it.  

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Okay.  Thank you.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  And maybe at some point, you

    19           can tell us orally, if you have any basis to object, so you

    20           won't have to write another brief. 

    21                    THE WITNESS:  We'll try again.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  I don't know whether there's something

    24           about the Philadelphia Phillies that doesn't want me to go

    25           there --

                                                                           116

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  -- so I'm going to move on.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL;  They had a tough year last year.

     4                    (Laughter)

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Try the ballet.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Maybe put arts.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  One of the really practical ways that

     8           I actually used the Internet yesterday when we were setting

     9           up, is someone was here and wanted to fax something back to

    10           the hotel, and we were able to use the Internet, the Key to

    11           Philadelphia, find the location of the hotel and the fax

    12           number, and fax something off.  So there's some very

    13           practical applications.

    14                    Another thing that you might possibly do if you were

    15           wanting to go to some other location, if you had a trip to

    16           Paris planned, you might want to get some information about

    17           the Louvre before you went there.  So you could also know the

    18           address of that location, and type it in.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This is the address of the Louvre?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Pardon?

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  This is the address of the Louvre

    22           you're putting?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Of the Louvre, right.

    24                    (Pause in proceedings.)

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  And now this will take me to   

                                                                           117

     1           -- I typed it incorrectly -- to information about the Louvre. 

     2           So it really begins to show you the global nature of the

     3           Internet and how you can just travel all places in different

     4           parts of the world.

     5                    Now sometimes it takes a while to get things.  We

     6           happen to be using the Internet at a time when all of

     7           California has awakened and is on the Internet, and the East

     8           Coast is still using the Internet, so sometimes it takes a

     9           little while to get -- get places.  I'll try again.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Because it's going to France now.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  I believe it's going. 

    12           It actually -- I assume that the origin of this is in Paris,

    13           although I actually don't know.  Sometimes they have sites

    14           where they keep pieces of the information in different       

    15           areas -- 

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Right.  

    17                    THE WITNESS:  -- so it actually could be accessing a

    18           computer that I don't know exactly where the location is.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A question I had for our witness

    20           this morning which I'll have to wait until tomorrow about,

    21           right?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not getting there, so let me try

    23           one more time.  

    24                    (Pause in proceedings.)

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Well, let's -- another place that I

                                                                           118

     1           had actually looked at to go beforehand was to the museums of

     2           London.  Let's see if we can get to London instead of to

     3           Paris right now. 

     4                    Okay.  So Paris was busy, and now we've gone to

     5           London, so -- and this gives you a list of the various

     6           museums of London, and if I followed one of these links, I

     7           would then be able to get information about what was being

     8           shown.  So if I go to say, the National Gallery, it would

     9           show me what exhibits were being shown, or some information

    10           about the National Gallery, so...

    11                    Now, when I've chosen to go to these places, it's

    12           because I've known the location that I want to go to. 

    13           Sometimes you don't know where you want to go, or where the

    14           information is, and you need to use one of the search engines

    15           that I think Mr. Bradner mentioned this morning.

    16                    An example of that is last year, my daughter, who is

    17           a freshman in high school, had to do a report on the Fragile

    18           X Syndrome.  And our encyclopedia didn't have anything about,

    19           and it was Sunday night, with the report due Monday.  So

    20           access to libraries was a big limited.  

    21                    So we sat down at the computer together, and we went

    22           and used one of the search engines.  There are a number of

    23           different search engines that are available.  

    24                    The one that we're going to use this morning is

    25           called Infoseek.  And it gives you information.  It says

                                                                           119

     1           search for information about, so I type in Fragile X, and I

     2           say search now.  What I'm going to get is -- it's going to go

     3           out in its database and find me citations, much like a card

     4           catalogue, of what matches Fragile X.  If I look over here on

     5           the right, I can see these citations.  It tells me there's a

     6           research foundation newsletter, and if I scroll up a little

     7           more, there's actually something that says, what is Fragile

     8           X.  If I follow that link, I can then get some information

     9           about the Fragile X Syndrome.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now this search engine that you

    11           have, do you pay for that, or does that come as part of your

    12           package?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  That's part of -- they're -- they're

    14           sort of built into the Internet as part of the browser.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The Netscape browser.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  The Netscape browser.  So there I have

    17           information about Fragile X, and it was the jumping off point

    18           for her to do her report.  

    19                    In fact, in one of the places that we found some

    20           research, there was actually an E Mail address of someone

    21           that was doing current research in that area.  And she had

    22           the opportunity to E Mail this person, who was not located in

    23           our area, to get information about the Fragile X Syndrome.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mrs. Duvall, do we know from this,

    25           where this is from?

                                                                           120

     1                    THE WITNESS:  No.  I don't know where this is coming

     2           from.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And is there any way we could find

     4           out -- you know, for -- if we wanted to cite it?  That is to

     5           say, if your daughter wanted to cite it --

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Right.  

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- in her paper, what would she put?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Well, she would probably put this

     9           Internet address.  But I would also look a little further, to

    10           see if there were any -- I'd probably go back to the Fragile

    11           Research Foundation home page, and see if they had some

    12           information about it.  So you have to travel around a little

    13           bit.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do -- do that, would you?  Would    

    15           you --

    16                    THE WITNESS:  I think she actually cited the

    17           Internet as her reference, and I think --

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would you surf to that home page?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Sure.  Okay.  Here I also look up     

    20           -- here I say the reference section includes several texts on

    21           educational strategy, so there is probably a reference

    22           section in addition, that will give me some quotations.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But somebody -- but somebody has

    24           compiled this --

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.

                                                                           121

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- for this purpose.  

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  This isn't word for word from some

     4           publication that -- I think that maybe Judge Dalzell's

     5           question also, that appears somewhere.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  That's my understanding. 

     7           Someone has compiled this.  If there has been something that

     8           is actual citation, such as I believe Mr. Bradner mentioned,

     9           the Homeland, then it would give credit to the place that it

    10           had come from.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, maybe the Fragile Foundation

    12           put it on, because --

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Right.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- it has here, what is Fragile X.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Uh-huh.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So presumably, that's what you just

    17           had on your screen.

    18                    THE WITNESS:  That's right.  That's a link back to

    19           the page that I just saw.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's a link.  You could just   

    21           -- we could just test that right now.

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  And that would take me back to

    23           where -- probably where I just was.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  Now we know.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Okay.  Now, these are things

                                                                           122

     1           that I've done, sort of, with my 15 year old.  There's also  

     2           -- many parents that are getting on line with younger

     3           children that have some concerns about letting their children

     4           roam freely on the Internet, they'd like to have some

     5           information about sites that were perhaps geared a little bit

     6           more towards children.  

     7                    And one of the search engines that's out there is

     8           called Yahoo, and they've just created a new site called

     9           Yahooligans.  So if we go take a visit to -- just make sure I

    10           spell it right -- will take us to a site called Yahooligans. 

    11           And as this comes up, you can see that it's really -- the

    12           content is really geared for younger children -- pictures and

    13           science and oddities, and art soup, things like that.  So

    14           these are the kinds of new content that's been coming up

    15           that's really available for young -- for young children to

    16           see.

    17                    One of the areas that I have had great interest in

    18           is Street Smart on the Web, so I'm going to follow that link. 

    19                    And what Yahooligans has included is the fact that

    20           the Internet is a great and wonderful place to see, but there

    21           are also some areas that can be troublesome, or some areas

    22           you might not -- have things you might not want your child to

    23           see.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Before you go on, what category    

    25           -- what would be the generic name of what is Yahooligans, in

                                                                           123

     1           terms of the testimony that we heard this morning?  Is that  

     2           a --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  That's a URL.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  That's a URL.  

     5                    THE WITNESS:  I believe.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But Yahoo was a search engine?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Well, Yahoo is a company that has a

     9           search engine and they also created this page for children --

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  -- so it wasn't connected with the

    12           search engine --

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  -- at that moment.  So these rules for

    15           safety are ones that were presented from the National Center

    16           for Missing and Exploited Children.  And I use them a lot

    17           when I'm talking with parents that are getting on line for

    18           the first time, to help them understand that it's important

    19           for kids not to give out personal information, like their

    20           address and phone number, their parents' work address and

    21           phone number.  And these are just some general rules that are

    22           printed here on the screen that parents can see and

    23           understand some of the pitfalls of the Internet, and all the

    24           wonderful things of the Internet as well.

    25                    Now if I scroll a little bit further down on this

                                                                           124

     1           page, there's also a pointer to Surfwatch, Protect Your Kinds

     2           on the Net.  And I can actually click that and go to the

     3           location on line.  

     4                    Now the interesting thing is, is that where we are

     5           actually now is -- if you remember, we were at Surfwatch home

     6           page when I first started.  We've now come in to a lower

     7           place in the Surfwatch home page.  So we don't have to always

     8           go down through the top we've come to, because there was a

     9           link directly to some lower location, we could get to that

    10           location immediately, which sort of explains why this is

    11           called a Web, as opposed to just a tree, because you can jump

    12           in at any point.

    13                    And here, immediately --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could you bookmark to this

    15           particular -- 

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- like the thing that we just saw,

    18           the page we just saw, in which the child learns to say I will

    19           not give anyone my address?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  Okay.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Can you bookmark to that, or do you

    22           have to bookmark to the whole thing?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  No.  I'll show you exactly.  I can go

    24           back.  There's a back key, right up here at the top, which

    25           keeps a record of where I've been.  So now I'm going to go

                                                                           125

     1           back to that page, which is right here, so you can go back to

     2           that information you've seen.  I go up under bookmark, and I

     3           say add bookmark.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Just to that -- and that gets it to

     5           that page.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  That's it.  Now if you look at

     7           bookmarks now, you'll see the bottom one says Street Smart on

     8           the Web.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mm-hmm.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  So now I can go back to that at any

    11           point.  Now I'll go forward to the point that I had just

    12           left.  

    13                    This is an advertise -- or a place where parents can

    14           actually purchase Surfwatch right on line.  If they click

    15           there, they will go to the Internet Shopping Network and can

    16           actually order the software right on line, and they will

    17           actually will be able to download it on their computer.  

    18                    Now, Surfwatch and the other parental technology is

    19           available in stores, available on line like this, available

    20           from our company directly.

    21                    So what is Surfwatch and where did it come from?  We

    22           -- Surfwatch is -- the product was -- is less than a year

    23           old, as is the other parental control technologies, and it

    24           came from my husband and myself, concerned about things that

    25           were on the Internet that we felt were inappropriate for our

                                                                           126

     1           child.  And my husband has a long technical background, 30

     2           years of experience in this field.  So we were able to

     3           actually implement the technology that both of us felt was

     4           important to have on the Internet.

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well -- excuse me, your Honor.  I

     6           really don't mean to interrupt, but we're getting beyond

     7           demonstration, into a direct testimony type situation where

     8           she's just --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, she's just giving a background

    10           of her company.  Objection overruled.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  So -- you know, and we really felt

    12           like what we wanted to provide were tools.  We understood

    13           that what our concerns for our kids were different than some

    14           other concerns for other -- that other parents might have for

    15           their children.  

    16                    So we really wanted to be able to provide tools,

    17           that if parents had serious concerns about what their kids

    18           saw on the Internet, they could have very severe filtering

    19           technology, and parents who were less concerned with the

    20           risk, could allow their kids to wander a little bit more.

    21                    And for me, I believed it was important to have my

    22           child wander on the Internet as much as I wanted.  

    23                    So Surfwatch is a product that during this whole

    24           demonstration, has been on my computer right here, running

    25           the whole time in the background.  So you can see it's

                                                                           127

     1           allowed us to search anywhere that we wanted to go on the

     2           Internet, hasn't interfered with us going anywhere, and we

     3           still have it running, and it's in the background.

     4                    We designed Surfwatch to be easy to install, and

     5           easy for parents who don't have a lot of computer experience

     6           to put on their machine.  And it's about a 10 minute time

     7           period to install it, and they install it with their own

     8           personal password.  

     9                    So how does Surfwatch work?  Well, one of the things

    10           that we did is I knew addresses of where -- places that I

    11           might want to go.  Well, sometimes kids know addresses of

    12           places that they might want to go.  And it is possible that

    13           kids might know that Playboy Magazine exists on the Internet. 

    14           So they might know the address of that.  And if they open the

    15           -- do the open location of HTTP:\\WWW.Playboy, and they hit

    16           the open, they will get a message --

    17                    (Laughter)

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, again, the Net is slow, so it's

    19           actually got to go out and check and see if this is something

    20           that Surfwatch blocks, but it should come back blocked by

    21           Surfwatch.  

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that because it's stopping it? 

    23           It's programmed to stop it, or -- or will a -- should a

    24           message come up?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  A message should come up.  And I don't

                                                                           128

     1           understand why that's not coming up.  So -- I mean what's

     2           happening is I can't get there.  So that's sort of good news. 

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that's just as effective, I

     4           guess, huh?

     5                    THE WITNESS:  Let's try -- let me see if a bookmark

     6           to it will get the connection to work.  Well, I don't know. 

     7           But anyway, let's move on.  We'll come back and do that one

     8           in a few minutes.

     9                    The other thing that -- that I --

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, in order to show how, to

    11           demonstrate, could you think of an -- I don't know the name

    12           of another magazine.  Do you know the name of another

    13           magazine that would be locked?

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Something else that you know -- that

    15           you know you've blocked.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm going to show you how to

    17           block something else, then I'll come back and do Playboy in a

    18           minute.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.

    20                    THE WITNESS:  We -- we did a word search before.  So

    21           I'm now -- kids often will go to one of the search engines

    22           and try searching on a word.  So for example, if they type in

    23           the word sexy, and they try and do a search, they get blocked

    24           by Surfwatch.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.

                                                                           129

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  So the message does come up. 

     3           And they might be a little more sophisticated.  So they might

     4           type in the word erotic.  And these are words that we have

     5           found most likely lead to places that we think might contain

     6           material that's inappropriate for children.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now how do you override it?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  I'll show you that in a second. 

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    10                    THE WITNESS:  So let me actually try Playboy one

    11           more time.  My guess is that often what happens with a lot of

    12           these sites is they get very busy in the middle of the day,

    13           and you actually can't --

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Playboy.

    15                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  And you actually can't have

    16           access to it, which is actually a deterrent, often when a lot

    17           of people are going there.  But it's not a guarantee, but,

    18           you know, it is blocked by Surfwatch.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So that may explain why it's slow,

    20           because there's just a lot of traffic on that?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  There's a -- this is -- this is the

    22           most busy time on the Internet, during the day.  When

    23           California's awake, and the East Coast still is busy.  It's a

    24           very busy time on the Internet, so...

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  We have California time on your

                                                                           130

     1           terminal.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I do.  It's because it's my portable

     3           that I brought from home, so...so... there.  Okay.  So I

     4           typed in another magazine.  I typed in Penthouse.  That's the

     5           message I should get from Playboy.  The only explanation I

     6           can give is that for some reason, it's busy out there and I

     7           can't get out there.  But that's the message you get when you

     8           attempt to go to a site like that.

     9                    So you asked how easy it is to turn off?  That's

    10           just another message that Netscape is giving me that it can't

    11           -- it was refused access to Penthouse.  It's sort of a double

    12           message because Surfwatch blocked it, and then Netscape said

    13           I couldn't get there, but it couldn't get there at that point

    14           because Surfwatch had actually blocked it.

    15                    So to turn it off, I go to what's called the control

    16           panel, and there's Surfwatch sitting there.  And it's turned

    17           on, registered to me.  I go to turn it off.  It asks me for

    18           my personal password, okay.  

    19                    If I type in something -- a kid tries to type in

    20           something, you try it, it says, you entered the incorrect

    21           password.  Nothing has been changed.  If I try again, and

    22           type in the password that I know is correct, it turns it off.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  And now I have access to all of those

    25           sites that previously were blocked.  And a parent can use

                                                                           131

     1           this at any time, because it may be the case that Surfwatch

     2           has blocked something that a parent thinks is appropriate for

     3           their child to see.  They can turn Surfwatch off at any time,

     4           and go to that location.  

     5                    And Surfwatch will have available in about a month,

     6           something called the Surfwatch Manager, which will allow

     7           people to actually add and delete their sites right there, as

     8           they're using the computer.  So if we've blocked something

     9           someone would like unblocked, or vice-versa, they will have a

    10           chance to actually change that right now.

    11                    And in addition, if a parent wanted -- if a parent

    12           was really concerned with what their kids saw and didn't want

    13           them very much surfing the net, Surfwatch has a capability to

    14           block everything on the Internet, except for the explicit

    15           sites that a parent might choose to allow the person -- allow

    16           their child to access.  So you could block everything, except

    17           for the hundred sites that the parent might want the child to

    18           access.

    19                    So that's the end of my demo.  I just -- it was

    20           important for me to actually put some visual stuff to what

    21           you had seen this morning, so that it actually began to make

    22           some sense of what the Web is.  

    23                    I think it's important, from my point of view, that

    24           the Web is a place where you actually make an affirmative

    25           choice to go places.  It doesn't just come at you.  You

                                                                           132

     1           actually choose to go to locations at each place, each step

     2           along the way, and secondly, that it's a global network. 

     3           That's what's so exciting.  I mean I was -- tried to get to

     4           Paris -- London, and you could go lots of different places in

     5           the world.  I think that's really important.

     6                    And that there are tools that exist for parents, and

     7           this is a brand new technology.  We're growing.  We have lots

     8           of new exciting ideas coming.  We're changing and adopting to

     9           what the customers want and what's needed in there.  But

    10           there is technology that allows parents to make choices about

    11           what their children see on the net.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that the end of show and tell?

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Is that the end of the direct --

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- as supplemented?

    16                    MR. ENNIS:  That's the end of our demonstration,

    17           your Honor.  The Government may want to cross-examine, and if

    18           the Court has additional questions --

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Sure.  Mr. Coppolino, will you be

    20           doing that?

    21                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I will be.  Yes.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Are you going to be using this? 

    24           Are we going to be using these again during this hearing?

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Today, your Honor?  I don't believe

                                                                           133

     1           so.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Ever?

     3                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Yes.  I think these should be

     4           available for when we present our case.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Okay.  It's just a bit of a

     6           -- if we could get it off --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, maybe --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- we might not feel so --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would it be possible during the

    10           break, or --

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Well, your Honor, it would just take a

    12           moment to lift it down.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- just to take a moment.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well, not this second.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, you told me yesterday, you

    16           could just take it off right now.

    17                    MR. ENNIS:  Right.  Right.  Why don't we do that? 

    18           If the Government doesn't need the monitors, we can take this

    19           down right now.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You don't need the monitors, Mr.

    21           Coppolino?

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Today.

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We don't need them today.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Today, okay.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That

                                                                           134

     1           would be --

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If that would be all right, Mr.

     3           Coppolino, we would be able to have -- get our own material.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It gives us a little more space.

     5                    (Pause in proceedings.)

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  There's a wonderful --

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Free at last.

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  I'm going to turn the monitors off and

     9           display, if that's acceptable to the Government and to the

    10           Court.

    11                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Could I just clarify, your Honor,

    12           does the witness have a copy of her affidavit direct

    13           testimony?

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Do you have this in front of you?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, I don't.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Ennis, or one of your

    17           colleagues, could you --

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, I can get one quickly, your Honor.

    19                    MR. COPPOLINO:  And also, your Honor, is there a

    20           copy of any of the defendant's exhibits left over from this

    21           morning?  Because if not --

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I could give her mine, if you'd

    23           like.

    24                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No.  At the appropriate point, I can

    25           hand her a copy, your Honor.

                                                                           135

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  All right.

     2                    MR. ENNIS:  I gave them back to your side during the

     3           lunch break.

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Oh, you gave them back.  Okay. 

     5           Well, we'll hand it up when we need them.

     6                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

     7           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

     8           Q   Good afternoon, Mrs. Duvall.  Nice to see you again. 

     9           First, with respect to your professional background, do you

    10           have any expertise in computer programming?

    11           A   No, I do not.

    12           Q   Do you have any expertise in computer software

    13           development?

    14           A   No, I do not.

    15           Q   Do you have any expertise in computer hardware

    16           development?

    17           A   No, I do not.

    18           Q   Do you have any expertise in Internet transmission

    19           protocols?

    20           A   No, I do not.

    21           Q   Is it correct to say that your expertise does not extend

    22           to the specific technical details as to how Surfwatch

    23           actually operates on a computer system?

    24           A   That is correct.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Could you speak into the -- pull the

                                                                           136

     1           microphone -- 

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- is it on, the microphone?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Go ahead.

     6           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

     7           Q   And so is it fair to say that your expertise is in what

     8           Surfwatch does, as opposed to precisely how it does it on a

     9           technical basis?  Is that a fair statement?

    10           A   Yes, it is.

    11           Q   I'd like to refer you to paragraph 21 of your direct

    12           testimony affidavit, please.  And paragraph 21 describes some

    13           of the criteria that Surfwatch uses to block access to

    14           sexually explicit sites on the Internet.  Is that correct?

    15           A   Yes, it is.

    16           Q   And just so that the record is clear, that paragraph

    17           indicates that Surfwatch's blocking criteria includes a

    18           screen or warning at the entrance of a site that identifies

    19           as containing adult material, or material that is not

    20           suitable for minors, nudity, explicit descriptions of sexual

    21           acts, obscenity, explicit descriptions in graphics or text,

    22           of genitalia or a sexual apparatus, and sexually exploitive

    23           or sexually violent text of graphics.  Do you agree that each

    24           of these is one of the criteria that Surfwatch uses to block

    25           sites on the Internet?

                                                                           137

     1           A   Yes.  That's one of many of the criteria we use.

     2           Q   What additional criteria are there?

     3           A   I actually don't have the list in front of me, but these

     4           are the main criteria, and then we actually go and look at

     5           sites, and make a judgment based on what we see.

     6           Q   I understand.

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, I am going to give the

     8           witness the exhibit book.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Sure.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Which numbers?  Which part of the

    12           exhibit book?

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We're going to give her one to 45,

    14           and I'll identify the exhibits.  

    15           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    16           Q   I'll tell you which exhibit I'm going to ask you to look

    17           at.

    18           A   Okay.

    19                    (Pause in proceedings.)

    20           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    21           Q   All right.  Ms. Duvall, would you take a look at Exhibit

    22           30, please?  And do you -- do you recognize this exhibit as

    23           an exhibit I showed you at your deposition on Monday, which

    24           lists a number of so-called x-rated sites that are listed in

    25           the Internet yellow pages?  I believe that's the 1995

                                                                           138

     1           edition.  Is that correct?

     2           A   Yes.  I remember seeing this document.

     3           Q   All right.  Are these the type of sites that Surfwatch is

     4           designed to block?

     5           A   Yes.  Surfwatch is designed to block these sites.

     6           Q   That's all we're going to do with that exhibit.  Thank

     7           you.  Referring to paragraph eight of your direct            

     8           testimony --

     9           A   Excuse me.  Eight?

    10           Q   Eight.  

    11                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You were talking about Exhibit 30

    12           there?

    13                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Excuse me, your Honor?

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What exhibit were you on?

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  30.

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I was looking at 30.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He had looked at 30.  You got it

    18           there.  You got it now.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You mean it's designed to block

    20           these?

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No.  Turn the page.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh.  Oh.  Okay.

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I asked, your Honor, if -- 

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  All right.

    25                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I asked her if it was designed to

                                                                           139

     1           block the type of sites that are listed at Exhibit 30, and I

     2           believe the witness indicated that it was.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  All right.  I was looking   

     4           -- okay.  Fine.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I missed that.  I missed it.

     6                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I might have gone a little too

     7           quickly.  I apologize.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.

     9                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Well, two out of three missed it.

    10           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    11           Q   Mrs. Duvall, you state in paragraph eight that Surfwatch

    12           blocks access to more than 5,000 Internet sites that are

    13           known, or appear likely to contain text or graphics of a

    14           sexual nature that Surfwatch considers to be inappropriate

    15           for minors.  Is that correct?

    16           A   Yes, it is.

    17           Q   Is it correct that that figure could be as high as 8,000?

    18           A   It's a difficult number to actually pinpoint.  Let me

    19           give you an example.  We block Playboy.  We count that as one

    20           site.  Playboy actually could have multiple pages underneath

    21           that, so it could be a hundred additional pages in that.  So

    22           there -- now the number would be a hundred and one.  So

    23           depending on how we want to actually count, we can't always

    24           count exactly the sites that we're blocking because there

    25           could be multiple underneath a certain header.

                                                                           140

     1                    In addition, we block on some word and pattern

     2           matching technology.  And that's kind of a fluid ongoing

     3           thing, so we don't actually have a count of exactly how      

     4           much.

     5           Q   Well, I'm just trying to get a sense of the range of the

     6           number of sites.  Would you take a look at Exhibit 22,

     7           please, of defendant's exhibits?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   Is that the affidavit that was filed in this case, signed

    10           by your husband, Bill Duvall?

    11           A   Yes.

    12           Q   Would you look at paragraph nine?  Does paragraph nine of

    13           that affidavit state that Surfwatch blocks access to

    14           approximately five through 8,000 Internet sites containing

    15           sexually explicit material?  Is that correct?

    16           A   That's what it says.

    17           Q   Are you saying your husband's statement was not correct?

    18           A   No.  I assume if he made that statement, that he assumed

    19           that it was correct.

    20           Q   When Surfwatch was first introduced in May of 1985 -- is

    21           that correct?

    22           A   '95.

    23           Q   1995.  Excuse me.  Do you know roughly how many specific

    24           sites that Surfwatch had identified that were blocked by the

    25           software?

                                                                           141

     1           A   I don't actually have a count, back in May of 1995 when

     2           we first released.

     3           Q   Could you give us an approximation?

     4           A   Again, since we were blocking both on word matching

     5           pattern technology and explicit sites, it was difficult.  But

     6           I would imagine at that time, we were probably blocking about

     7           2,000 sites.

     8           Q   Okay.  Has the number of sites that -- excuse me.  Could

     9           you tell me what the increase in the number of sites that

    10           Surfwatch has specifically identified has been since May of

    11           1985, the number of sites that have been specifically

    12           identified by Surfwatch?

    13           A   Again, that's a difficult number, because if I'm listing

    14           Playboy as a specific site, I count that as one.  It could

    15           also be counted as a hundred and one.

    16           Q   Well, do you recall when we met at a deposition last

    17           Monday, that you made a general estimate of a couple of

    18           thousand new sites had been specifically identified by

    19           Surfwatch since May of 1995?  Do you recall that testimony?

    20           A   I don't recall exactly saying that, but --

    21           Q   Well, let me refresh your recollection, then. 

    22                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, may I give the witness a

    23           copy of her --

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, you may.

    25           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

                                                                           142

     1           Q   I'll refer you the page...

     2           A   Okay.  

     3           Q   Take a look at page 145, please.  Actually, starting at

     4           the bottom of page 144, I asked you -- and I'll just quote

     5           from the transcript:

     6                    "Do you have any estimate of the number of new sites

     7           that have been found since the software was released in May

     8           of 1995?"

     9                    "Answer:  Not specifically, no."

    10                    "Do you have a general estimate?"

    11                    "Answer:  It would be a couple of thousand."

    12                    Is that testimony correct?

    13           A   That is correct.

    14           Q   Mrs. Duvall, does Surfwatch utilize a team of so-called

    15           surfers to search the Internet for sites that may contain

    16           sexually explicit material, as described in paragraph 21?

    17           A   It's one of the ways we use to find new sites.

    18           Q   Excuse me?

    19           A   That's one of the ways we use to find new sites.

    20           Q   Could you indicate how many people are currently

    21           performing this task?

    22           A   I believe we have at least 10 surfers at this time.

    23           Q   Are a number of these individuals university students?

    24           A   Yes, they are.

    25           Q   And the ones that are university students, are over the

                                                                           143

     1           age of 21, is that correct?

     2           A   Yes, they are.

     3           Q   Okay.  Approximately how many hours per week do you ask

     4           your searchers -- does Surfwatch ask its surfers to search

     5           the net for sites that Surfwatch may choose to block?

     6           A   We tell them we'd like to surf for a minimum of 10 hours

     7           per week.

     8           Q   And how many hours per week do you estimate that they

     9           actually do search, on average?

    10           A   Probably closer to 20 on average per week.

    11           Q   That's your current estimate today, of 20?

    12           A   Well --

    13           Q   Well, let me try to refresh your recollection on that

    14           one, too.  Why don't you take a look at page 49.  

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Matt, check if her microphone is on.

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Yeah.  It doesn't seem --

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I don't think her microphone's on.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Is her microphone on?

    19                    THE WITNESS:  It is.  It's just not close enough to

    20           me, probably.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's a very sensitive microphone,

    22           so...

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mine's on off.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  No, no.  Hers.  

    25                    THE CLERK:  Oh.  It's on.

                                                                           144

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  Okay.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't need yours on to get --

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I put mine off.    

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You don't need yours on --

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- mine on.  I don't want to --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah, but for you to get on the

     7           tape, don't you need to be -- I mean in my court, you do.  

     8                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, could we also see if this

     9           could be turned off?  We're having trouble hearing at this

    10           end as well.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have what turned off?

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  Whatever this projector is.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, sure.  

    14                    (Pause in proceedings.)

    15           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    16           Q   Mrs. Duvall, perhaps you heard me say two weeks instead

    17           of one, but my question is the number of hours on average the

    18           surfers search per week, and as the deposition transcript on

    19           page 49 indicates, that your estimate was, "per week, I'll

    20           say about 12 hours."  Is that correct?

    21           A   That's what I said the estimate was.

    22           Q   And -- and to be accurate, you said that's a guess, or

    23           that's an estimate, is that correct?

    24           A   Yes.

    25           Q   All right.  Mrs. Duvall, do the surfers, I'll call them,

                                                                           145

     1           that Surfwatch utilizes, do they search for new sites with

     2           the Surfwatch software loaded on their computers?

     3           A   Yes, they do.

     4           Q   And is the idea to find sites that Surfwatch does not

     5           block?

     6           A   Yes.  That's the idea.

     7           Q   And the idea is to use the -- to load the software in

     8           advance, so that if they find a site that's not blocked, they

     9           know that it's not blocked.  Is that correct?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   And do your surfers in fact find that there are sexually

    12           explicit sites meeting the criteria described in paragraph 21

    13           that are not blocked by the software when it is loaded onto

    14           the computer?

    15           A   Yes, they do.

    16           Q   With the Surfwatch software loaded, could you indicate

    17           approximately how many new sites your surfers find per week?

    18           A   We probably get between a hundred and 200 sites a week.

    19           Q   And is it fair to extrapolate that number out to a

    20           monthly approximately of 400 to 800 new sites identified a

    21           month?

    22           A   Well, it's very difficult to extrapolate with a new

    23           company that's only been around for nine months.  So I would

    24           be a little hesitant to do a lot of extrapolating.

    25           Q   Do you recall that you testified to that effect last

                                                                           146

     1           Monday?

     2           A   No, I didn't recall --

     3           Q   Well, let's take a look at page 144 of your deposition. 

     4           The bottom of page 143 to 144.  I had asked you about a

     5           weekly number.

     6                    "Was that a weekly number?"

     7                    "Answer:  I said 100 to 200 a week."

     8                    "Question:  So could I extrapolate out to 400 to 800

     9           a month, perhaps.  Is that fair?"

    10                    "Answer:  Sure."

    11                    Was that testimony that you gave on Monday correct?

    12           A   That is the correct testimony I gave on Monday.

    13           Q   Do you disagree with it today?

    14           A   No, I don't disagree with it.  I -- it's a difficult

    15           number to always extrapolate, since we don't have a lot of

    16           history to base this on.

    17           Q   Mrs. Duvall, is it correct to say that Surfwatch's

    18           experiences at the number of sites on the Internet containing 

    19           sexually explicit material of the type described in paragraph

    20           21 is constantly changing?  Is that a correct statement?

    21           A   Yes, that is.

    22           Q   I believe your affidavit indicates in paragraph 11 that

    23           Surfwatch offers a subscription service that automatically

    24           updates the identification of specific sites that Surfwatch

    25           blocks.  Is that correct?

                                                                           147

     1           A   Yes.  That's correct.

     2           Q   Could you tell the Court approximately how much that

     3           service costs per month?

     4           A   Well, if they purchase the service directly from us, it's

     5           $5.95 a month, or $60 for a yearly subscription.  But it is

     6           available through some of the Internet Service Providers at a

     7           much lower cost to people.  It's provided -- included as part

     8           of their package.

     9           Q   Could you indicate how often Surfwatch normally provides

    10           its subscribers an automatic updated list of sites that have

    11           been -- that Surfwatch would add to its block site list?

    12           A   At this point, we're on a 28 day cycle.

    13           Q   Mrs. Duvall, do you agree that an important aspect of

    14           maintaining the effectiveness of Surfwatch is to subscribe to

    15           the list of updated sites?

    16           A   Yes, I do.

    17           Q   And would the effectiveness of Surfwatch diminish over

    18           time, if a user did not subscribe to a list of updated block

    19           sites?

    20           A   If they were using the standard version of Surfwatch,

    21           then the subscription wouldn't make a difference.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  What was that?

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What did you say?  I'm sorry.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  If they're using the standard version. 

    25           We have a version where parents will be able to block

                                                                           148

     1           everything on the Internet, except what they choose their

     2           child to see, and therefore the subscription would not make a

     3           difference at that point -- 

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I see.

     5                    THE WITNESS:  -- because they would be making their

     6           own choices as to what they wanted their child to see.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Oh, so -- go ahead.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Go ahead.  Now what was --

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you can get -- you can get then a

    10           version of Surfwatch that's a total block --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- except for sites that the parents

    13           specifically authorize.

    14                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    16                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I didn't hear the answer to Mr.

    17           Coppolino's question before, which was if you didn't get that

    18           version and did get the regular version, but didn't get the

    19           monthly update, what would the effectiveness be?  I think

    20           that was your question, paraphrased.  

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Right.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And I just didn't hear your answer.

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  The effectiveness would

    24           diminish, as there are new sites that are coming on the

    25           Internet all the time.  So to have the most updated filters

                                                                           149

     1           available, you'd need to subscribe to the service.

     2           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

     3           Q   And is it -- is it fair to say that the software -- the

     4           new software that you're developing that you've just

     5           described to the Court, reverses the presumption, and instead

     6           of selecting sites to block, allows parents to select sites

     7           to provide access to?

     8           A   That's correct.

     9           Q   Is Surfwatch going to cease using its annual -- or 28 day

    10           updates of updated sites, once this new software is available

    11           that you just described?

    12           A   Would you repeat that again, please?

    13           Q   What I wanted to know is when you have the new software

    14           that's going to allow parents to block everything except what

    15           they want, does Surfwatch contemplate ceasing its

    16           subscription service, which would provide automatic updates

    17           of block sites?

    18           A   We don't plan to, at this point.  And we -- I mean at

    19           this point, we block every -- we update automatically every

    20           28 days.  That's a number that can change at any time.  We

    21           can automatically update anybody at any time, if we so

    22           choose.  They just can -- we can set the number to be every

    23           five days, if we think that's more appropriate, or every

    24           three days, or every two weeks.  So that's a number that's

    25           not solid, hard built into the program.  We can change that

                                                                           150

     1           as we find maybe it's more appropriate to have someone update

     2           on a weekly basis, instead of 28 days.

     3           Q   Does Surfwatch have any reason to believe that the need

     4           to continue to provide an updated list of sites will diminish

     5           for the foreseeable future?

     6           A   You're asking me to predict what's going to happen on the

     7           Internet.  It's difficult to say what will happen, as far as

     8           people providing content on the Internet, of the nature that

     9           we have been filtering out at this point.

    10           Q   Would you take a look at page 147 of your -- of your

    11           deposition?  I asked you then:

    12                    "Is there any reason to believe that the necessity

    13           for Surfwatch to continue to update its list of block sites

    14           will diminish in the foreseeable future?"

    15                    "Answer:  No."

    16                    Is that your testimony on Monday?

    17           A   Yes, it is.

    18           Q   Paragraph seven of your -- of your affidavit today, if

    19           you could take a look at that, please.  You use a phrase,

    20           "the tiny portion of inappropriate material on the Internet." 

    21           Do you consider the 5,000 sites that Surfwatch attempts to

    22           screen to be a tiny portion of inappropriate material on the

    23           Internet?

    24           A   Yes, I do.

    25           Q   And what's the basis for that statement?  Have you -- let

                                                                           151

     1           me -- let me strike that question and ask this one.  Have you

     2           done any statistical analysis of the percentage of material

     3           that Surfwatch screens, as a percentage of the total material

     4           on the Internet?

     5           A   Would you repeat that question?

     6           Q   Have you done a -- has Surfwatch done a statistical

     7           analysis of the percentage of the material that Surfwatch

     8           screens, as a percentage of the total material on the

     9           Internet?

    10           A   We haven't done it -- we -- Surfwatch has not done any

    11           statistical analysis.

    12           Q   Does your -- is your statement in this paragraph

    13           reflecting a particular study?

    14           A   Where's that -- where are you, paragraph seven?

    15           Q   Paragraph seven.  The characterization, "a tiny portion

    16           of inappropriate material on the Internet."

    17           A   I'm not seeing that.

    18           Q   Of your affidavit.  It's in the second sentence.  

    19           A   The second sentence of paragraph seven, or am I looking

    20           at the wrong thing?

    21           Q   Well, I think so, but most of your --

    22           A   I'm looking at the wrong affidavit.

    23                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Could I assist the witness perhaps,

    24           your Honor?

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's this one, in the binder here.

                                                                           152

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  There were two of them, and I

     2           was looking at the wrong one.

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You can assist her, though.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page four.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  You want to show her, Mr.

     7           Coppolino?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Sorry?  

     9           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    10           Q   I was referring to your -- 

    11           A   Oh, okay.  Okay.  That's what I was -- they look -- yeah. 

    12           Q   Tab C.

    13           A   Okay.  Thank you.

    14           Q   That -- that -- I'm sorry.  I'm sorry.

    15           A   Is that -- okay.  That wasn't in the other one.  Okay. 

    16           Okay.  Well, just -- I mean from my experience in what I know

    17           is out on the Internet, and there have been some numbers that

    18           have bantered around, that there are over 50 million pages of

    19           information on the Internet, I tend to believe that there is

    20           a small amount of inappropriate material on the Internet.

    21           Q   But according to your affidavit, there are at least 5,000

    22           to 8,000 sites that Surfwatch has currently identified.  Is

    23           that correct?

    24           A   About 5,000 sites that we block, that aren't --

    25           Q   That you block.

                                                                           153

     1           A   Right.

     2           Q   Well, I assume that includes a combination of those

     3           you've identified, as well as a text blocking mechanism.  Is

     4           that correct?

     5           A   Yes.

     6           Q   Okay.  And incidentally, if you block something by the

     7           text blocking mechanism, are you aware -- you become aware of

     8           the specific site?

     9           A   No, we do not.

    10           Q   Would you take a look at paragraph 23, please?  If you'd

    11           like to take a moment to look through paragraph 23.  Have you

    12           had a chance to look over paragraph 23, Mrs. Duvall?

    13           A   Mm-hmm.

    14           Q   Paragraph 23 indicates in the second to last sentence,

    15           that Surfwatch blocks 90 to 95 percent of certain sites --

    16           I'm not quoting exactly, so I'm going to let you explain     

    17           this --

    18           A   Mm-hmm.

    19           Q   -- but 90 to 95 percent of certain sites identified by

    20           sexually explicit key words, such as sexy or erotica, is that

    21           -- is that correct, that Surfwatch says that it blocks 90 to

    22           95 percent of certain sites identified by sexually explicit

    23           key words, such as sexy or erotica?  Is that -- is that      

    24           the --

    25           A   What -- what that -- what that really means is that we

                                                                           154

     1           believe that most sites that attract -- there's so many sites

     2           on the Internet, that there has to be something that attracts

     3           someone to go to that site.  So either it's a site that they

     4           know about, such as Playboy.Com, or it's a site that has

     5           something in its title that's going to draw someone to there. 

     6                    If there's a site that says Ann's Home Page, it's

     7           not likely, if a child is searching for sexually explicit

     8           material, they're going to go to that home page.  

     9                    But if something says sexy, sexy, sexy in the title,

    10           there's a good chance that a child might be attracted to

    11           that.  

    12                    And since we can block on what's in the title, we've

    13           come to find that we believe we block about 90 to 95 percent

    14           of what we call the readily available sites on the Internet

    15           that contain sexually explicit material.  And it has been our

    16           experience in the thousands of copies that we have out there,

    17           that we're not getting a huge amount of complaints from

    18           parents and teachers that we're missing huge amounts of

    19           material that students and kids are finding on the Internet.

    20           Q   Mrs. Duvall, do you recall describing this estimate to me

    21           last Monday in your deposition, as a marketing statement?

    22           A   I said that it was used -- that I had taken it -- my

    23           husband had taken it from a marketing statement, that we had

    24           used it as a marketing statement.

    25           Q   As a Surfwatch marketing statement.

                                                                           155

     1           A   Mm-hmm.  Yes.

     2           Q   You testified previously that the number of sexually

     3           explicit sites on the Internet is changing constantly.  Is

     4           that correct?

     5           A   That's correct.

     6           Q   And you also testified previously I believe that your

     7           surfers are finding a hundred to 200 new sites per week, that

     8           Surfwatch would block.  Is that correct?

     9           A   That's correct.

    10           Q   Is it possible to determine at any given time how many

    11           sexually explicit sites are actually added and removed from

    12           the Internet?

    13           A   No.

    14           Q   One question with respect to the demonstration.  I

    15           believe you indicated that in order to connect to the

    16           Internet, somebody had to buy a modem.  Could you indicate to

    17           the Court whether or not there are computers that actually

    18           come with a modem built in?

    19           A   There are computers that come with modems.

    20           Q   Is it some, or many, or most?  Do you know?

    21           A   I don't have that -- no, I don't know that information.

    22           Q   So you wouldn't know if it's -- if it's today's

    23           technology, would you know whether or not most computers come

    24           with a modem built in?

    25           A   No, I wouldn't.

                                                                           156

     1           Q   You don't know?

     2           A   I don't know.

     3           Q   Okay.  

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I thank the Court.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Mr. Ennis?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Just a couple of brief questions.

     7                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     8           BY MR. ENNIS:

     9           Q   Mrs. Duvall, you were testifying today, primarily on

    10           behalf of Surfwatch.  But is it fair to say that there are

    11           several other software companies that produce comparable

    12           products?

    13           A   Yes, there are.

    14           Q   And do some of those other companies produce products

    15           that permit parents to choose to block all access to the

    16           Internet, except for sites the parents have previously

    17           selected as appropriate?

    18           A   To my understanding, yes.

    19           Q   I think there's been a little confusion about how your

    20           blocking works.  Is it fair to say that you block sites,

    21           regardless of whether the site in its address has a sexy

    22           word, if you know the site contains inappropriate material? 

    23           Is that correct?

    24           A   That is correct.

    25           Q   Like, for example, you said Ann's Home Page.  That

                                                                           157

     1           doesn't sound bad, but if you knew that Ann's Home Page

     2           contained inappropriate material, you would block that site

     3           as a site, correct?

     4           A   Absolutely.

     5           Q   And then is it also true that you block because of your

     6           word pattern technology system, so that if the address of the

     7           site has a word like sexy or porn, or cyberporn, you would

     8           block that site for that reason?

     9           A   That's correct.  

    10           Q   Now, you testified that insofar as you're blocking by

    11           known site, that if you don't subscribe to the service, the

    12           effectiveness of site blocking will diminish over time,

    13           correct?

    14           A   That's correct.

    15           Q   Is that also correct, or is that incorrect when you're

    16           blocking with respect to word recognition?

    17           A   Not -- absolutely not the same amount, because the words

    18           are always there, and will remain there, and we will continue

    19           to block on those words forever.

    20           Q   So that hypothetically --

    21           A   Mm-hmm.

    22           Q   -- if, in a two week period, 200 new sites were added to

    23           the Web, and all of those 200 new sites had a word in the

    24           title, like adult, or sexy, or erotic --

    25           A   Mm-hmm.

                                                                           158

     1           Q   -- even if you hadn't investigated those sites

     2           individually, they'd be blocked?

     3           A   That's absolutely correct.

     4                    MR. ENNIS:  I have no further questions.

     5                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Could I ask one?

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, yeah.  We may have some, too.

     7                    MR. COPPOLINO:  I understand, your Honor.

     8                                RECROSS EXAMINATION

     9           BY MR. COPPOLINO:

    10           Q   Mrs. Duvall, just following up on Mr. Ennis' questions,

    11           if Surfwatch had not previously identified the site captioned

    12           Ann's Home Page, or something of that nature -- let's just

    13           say Ann's Home Page -- as containing sexually explicit

    14           material, if you had not previously identified that specific

    15           site, would the site be blocked by Surfwatch?

    16           A   No.

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Thank you.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Could I ask some questions?

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I have some, too.  You go first.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is Surfwatch a money making

    21           project?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  I hope so.

    23                    (Laughter)

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's the -- that's the hope.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it stopped being a money making

                                                                           159

     1           project, would you -- and your children had become adults,

     2           there would be -- is it correct that there would be no reason

     3           for you to continue with this project?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I think the original reason that

     5           inspired the idea was that we have a child at home.  But as

     6           we have developed this software, it's become very clear to me

     7           that parents would like to have tools for themselves, to use

     8           on the Internet, as their children become -- come on the

     9           Internet, for them to help filter out what they think is

    10           inappropriate.  So I would like to continue the work that

    11           we've begun at Surfwatch.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But there's no assurance to the

    13           public, the Government, parents, that your particular company

    14           will remain in existence and provide this alternative.  Is

    15           that right?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  That's probably correct.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  On the other hand, I gather what

    18           you're telling us is that the facility exists, so that if you

    19           don't do it -- because, with all due respect, one might say

    20           you're a small entity in this totality of what we heard the

    21           first witness talk about -- 

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Mm-hmm.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- somebody else might do it.

    24                    THE WITNESS:  In addition, I think that we --

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Well --

                                                                           160

     1                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.

     2                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- yes or no on that, first.

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.  No, that's true.  Someone else

     4           might do it.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And at the moment, you're -- I

     6           assume you're paying these college students and one, as I

     7           know as a parent of one that just finished, you can't always

     8           be sure that they won't be busy doing exams, or other things. 

     9           Is that correct?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have you ever explored the

    12           possibility of contacting parents' groups, and church groups,

    13           and other groups that might be interested in this, to notify

    14           you of appropriate -- what they would think are words that

    15           should be added, or sites that should be added?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Absolutely.  In fact, we solicit from

    17           our customers now to send us information if they find sites

    18           that we aren't blocking, so --

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But do you checks those sites

    20           before you block them, to see whether your view as to whether

    21           they should be blocked, may differ from the view of your

    22           volunteer?

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, we do.  We check all the sites.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then your subscribers -- is it

    25           correct to say that your subscribers are dependent on your

                                                                           161

     1           view of what may be inappropriate for children?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  At this point, yes.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah.  I had a couple questions on

     5           your declaration.  On page 19 in paragraph 39, you make

     6           reference to "parental control software that blocks access to

     7           non-Internet sites also is available."  Could you tell me,

     8           what is a non-Internet site?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  That was in reference to -- there's

    10           some bulletin boards, some separate computers that people can

    11           dial from their home, directly to a bulletin board.  And

    12           there is some software available that will allow you to

    13           actually block on specific phone numbers and -- and whatever.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  If you know what those

    15           numbers are.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  I got you.  And on page 20,

    18           paragraph 41, you make the statement that 30 percent of

    19           Surfwatch blocked sites, "originate outside the United

    20           States."  How do you know that?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  That's from our actual list of sites

    22           that we block, so that number may actually be higher than

    23           that.  But of the known sites where we specifically have the

    24           name of the site, it's approximately 30 percent of those that

    25           come from outside --

                                                                           162

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how are you able to tell that

     2           they originate outside the United States?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Well, even though today, when I wasn't

     4           sure that I came from Paris, many sites actually do have an

     5           identifier on them that indicate what country they

     6           originated.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So it's based on an actual

     8           canvas that you've done --

     9                    THE WITNESS:  It's an -- 

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- of these sites.

    11                    THE WITNESS:  It's an actual address.  We can look

    12           at the address, and decide whether it comes from United

    13           Kingdom or Finland.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Let's assume there's 5,000 blocked

    15           sites.  You have actually counted, or your firm has actually

    16           counted 1500 -- to wit, 30 percent as being from outside the

    17           United States.  Is that correct?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    20                    THE WITNESS:  We didn't count.  We used the

    21           computers to help us figure that out, so...

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And last -- two other

    23           questions.  You also --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes.  The answer's yes.  You may

    25           ask.

                                                                           163

     1                    (Laughter)

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you.  You also say at page 31,

     3           you make the statement, which I'm curious to know what the

     4           source of the information is --

     5                    THE WITNESS:  What page was that?

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- that 50 percent of the nation's

     7           public schools have connected to the Internet.  You cite a

     8           survey by the U.S. Department of Education.  Could you be

     9           more specific?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  What page are you on?

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Page 14.  

    12                    THE WITNESS:  14.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Paragraph 31.  And you go on to say

    14           that your firm has sold its software to these school

    15           districts.  You see the bottom of page 14?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Right.  Okay.  We -- this was a survey

    17           that was listed in the local paper, that 50 percent of the

    18           nation's public schools have connected to the Internet.  That

    19           was --

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What percentage of your customers

    21           are public schools?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  I'd say presently about 70 percent of

    23           our customers are public schools.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  70?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

                                                                           164

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Percent.  And lastly, how many

     2           units, approximately, have you sold to date?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  That is a very difficult number for me

     4           to come up with.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's your company.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  It is.  I know it's my company.  We

     7           sell a certain number from our local office.  We also have

     8           retail distribution that goes through a distributor.  

     9                    And in addition, we have -- we've done a deal called

    10           Internet in a Box For Kids, and recently, Family PC Magazine

    11           shipped a hundred thousand of these CDs out to families.  

    12                    So it's really difficult for us to say really how

    13           many installed products we have.  We don't actually know that

    14           someone's installed until they actually subscribe.  And what

    15           we do is we give people a couple of months of free update, so

    16           they can get used to the pattern, see how it works.  So we're

    17           just beginning to get those figures coming in, since we are

    18           such a new company.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So how many subscribers would

    20           you say you have now, roughly?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  About 1500 subscribers.

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Very good.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Do you have competitors out

    24           there?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  We sure do.

                                                                           165

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  How many do you have, just

     2           roughly?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  There are probably four that I know of

     4           right now.  

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Mm-hmm.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  And there are a few others that are

     7           lurking, I'm sure. 

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  How do you -- I think you

     9           explained how you override the Surfwatch.  Is that through a

    10           -- some kind of code?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Basically, it's a password that the

    12           parent, or whoever installs the software, puts in.  They make

    13           it up when they actually install the software.

    14                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  They make -- they -- 

    15                    THE WITNESS:  They make it up.  It's like your PIN

    16           number at your bank.  So you make it up when you install the

    17           software, and then you just use that same password.

    18                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Can a clever person get a hold of

    19           that somehow, or is there a way of finding that out?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  There's no way of --

    21                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Other than the -- other than the

    22           parent or -- 

    23                    THE WITNESS:  Parent telling it.

    24                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  -- revealing it.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  There's no -- it's not an easy way. 

                                                                           166

     1           We've taken a lot of effort to try and prevent tampering of

     2           the software.  And I'd say in the numbers that we have out

     3           there, we've received very few complaints from parents or

     4           teachers that the children have disabled the software.

     5                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  That's all.

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have a question.

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you could get the public schools

     9           in this country, or private schools -- Catholic schools, for

    10           example -- to agree on what was inappropriate material, could

    11           they develop their own version of Surfwatch or a blocker?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  What we have available today is --

    13           because we have this -- different filters available, if you

    14           wanted to put together a list of sites that you wanted

    15           blocked, and then make that available -- for example, the Boy

    16           Scouts of America wanted to put together a list, or the

    17           schools wanted to put together a list of sites that they

    18           wanted blocked.  We would create a special filter set for the

    19           school.  And then, if they had technology like Surfwatch,

    20           then they would have access to that specific filter set.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would they need you to make out the

    22           filter set?  In other words --

    23                    THE WITNESS:  No.  They could --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  -- somebody who was -- who knew as

    25           much technical -- had as much technical background as your

                                                                           167

     1           husband, for example, or whoever helped develop this -- I

     2           think Mr. Friend, was it, or somebody else -- could they do

     3           it, independent of you?

     4                    THE WITNESS:  There's two separate issues.  There's

     5           actually the software technology that is fairly

     6           sophisticated.  But developing the list or the filters, I

     7           could do that.  I mean anyone without any technical

     8           background could develop the list.  Then they would need that

     9           technology to be able to identify those sites that were

    10           trying to be accessed, in order to be able to block t hem.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Did our questions elicit -- evoke

    12           any additional questions from counsel?  Because I -- we don't

    13           want --

    14                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No, your Honor.  Thank you.

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  No, you Honor.  May I ask your Honors if

    16           the witness may be released?

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If it's all right with them, sure.

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  And since this -- I don't think the

    19           Government needs the computer.  It's her personal computer. 

    20           May she take that with her?

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yeah.  I think that we'll -- it

    22           might be an appropriate time to break, and you can take care

    23           of all these matters.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Will your next witness be Dr.

    25           Hoffman, or --

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, we -- we would next like to

     2           call the two witnesses that the Government does not wish to

     3           cross-examine, Mr. Kuromiya and Ms. Warren, in the event the

     4           Court wishes to ask any questions of them, so that we can

     5           release them, if the Court --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And Mr. Croneberger will be around

     7           tomorrow?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Ms. Hoffman is here, Dr. Stayton is

     9           here, and as I understand, Mr. Croneberger will be here

    10           tomorrow.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  He'll be here tomorrow.  Okay.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  He's here now, actually.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Fine.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But will he be here tomorrow to --

    15                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes, whenever -- with the Court's

    16           convenience.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yeah, because we -- I think we have

    18           some questions.  Okay. 

    19                    (Recess taken from 2:55 p.m. to 3:10 p.m.)

    20                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Court is now in session.  Please

    21           be seated.

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  My name

    23           is Christopher Hansen.  I'm one of the lawyers representing

    24           the plaintiffs in the ACLU case.  Plaintiffs' next witness is

    25           Kiyoshi Kuromiya, the director of the Critical Path AIDS

                                                                           169

     1           project.  The Government has advised us that they have no

     2           desire to cross-examine Mr. Kuromiya, so I would like to

     3           first move his declaration into evidence.  His declaration

     4           was signed on March 8th, 1996.  It's been previously filed

     5           with the Court.  I'd like to move it into evidence for his

     6           direct testimony.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  It's granted.  Do you have any

     8           objection?  Before I grant it, we should hear.  Does the

     9           Government have any objection?

    10                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor, we don't have any

    11           objection.

    12                    COURT CLERK:  Could you identify yourself for the

    13           record?

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, I will.  I'm Patricia Russotto. 

    15           I represent the Department of Justice as well.

    16                    Your Honor, we do not have any cross-examination for

    17           Mr. Kuromiya this afternoon.  We do not have any objection to

    18           having his declaration admitted into evidence.  However, we

    19           do reserve the right to submit deposition testimony.  This

    20           witness was deposed over the weekend and we do have -- intend

    21           to admit or present to the Court deposition excerpts.  And

    22           we're satisfied that those excerpts will sufficiently address

    23           the issues that Mr. Kuromiya raises in his declaration.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Do the plaintiffs have any

    25           objection?

                                                                           170

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  We do not, your Honor, with the

     2           understanding that we could submit alternative pages, if

     3           necessary, of the same deposition.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I think the Federal Rules always so

     5           provide, don't they?

     6                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor --

     7                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  The only other --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  You do have an objection?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I might, your Honor, because it creates

    10           a problem for us.  If they put in pages, particular portions

    11           of deposition now, we might want to do some live redirect and

    12           we wouldn't know what their pages are.  If they could tell us

    13           those pages now, we could make that judgment now.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ms. Russotto, could you maybe now

    15           give us some idea of the areas or the paragraphs of his

    16           declaration that these excerpts would rebut or somehow

    17           qualify?

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Your Honor, I'm really not prepared

    19           to do that this afternoon.  We're going to be submitting the

    20           deposition transcript to address -- to address the areas that

    21           have been raised.  I point out that the plaintiffs had the

    22           opportunity during the deposition to do redirect testimony

    23           and that it was in our view clear during the deposition

    24           process that we proceeded with that process on the

    25           understanding that some of these depositions would be

                                                                           171

     1           admitted into evidence or would substitute for actual live

     2           testimony during the hearing, and that the plaintiffs did

     3           have the opportunity to do that kind of redirect and did not

     4           do it.

     5                    MR. ENNIS:  Your --

     6                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is the Government finished with its

     7           position on this so that we won't go back and forth.  Okay.

     8                    Mr. Ennis?

     9                    MR. ENNIS:  I don't mean to be raising a possible

    10           false alarm.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  No, go ahead.

    12                    MR. ENNIS:  I think it will be perfectly acceptable

    13           from our plaintiffs for Mr. Kuromiya to leave the stand and

    14           probably whatever we want to put in, other portions of the

    15           deposition transcript will probably be just fine.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, okay, you understand that we

    17           may have some questions now.

    18                    MR. ENNIS:  Yes.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  So you're not going to

    20           ask any questions now?

    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, we're not.  We would, however,

    22           reserve the right to do redirect or recross, rather, in this

    23           case if the Court -- depending on what the Court's questions

    24           are.  And also I would say that if the plaintiffs feel like

    25           we have submitted deposition excerpts that they're not --

                                                                           172

     1           that they don't believe are representative of the entire

     2           deposition, they're certainly free to submit their own

     3           excerpts as well.

     4                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Sir, would you state and spell

     5           your name, please?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  My name is Kiyoshi Kuromiya.  That's 

     7           K-I-Y-O-S-H-I, last name K-U-R-O-M-I-Y-A.

     8                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Thank you.  Would you please

     9           raise your right hand?

    10                    KIYOSHI KUROMIYA, Sworn.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Dalzell?

    12                                 DIRECT EXAMINATION

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Critical Path Project, Incorporated,

    14           that's a nonprofit entity?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  No, we're a sub S corporation.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A sub S, so it's a for-profit

    17           enterprise?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Actually we -- we work through a

    19           nonprofit organization, but it's a partnership that we set up

    20           by very early on.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  A partnership with whom?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  An individual who is no longer around.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  And the Critical Path AIDS

    24           Project, is that just a division or is that a sub 501(c)3

    25           organization, nonprofit tax exempt organization?

                                                                           173

     1                    THE WITNESS:  We work through AIDS Information

     2           Network of Philadelphia who handle our financial affairs. 

     3           We're a small organization, one employing myself and one

     4           part-time technical person.

     5                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  If you could look on page

     6           two, paragraph six of your declaration, do you have it there?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  I don't.

     8                    (Pause in proceedings.)

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  I'm very curious to know, how

    10           exactly does the technology work?  How do you build up this

    11           access to, as you say here, thousands of data bases that go

    12           through your Web page?  Could you just explain that to me?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Okay.  We began in 1989 with a 24-hour

    14           AIDS treatment hotline, specifically for persons with AIDS. 

    15           And we felt that we could provide the kinds of information

    16           that persons with AIDS could not get from other sources.  I

    17           am a person with AIDS myself, and I am also a primary care

    18           provider.

    19                    We began in 1992 with a small computer bulletin

    20           board system.  We have about 1500 people registered under

    21           that system.  We found it was quite effective in getting

    22           information out, both prevention and treatment information to

    23           individuals.

    24                    We also found it important in providing data that

    25           was not easily accessible from other sources, such as full-

                                                                           174

     1           text clinical trials information and information on

     2           alternative treatments.  And we found that neither Government

     3           sources nor clinicians within the community were able to

     4           provide that kind of information, so we found it very useful.

     5                    From that point we began expanding the number of

     6           people who were on our system, and in May of '95 we set up a

     7           Web site and later last year we became an Internet service

     8           provider.  We host a number of Web pages through our system. 

     9           We provide free Internet access for both individuals and

    10           grass roots organizations in the Philadelphia area who might

    11           not otherwise be able to access this information.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So what your Web page links do is

    13           they provide the people who are interested in this site and

    14           the information with a free access to all this information;

    15           is that correct?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And in addition to the information

    18           that you physically assembled yourself, what I'm trying to

    19           get at is you seem to have entered into a number of

    20           arrangements, thousands of them, with institutions including

    21           research institutions, correct?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  How do you do that?  I'm just

    24           wondering how hard it is to do that and how you go about

    25           doing that.

                                                                           175

     1                    THE WITNESS:  It's very easy.  For example, for

     2           someone that wants to locate information at specific research

     3           institutions, we might link to the biosciences database of

     4           links at Harvard University.  And there are many hundreds of

     5           links on that one site.  Through that we have access to

     6           research institutions all over the world.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you --

     8                    THE WITNESS:  For chemistry sites, we would access

     9           them through UCLA.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And how do you get the access?  I

    11           mean how do you physically do that?  Do you write them, do

    12           you call them on the telephone?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  I write the HTML code and we include

    14           that database or that set of links or single links or a

    15           particular document, whatever it is, that's available on the

    16           Internet and provide it for people who use our system.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you say here that you average at

    18           least in the month from February 4 through March 4 of 1996

    19           3,300 accesses per day?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, since February 8th,

    22           1996, when President Clinton signed the law in question here,

    23           when he signed that legislation?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Have you all changed anything in the

                                                                           176

     1           way you communicate information to users?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  No.  We're constantly updating our Web

     3           site, but no, we haven't changed anything.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And if this panel were to find that

     5           the law was constitutional, okay, would you have to make any

     6           changes in the way you operate?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I'm not sure how to interpret

     8           that law.  I do not know what indecent means.  I don't know

     9           what patently offensive means in terms of providing life

    10           saving and life promoting information to persons with AIDS or

    11           persons at high risk for contracting AIDS, including

    12           teenagers.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That is, people under 18?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So, I don't think you've answered my

    16           question.  You don't know how you would change or you do know

    17           how you'd change?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, my -- as a person with AIDS,

    19           first and foremost is my mission to provide easily

    20           accessible, easy to understand information for people who are

    21           either infected with AIDS or at high risk for contracting

    22           AIDS.  We see that it is a growing situation.  The White

    23           House issued last week a report on the growing epidemic among

    24           young people in this country.  We also know that it's the

    25           leading cause of death for people between the ages of 25 and

                                                                           177

     1           44 in this country and in other countries, and particularly

     2           in minority communities and communities that I'm interested

     3           in providing this information for.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So do I interpret your answer as

     5           saying that you will just take the risk that you'll be

     6           prosecuted, or will you change something?

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't know how to interpret. 

     8           I don't know how this Court interprets the indecency and

     9           patently offensive.  I personally find this life-saving

    10           information.  I don't know how it could be interpreted

    11           otherwise.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Fine.  That's all I have.

    13                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I have no questions.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have only one.  Did this White

    15           House report provide any information as to the number of

    16           people who are HIV positive below the age of 18 in this

    17           country?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Well, basically what we get from this

    19           report is the fact that something like 25 percent of all the

    20           people infected with HIV in this country which is

    21           approximately one million people, although that may be

    22           undercounting somewhat.  25 percent of those individuals were

    23           infected while they were very young, either below the age of

    24           18 or shortly thereafter.

    25                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your statistics I thought in your

                                                                           178

     1           affidavit went up to 20 something, and I'm trying to, since

     2           our interest here is in young people --

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Well --

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If you don't know, just please say

     5           you don't know.  I'm not trying to --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  It's paragraph 22.

     7                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I --

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me, let me finish the

     9           question.  But that was to the age of 20 and then you go on

    10           to the age of 15 to 24 throughout the world, and I'm really

    11           asking about our universe here, which is this country and

    12           below the age of 18.  And all I want to know is do we have

    13           figures that are segregated that show the number of people

    14           below that age who currently are infected with -- who are HIV

    15           positive.

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Yeah.  We do have some information.  I

    17           can provide the Court with some of that information.  On the

    18           other hand, I must say that HIV is a disease that extends

    19           over a long period of time.  A person does not show any

    20           symptoms for something between seven and ten years after

    21           infection.  That's why I provided the figures that extended

    22           up into the early 20s.

    23                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.  Have our

    24           questions elicited any questions from counsel?

    25                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Yes, one or two, your Honor.

                                                                           179

     1                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

     2           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:

     3           Q   Good afternoon, Mr. Kuromiya.  I just want to ask you a

     4           couple of questions to pick up on some of the questions that

     5           the judges have asked you here.

     6           A   Yes.

     7           Q   I believe you had been asked about how exactly your

     8           organization links to other organizations.  That's through a

     9           hypertext link, correct?

    10           A   That's correct.

    11           Q   So that's something you would just click on.  It comes up

    12           on your screen as a highlighted, in a color, and you just

    13           click on that --

    14           A   Yes.

    15           Q   -- and that takes you to another location, right?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And you write the HTML code yourself for those hot links?

    18           A   I do.

    19           Q   And you taught yourself to write HTML code, right?

    20           A   That's correct.

    21           Q   And that's something that it's your understanding is

    22           going to become easier as new software comes out to help

    23           people write HTML code, right?

    24           A   Probably.

    25           Q   You're aware that there is that software that's coming

                                                                           180

     1           out, though, right?

     2           A   There's a lot of software coming out making it easier and

     3           easier, yes.

     4           Q   Let me ask you also about a statement in paragraph five

     5           of your declaration.  Do you have a copy of your declaration

     6           in front of you?

     7           A   Yes.

     8           Q   Where you talk about your Web pages during the period

     9           from February 4, 1996 to March 4, 1996 were accessed

    10           approximately 98,000 times average 3300 times per day.  Does

    11           that tran -- are you talking about 3300 hits there?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   How are those measured?

    14           A   Those are measured when someone calls up under their

    15           screen a document on our site or accesses our site from

    16           another site.

    17           Q   Okay.  

    18                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Nothing further, your Honor.

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  No further questions, your Honor.

    20                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.

    21                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

    22                    JUDGE DALZELL:  One other question, following up on

    23           a question Mr. -- were you here this morning?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That Mr. Baron was asking and Mr.

                                                                           181

     1           Brenner.  When there was talk about encoding your URL with a

     2           self rating system, did you hear that testimony?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I did.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And to use the motion picture

     5           parlance, that NC17, R, PG13, that sort of thing, okay? 

     6           Let's just use that for my hypothetical, all right?  Would

     7           you agree that there's material in your Web site that would

     8           be NC17?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  No.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So you would not -- if you were

    11           required to self rate your system, you would not self rate it

    12           NC17?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  No.  Our material is designed for all

    14           ages and it may be explicit, but it's information that's

    15           necessary to protect oneself from contracting a sexually

    16           transmitted disease.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's what I'm getting at.  You

    18           would not want, affirmatively, you would not want to rate

    19           your Web page in such a way that young people could not

    20           access it?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  I would not want to deny young people

    22           access to information that was necessary to protect them from

    23           infection from a potentially fatal disease.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes, that's what I'm getting at.  So

    25           even if somebody told you you should do that, you wouldn't do

                                                                           182

     1           it.

     2                    THE WITNESS:  I can only repeat what I said.  I know

     3           the difficulties of living with this disease.  I've been

     4           infected for something like 15 years, and have had full-blown

     5           AIDS by the CDC definition since 1993.  And yes, I would want

     6           to protect people who are potentially going to contract HIV

     7           and we know that from current Government statistics that two-

     8           thirds of all high school students are sexually active.  And

     9           so yes, we're providing the information for people who are

    10           sexually active and are potentially exposing themselves,

    11           maybe because of lack of information or the lack of a source

    12           where they can get anonymously information that they need to

    13           protect themselves.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, thank you.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Just so I understand and I think we

    16           put on the table what you're talking about that might

    17           potentially come -- that some people might think come within

    18           the statute are safe sex practices.  Is that really what

    19           we're talking about?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  We're talking about safer sex

    21           practices and descriptions of those practices and how to

    22           protect oneself from HIV infection or infection from other

    23           sexually transmitted diseases.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And that's the universe of what you

    25           think is potentially at risk in the material for which you

                                                                           183

     1           are the source?

     2                    THE WITNESS:  Well, I don't -- someone might find

     3           material that we find very important as being offensive to

     4           them.  I have no control over that.  So that would --

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  But I'm just trying to find out

     6           what we're talking about.  And what we're talking about then

     7           are certain kinds of sexual practices and maybe some body

     8           parts, and is that the limit of what we're talking about?

     9                    THE WITNESS:  That's correct.  That's correct.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The depiction of body parts?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Possibly.

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you very much.

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honor, if I might ask one follow-

    14           up question based on the Court's question.

    15                                RECROSS-EXAMINATION

    16           BY MR. HANSEN:

    17           Q   Mr. Kuromiya, when your site discusses safer sex

    18           practices, what language do you use to explain to people how

    19           to use those safer sex practices?

    20           A   We use language that they will understand.  I think that

    21           this may create a problem for some people, since people may

    22           not have the education to understand clinical language.  So

    23           we may use street language, we may use colloquial language in

    24           describing the -- what is high risk behavior and how to

    25           protect oneself.

                                                                           184

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you.  Thank you, your Honor.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  One more question.  I was just

     3           wondering if you make any effort not to use colloquial

     4           language over the years?  Do you try in any way to explain

     5           the proper terminology?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  My experience comes from --

     7                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I understand what you mean by

     8           street language, and it's much easier to explain that way

     9           than by using the technical terms, I fully understand that. 

    10           But --

    11                    THE WITNESS:  My experience comes from what I'm able

    12           to -- what communicates via my hotline.  I have for over six

    13           years answered something like 10 to 20 hotline calls from

    14           very concerned individuals of varying ages --

    15                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  No, I just asked simply the

    16           question do you make any effort what the proper --

    17                    THE WITNESS:  I use whatever language is appropriate

    18           to communicate to that individual.  And I don't go out of my

    19           way to use street language.

    20                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  All right, I'm just curious.  All

    21           right, thank you.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Gentlemen, ladies?  No. 

    23           Thank you very much.

    24                    (Witness excused.)

<H2>Testimony of Patricia Nell Warren -- publisher, Wildcat Press</H2>
<STRONG>March 21, 1996</STRONG> 
<PRE>

    25                    MS. BEESON:  Good afternoon, your Honors.  I am Ann

                                                                           185

     1           Beeson and I'm another of the attorneys for the ACLU

     2           plaintiffs in this case.  And we now call as our next witness

     3           Patricia Nell Warren.

     4                    We have been informed by the Government that they do

     5           not wish to cross-examine Ms. Warren, and so we therefore

     6           offer into evidence the affidavit which she signed on the

     7           15th of March and which was filed in this case on the 19th.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection by the

     9           Government?

    10                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor, this is basically the

    11           same situation as with Mr. Kuromiya.  We're prepared to

    12           accept the declaration being entered into evidence, but

    13           subject to our ability to submit deposition testimony.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is there any objection to that

    15           by the plaintiffs?

    16                    MR. COPPOLINO:  No objection.

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, fine.

    18                    MS. BEESON:  We now make her available for the Court

    19           to question, if they wish.

    20                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Good afternoon, ma'am.  Would you

    21           please state and spell your name for the record?

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Patricia, P-A-T-R-I-C-I-A, Nell, N-E-

    23           L-L, Warren, W-A-R-R-E-N.

    24                    PATRICIA NELL WARREN, Affirmed.

    25                                 DIRECT EXAMINATION

                                                                           186

     1                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Ms. Warren, one thing I'm not clear

     2           about with respect to Wildcat Press, you are -- you have an

     3           interest in Wildcat Press, as I understand in your

     4           declaration?

     5                    THE WITNESS:   A little bit of history, I am an

     6           author that has published a number of books over the years

     7           and I recently made a decision to go independent and to

     8           publish my own books instead of relying on trade publishers. 

     9           So Wildcat Press is my own company co-owned with a business

    10           partner.  I publish my own books, new books, old books,

    11           getting them back in print.  We will also publish books by

    12           other people.  It is what is referred to in the trade as a

    13           small press.

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, Wildcat Press as you say

    15           in your declaration has a Web site, right?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Now, your books, let's just talk

    18           about your books.  What do you have on that site, excerpts? 

    19           I wasn't clear.  Or chapters or summaries or what about your

    20           books?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  We do two things with the Web site. 

    22           One, it's a place where people can come, they can learn more

    23           about the company, my books, what they're about.  They can

    24           also buy books directly off of the Web site through a credit

    25           card ordering apparatus.  So there are two excerpts, the

                                                                           187

     1           first chapters from two of my best-known books that are

     2           available for people to access and read and possibly interest

     3           them in buying the books.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, and how long are those

     5           excerpts?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  They are -- consist of the entire

     7           first chapters of the books, so they are like one long

     8           subpage.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So I guess as the copyright owner at

    10           least of those books you could make a decision, could you

    11           not, to put your whole book on line?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  I could.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Would you ever do that?

    14                    THE WITNESS:  If I thought it was a good idea, I

    15           definitely could do that.

    16                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  But at this point you're

    17           using the on line service to sell books, correct?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Correct.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You mention in your declaration that

    20           the credit card company, as I understand it, charges a dollar

    21           service fee --

    22                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- for processing.  Is that for the

    24           verification, as a fee for that, or what is that dollar?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  That is the fee for the -- that we are

                                                                           188

     1           charged for each user who wants to log into that particular

     2           feature and use their credit card.  It's a secure ordering

     3           device.  I believe there are several on the market.  This one

     4           is called First Virtual, which they can use a MasterCard or

     5           Visa credit card.  And we pay a fee for them to use that each

     6           time it occurs.

     7                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Were you here this morning?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You may have heard a lot of colloquy

    10           about verifying credit cards.  At your Web site, can you

    11           verify on line or do you have to go off line to verify?

    12                    THE WITNESS:  I'm not a technical person, and I'm

    13           not actually the technical person that runs this whole thing,

    14           so I can't tell you exactly how it works, but it is handled

    15           by the server that we operate off of, which is Southern

    16           California Gay Wired, and they're the ones that process it. 

    17           That's mostly what I can tell you.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  So this server, Gay Wired,

    19           handles all of that for your company?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Another line of questions I have for

    22           you that I'm very curious about, you say at paragraph 17 of

    23           your declaration that you've helped create an on line

    24           magazine, an E-zine as you call it called Youth Arts; is that

    25           correct?

                                                                           189

     1                    THE WITNESS:  That is correct.

     2                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you said that you've also

     3           created print magazines, a print magazine called Campus

     4           Courier; is that correct?

     5                    THE WITNESS:   I assisted in creating that. 

     6           Actually it never came to fruition, but that was many years

     7           ago.

     8                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, let me ask you this.  This is

     9           what I'm most curious about.  Is it easier to start an E-zine

    10           than a print magazine?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    12                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Why is that?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  Because the material costs of putting

    14           out a print magazine, standard print media, you're looking at

    15           all of the costs of photography, and art and paper costs and

    16           printing costs and so forth.  It generally is much more

    17           expensive than the cost of putting up a publication on line.

    18                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And where is the E-zine posted?  How

    19           do you access it?

    20                    THE WITNESS:  Through a URL.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Thank you.

    22                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Judge Buckwalter.

    23                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I'm still looking through --

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  Is it accurate that your

    25           material would be considered gay and lesbian literature, the

                                                                           190

     1           material that you authored?  I gathered that from the

     2           declaration, is that correct?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Are you asking about my personal

     4           writing?

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your personal books, yes.

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Not all of my books, but most of what

     7           I'm known for would be called gay literature.

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And would that include also books

     9           like Truman Capote's Other Voices, Other Rooms and some other

    10           books by Truman Capote?

    11                    THE WITNESS:  Well, let me -- I'd like to make sure

    12           I understand your question you're asking.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would that be considered gay and

    14           lesbian literature?

    15                    THE WITNESS:  I haven't read that particular book,

    16           but it has been mentioned in that connection, as far as I

    17           remember.

    18                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And is it your understanding that

    19           literature in that genre might be viewed as subject to the

    20           two provisions of the statute that are at issue in this case?

    21                    THE WITNESS:  I'm concerned about people in this

    22           country who view the entire subject of writing about gay and

    23           lesbian life as patently offensive.  Their opinions and

    24           feelings go way beyond the questions of the seven dirty words

    25           of the FCC, and I am concerned that there could conceivably

                                                                           191

     1           be complaints made on the basis that the entire subject

     2           matter is patently offensive.

     3                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And at the moment to your knowledge

     4           is such literature available to young people in public

     5           libraries, people under 18?

     6                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, it is.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

     8                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  And you're concerned about

     9           patently offensive, even with the extra language that's added

    10           in this statute there?  I mean it just doesn't say patently

    11           offensive, it says patently offensive, sexual or excretory

    12           activities or organs.  Is that still a concern to you?

    13                    THE WITNESS:  My concern is with how some individual

    14           or group of individuals might choose to interpret that in the

    15           course of bringing charges against me with the Justice

    16           Department.

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Okay.  I don't think I have any

    18           other questions.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Have our questions elicited any

    20           questions from counsel?

    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, your Honor.

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  No, your Honor.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Thank you for coming up.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.

    25                    THE WITNESS:  Thank you.

                                                                           192

                                                                           192

     1                    (Witness excused.)

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, there are two additional

     3           witnesses that we -- whose declarations we have proffered. 

     4           We were advised -- that is, Christine Soto and Hunter Allen. 

     5           We were advised by the Government that they neither wish to

     6           depose nor to cross-examine either of those witnesses.  They

     7           are both young people who are members of Youth Arts News, the

     8           E-zine that Ms. Warren runs.  Because of their age we have

     9           not brought them to Philadelphia.  We can make them available

    10           if the Court wishes, but at this point I'd like to move their

    11           declarations into evidence.  The declarations were previously

    12           filed.  They were attested to on March 7, 1996.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We'll hear from the Government.

    14                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  We have no objection, your Honor.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Then that will be admitted.  Is

    16           that it?

    17                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I have no desire to have them

    18           here.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  We have no desire to proceed

    20           with them.  Thank you.  No questions from the Court.

    21                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.  In that case,

    22           the plaintiffs' next witness is Dr. William Stayton.

    23                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Good afternoon.  Will you please

    24           state and spell your name for the record?

    25                    THE WITNESS:  William --

                                                                           193

     1                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Will you please move over and

     2           stand close to the mike?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  William ...

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  It appears we have one minor

     5           housekeeping problem.  If we might have just one moment, your

     6           Honors?

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Of course.

     8                    (Pause in proceedings.)

     9                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honor, we would just note for

    10           the record that the witness is being called out of order.  We

    11           had been told a different order, and we will not object, but

    12           we had prepared for a different witness for this time, and

    13           now since we have the burden to go forward with the cross-

    14           examination, we have to change our preparation.

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Let me just ask you, are you

    16           prepared to go forward, or did you -- because I gather this

    17           witness is from another city.

    18                    MR. HANSEN:  This witness is from Philadelphia.

    19                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, he's --

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  He has a 4:15 class which I'm --

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  He has a 4:15 class --

    22                    MR. HANSEN:  Or a 4:30 class which I'm trying to

    23           help him with, if possible.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Mr. Hansen and Mr. Ennis, in view of

    25           the constraints on Dr. Stayton's time as well as Mr.

                                                                           194

     1           Coppolino's concerns, Mr. Croneberger is here, is he not?

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  He is.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And you said to us before we started

     4           that the Government, at least at that time, had not intended

     5           to cross-examine him.  I certainly have some questions.  I

     6           believe my colleagues do.  Could we use the time productively

     7           with Mr. Croneberger?

     8                    MR. HANSEN:  Mr. Croneberger is Mr. Ennis' witness,

     9           your Honor.  I'll let him respond.

    10                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.

    11                    MR. ENNIS:  Your Honor, that would be fine with the

    12           ALA plaintiffs.  But my understanding is the Government was

    13           expecting the next witness to be Donna Hoffman.  And I don't

    14           care --

    15                    JUDGE DALZELL:  But she'll go on tomorrow, I mean,

    16           so the Government surely isn't prejudiced by that.

    17                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Well, that's fine.  If the Court

    18           would prefer Mr. Croneberger now, that's fine with us.

    19                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Just so we use the time

    20           productively, that's all.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is that all right with Mr. Stayton,

    22           Dr. Stayton?

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Well, I would like Dr. Stayton not to

    24           have to come back tomorrow.  I'd like to --

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, counsel is not prepared to

                                                                           195

     1           cross-examine him based on this.

     2                    MR. COPPOLINO:  We don't object, we'll go forward.

     3                    JUDGE DALZELL:  What's that?

     4                    MR. COPPOLINO:  It's out of order, but we'd rather

     5           go forward with Mr. Stayton now than any other --

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  All right.  Well, okay, fine.  We're

     7           just trying to be accommodating to you.

     8                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Will you now state your name?

     9                    (Much laughter.)

    10                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Touche.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Touche.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  It is still William R. Stayton, S-T-A-

    13           Y-T-O-N.  (Laughter.)

    14                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  And would you please raise your

    15           right hand?

    16                    WILLIAM R. STAYTON, Sworn.

    17                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  Thank you.  Please be seated.

    18                    MR. COPPOLINO:  Your Honors, I move into evidence

    19           the declaration of William R. Stayton, attested to on 

    20           March 14, 1996, and previously filed as his direct testimony.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Is there any objection by the

    22           Government?

    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No objection, your Honor, subject to

    24           cross-examination, of course.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Well, I have a question for Mr.

                                                                           196

     1           Hansen.  What exactly -- I assume that Dr. Stayton is being

     2           offered as an expert witness?

     3                    MR. HANSEN:  That's correct, your Honor.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  And it's not exactly clear to me the

     5           precise areas of expertise he's being offered for.

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  He's being offered for the value, to

     7           testify concerning the value of material about sex for

     8           minors.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  The value of material about sex --

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  For minors.

    11                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Social utility, in other words?

    12                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, that's correct, your Honor.

    13                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  Now, having specified that,

    14           Ms. Russotto, do you have any voir dire that you'd like to

    15           ask?

    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Not at this time, your Honor,

    17           although we would ask some latitude to explore the bases for

    18           Mr. Stayton's opinions about the availability and

    19           appropriateness of certain sexually explicit material for

    20           minors.

    21                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay.  But you don't object to him

    22           offering opinions in this area of expertise?

    23                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  No, I do not.

    24                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Okay, fine.  That's all we needed to

    25           know for now.  Of course you can ask those questions.

                                                                           197

     1                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honor.

     2                                 CROSS-EXAMINATION

     3           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:

     4           Q   Good afternoon, Dr. Stayton.

     5           A   Good afternoon.

     6           Q   Dr. Stayton, you are a psychologist and sex therapist

     7           here in the Philadelphia area; is that right?

     8           A   That is correct.

     9           Q   And your current practice includes about 20 clients a

    10           week; is that right?

    11           A   That is correct.

    12           Q   And your practice is now almost exclusively adult

    13           couples; is that correct?

    14           A   That is correct.

    15           Q   You have maybe one or two minors, right?

    16           A   That is correct.

    17           Q   But mostly adults.

    18           A   That is correct.

    19           Q   In preparation for your testimony here today, you have

    20           reviewed the affidavits that have been filed by the

    21           plaintiffs in the ACLU action; is that right?

    22           A   That's correct.

    23           Q   And I believe you've also reviewed some information from

    24           the Web sites of two of the ACLU plaintiffs; is that correct?

    25           A   That's correct.

                                                                           198

     1           Q   And those would be Stop Prison Rape, that's one?

     2           A   Yes.

     3           Q   And the Safer Sex Page?

     4           A   Yes.

     5           Q   From what you've read of the plaintiffs' materials, the

     6           information that they've made available on the Internet

     7           covers a variety of issues regarding human sexuality, doesn't

     8           it?

     9           A   Yes, it does.

    10           Q   For example, the Safer Sex Page includes information

    11           about safer -- safe sex practices, right?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   And it of course talks about sexual activities in that

    14           context as well, correct?

    15           A   That's correct.

    16           Q   And these would include things like information about

    17           conception, right?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   Information about birth control?

    20           A   Yes.

    21           Q   Safer sex?

    22           A   Yes.

    23           Q   AIDS?

    24           A   Practices, mm-hmm.

    25           Q   Yes, safer sex practices, yes.

                                                                           199

     1           A   Mm-hmm.

     2           Q   And the Stop Prisoner Rape page would contain information

     3           about -- explicit information about prison rape, correct?

     4           A   That's correct.

     5           Q   And the Critical Path AIDS Project as we've heard from

     6           Mr. Kuromiya contains information about AIDS as well, right?

     7           A   That's correct.

     8           Q   And you've reviewed all of those, correct?

     9           A   That's correct.

    10           Q   Now, in your view, these discussions of sex and sexuality

    11           that we've been talking about, that's information that is

    12           valuable for minors to have, correct?

    13           A   I believe so, yes.

    14           Q   And it's information that you believe is valuable because

    15           of its educational value, right?

    16           A   Yes.

    17           Q   And you'd agree, wouldn't you, that it's important to

    18           provide minors with accurate information about sex and

    19           sexuality, right?

    20           A   Right.

    21           Q   In fact, providing accurate information about sex and

    22           sexuality can actually prevent minors from making bad choices

    23           about those issues, right?

    24           A   That's correct.

    25           Q   So providing inaccurate information, inaccurate

                                                                           200

     1           information about sex and human sexuality, that could

     2           actually be harmful to minors, couldn't it?

     3           A   Giving them inaccurate --

     4           Q   Giving them inaccurate information.

     5           A   Could not be helpful, right.

     6           Q   Right.  Now, Dr. Stayton, you're familiar with Playboy

     7           Magazine, aren't you?

     8           A   Yes.

     9           Q   And you're familiar with Penthouse, right?

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   And Hustler?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   And you're aware that these magazines contain sexually

    14           explicit images, mostly of women, correct?

    15           A   That's correct.

    16           Q   In your opinion, viewing these types of sexually explicit

    17           pictures is not harmful to minors, right?

    18           A   I believe that's true.

    19           Q   But you'd still prefer that your children didn't see

    20           them, right?

    21           A   Playboy and Penthouse and --

    22           Q   Yes.

    23           A   No, it doesn't matter to me.

    24           Q   It doesn't matter to you?  Dr. Stayton, do you recall

    25           that I took your deposition --

                                                                           201

     1           A   Right.

     2           Q   -- on a Sunday afternoon, correct?

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I'm going to approach with a copy.

     4                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Yes.

     5           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:

     6           Q   And would you turn to page 58 of that deposition, please?

     7           A   Mm-hmm.

     8           Q   Do you recall that we were discussing some films that you

     9           use in your therapy class, correct?  You recall that we were

    10           discussing some films --

    11           A   Yes, yes.

    12           Q   And I had asked you whether or not -- and you had said

    13           that it would be valuable to minors to show those types -- to

    14           show the films in a -- I'm sorry, let me strike that.

    15                    I had asked you if it was valuable to show certain

    16           types of sexually explicit films to minors, right?

    17           A   Yes.

    18           Q   And I had also asked you whether or not it was important

    19           that those films be shown in an educational context, correct?

    20           A   Correct.

    21           Q   Okay.  And I asked you, quote, and this is at the bottom

    22           of page 58, &quot;What if it were not shown in an educational kind

    23           of context?&quot;  And you answered me, &quot;Most often it is.  Most

    24           often -- you know, kids get together and they show their

    25           magazines and that stuff, and they show stuff I wouldn't want

                                                                           202

     1           my kid to see, but they see it.  I would much rather it come

     2           in the context of my being able to interpret it and talk

     3           about it and answer questions about it.  I think children

     4           often see material I would prefer my kids not to see, but I

     5           don't have any control over that.&quot;

     6                    So this is material you would prefer your kids

     7           didn't see, isn't it?

     8           A   There is material I would prefer them not to see.  That's

     9           not a blanket that I don't want them to see any of the

    10           material or the material that you mentioned from like

    11           Playboy.

    12           Q   Dr. Stayton --

    13           A   Yes.

    14           Q   -- do you have a set of the defendant's exhibits at the

    15           desk?  They should be at your feet there, I'm sorry.  Let me

    16           ask you, the second volume, the one that should be marked 46

    17           to 89.

    18           A   Okay.

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  If I might, your Honor, plaintiffs have

    20           not been supplied a copy with these exhibits.

    21                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  Oh, I'm sorry.

    22           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:

    23           Q   May I ask you to take a look at Defendant's Exhibits 70

    24           through 77.

    25           A   Okay.

                                                                           203

     1           Q   And you recall that -- well, take a look at them and let

     2           me know when you've reviewed them.

     3           A   I've seen these.

     4           Q   Okay.  You recall that these are the same photographs

     5           that we talked about during your deposition on Sunday,

     6           correct?

     7           A   That's correct.

     8           Q   Okay.  Now, you would agree, wouldn't you, that these are

     9           images of nude women in a variety of sexually explicit poses,

    10           correct?

    11           A   That's correct.

    12           Q   And you'd agree also, wouldn't you, that these images do

    13           not depict a healthy view of women as healthy sexual beings,

    14           right?

    15           A   I don't know about the word &quot;as healthy sexual beings.&quot; 

    16           I don't know anything about them --

    17           Q   Well, let me rephrase it then.  You would agree, wouldn't

    18           you, that these images don't depict a healthy view of women

    19           as sexual beings, do you?  Isn't that right?

    20           A   I think the women are often exploited, yes.

    21           Q   And you'd also agree that pictures like these reflect a

    22           socialization process that use women as sex objects, right?

    23           A   They can, but it's only one part of all the input that

    24           they get.

    25           Q   You would also agree, wouldn't you, that these sexually

                                                                           204

     1           suggestive images of women do not depict real life?  They're

     2           not representative of the real world.

     3           A   It depends upon whose world.  If a person is -- this is

     4           all they see, then it would be a part of their real world in

     5           terms of what they viewed.  It's not a part of their real

     6           world in terms of I don't know what kind of input they get

     7           from other sources.

     8           Q   All right, well, let me go back to your deposition

     9           testimony --

    10           A   Sure.

    11           Q   -- on page 127.  You recall that we were talking about

    12           these very images.  And I asked you what you meant, and you

    13           said that this fits into the socialization process.  I'm

    14           sorry, I'm at line 10 on 127.

    15           A   Right.

    16           Q   What do you mean, you said this fits into the

    17           socialization process?  What do you mean by that and by

    18           &quot;this&quot; you're talking about the exhibits.  You said, &quot;The

    19           exhibits, I want my children or all children to have a

    20           healthy view of women as sexual beings and of men as sexual

    21           beings.

    22                    &quot;Question:  What is it about those pictures that you

    23           think may not promote a healthy view of women and men as

    24           healthy sexual beings?  

    25                    &quot;Well, it's so typical of the way people are

                                                                           205

     1           socialized that women are like sex objects.  You know, this

     2           just doesn't depict real life.&quot;

     3                    That's accurate, right?

     4           A   Yes, that's accurate.

     5           Q   And yet you don't believe that exposing minors to these

     6           types of sexually explicit images is harmful to them, do you?

     7           A   Not in and of itself, no.

     8           Q   And you don't think that minors would be socialized to

     9           view women as sex objects by exposure to these kinds of

    10           images?

    11           A   No.  They're going to get that from other parts of their

    12           input, from family, society, peer group.

    13           Q   And you don't believe, though, that these pictures would

    14           have any -- would be a factor in socializing people to view

    15           women as sex objects?

    16           A   In and of itself, no.  As a part of a total kind of

    17           input, it's a factor.

    18           Q   And you don't believe that minors viewing these images

    19           would be misled into believing that they do depict real life,

    20           do you?

    21           A   Not if they're getting different information from outside

    22           of these.

    23           Q   So in your view there's no harm in allowing a ten-year-

    24           old to see these kinds of sexually explicit images?

    25           A   There's nothing inherently, right.

                                                                           206

     1           Q   I'm sorry, there's nothing inherently harmful about those

     2           images?

     3           A   Harmful about these images.

     4           Q   In your view there's no harm in allowing an eight-year-

     5           old to see those images, is there?

     6           A   There's nothing inherently harmful about sex.

     7           Q   I'm not -- well, okay.  I asked you about whether there

     8           was anything inherently harmful --

     9           A   About these pictures.

    10           Q   -- about viewing those images.

    11           A   No, there's nothing inherently harmful.

    12           Q   And you wouldn't have a problem if a six-year-old was

    13           exposed to those kinds of sexually explicit images, would

    14           you?

    15           A   No.  I would want to be the one to give my value system

    16           as I worked with my six-year-old or a six-year-old.  But

    17           there's nothing inherently harmful that would hurt a six-

    18           year-old.  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people have

    19           seen pictures like this and never been harmed.

    20           Q   Well, Dr. Stayton, you've never actually done any

    21           research into whether or not minors viewing these kind of

    22           pictures that can be downloaded from the Internet is harmful

    23           to them, have you?

    24           A   No, this is not a part of my research, right.

    25           Q   And, Dr. Stayton, we were discussing a moment ago some

                                                                           207

     1           films that you use in your sex therapy.  And I believe that

     2           you had told me during your deposition that those films

     3           involved depictions of sexual intercourse; is that right?

     4           A   Some of them do.  I -- a pharmaceutical company 20 years

     5           ago made a series of sex therapy films for us using real

     6           people in real situations, and I use these with couples.  And

     7           it starts with -- it's really a process of helping them to

     8           become sexually functional through offering them ways of

     9           pleasuring their partner, first non-genitally and then

    10           genitally and then through ways of having intercourse.

    11           Q   And these are sexually explicit films, right?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   And they do depict explicitly acts of sexual intercourse.

    14           A   They depict -- there's a film that does, when we get to

    15           that part of the therapy process.  But in the beginning it's

    16           how to do a face caress.  How to caress a person's body and

    17           give pleasure.  Things that, you know, lead up to being a

    18           good lover through intercourse.

    19           Q   And these films also contain explicit depictions of oral

    20           sex as well, don't they?

    21           A   We have films that do.  It's not a part of the regular

    22           process.  A lot of couples will ask about oral sex, and we

    23           then can show them a film that talks about oral sex, tells

    24           them whether it's healthy or how it's healthy, et cetera, so

    25           that they can be instructed.

                                                                           208

     1           Q   And these films that you've been talking about that do

     2           have the explicit depictions of sexual activity, you believe

     3           that it would be -- that it would not be harmful to show

     4           those to minors, right?

     5           A   No, right.

     6           Q   And so you believe it would be appropriate to show those

     7           films -- or would not be harmful to show those films to a 12-

     8           year-old.

     9           A   Right, or if a 12-year-old saw them.  I don't think it

    10           would do harm.  

    11           Q   And it would be all right --

    12           A   I don't think I would take a show 12-year-olds, in fact,

    13           it's against the law.  I wouldn't do it.

    14           Q   But you think it would do no harm if they did see it?

    15           A   Absolutely it wouldn't.

    16           Q   And you think it would be appropriate for a 10-year-old

    17           to see those films?

    18           A   Yeah.  My five-year-old saw them, when he was five years

    19           old.

    20           Q   Now, Dr. Stayton, you are familiar, are you not, with the

    21           Attorney General's Commission on Pornography Final Report

    22           dated July 1986, correct?

    23           A   Yes, I am.

    24           Q   Okay.  Would you please turn to Defendant's Exhibit 80?

    25           A   Yes.

                                                                           209

     1           Q   Would you please turn to page 343 of that study.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  What page?

     3                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  343, your Honor.

     4           BY MS. RUSSOTTO:

     5           Q   And just so the record is clear, this is a section of the

     6           Attorney General's Commission on Pornography Final Report,

     7           July 1986.  It's from the main body of the report.  It deals

     8           with nonviolent and nondegrading sexually explicit materials.

     9                    Now, on page 343 of the report the Commission begins

    10           discussing the potential harm to children from exposure to

    11           pornography, isn't that right?

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   And the Commission in the first sentence states, and

    14           looking at the first full paragraph of 343, &quot;Perhaps the most

    15           significant potential harm in this category is with respect

    16           to children.  We all agree that at least much, probably most,

    17           and maybe even all material in this category, regardless of

    18           whether it is harmful when used by adults only is harmful

    19           when it falls into the hands of children.&quot;  

    20                    Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Stayton?

    21           A   I do not.

    22           Q   Okay, let me ask you to turn to page 344.  And again I'm

    23           looking at the first full paragraph.  &quot;We have little doubt,&quot;

    24           the Commission states, &quot;We have little doubt that much of

    25           this material does find its way into the hands of children,

                                                                           210

     1           and to the extent that it does, we all agree that it is

     2           harmful.&quot;  Do you agree with that conclusion of the

     3           Commission?

     4           A   I do not agree.

     5           Q   And in the next sentence the Commission states, &quot;We may

     6           disagree about the extent to which people should as adults be

     7           tolerate&quot; -- I'm sorry.  &quot;We may disagree about the extent to

     8           which people should as adults be tolerated in engaging in

     9           sexual practices that differ from the norm, but we all agree

    10           about the question of the desirability of exposing children

    11           to most of this material.  And on that our unanimous

    12           agreement is that it is undesirable.&quot;  

    13                    Do you agree with that statement?

    14           A   I do not agree with that statement.

    15           Q   And then skipping down one sentence the Commission

    16           states, &quot;We may disagree among ourselves about the extent to

    17           which the effect on children should justify large scale

    18           restrictions for that reason alone, but again we all agree

    19           that if the question is simply harm and not the question of

    20           regulation by law that material in this category is, with few

    21           exceptions, generally harmful to the extent it finds its way

    22           into the hands of children.&quot;

    23                    Do you agree with that statement, Dr. Stayton?

    24           A   I do not agree with that statement.

    25                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  I don't have anything further.

                                                                           211

     1                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Thank you.  Is there any redirect?

     2                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, please, your Honor.

     3                                REDIRECT EXAMINATION

     4           BY MR. HANSEN:

     5           Q   Dr. Stayton, the Government began by asking you about the

     6           composition of your current clinical practice and its

     7           relationship to minors.  I'd like to have you explain what

     8           your experience has been in terms of sex education

     9           specifically with respect to minors.

    10           A   I'm a clergyperson.  And I started out my first six years

    11           through seminary and after as a youth minister, where I had

    12           charge of the entire program of a fairly large church.  I

    13           then had my own parish which was in Gloucester,

    14           Massachusetts, and there I also had the young people, as well

    15           as being the pastor of the church.  It was a small church. 

    16           And they asked me if I would have a sex education course for

    17           them.  I took what I had done with my youth at the church

    18           where I was a youth minister in the area of sex education and

    19           built a program where within a year I was going all over New

    20           England setting up sex education courses for churches and

    21           synagogues throughout the area.

    22                    I then started teaching on the seminary level and in

    23           a nursing school, and there they asked me if I would teach

    24           human sexuality education.  On the basis of this, getting

    25           more into it, I decided I might as well go all the way and

                                                                           212

     1           really get into this field, and I received a postdoctoral

     2           fellowship to the University of Pennsylvania to spend a year

     3           doing research on the interface between religion and

     4           sexuality.  I was hired at the end of that as the chief of

     5           family life and sex education for the Department of

     6           Psychiatry, Marriage Council of Philadelphia, part of the

     7           University of Pennsylvania.

     8                    And there I began working with churches throughout

     9           the country in developing human sexuality education.  I

    10           actually taught for a year the juniors and seniors at the

    11           Pennsylvania School for the Deaf and trained their teachers

    12           to teach human sexuality education.  And in the last 25 years

    13           since I started at Penn and I'm still there, I speak a lot at

    14           churches to their youth and to their congregations about

    15           human sexuality education.

    16           Q   Have you also worked with schools with respect to human

    17           sexuality education?

    18           A   Yes.

    19           Q   Would you discuss that, please?

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  Your Honors, Dr. Stayton's curriculum

    21           vitae is Plaintiff's Exhibit 3 which has previously been

    22           admitted into evidence.

    23           A   Well, first of all, I worked with my own children's

    24           school and did sex education for their high school.  I also

    25           supervised my students who were adult trainees in the field

                                                                           213

     1           as they do sex education programs, both at the school that my

     2           children attended and at other schools.

     3                    By the way, Penn is one of two universities in the

     4           whole world that gives a Ph.D. in human sexuality education. 

     5           And I've been on the faculty of that program since the

     6           beginning.  So actually a lot of my work is training teachers

     7           to teach, as well as helping them develop curriculum.

     8           Q   Do you hold any other appointments, faculty appointments,

     9           besides your appointment at Penn?

    10           A   Yes.  I'm professor at LaSalle University in five minutes

    11           (laughter) my class begins.  I do have a student assistant

    12           who's going to start the class.  And I teach in a pastoral

    13           counseling program there, and I teach both human sexuality

    14           and I teach marital therapy, which is what I'm teaching

    15           today.

    16           Q   Dr. Stayton, how closely are you supervised by the --

    17           what religion are you a minister of?

    18           A   I'm an American Baptist.

    19           Q   And how closely are you supervised by your denomination?

    20           A   About five or six years ago my denomination commissioned

    21           me as a minister in the field of human sexuality.  I don't

    22           know how many Baptists know that (laughter) but they did. 

    23           And as a result of that, I have a board of directors from my

    24           denomination that both oversee all the work that I do as well

    25           as set all my fees.

                                                                           214

     1           Q   Do you hold any specialty certifications in the area of

     2           sex education or sex therapy?

     3           A   I'm a certified sex educator and a certified sex

     4           therapist through the American Association of Sex Educators,

     5           Counselors and Therapists.  I'm also a supervisor, a

     6           certified supervisor.  I'm also president-elect of that

     7           organization.

     8           Q   The Government asked you about the Attorney General's

     9           report --

    10           A   Yes.

    11           Q   -- which is Defendant's Exhibit 80.

    12           A   Yes.

    13           Q   Can you just describe for me what the Attorney General's

    14           report reputation is in the field of those who teach and work

    15           in the area of sex education?

    16           A   First of all, let me say that there have been two

    17           Commissions on Obscenity and Pornography, Presidents'

    18           Commissions.  One came out in 1970 which was started by

    19           Johnson but was known as the Nixon Commission.  And it was a

    20           very well researched and documented Commission Report.  They

    21           had the best people in the field of human sexuality that

    22           spent a couple of years gathering data, getting the most

    23           reliable information that we have, and giving and put out

    24           that report.  It was an excellent report.  It is still highly

    25           regarded in the field.

                                                                           215

     1                    The Commission on Obscenity and Pornography that

     2           came out under Mr. Meese has -- in the field has absolutely

     3           no positive reputation at all.  It was felt to be politically

     4           motivated -- in the field we believe that it was politically

     5           motivated to counteract the very fine Commission Report that

     6           came out much earlier. 

     7                    Even our person, our sexologist, who was on that

     8           Committee quit during the gathering of that because of the

     9           way in which the Commission was doing their report.

    10           Q   Now, the Government asked you a number of questions about

    11           whether it would be harmful for minors to access sexually

    12           explicit information.  Would you explain why you concluded

    13           that it would not be harmful?

    14           A   First of all, we're born sexual.  It's a fact.  That's

    15           who we are.  And it's my belief that we then have a right to

    16           know what it is to be a sexual person.  I have a great value

    17           on knowledge.  I encourage my children at least to go through

    18           high school, I wanted them to go to college, I encouraged

    19           them to go to graduate school and I want them to take

    20           continuing education courses and I want them to read

    21           everything, because I have a value on knowledge.  It saddens

    22           me that we reverse that and say that somehow knowledge is bad

    23           for people or for children.  And I absolutely disagree with

    24           that.  

    25                    I believe that children have a right to know about

                                                                           216

     1           themselves as sexual beings, just as if a child was deaf,

     2           they would have the right to get information on how to

     3           communicate.  If they were blind they would have a right to

     4           the kinds of information that would help them to visualize

     5           what the world is about.  I believe that because we're sexual

     6           beings, we also have a right to know about that.  That's why

     7           children are curious.  That's why I want children to be able

     8           to get the information.  I believe it helps them to be not

     9           only more responsible people, but to make more responsible

    10           decisions as they get to the point where they have to make

    11           decisions about themselves.  And I want them to have the kind

    12           of information that will help them to make that decision.

    13                    I believe that a lot of the things that happen to

    14           children as they grow up and make the wrong decisions, a lot

    15           of that, and this is well researched, is based upon the fact

    16           that they're ignorant, and that they do not know what good

    17           information there is out there, and so a lot of their acting

    18           out is curiosity or rebellion against not knowing.

    19           Q   Who do you think ought to be the primary sex educator of

    20           children?

    21           A   Absolutely the parents are the primary.  There's -- I

    22           think there is total agreement on that.  Parents are the

    23           primary educators of our children.  The home, the church -- I

    24           mean the church, the school, the YMCA, the organizations as a

    25           part like Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, are only auxiliary

                                                                           217

     1           educators.  I really want them also to do their

     2           responsibility of providing that auxiliary education, because

     3           our children are bombarded by sexuality on all sides, and I

     4           want them to have good information and right information.

     5           Q   Do you think parents are part of sex education ought to

     6           impart their own personal values to their children?

     7           A   Absolutely.  I think that's a sacred right of parents.  I

     8           wanted to give my children my values, and impart that to

     9           them.  I didn't want them to get their values from somebody

    10           else until they knew what my values were, and could weigh my

    11           values against the other value systems that they're going to

    12           get a lot of stuff from.

    13           Q   The Government asked you about the safer sex information

    14           that you observed that was being spoken by the plaintiffs,

    15           some of the plaintiffs that I represent.  Why do you think

    16           particularly for teenagers it's important that they have

    17           access, indeed valuable for them to have access to safer sex

    18           information?

    19           A   We know that unfortunately 20 percent of all children

    20           across education, economic, racial guidelines are already

    21           sexually active, 13 and 14-year-olds.  We know that by 16 or

    22           17, 50 percent of our kids are already sexually active.  By

    23           18 or 19, 85 percent.  We do almost nothing to really prepare

    24           these kids and to help them.  

    25                    I agree with the former person who was here, I think

                                                                           218

     1           our teenagers are at highest risk for our sexually-

     2           transmitted diseases, and I want to do everything I can to

     3           protect them.  And I think they have a right to the

     4           information that will protect them.

     5                    One, I hope that by getting this information it will

     6           help them to be more responsible in making that decision to

     7           have sex.  Second, I hope that when they do make that

     8           decision they will then be able to use the right methods to

     9           protect themselves.

    10           Q   Do you recall at your deposition that the Government

    11           asked --

    12                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Excuse me just for a minute.

    13                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, your Honor.

    14                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  If Dr. Stayton doesn't mind going

    15           through his class, that's all right with the Court, but I

    16           just wondered if you had a lot more of Dr. Stayton on

    17           redirect that we shouldn't let him go and ask him to come

    18           back tomorrow.

    19                    MR. HANSEN:  I have no further questions, your

    20           Honor.

    21                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I didn't mean to cut you off,

    22           because the Court will have --

    23                    MR. HANSEN:  Well then let me ask one more.

    24                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Yes, but the Court will have

    25           questions.

                                                                           219

     1                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I think he's going to miss his

     2           class.  Is your class effectively missed?

     3                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, I think so.

     4                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay, all right.  So it's a fait

     5           accompli, and go on.

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  And now I've forgotten my last

     7           question, so I withdraw it.  (Laughter.)

     8                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  And there's no court reporter to

     9           read it back, I'm sorry.

    10                    MR. HANSEN:  I hadn't formulated it yet

    11           unfortunately, but I don't have any more questions, your

    12           Honor.  Thank you.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Oh, I'm truly sorry.  

    14                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Recross?

    15                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Recross?

    16                    MS. RUSSOTTO:  None, your Honor.

    17                    JUDGE DALZELL:  You mentioned some percentages,

    18           about 20 percent by age 13, --

    19                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    20                    JUDGE DALZELL:  -- 50 percent by I think you said 15

    21           or 16 --

    22                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    23                    JUDGE DALZELL:  85 percent by 18?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    25                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Where do those figures come from?

                                                                           220

     1                    THE WITNESS:  They come from a number of sources. 

     2           The Center For Population Options puts out figures like this. 

     3           The Planned Parenthood Association of America puts out

     4           figures.  There are dissertations that have looked at this

     5           type of activity.

     6                    JUDGE DALZELL:  Based on surveys, I take it, of

     7           young people?

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Yes, correct.

     9                    JUDGE DALZELL:  So this is self reported?

    10                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    11                    JUDGE DALZELL:  That's all I have.

    12                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  I just wanted to ask a question,

    13           and not out of disrespect to the doctor's opinions, but I

    14           guess if we had opening statements we would have known why he

    15           was being presented here.  Perhaps my two colleagues know,

    16           but maybe the lateness of the hour, I don't.

    17                    MR. HANSEN:  Yes, your Honor, I'd be happy to

    18           address that.  The plaintiffs' first arguments here have to

    19           do with the effect of the Act in banning speech for adults,

    20           and it is our view that the effect of the Act will be to end

    21           up banning a large amount of valuable speech for adults.  If

    22           you agree with us on that argument, Dr. Stayton's testimony

    23           will turn out to have been irrelevant.  If, however, you

    24           disagree with us on that argument, it is then our view that

    25           the Government must show that it has a compelling interest in

                                                                           221

     1           preventing minors from having access to this information.

     2                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  That's precisely what I thought

     3           the reason was for your presenting him, but I wasn't sure in

     4           light of your briefs, so I just wanted to get that straight

     5           in my mind.  Thank you.

     6                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you.

     7                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  I have a question, Doctor.

     8                    THE WITNESS:  Sure.

     9                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Your attention was called by the

    10           Government to Exhibits 70 through 77 which are these

    11           pictures.

    12                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    13                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Would you think that there are some

    14           people in contemporary society that would deem these pictures

    15           to be obscene or pornographic?

    16                    THE WITNESS:  Oh, yes.  I know them.  (Laughter.)

    17                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  Okay.  I think the end will follow. 

    18           Thank you very much.

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Thank you.  Appreciate it.

    20                    MR. HANSEN:  If I might indulge the Court, I thought

    21           of my one -- my last question.  (Laughter.)

    22                    I apologize, but I had a minute to catch my

    23           thoughts.

    24           BY MR. HANSEN:

    25           Q   Dr. Stayton, do you recall at the deposition the

                                                                           222

     1           Government asked you based on your contacts with other people

     2           in the field of sex and based on your ministry whether you

     3           thought your views were out of the mainstream with respect to

     4           people who are --

     5           A   Right.

     6           Q   -- sex educators and sex therapists.  Could you tell me

     7           whether you think your views are out of the mainstream in

     8           that respect?

     9           A   Not at all.  I go around to both seminaries and churches

    10           and I work with denominational leaders, and I find that I'm

    11           probably right in the middle as I work with churches.  I have

    12           tremendous -- I find that people generally are hungry to know

    13           about their sexuality, and especially in light of their

    14           religious convictions and that's -- I work a lot with that

    15           area.

    16                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  You believe that it ought to be

    17           in the hands of parents?

    18                    THE WITNESS:  Say it again?

    19                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  Ideally sex education ought to be

    20           in the hands of parents --

    21                    THE WITNESS:  Yes.

    22                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  But it probably is not though, is

    23           it?

    24                    THE WITNESS:  Unfortunately what happens is the

    25           parents abdicate their role.  I would like to see us do more

                                                                           223

     1           training of parents to be sex educators.  In fact we do that. 

     2           I'm doing that with a Methodist church this weekend.

     3                    JUDGE BUCKWALTER:  All right.

     4                    MR. HANSEN:  Thank you, your Honors.

     5                    JUDGE SLOVITER:  We would suspend for the day, but

     6           we'd like to see counsel in the back on some housekeeping

     7           matters.

     8                    COURTROOM DEPUTY:  All rise.

     9                    (Proceedings adjourned for the day at 4:25 p.m.)

(1) HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE HOLDS HEARING ON ENCRYPTION LEGISLATION;
    NSA, DOJ OPPOSE CONGRESSIONAL EFFORTS TO PROMOTE PRIVACY ONLINE

At a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday September
25, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick laid to rest any lingering
suspicion that the Administration would agree to change current export
controls on strong non-escrowed encryption. Equally troubling to Internet
users, Administration witnesses confirmed that the Government is seeking to
compel domestic Internet users towards a "voluntary" key-escrow encryption
system.

The hearing was called to consider the "Security and Freedom through
Encryption (SAFE) Act of 1996," (H.R. 3011) sponsored by Representatives
Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA), and a bi-partisan group of more
than 43 other Representatives. The bill is designed to encourage the
widespread availability of strong, easy to use encryption technology by
relaxing current encryption export controls.

The hearing -- the first before the House in nearly 3 years -- marked the
first time the House Judiciary Committee has formally considered the
encryption issue, and marks an important step along the path towards
passage of real encryption policy reforms.

Witnesses testifying before the Committee Wednesday:

* Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chief Sponsor of the HR 3011
* Jamie Gorelick, Deputy Attorney General
* William Crowell, Deputy Director, National Security Agency
* William Reinsch, Under Secretary of Commerce, Export Administration
* Melinda Brown, VP and General Counsel, Lotus Development Corp.
* Roberta Katz, VP and General Counsel, Netscape Communications Corp.
* Patricia Rippley, Managing Director, Bear Stearns & Company
* Dr. Charles Deneka, Senior VP and CTO, Corning, Inc (on behalf of the
  National Association of Manufacturers).

REPORTS OF ADMINISTRATION COMPROMISE PROVE PREMATURE

Although some press reports had suggested that the Administration was
poised to announce a new compromise encryption policy in testimony before
the Committee, these reports proved to be premature.

In response to rumors that the administration would relax export controls
on 56 bit DES encryption (encryption exports are currently limited to 40
bit keys) Gorelick stated that the Administration does not support the
unrestricted export of 56 bit DES.

However, Gorelick did confirm that the Administration plans to propose
legislation soon, and suggested such a proposal would specify the process
for law enforcement to access encryption keys held by third-parties.  The proposal would include new civil penalties for the unauthorized disclosure
of keys.

Additionally, credible sources have told CDT that the Administration's new
proposal will transfer jurisdiction for encryption exports from the State
Department to the Commerce Department, and that domestic law enforcement
will have a role in evaluating export applications.  It is also likely that
the Administration will again offer to raise the export limit from 40 to 64
bit key-lengths with law enforcement access.

ADMINISTRATION REITERATES PLANS TO COMPEL USE OF KEY-ESCROW DOMESTICALLY

Both Gorelick and NSA Deputy Director William Crowell stressed that the
Administration is not seeking to mandate the domestic use of key-escrow
encryption. However, both admitted that they would like to see the
widespread adoption of key-escrow systems and have initiated a broad effort
to encourage industry to develop such systems.

In her prepared statement, Gorelick acknowledged that criminals will at
times use non-escrowed encryption to communicate with themselves, but,

 "we believe that if strong key recovery encryption products that will
  not interoperate -- at least in the long term -- with non-key recovery
  products are made available overseas and domestically and become part
  of a global KMI (Key Management Infrastructure), such products will
  become the worldwide standard.  Under those circumstances, even
  criminals will be compelled to use key recovery products, because even
  criminals need to communicate with legitimate organizations like
  banks, both nationally and internationally."

The administration continues to insist that their policy is "voluntary",
despite the fact that their policy is clearly designed to compel the use of
key-escrow domestically through continued controls on encryption exports
and negotiations with foreign governments through the OECD.  This apparent
double-talk from the Administration cannot be the basis for sound
encryption policy reform.

CONGRESS, INDUSTRY REMAIN SKEPTICAL OF ADMINISTRATION'S POSITION, STAGE IS
SET FOR REAL REFORM NEXT YEAR

Led by Representatives Bob Goodlatte (R-VA) and Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), members
of the Judiciary Committee expressed a great deal of skepticism about the
Administration's proposal.

Rep. Goodlatte (a chief sponsor of the SAFE bill) testified that in his
view, "the chief roadblock to electronic commerce on the Internet is
government regulation of encryption."  Goodlatte added, "The arguments that
the FBI, CIA, and NSA have given me to justify the need for a massive
'key-escrow' or as it's now called 'key-recovery' plan just don't ring true
in 1996."

Representative Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), expressed concern that current US
encryption policy is endangering the future of the US high-technology
industry.  Lofgren was also highly critical of the Administrations efforts
to push for a global key-escrow standards through the OECD. Lofgren said:

 "The Deputy Attorney General also argues that the United States,
  combined with its allies, can control the world encryption market and
  can coordinate the implementation of an international 'key-escrow'
  regime.  Notwithstanding the absence of any demonstrable progress
  towards such an agreement, the aspirations for a comprehensive global
  key escrow scheme ignore the undeniable power of market demand for
  cryptographic products that do not incorporate any form of escrow. The
  customers that purchase encryption products DO NOT WANT products with
  escrowed keys, and if use suppliers are forbidden to supply these
  products, then someone undoubtedly will.  Whatever hopes we may have
  for an international system of key escrow, we will never achieve 100
  percent participation, and those who do not participate will profit
  heavily at our expense." (emphasis in original)

Several other members of the Committee, including Reps. Sonny Bono (R-CA),
John Conyers (D-MI), Robert Scott (D-VA), and John Bryant (D-TX) echoed
these concerns in their questions of the Administration witnesses.  The
fact that Committee members from both parties expressed deep skepticism of
the Administration's proposal is an extremely encouraging preview of the
debate when Congress resumes in January.

Finally, witnesses testifying on behalf of the software industry, the
securities industry and users of encryption technology all expressed
support for the SAFE bill, and argued that current policy threatens the
competitiveness of US businesses and Internet users.

NEXT STEPS

Time is running out in a busy election year Congressional calendar, and
chances of passage of encryption reform legislation in either the House or
Senate before the end of the current term are slim. However, the stage is
clearly set for an all out battle when Congress returns in January, and
support for encryption policy is clearly growing in Congress.

Forty-five Republican and Democratic members of the House have signed on
as co-sponsors of the Security and Freedom through Encryption Act (SAFE).
The Burns/Leahy "Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era (ProCODE)
Act also enjoys broad bi-partisan support in the Senate.  Meanwhile, the
Administration continues to offer more of the same -- continued reliance on
export controls while pushing for a global key-escrow standard.

The stage is set, but the battle over U.S. encryption policy reform is only
just beginning.  CDT will continue to work to educate policy makers and the
public on the importance of encryption policy reform. Over the next several
months, stay tuned for more information on what you can do to help protect
privacy and security on the Internet.

(1) FBI Demands for Broad New Surveillance Power Rejected on Privacy
    Grounds

A telecommunications industry standards body on Thursday voted to reject a
demand by the FBI to create a national tracking system out of the wireless
telephone network.  CDT applauds this decision as a significant victory
for privacy and condemns the FBI's blatant efforts to subvert the specific
requirements of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act
(CALEA, also known as "Digital Telephony").

"The FBI is demanding that every cell phone double as a tracking device,
providing instant and continuous location information not just when a
subject is talking but whenever a cellular phone is turned on. " said CDT
Executive Director Jerry Berman. "The FBI is demanding real-time tracking
of anyone suspected of committing a crime.  This is a clear violation of
the statute and the Fourth Amendment." Berman added

At issue are technical standards currently being drafted to implement the
1994 law. The FBI, which holds an influential position within the industry
standards process, has demanded that the wireless telephone network be
designed in a way that would allow real time tracking of individuals
suspected of a crime.

Specifically, the FBI is demanding that wireless networks be designed to
facilitate:

* Tracking of the physical location of a subject any time a cellular
  phone is turned on (even if no call is being made or received)

* Tracking of the physical location of a subject when a cellular phone
  moves within a service area or moves to another carrier's service area

* Tracking of the physical location of a subject when a cellular phone
  makes or receives a call

* Delivery of this information to law enforcement in real time (within
  500 milliseconds)

Although law enforcement currently has the authority to obtain certain
location information through a search warrant, the standards proposed by
the FBI would have allowed access to far more detailed location information
under a lower standard.

"The law was designed to freeze the FBI in time, not as a blank check to
the FBI to design the telecommunications network any way it pleased."
Berman said. "The FBI's demands go far beyond what's permitted under CALEA
and contradict statements by Director Freeh before Congress 2 years ago."

The drafters of CALEA specifically stated that the statute was not designed
to expand law enforcement surveillance authority. The Committee report on
the legislation notes:

 "The FBI director testified that the legislation was intended to
  preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law
  enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in
  the past. The Committee urges against over broad interpretation of the
  requirements."
   -- House Judiciary Committee Report to Accompany H.R. 4922. Rept.
      103-827 Part 1, Page 22

NEXT STEPS

In order to ensure public oversight and accountability over the FBI's
surveillance authority, CALEA requires the government to reimburse the
telecommunications industry for the costs of meeting the statute's
requirements.  Congress is currently considering a mechanism to fund the
implementation of the law.

CDT urges the Congress to exercise its oversight role to determine whether
the FBI is seeking to use CALEA to expand current surveillance capabilities
contrary to the specific intent of the law.  Unless and until the FBI
clarifies its intent and justifies its demands, Congress should not allow
the expenditure of any funds to implement CALEA.

CDT and a ad-hoc task force of other privacy organizations and
telecommunications industry representatives are currently conducting a
review of electronic surveillance issues at the request of Senators Patrick
Leahy (D-VT) and Arlen Specter (R-PA).  The task force report will cover the
implementation of CALEA and will be released within the next few months.
CDT stands ready to intervene again at the standards setting process and
before the FCC if necessary in order to ensure that privacy is protected as
CALEA is implemented.

public interest organization focusing on free speech and privacy issues in

(2) CDT BACKGROUND MEMO ON THE FBI DEMANDS

FBI SEEKS TO USE CELLULAR TELEPHONES AS TRACKING DEVICES

The FBI is demanding the telecommunications industry design cellular
telephone networks in a way which would allow law enforcement to track
the physical location and movements of individuals in clear violation of
the law.  This effort by the FBI raises grave privacy concerns and must
be rejected by the telecommunications industry.

In ongoing discussions with a Telecommunications Industry Association
committee established to set technical standards to implement the
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA, P.L. 103-414,
also known as the "Digital Telephony" statute), the FBI is requesting
surveillance capability far beyond current law enforcement capabilities and
in clear violation of the scope of the law.

CALEA was not designed as a blank check from Congress allowing law
enforcement to design the telecommunications network to expand existing
surveillance capability. Rather, the statute was carefully balanced to
ensure that law enforcement maintain the status quo. This overreaching by
the FBI raises serious privacy concerns and clearly violates the balance
struck by CALEA.  CDT strongly urges Congress to refrain from approving any
funding for the implementation of CALEA until the FBI makes its intentions
clear.

FBI Demanding Location Information In Clear Violation of the Statute

The FBI's request is contained in a proposal called the Electronic
Surveillance Interface (ESI), which specifies the design of the interface
between the telecommunications network and law enforcement's own
surveillance equipment. The FBI has refused a formal request by CDT to view
a copy of the ESI.

However, documents obtained from a meeting of the FBI and the
telecommunications industry on September 12 indicate that the FBI is
demanding that cellular networks be designed to deliver location
information to law enforcement.  Specifically,  the ESI states that
cellular networks must be designed to provide the geographic location of a
particular subject:

The ESI states:

  R7-62     The SSM (Surveillance Status Message) shall be delivered to
            the LEA (Law Enforcement Authority) whenever the subject
            changes location or between systems and this location is
            available to the IAP (Intercept Access Point)

In short, the FBI is requesting that the cellular network be designed to
report the geographic location of an individual subject:

1. When a cellular phone is turned on (even if no call is made)
2. When a cellular phone moves within a service area or moves to another
   carrier's service area.
3. When a cellular phone makes or receives a call.

The FBI claims that location information has to be provided to law
enforcement under CALEA because it is part of  "call setup information."
However, in his testimony before a joint hearing of the House and Senate
Judiciary Committees on March 18, 1994, FBI Freeh director stated exactly
the opposite:

 "Several privacy-based spokespersons have criticized the wording of the
  definition (of call setup information)... alleging that the government
  is seeking a new, pervasive, automated 'tracking' capability. Such
  allegations are completely wrong.... In order to make clear that the
  acquisition of such information is not... included within the term
  'call setup information' we are prepared to add a concluding phrase to
  this definition to explicitly clarify the point: '*** except that such
  information [call setup information] shall not include any information
  that may disclose the physical location of a mobile facility or
  service beyond that associated with the number's area code or
  exchange.'"    (Testimony of FBI director Louis Freeh before a joint
  hearing of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and
  Constitutional Rights and the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on
  Technology and the Law, March 18, 1994. S. Hrg 103-1022).

The drafters of CALEA noted in the Committee report that the statute was not
designed to expand law enforcement surveillance ability:

 "The FBI director testified that the legislation was intended to
  preserve the status quo, that it was intended to provide law
  enforcement no more and no less access to information than it had in
  the past.  The Committee urges against over broad interpretation of
  the requirements." (House Judiciary Committee Report to Accompany H.R.
  4922. Rept. 103-827 Part 1, page 22)

The FBI's demand that all wireless communications equipment provide the
physical locations of a subscriber at all times goes raises obvious privacy
issues and goes well beyond the scope of CALEA and the explicit statements
of the FBI.

No Funds Should Be Appropriated to Implement CALEA Until This Issue is Resolved

In passing CALEA, Congress sought to preserve law enforcement's ability to
conduct electronic surveillance as new communications technologies are
developed.  At the same time, Congress was very clear that the law was
designed to preserve the status quo and not to expand law enforcement
surveillance authority.  In addition, Congress took the extra step of
including substantial Congressional oversight and public accountability to
the implementation process in order to ensure that law enforcement did not
overreach and that privacy interests would be protected.

The law requires the telecommunications industry to set standards for
meeting the FBI's general requirements in an open process, allows
interested parties to challenge any standard before the FCC if it fails to
protect privacy, and requires Congressional oversight and accountability
over the implementation of the law by mandating government reimbursement
for expensive capability upgrades.

We urge Congress to exercise its oversight role to determine whether in
fact the FBI is seeking to use CALEA to expand its current surveillance
capabilities contrary to the intent of the law.  Unless and until the FBI
clarifies its intent and justifies its demands, Congress should not allow
the expenditure of any funds to implement CALEA.

We look forward to discussing this issue with you further.  If you have any

<BIG><STRONG>FBI Issues Scaled Back Surveillance Capacity Notice -- Cost and Capability Issues Remain</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[Posted on January 17, 1997 | Updated on February 14, 1997]</FONT> <P>

On Tuesday January 14, 1997, the FBI issued a revised notice of proposed
surveillance capacity as required by the 1994 Communications Assistance for
Law Enforcement Act (CALEA - a.k.a. Digital Telephony).  The notice details
projected increases in law enforcement wiretapping and other electronic
surveillance activity in the coming years.
<P>
While the latest notice appears far less expansive than the FBI's first
capacity notice issued in October of 1995, and while this notice, by
including the unprecedented release of baseline surveillance information on
a county-by-county basis, goes a long way towards satisfying some of CDT's
objections to the first notice, many serious issues remain.  
<P>
The new notice is subject to a 30 day comment period, in which telephone
companies, privacy advocates and members of the public can submit comments.
Any person can submit comments, directing them to the Telecommunications
Industry Liaison Unit, FBI, P.O. Box 220450, Chantilly, VA 20153-0450.  The
Bureau has not made arrangements for on-line submissions.  Hard-copy
comments must be submitted by mail, in triplicate.

     &quot;Pro-CODE&quot; Rides Again in 105th
     Burns to Push Bipartisan Bill Easing Limits on Encryption Exports


        WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Montana Senator Conrad Burns today announced
     that he will again introduce legislation in the next few days to ease
     government restrictions on encryption, or data security, software and
     hardware and to override the Clinton administration's encryption plan.

        &quot;Almost four years ago, the Clinton administration announced that
     its plan to help secure the massive amounts of information we move
     electronically was to give government a direct peephole into that
     information,&quot; Burns said.  &quot;Four years later, the president has not
     budged from this position.

        &quot;A significant bipartisan coalition in Congress and in the private
     sector has consistently rejected that approach.  We advanced the
     debate significantly in the last Congress but came up short because of
     White House obstructionism.  This time around, we intend to put a bill
     on the president's desk and find out if he is truly on the side of the
     users and providers of rapidly expanding high-tech goods and
     services.&quot;

        Burns announced the legislation along with cosponsors Sen. Patrick
     Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), and with U.S. Rep. Bob
     Goodlatte (R-Va.), who is sponsoring a companion bill in the House, in
     a video teleconference with the RSA Data Security Conference in San
     Francisco.

        &quot;We're working hard to get the same broad cosponsorship we had in
     the last Congress, and we will be introducing a bill that is virtually
     identical to Pro-CODE from the last Congress,&quot; Burns said.

        Pro-CODE, or &quot;The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era
     Act,&quot; would ease export restrictions on encryption technology to a
     level deemed &quot;generally available&quot; worldwide by the U.S. Department of
     Commerce.  It would also prohibit a mandatory system under which
     producers or users of hardware and software would be required to
     surrender a decoding &quot;key&quot; to a third party.  An executive order
     signed by President Clinton would ease export restrictions to a level
     of 56 bits for applicants who agree to give up a copy of their
     decoding keys.

        &quot;This debate comes down to a potential loss of billions of
     high-tech dollars and thousands of high-tech jobs.  It comes down to
     significant harm to our global high-tech competitiveness.  It comes
     down to whether or not government can force people into making
     business and consumer choices, and whether government should have
     access to our most private communications.&quot;

<P>
Twenty-one Senators and Representatives, including Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) signed a letter opposing the latest Administration proposal to ease export controls on products using strong encryption.  In the bipartisan letter sent to Department of Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor and dated October 15, 1996, the members write, &quot;Unfortunately, the Administration's most recent encryption initiative shortchanges both U.S. business and law enforcement interests.&quot;  They ask the Administration to work with them, industry, and other interested groups to modify the proposal.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H2>BSA Letter to Vice President Gore</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
December 2, 1996<BR>
<BR>
The Honorable Albert Gore<BR>
The Vice President of the United States<BR>
The White House<BR>
1600 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20500<BR>
<BR>
Dear Mr. Vice President:<BR>
<BR>
On behalf of America's leading publishers of computer software,<SUP><A HREF="#note">*</A></SUP>
I want to express our dismay at the way the Administration is implementing
the October 1 encryption policy announcement. BSA said at the time that
the announcement was a step in the right direction, but that numerous questions
remained. We understand that the Interagency Working Group on Encryption
intends to consult with interested parties throughout the process prior
to implementation of regulations which is planned for January 1, 1997, and
additional information may be available in the very near future. However,
given that everything we have seen and heard to date reveals that the government
is headed in the absolute wrong direction, we specifically wanted to bring
to your direct attention five key principles which underlie BSA's positions
and which should, but unfortunately do not appear to, be guiding the Administration.<BR>
<BR>
It appears that significant backtracking has occurred since the October
1 announcement and, therefore, we seriously doubt that the regulations will
work, meet computer user demands, or be accepted by the private sector unless
the Administration radically changes its approach immediately. If not, the
new policy is destined to fail just like its predecessor Clipper efforts.
We strongly urge the Administration to focus on what is doable in the real
world of millions of Internet users with scores of encryption alternatives
from which to chose.<BR>
<BR>
On November 8, BSA provided the Working Group detailed positions on the
issues and specific suggestions for regulatory implementation <A HREF="961108_BSA_wrkng_ltr.html">(a copy of
the letter is attached)</A>. Given the short period left before implementation,
five key principles are specifically discussed below which underlie the
positions taken in our earlier letter.<BR>
<BR>
(1) <B>VOLUNTARY AND MARKET DRIVEN</B>: To be successful, any key recovery
initiative must be voluntary and market-driven. Our companies cannot sell
what consumers do not want. As BSA CEOs have discussed with numerous Administration
officials, the U.S. software industry is operating in a very competitive,
international market -- hundreds of strong encryption products are presently
available around the world, many easily down loaded from the Internet. Consumers
are demanding strong encryption and it is key to the success of the Internet.
Unless users find value in a key recovery function, they will not buy products
with this function. The result: American companies lose sales and the government
will have failed in its efforts to have such products widely deployed.<BR>
<BR>
(2) <B>UNLIMITED KEY LENGTH FOR KEY RECOVERY PRODUCTS</B>: &quot;Key recovery&quot;
products should be exportable without key length limit if they include features
making the recovery of plain text stored information accessible without
the assistance of the individual who has encrypted the information.<BR>
<BR>
As we have explained to the Working Group, there may well be commercial
demand for products that enable the recovery of stored encrypted data, but
there is little, if any, commercial demand for a key recovery function in
real-time communications. Accordingly, there should be no such requirement
for exportable encryption communications products (or products which do
both communications and stored data as long as there are key recovery features
for stored data).<BR>
<BR>
<I>Furthermore, key recovery is not key escrow.</I> A purchaser or user
of a product being able to recover his data is different than, and separate
from, the decision as to whether to voluntarily empower a trusted third
party to be able to recover the data.<BR>
<BR>
(3) <B>NO INDUSTRIAL POLICY</B>: The government should not dictate &quot;milestones&quot;
for company specific plans regarding key recovery products as a condition
for interim export control relief. Companies have already announced plans
to develop such key recovery products; for example, 35 companies have joined
IBM in a key recovery alliance. Numerous other companies already have key
recovery products on the market today. There is no need for the government
to go down the road of industrial policy by insisting upon becoming a partner
with each company. We urge the Administration to adopt the simplest possible
process.<BR>
<BR>
(4) <B>EASY EXPORT OF 56 BIT PRODUCTS AS PROMISED</B>: Interim export control
relief must permit the export of 56-bit non-key recovery encryption products
under Department of Commerce General License procedures that represent actual
liberalization. The mere transfer of licensing jurisdiction to Commerce
is of little significance unless accompanied with expedited product reviews
and realistic licensing requirements. Yet, the recent Executive Order states
that products which already have export licenses will have to undergo new
reviews -- only this time with FBI scrutiny. There is also an urgent need
to permit the export of 128-bit encryption for financial applications (when
done with appropriate safeguards).<BR>
<BR>
(5) <B>MEETING MARKET DEMANDS NOW AND IN THE FUTURE</B>: Any interim export
control relief will be only a mirage unless it meets business needs after
two years. Quite simply, there must be interoperability between key-recovery
and non key-recovery products. It also must be possible for American companies
to service and support the installed base of 56-bit non key-recovery products.<BR>
<BR>
The American software industry needs immediate relief. It is a matter of
jobs and international competitiveness. For the Administration's policy
to be successful, the government must accept and work with the market, not
try to supplant it. It is clear that many in Congress understand the urgency
and importance of this issue and the need for strong protection for Internet
users. We thought that the October 1 announcement showed that the Administration
was also coming to grips with these issues. But now, only a few weeks later,
we wonder.<BR>
<BR>
We have submitted comments to the Government and we stand ready to continue
working with you to formulate and implement a market driven, voluntary system
which meets consumers' needs.<BR>

<BR>
Dear Bruce and Ed:<BR>
<BR>
On behalf of America's leading publishers of software I wanted to thank
you again for the Administration's recent decision to liberalize export
controls for commercial encryption products. As BSA said at the time, it
is clearly a step in the right direction. However, as we have also explained
on numerous occasions since the announcement, there were some notable omissions
as well as a great number of unanswered questions. Therefore, we sincerely
appreciate your willingness to work with us on an expedited basis to hopefully
resolve remaining issues and to make further progress. .<BR>
<BR>
Based on our recent discussions and meetings with Administration officials,
we believe there are four major outstanding areas that need immediate clarification.
This letter is intended to provide the Administration with BSA's reactions
to what we have heard to date as well as our concrete recommendations for
moving forward in these areas.
<H3>1. Interim Export Control Relief.</H3>
BSA's members have said for some time now that the ability to immediately
export 56-bit encryption products is critical to maintaining the international
competitiveness of the software industry and to providing computer users
worldwide with acceptable information security. This also was the major
recommendation of the National Research Council Study. Such exports also
were clearly permitted under legislation pending before Congress.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, we welcome your decision to permit the export under Department
of Commerce General License beginning January 1, 1997 of products using
56-bit encryption keys. We believe that many American software companies
will be ready to ship such products on January 1st. We trust that any necessary
government action will be completed by then.<BR>
<BR>
Our specific concerns and suggestions follow:<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Licensing Procedures and Rewrite of Regulations:</I></B> We expect
that: 
<UL>
  <LI>the decision covers all commercial software and hardware programs
and products employing encryption for general text (data) confidentiality
purposes;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>after the transfer of licensing jurisdiction to DOC, exports of all
commercial products will occur under the least restrictive DOC General License
(License Exception) - either GTDU (TSU) or, if a new license is created
or a new ECCN established, the terms and conditions should permit the export
to all non-embargoed countries without requirement of written assurances;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>all products already reviewed and approved for export will continue
to be exportable (under whatever DOC General License) without the need for
any further approvals, and independent of any new requirement or process
for &quot;commitments&quot; on key recovery, including:<BR>
<BR>
1. 40-bit key length mass market products<BR>
<BR>
2. 56-bit or longer key length products for the financial services sector
(which, as explained below, needs to be immediately increased to 128 bits
for Internet financial applications)<BR>
<BR>
3. other 56-bit or longer key length products (e.g. to U.S. subsidiaries,
certain foreign multinationals, certain foreign governments)<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>with respect to new products and programs:<BR>
<BR>
1. for all mass market products already approved for export at the 40 bit
level, if the only change is to 56 bits, then a simple letter to that effect
from the company (exporter) should be sufficient for General License treatment;<BR>
<BR>
2. initial reviews of new products and programs with 56-bit key lengths
will occur under the same stringent time frame (7 to 15 days) that currently
exist for mass market products;<BR>
<BR>
3. any commercial products with key lengths longer than 56-bits that are
not eligible for General License treatment should still be eligible for
export under a Validated License with terms and conditions substantially
similar to existing State Department export licenses. 
</UL>
We appreciate the time constraints under which the Administration is laboring;
however, we also believe it is essential to get the regulations done right.
Therefore we strongly urge you to involve industry associations in the drafting
of the new rules. Industry involvement is essential if the Administration
is to make good on the promise of achieving liberalized export controls
through transfer of jurisdiction over encryption software from State to
Commerce. Otherwise the new regime may be more restrictive than the current
dual agency regime.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Periodic Upward Adjustments in Key Lengths.</I></B> We were disappointed
that the Administration did not also institute automatic, periodic adjustments
in key lengths that simply would maintain the same level of information
protection in the future. Such adjustments are necessary because predictable
advances in computing power will make attacks on encrypted information cheaper
and easier. This was the rationale behind BSA's earlier recommendation of
a &quot;cost of cracking adjustment.&quot; The NRC CRISIS Report also called
for periodic adjustments. We note again that such adjustments would not
further disadvantage the government in performing any required brute force
attacks because it is precisely these attacks that benefit from the advances
in computing power!<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Financial Applications.</I></B> While the announcement confirms that
longer key lengths will continue to be approved for products dedicated to
the support of financial applications, no specific decision was made to
permit the export of such products with 128-bit encryption keys (under General
License GTDU (TSU)). Immediate action in this area is critical as the worldwide
financial sector currently demands this level of information security, foreign
competitors already are providing it, and safeguards are available to ensure
that such products are not used as general confidentiality products. (Industry
is familiar and comfortable with the binding standards currently used by
NSA - essentially a &quot;work factor&quot; test in which it would take
more effort to reconfigure the program than to do a separate one.) It is
essential to remember that if the U.S. Government does not provide immediate
export control relief in this area that foreign software companies are now,
and will become even more aggressive in, supplying such products - but without
the safeguards - thereby defeating our government's efforts to limit such
encryption worldwide. For example, a German product explicitly advertises
on the Internet its ability to provide &quot;highly secure 128 bit transaction
encryption despite U.S. export restrictions.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Personal Use Exemption.</I></B> We also believe further progress needs
to be made in the areas of the so-called &quot;personal use exemption&quot;
and non-confidentiality uses of encryption. Specifically, reporting requirements
should be eliminated or significantly simplified to ease administrative
burdens. Moreover, the exemption should be extended to foreign nationals
(except those from embargoed countries) employed by U.S. or Canadian companies
or subsidiaries/affiliates of U.S. companies.
<H3>2. Definition of Key Recovery.</H3>
Importantly, the Administration's announcement conditions the export of
56-bit encryption products upon &quot;industry commitments to build and
to market future products that support key recovery.&quot; Such products
would have no algorithm restrictions or key length limits.<BR>
<BR>
To be successful, any key recovery initiative must be voluntary and market-driven.
Users must see the value of key recovery features and want to use them.
American companies cannot sell what users will not buy. In this regard,
BSA's members have said for some time that they believe there may well be
commercial demand for products that enable the recovery of stored data and
that could be saleable worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
We think it also is in the government's interest to see the deployment of
such key recovery products for stored data. We believe the government should
focus on what is &quot;doable&quot; in the near term. See what works; get
real world experience.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>What Key Recovery Means.</I></B> As we have repeatedly explained,
we believe a &quot;key recovery&quot; encryption confidentiality product
should be exportable if it includes features making the recovery of &quot;plain
text&quot; stored information accessible without the assistance of the individual
who has encrypted the information.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Key Recovery Is Different Than Key Escrow.</I></B> A purchaser or
user of a product being able to recover his data is different than, and
separate from, the decision whether to voluntarily empower a trusted third
party to be able to recover the data. Indeed, this distinction between a
&quot;key recovery&quot; product that enables third party access to stored
information. and &quot;key escrow&quot; which requires such advance third
party access, makes all the difference in terms of industry and user acceptance.
Quite simply, there should be no requirement that a copy of the user's key,
or the means to access or reconstruct the key, be given to anyone (let alone
required to do so with government certified agents or with a U.S entity).
Indeed, we also note that even if certain individuals wanted to give a copy
of their key to a third party, the existence of a trusted third party infrastructure
in each country does not yet exist and could take some time to develop.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, while we believe that in many cases businesses and other entities
would have access to keys used by their employees and (in time) commercial
key recovery services would be able to recover keys of their subscribers,
yet other computer users might choose not to give a copy of their key to
anyone (instead perhaps printing out a copy on a floppy disk or paper or
content to have it reside in a separate file on their hard drive). The analogy
to what people do with their house keys seems apt -- some give a copy to
a neighbor or friend, businesses often hold &quot;passkeys&quot; to their
employees offices, others put a copy in a safe deposit box or a drawer.
Importantly, in each situation the government can obtain the plain text
of information by lawfully obtaining the key where ever it might be kept.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Key Recovery Should Be A Condition Of Export Only For Stored Data.</I></B>
As we have explained on many occasions, there is little if any commercial
demand for a key recovery function in real-time communications. The reason
is simple: if the communication is unsuccessful then it is simply tried
again until the transfer of information is successfully completed. Users
only want the ability to recover in plain text form their stored encrypted
information after the fact of transmission. Moreover, software companies
have been focusing on meeting this user demand - recovery of stored data.
They understand technically how to do this. In the short run, it is an achievable
objective.<BR>
<BR>
We are concerned, however, that some in government seem intent on arguing
that because a few products can technically perform key recovery for communications
it should be a widespread requirement. To the contrary, our members have
seen nothing to suggest that any<BR>
product developed to date can work on a mass market scale or that there
is significant commercial demand for such products.<BR>
<BR>
Therefore, an encryption product that provides key recovery for stored data
should be exportable even if it also encrypts communications without key
recovery.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Licensing Procedures.</I></B> Finally, BSA believes that key recovery
encryption products for stored data should be exportable: 
<UL>
  <LI>regardless of key generation technique of technology used (i.e. no
limits on how often keys may be changed or replaced);<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>without additional requirements or conditions precedent such as new
bilateral agreements;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>to all destinations subject only to generally applicable limitations
on non-controlled commodities (e.g. embargoed countries); and<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>pursuant to DOC General License or License Exception (GTDU (TSU) or
equivalent) after a one-time review comparable to that provided for mass
market software. 
</UL>
<H3>3. Industry Commitments.</H3>
Based on what we have heard to date, unfortunately we believe the Administration
may adopt an approach that is based much more on sticks than carrots. We
think there is a better way.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>The Administration's Tentative Approach.</I></B> We understand that
the Administration may interpret &quot;industry commitments&quot; to building
and marketing key recovery products so as to require each company to provide
detailed information to the government regarding its plans for developing,
producing and marketing key recovery products and services. Moreover, under
such an approach companies would have to make resource commitments and concrete
benchmarks. The government would review each company's plan every six months.
If the government decided that inadequate progress had been made then it
could end a company's interim General License to export 56-bit products.<BR>
<BR>
We believe this approach is misguided and unnecessary. Undoubtedly it would
subject the Administration to charges of micromanagement and industrial
policy. Moreover, such detailed governmental involvement could well threaten
the continued success of America's highly dynamic and competitive software
and hardware industries. Finally, the burdens of such an approach would
limit the ability of companies to participate, thereby reducing the number
of companies who could afford to develop key recovery products.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>A Better Way.</I></B> As we explained, we believe that a much more
productive and efficient approach is to rely on the fundamental incentive
inherent in the government's decision: after two years companies wishing
to export encryption programs with long key lengths will only be allowed
to do so if those programs and products have key recovery functions for
stored data.<BR>
<BR>
We understand that the Administration is nervous about industry actually
moving forward with development of key recovery products. But the government
already knows that companies will develop and offer key recovery programs
for stored data because a number of companies either have such products
now, are currently working on such products, or have announced individual
or joint efforts to develop such products. They are doing so because users
want such products. Indeed, Administration officials have already acknowledged
that a &quot;critical mass&quot; of companies are at work on such key recovery
products.<BR>
<BR>
We believe these activities should be sufficient and that any company should
be allowed to immediately begin exporting 56-bit products. We do not think
it is appropriate or wise to condition each individual company's ability
to export 56-bit encryption products on that company's plans to develop
or offer key recovery products.<BR>
<BR>
However, if the Administration nevertheless believes such a requirement
is necessary, then we strongly urge you to adopt the simplest possible process:
make such a commitment to develop or offer key recovery products a term
of the General License (or Exception). By exporting products pursuant to
the General License, companies would have &quot;self certified&quot; that
they are making the requisite commitment. This would obviate the need for
an entire separate regulatory scheme, with letters, meetings, reviews, etc.
We also believe it is essential that the license simply require a commitment
to develop or offer key recovery products generally, not a key recovery
version of each and every 56-bit product being exported pursuant to the
General License.
<H3>4. What Happens After Two Years</H3>
There are several issues presented by the Administration's announcement
that after two years American companies will be unable, as a general proposition,
to continue exporting 56 bit encryption products without key recovery.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Interoperability.</I></B> The Administration maintains that the &quot;domestic
use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain free
to use any encryption system domestically.&quot; As we have explained all
along, we do think that there always will be some demand for non-key recovery
encryption programs and products. Thus, we understand the Administration's
decision to mean: 
<UL>
  <LI>companies may continue to sell domestically, to U.S. citizens abroad,
and to U.S. subsidiaries abroad, non-key recovery encryption programs and
products without regard to key length;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>companies may continue to sell worldwide non-key recovery encryption
programs and products which are approved for export; and<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Exportable key recovery encryption programs and products will be able
to interoperate with non-key recovery programs and products at the encryption
strength of those other programs and products (for domestic users this means
no limits and for international users at whatever level is approved for
export (e.g. 56 bit keys as adjusted upwards in the future)). 
</UL>
<B><I>The Installed Base.</I></B> Any interim export control relief will
be a mirage unless it meets serious business needs. No commercial user will
purchase such products unless they know they can purchase similar products
in the future for expanding needs (e.g. a bigger site license), can get
replacement products if something is wrong, can install upgrades in the
product (even if the encryption remains the same), and can get continued
service and customer support. Yet we have heard nothing that addresses these
issues. The Administration's decision must be implemented so that whatever
is permissible at the end of two years will continue to be so (i.e. approvals
already granted must be reasonably interpreted in the future).<BR>
<BR>
BSA and its member companies remain committed to working with the Administration
to specifically address these important questions and implementation details.<BR>

(1) LATEST ADMINISTRATION CRYPTO POLICY CONTINUES PUSH TOWARDS KEY ESCROW

This week the Administration announced the latest in a series of encryption
policies designed to promote the use of key escrow systems, both
domestically and abroad.  This latest initiative continues the drive
towards a global guarantee of law enforcement access to all encrypted
communications and stored data. CDT believes that such governmental access
systems -- whether through "key escrow" or "key recovery" -- threaten the
fundamental privacy rights of computer users, both domestically and abroad.

The latest Administration proposal would promote key escrow by temporarily
easing current export restrictions on moderately strong encryption
products.  The proposal would raise the current export limit from 40 bits
to 56 bits for companies that agree to produce key escrow products.  
Companies would be required to report their progress every six months.  
After two years, all exportable encryption systems stronger than 40-bits 
would have to include key escrow.  Encryption producers will be compelled to
be part of this scheme in order to stay competitive, eventually producing and
adopting key escrow systems which so far have been largely rejected by the
public.

An overview of the latest Administration policy, considered within the
context of the government's relentless drive towards key escrow, is
attached below.

- THE UNSWERVING GOAL: GOVERNMENT ACCESS TO ALL COMMUNICATIONS AND
  STORED DATA

The long-standing goal of every major encryption plan by the Administration
has been to guarantee government access to all encrypted communications and
stored data. In 1993, the Clipper Chip policy achieved access through keys
held by the government.  In 1995, the "Clipper II" proposal allowed export
relief for commercial key escrow systems. This summer, "Clipper III" sought
access to keys through the dual incentives of export controls and a new
government "key management infrastructure."  In each case, the ultimate
goal has been a guarantee of government access to the plaintext of
encrypted information.  Law enforcement and national security interests
have driven this process.

The attempt to institutionalize key escrow worldwide is a fundamental
threat to the privacy and security of Internet users both domestically and
abroad.

* GUARANTEED ACCESS TO INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS AND STORED DATA WOULD BE
  A DRAMATIC EXPANSION OF CURRENT LAW ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES.

  Guaranteed access to Internet communications and stored files is a far
  greater intrusion into the privacy of computer users than current
  wiretapping.   As individuals conduct more aspects of their lives
  online, key escrow is tantamount to guaranteeing law enforcement
  access to all of our most intimate conversations, sensitive personal
  records, musings and thoughts in a way never available before.  Within
  the United States, Congress and the courts have established a delicate
  balance in electronic surveillance between law enforcement and
  individual privacy rights.  Key escrow destroys that balance,
  providing law enforcement with a comprehensive dossier of individual
  lives and activities.

* GLOBAL KEY ESCROW ENDANGERS THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF COMPUTER USERS
  COMMUNICATING IN COUNTRIES THAT HAVE NO FOURTH AMENDMENT OR OTHER
  PRIVACY PROTECTIONS.

  An international key escrow scheme will necessarily entail the escrow
  of key information in foreign countries, with access by foreign
  governments through much weaker privacy protections.  Such global key
  escrow jeopardizes the privacy rights of any American who communicates
  or stores files abroad, where key information might be released with
  few privacy protections. Moreover, global key escrow endangers the
  privacy and free expression of computer users everywhere by
  establishing the global machinery for government surveillance without
  privacy protections.

* THE CHOICE TO ACCEPT THE COSTS AND RISKS OF KEY ESCROW SHOULD BE MADE
  BY INDIVIDUAL USERS, NOT FORCED UPON THEM.

  Additional access points to encrypted data will create added
  vulnerabilities, new security problems, and additional costs.  While
  some users may decide that the benefits of key escrow outweigh the
  costs, governments should not be imposing these costs and risks on
  users who do not want them.  Individuals should be able to choose the
  type of encryption they want.

The global adoption of government access systems has serious, negative
consequences on the privacy of computer users. The recent Administration
announcement is another step in that wrong direction.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT YOU CAN DO -- ADOPT YOUR LEGISLATOR

As Members of Congress head home for the fall elections, they need to hear
from Internet users about the importance of encryption policy reform for
the future of the Net.

Adopt your legislator -- tell them that the Administration's Key Escrow
plan threatens the basic privacy rights of Internet users, and let us know
what they say!

(2) ANALYSIS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEXT STEP: SHORT-TERM EXPORT RELIEF
    TO COMPEL LONG-TERM KEY ESCROW

The latest Administration encryption policy, announced October 1, continues
this trend towards governmental access to all encrypted information.  Using
a carrot-and-stick approach, the plan promises moderate, short-term export
relief in return for the development and eventual adoption of key recovery
systems.

The Administration unveiled its encryption initiative at a White House
briefing by CIA Director John Deutch, Domestic Policy Advisor to the Vice
President Greg Simon, Undersecretary of Commerce William Reinsch, and
high-level representatives of the Department of Justice and the Office of
Management and Budget.  The basic outlines of the proposal included below
were culled from the Administration's statement and Tuesday's White House
briefing.

Major features of the new policy include:

* ALLOWS EXPORT OF 56-BIT ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS,
  "contingent upon industry commitments to build and market future
  products that support key recovery." Six-month licenses for 56-bit
  exports would be granted and renewed for up to two years -- contingent
  on satisfactory progress towards key escrow.

* REQUIRES KEY ESCROW CAPABILITIES AFTER TWO YEARS in all exportable
  products with more than 40 bits.

* "ENCOURAGES" THE ADOPTION OF KEY ESCROW SYSTEMS through international
  agreements, standards processes, and a new key management
  infrastructure.

* TRANSFERS JURISDICTION OVER ENCRYPTION EXPORT LICENSING TO THE
  DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE, but grants the Department of Justice a formal
  vote in the process.

The President is expected to sign an Executive Order enacting many of these
changes in mid-October. Other pieces will be published as agency rules or
regulations; a small part of the proposal (rules governing key holders) may
require legislation.

WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:

In the short run, computer users may see more widespread availability of 
moderately stronger encryption products (up to 56-bit key length) if 
vendors choose to and are able to meet the "commitments" required under 
the proposal.  In the longer term, however, even these moderately stronger
products will only be exportable with key escrow.  Ultimately, this 
proposal is designed to force the widespread adoption of key escrow systems,
both domestically and abroad.


A.  EXPORT CONTROL RELIEF AS AN INCENTIVE FOR KEY ESCROW:  The
    Administration proposal would allow for short-term export of 56-bit
    DES equivalent encryption products in return for commitments from
    exporters to develop "key recovery" systems.

* Starting on Jan. 1, 1997, the Administration would begin granting six
  month general licenses for export of 56-bit encryption products.

* Licenses would be granted "contingent on commitments from exporters to
  explicit benchmarks and milestones for developing and incorporating
  key recovery features into their products and services."

* Additional six month licenses would be granted "if milestones are
  met."

* In two years, "the export of 56-bit products that do not support key
  recovery will no longer be permitted."

* Export of longer key lengths would continue for certain sensitive
  financial applications.

* Export of longer key lengths may be allowed more generally once key
  escrow mechanisms are in place.

Questions remain as to exactly what form the commitments from exporters
will take, who will qualify for these relaxations, and what will happen at
the end of two years to 56-bit non-escrow products in the marketplace and
how they will be supported.  No interoperability restrictions on products
have been mentioned, and the Administration seemed to indicate that it
would be willing to tolerate a greater degree of interoperability between
products.

WHAT EXPORT CONTROLS MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:

This Administration export control scheme coerces industry into developing
key escrow systems, domestically and abroad, whether they want to or not.
Since 1992, export controls have been the favorite vehicle for enforcing
the adoption of such key escrow systems.  The strong public desire for
secure global communications has allowed government to use key escrow as a
precondition for export relief.   Export controls are a force for key
escrow in the domestic market as well as the international market because
of the need for secure international communications and the cost of
producing product lines for U.S. use only.  The Administration realizes
this: as CIA Director Deutch stated at the White House press briefing, he
was more concerned with encryption that people "buy at Sears" than about
less popular strong encryption products that the Administration concedes
will always be available.

In addition to their impact on the market for key escrow, the proposal's
export controls and key length limits themselves hurt user privacy and
security.

* Export controls don't make sense for a global Internet; they place
  business at a competitive disadvantage and prevent deployment of a
  secure global infrastructure.

* 56-bits is not enough for many applications.  CDT welcomes the
  Administration's recognition that 40-bit products are not strong
  enough, but last winter's study by a panel of encryption experts
  argued that DES keys can be cracked relatively quickly by well-
  financed groups, and that 70- to 90-bit keys are more appropriate.

* Key length limits are a flawed approach because they presuppose that
  some entities should be able to break keys and some should not -- a
  solution that is unlikely to appeal to worldwide consumers of
  encryption.


B.  "KEY RECOVERY":  Government access to the plaintext of encrypted
    data remains the centerpiece of the Administration proposal.  Major
    features of the key escrow requirements in the latest proposal
    include:

* Key escrow systems would rely on a trusted party to recover a user's
  confidentiality keys for use by law enforcement acting under "proper
  authority."

* The trusted recovery party might in some cases be internal to the
  user's organization, but in all cases notice to surveillance targets
  that their key information had been released would be prohibited.

* Access to keys internationally "would be provided in accordance with
  destination country policies and bilateral understandings."

* The Administration will pursue legislation to govern the release of
  keys, provide criminal and civil penalties for unauthorized releases
  or theft of keys, and provide liability protection for key holders.

* The Administration will continue to "encourage" the adoption of key
  escrow systems through it's broad efforts to promote international key
  escrow agreements, government key escrow purchasing standards, and the
  creation of a key management infrastructure.

None of the officials at the White House briefing were able to give
specific information about the requirements to be placed on key holders
(e.g., response times, security clearances, etc.)  The Administration did
indicate a broader approach to allowing industry key escrow systems that
more limited access to confidential information through, for example,
recovery of specific plaintext or separation of key information.

  NOTE: KEY ESCROW V. KEY RECOVERY -- CDT recognizes that real progress
  has been made in the development of systems that provide access to the
  plaintext of encrypted data while minimizing the collection and
  disclosure of sensitive key information.  However, from a privacy
  policy perspective these approaches have the same basic privacy
  problem: they are designed to provide law enforcement with guaranteed
  access to all encrypted information.

WHAT "KEY RECOVERY" MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:

CDT recognizes that some companies and users may wish to use key escrow
systems.  The Administration's apparent recognition that these systems are
best designed in the private sector is welcome.  However, this policy's
acknowledged desire to widely promote key escrow is dangerous and threatens
the privacy of users:

* Users are being pushed towards key escrow, whether they want it or
  not. The Administration is using the enormous pressure of export
  controls, competitive markets, and industry standards to force
  adoption of key escrow.  Each user should be free to decide for
  themselves whether to accept the costs of key escrow.

* International key escrow doesn't protect privacy in a world without a
  Fourth Amendment -- What legal standards apply to communications when
  keys are held in foreign countries? Officials have been unable to
  clearly explain how the privacy of computer users will be preserved.

* Key escrow dramatically expands law enforcement capabilities --
  Guaranteed access to encrypted information is a far greater intrusion
  into our lives than the delicate balance struck under U.S. privacy
  law.

* Key escrow is unproven -- The NRC's recent study argued that a policy
  relying on key escrow is "not appropriate at this time" and "is likely
  to have a significant negative impact on the natural development of
  applications."

* Key escrow creates new security vulnerabilities, such as the creation
  of large aggregations of sensitive key information, that are poorly
  understood.


C.  TRANSFER OF JURISDICTION TO THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT:  According to
    the White House, "after consultation with Congress, jurisdiction for
    commercial encryption controls will be transferred from the State
    Department to the Commerce Department."

* Encryption licenses will be reviewed under the Commerce Department's
  "normal process" by a committee with representatives from the
  Departments of Commerce, State, Defense, Energy, and for encryption
  exports, Justice.

* The Justice Department will have a single vote in the review
  committee, which will make its decisions by majority rule.

* The State Department will only have jurisdiction over special, single
  customer, military-specific encryption products.

WHAT TRANSFERRING JURISDICTION MEANS FOR INTERNET USERS:

While the switch to Commerce has been perceived as helpful by some, CDT
believes the benefits are unclear if fundamental policy remains unchanged.
The switch to Commerce will have little impact on the underlying policy
direction aimed at institutionalizing key escrow.  Moreover, the Commerce
Department's review committee is heavily weighted towards the law
enforcement and national security perspective (State, Defense, Justice, and
Energy), with the Commerce Department the lone representative of industry
and consumer interests. Finally, the presence of domestic law enforcement
in export control decisions raises serious questions about the ultimate
goal of this policy.

IV.  CONCLUSION

The Administration's latest encryption proposal remains wedded to a
flawed, key escrow and export control oriented approach that does not
address the privacy concerns of users.  While it contains some welcome
ideas, at its heart the Administration proposal uses the short-term easing
of export controls to promote key escrow through a Faustian bargain with an
industry desperate to produce strong security products.

Such manipulation of the market for encryption products is designed to
forward law enforcement's dangerous agenda of worldwide governmental access
to all encrypted information.  The march towards institutionalized key
escrow is a real threat to the privacy of computer users, particularly in a
world where not everyone has a Fourth Amendment.  The United States should
be a force for Internet privacy and security worldwide.  Rather than
forcing key escrow on a wary public, the Administration should look to work
with Congress, privacy and Internet advocates, the user community, and
industry to craft a truly voluntary policy that meets the privacy and
security needs of computer users in the global Information Age.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<BR>
CONTACT:  456-7035<BR>
TUESDAY, October 1, 1996<BR>

<P><CENTER><B>STATEMENT OF THE VICE PRESIDENT</B></CENTER>

<P>President Clinton and I are committed to promoting the growth of electronic
commerce and robust, secure communications worldwide while protecting the
public safety and national security.  To that end, this Administration is
consulting with Congress, the information technology industry, state and
local law enforcement officials, and foreign governments on a major initiative
to liberalize export controls for commercial encryption products.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration's initiative will make it easier for Americans to use
stronger encryption products -- whether at home or abroad -- to protect
their privacy, intellectual property and other valuable information.  It
will support the growth of electronic commerce, increase the security of
the global information, and sustain the economic competitiveness of U.S.
encryption product manufacturers during the transition to a key management
infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
Under this initiative, the export of 56-bit key length encryption products
will be permitted under a general license after one-time review, and contingent
upon industry commitments to build and market future products that support
key recovery.  This policy will apply to hardware and software products.
 The relaxation of controls will last up to two years.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration's initiative recognizes that an industry-led technology
strategy will expedite market acceptance of key recovery, and that the ultimate
solution must be market-driven.<BR>
<BR>
Exporters of 56-bit DES or equivalent encryption products would make commitments
to develop and sell products that support the key recovery system that I
announced in July.  That vision presumes that a trusted party (in some cases
internal to the user's organization) would recover the user's confidentiality
key for the user or for law enforcement officials acting under proper authority.
 Access to keys would be provided in accordance with destination country
policies and bilateral understandings.  No key length limits or algorithm
restrictions will apply to exported key recovery products.<BR>
<BR>
Domestic use of key recovery will be voluntary, and any American will remain
free to use any encryption system domestically.<BR>
<BR>
The temporary relaxation of controls is one part of a broader encryption
policy initiative designed to promote electronic information security and
public safety.  For export control purposes, commercial encryption products
will no longer be treated as munitions.  After consultation with Congress,
jurisdiction for commercial encryption controls will be transferred from
the State Department to the Commerce Department.  The Administration also
will seek legislation to facilitate commercial key recovery, including providing
penalties for improper release of keys, and protecting key recovery agents
against liability when they properly release a key.<BR>
<BR>
As I announced in July, the Administration will continue to expand the purchase
of key recovery products for U.S. government use, promote key recovery arrangements
in bilateral and multilateral discussions, develop federal cryptographic
and key recovery standards, and stimulate the development of innovative
key recovery products and services.<BR>
<BR>
Under the relaxation, six-month general export licenses will be issued after
one-time review, contingent on commitments from exporters to explicit benchmarks
and milestones for developing and incorporating key recovery features into
their products and services, and for building the supporting infrastructure
internationally.  Initial approval will be contingent on firms providing
a plan for implementing key recovery.  The plan will explain in detail the
steps the applicant will take to develop, produce, distribute, and/or market
encryption products with key recovery features.  The specific commitments
will depend on the applicant's line of business.<BR>
<BR>
The government will renew the licenses for additional six-month periods
if milestones are met.  Two years from now, the export of 56-bit products
that do not support key recovery will no longer be permitted.  Currently
exportable 40-bit mass market software products will continue to be exportable.
 We will continue to support financial institutions in their efforts to
assure the recovery of encrypted financial information.  Longer key lengths
will continue to be approved for products dedicated to the support of financial
applications.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration will use a formal mechanism to provide industry, users,
state and local law enforcement, and other private sector representatives
with the opportunity to advise on the future of key recovery.  Topics will
include:
<UL>
<LI>evaluating the developing global key recovery architecture
<LI>assessing lessons-learned from key recovery implementation
<LI>advising on technical confidence issues vis-a-vis access to and release
of keys
<LI>addressing interoperability and standards issues
<LI>identifying other technical, policy, and program issues for governmental
action.
</UL>
The Administration's initiative is broadly consistent with the recent recommendations
of the National Research Council.  It also addresses many of the objectives
of pending Congressional legislation.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Burns Cautious on Encryption Plan</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER>Oversight Vowed for Plan That &quot;Raises More Questions Than
It Answers&quot;</CENTER>

<P>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Montana Senator Conrad Burns today reacted cautiously
to plans by the Clinton administration to loosen restrictions on exports
of stronger encryption for computer software and hardware.  He also criticized
the White House for its failure to negotiate on the cornerstone of its proposals:
 that companies must agree to &quot;escrow&quot; their decryption keys.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I have no doubt that it was the pressure of Congress, high-tech companies
and privacy advocates that dragged the White House kicking and screaming
into agreeing that export restrictions should be eased,&quot; said Burns,
chief sponsor of the Pro-CODE bill, which would loosen restrictions on encryption
exports and prohibit government-mandated key escrow.  &quot;However, I can't
say I'm pleased with a process that has all but excluded Congress and the
public from the discussion.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The administration's insistence on key escrow as a condition of lifting
these restrictions has never been negotiable.&quot;  Meanwhile, what choice
do these companies have but to yield as their global competitiveness withers
on the vine?<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This plan raises even more questions than it answers, such as, what
about the widespread availability of much stronger encryption that which
is allowed by the White House?  How do we deal with rapid changes in technology
that will inevitably render the 56-bit limit obsolete?  The devil is definitely
in the details.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This debate is not over by any stretch of the imagination.  The administration
has prevented Congress from weighing in on this issue just as support was
building for a legislative solution.  I intend to move forward with pro-encryption
legislation in the next Congress.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I will also push for vigorous oversight of the administration's plan
in the Commerce Committee.&quot;  The Senate Commerce Committee, of which
Burns is a member, has jurisdiction over the Commerce Department.  The administration
has stated its intent to transfer export licensing authority over encryption
from the State Department to the Commerce Department.<BR>

    <TITLE>CDT | Sen. Leahy Statement re: Admin. Crypto Proposal, 10/1/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">

<H3>STATEMENT OF <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~leahy/" TARGET="NEW">SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY</A> (D-VT)<BR>
ON THE ADMINISTRATION'S NEW ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE<BR>
<BR>
October 1, 1996</H3>
<BR>

The timing of the Administration's announcement on encryption, within hours
of the Congress' likely adjournment, is unfortunate. The Administration
needs to work with Congress to develop a consensus on a national encryption
policy that takes account of the privacy, law enforcement and competitiveness
concerns of our Nation's citizens and businesses.<BR>
<BR>
Taking unilateral steps will not resolve this issue, but instead could delay
building the consensus we so urgently need. This issue simply cannot by
resolved by Executive fiat.<BR>
<BR>
While technology should not dictate policy, particularly when our public
safety and national security interests are at issue, any policy we adopt
must protect our privacy.  As the Administration and industry rush to find
an alternative to unbreakable encryption, they should take heed that any
solution which fails to protect the Fourth Amendment and privacy rights
of our citizens will be unacceptable.<BR>
<BR>
That is why, with bipartisan support, Senator Burns and I introduced legislation
in March that set out privacy safeguards to protect the decoding keys to
encrypted communications and stringent legal procedures for law enforcement
agencies to get access to those keys.<BR>
<BR>
In this plan, the Administration is directing the resources of our high-tech
industry to develop breakable, rather than unbreakable, encryption. But
no one is yet clear about who will be legally allowed to break into encrypted
messages, and under what circumstances. These are questions that have to
be answered not only with our own government but also with foreign governments.
 The weakest link in a key recovery system may be the country with the weakest
privacy protections. Internet users, who can send messages around the globe
seamlessly, do not want the privacy of their encrypted communications to
be at the mercy of a country that ignores the Fourth Amendment principles
we enjoy here.<BR>
<BR>
These are significant privacy and security concerns not answered by the
Administration's plan.<BR>
<BR>
Even without reading the fine print, the general outline of the Administration's
plan smacks of the government trying to control the marketplace for high-tech
products. Only those companies that agree to turn over their business plans
to the government and show that they are developing key recovery systems,
will be rewarded with permission to sell abroad products with DES encryption,
which is the global encryption standard.<BR>
<BR>
Conditioning foreign sales of products with DES on development of key recovery
systems puts enormous pressure on our computer industry to move forward
with key recovery, whether their customers want it or not.<BR>
<BR>
Internet users themselves -- not the FBI, not the NSA, not any government
regulator -- should decide what encryption method best serves their needs.
Then the marketplace will be able to respond. The Administration is putting
the proverbial cart before the horse, by putting law enforcement interests
ahead of every one elses.<BR>
<BR>
But that is not the only catch in the Administration's plan. Permission
to export DES will end in two years. Allowing American companies to sell
DES overseas is a step long overdue. Given the fact that a Japanese company
is already selling &quot;triple DES&quot;, one might say this step is too
little, too late. Threatening to pull the plug on DES in two years, when
this genie is already out of the bottle, does not promote our high-tech
industries overseas. Does this mean that U.S. companies selling sophisticated
computer systems with DES encryption overseas must warn their customers\\that
the supply may end in two years? Customers both here and abroad want stable
suppliers, not those jerked around by their government.<BR>
<BR>
The most effective way to protect the privacy and security of our on-line
communications is to use encryption technology. Every American should be
concerned about our country's policy oencryption since the resolution of
this debate will affect privacy, jobs and the competitiveness of our high-tech
industries.<BR>

<H2>CDT Analysis of Bernstein Decision</H2>

A U.S. District Court judge in San Francisco has ruled that some federal
regulations on the export of encryption are unconstitutional restrictions
on free speech.<BR>
<BR>

Judge Marilyn Hall Patel handed down the declaratory judgment on Wednesday
in Bernstein v. Dept. of State, a challenge to the Cold War-era International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) that restrict export of encryption hardware
and software.  The case was brought by researcher Daniel Bernstein, who
was prevented from publishing an encryption algorithm due to the export
controls. In her central ruling, Judge Patel held that, &quot;The ITAR licensing
system as applied to Category XIII(B) [cryptographic systems] acts as an
unconstitutional prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

The opinion is an important first ruling by a Federal judge that there are
serious First Amendment problems with the Administration's encryption restrictions.
 The ruling protects the publication of encryption source code and, if upheld,
would significantly undermine the outdated export controls that currently
threaten the privacy of computer users. The ruling also serves as a strong
statement of constitutional principles in the face of further encryption
regulations threatened both domestically and internationally.<BR>
<BR>

A cautionary note: At this time the court's ruling does not- necessarily
permit widespread encryption exports.  The ultimate effect of the ruling
on export of encryption products, particularly under new Commerce Department
rules expected to take effect on January 1, is unclear.<BR>

<H3>Major Findings</H3>

In a closely-reasoned 40 page opinion, Judge Patel presented  the most extensive
ruling to date on the First Amendment problems raised by ITAR export controls
on encryption.  Major holdings of the court include:

<UL>
  <LI><B>Encryption source code is protected speech</B> -- The judge reiterated
her April ruling that &quot;source code is speech,&quot; and held that:
&quot;Software relating to encryption is simply a topic of speech employed
by some scientists involved in applied research. Hence, Snuffle [Bernstein's
encryption program] is speech afforded the full protection of the First
Amendment not because it enables encryption, but because it is itself speech.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

  <LI><B>The ITAR export controls on encryption are an unconstitutional
prior restraint</B> -- The court held that the ITAR licensing process as
applied to encryption exports has the effect of preventing the publication
of software source code and thus represents a &quot;prior restraint&quot;
on protected speech. Such restraints are highly disfavored under the First
Amendment since they bypass the judicial process and give government officials
broad discretion to rule on the permissibility of speech.<BR>
<BR>

Calling the ITAR scheme &quot;a paradigm of standardless discretion&quot;
the court ruled that the government failed to meet any of the procedural
safeguards required for prior restraints of speech. &quot;Because it fails
to provide for a time limit on the licensing decision, for prompt judicial
review and for a duty on the part of the [licensing agency] to go to court
and defend a denial of a license, the ITAR licensing system as applied to
Category XIII(B) acts as an unconstitutional prior restraint in violation
of the First Amendment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

  <LI><B>ITAR restrictions on &quot;technical data&quot; and &quot;defense
articles&quot; raise constitutional issues</B> -- The court was &quot;inclined
to agree&quot; that export controls on 'technical data,' as they relate
to academic and scientific speech, violate the First Amendment, but was
forced by Circuit Court precedent to uphold the restrictions. The court
also held that ITAR definitions &quot;defense articles&quot; and &quot;technical
data&quot; are to be more narrowly construed so as to maintain their constitutionality.
</UL>

The court did not specifically address the constitutionality of object code
export restrictions.  The court also declined to rule on whether encryption
rules are content-based, or whether there were other First Amendment interests
in encryption based upon anonymity. The court largely denied Bernstein's
other challenges based on overbreadth and vagueness, and denied Bernstein's
motion for a preliminary injunction on the grounds that it was not necessary
given representation's by the government .<BR>

<H3>Conclusion: Questions Remain</H3>

The Bernstein ruling leaves many issues unresolved:  

<UL>
  <LI>The opinion's reasoning is based on source code protection, but its
ultimate applicability to the export of object code or commercial products
is unclear. <BR>
<BR>

  <LI>The District Court's ruling is not controlling in other potential
prosecutions under the export controls, though it is influential.  <BR>
<BR>

  <LI>The court did not rule on the constitutional problems raised by encryption
export regulations that are not prior restraint, providing little guidance
should the Administration significantly modify the licensing process.  
</UL>

Moreover, new rules from the Department of Commerce are expected to replace
the ITAR encryption regulations as of January 1.  The immediate effect of
Judge Patel's holding on the new Commerce rules is unclear, although the
new rules are strikingly similar to the ITAR and appear to contain many
of the same underlying constitutional problems.<BR>
<BR>

Despite these unanswered questions, Judge Patel's opinion represents a significant
step forward in the efforts to reform outdated U.S. encryption regulations.
 The ruling lays the groundwork for further challenges to encryption restrictions.
 The ruling also spells out important First Amendment protections for source
code as new encryption restrictions are being considered both internationally
and domestically.   Finally, this ruling should serve as a wakeup call to
Congress, the Administration, and the public: current U.S. encryption policies
raise serious issues of individual liberty, and should be changed to respect
the free speech and privacy rights of computer users.<BR>

<BIG><STRONG>Important Hurdle Cleared in Court Battle to Overturn Crypto Export Controls</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>(April 17, 1996)</font>
<p>
A Federal judge in San Francisco has denied a Government request to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Daniel Bernstein and the Electronic Frontier Foundation that challenges the government's export restrictions on cryptography.  Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that "source code is speech" and is thus entitled to heightened First Amendment protection.  The ruling has important policy implications on the future of cryptography exports and on privacy and electronic commerce.  The ruling could also affect the ongoing legislative battle to lift export controls on cryptography.

<H3><CENTER>Analysis of S.1726, the &quot;Promotion of Electronic Commerce
<BR>
in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996&quot;</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Summary.</FONT></B>  S.1726, the encryption bill authored
by Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) and others, offers the electronic commerce counterpoint
to S. 1587, the pro-privacy encryption bill offered earlier this session
by Senator Burns, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT), and others. 
<p>
S.1726 would:
<UL>
<LI>Relax current export controls by lifting restrictions on all encryption
hardware and software, regardless of key length, that is &quot;generally
available&quot; or in the public domain in the United States. Hardware and
software not available in the mass market or public domain would fall under
an export scheme that would currently allow up to roughly DES-strength (i.e.,
56-bit key length) security.<P>
<LI>Give the Commerce Department exclusive jurisdiction over encryption
exports, rather than the State Department.<P>
<LI>Affirm domestic use and sale of encryption and explicitly prohibits
mandatory key escrow.<P>
<LI>Prohibit Commerce Department standard-setting activities on encryption.<P>
<LI>Present broad new Congressional finding on the negative impact of current
encryption regulations on electronic commerce.
</UL>
The bill does not contain any of the key holder standards found in S.1587,
or the criminal provisions found in S.1587 and its House counterpart H.R.
3011. Taken together, the provisions of S.1726 are designed to make strong
encryption products more widely available and remove many of the competitive
barriers facing U.S. industry and individuals.<BR>
<BR>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><STRONG>Major provisions.</FONT></STRONG> The &quot;Promotion
of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996&quot; would
substantially change current encryption controls in the areas of export
controls, domestic use and distribution, and Commerce Department standard-setting.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Export Controls:  </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
	Under the Arms Control Export Act and subsequent ITAR regulations, encryption
products and technology are classified as &quot;munitions&quot; subject
to a complex export licensing scheme involving the State Department and
Commerce Department. Currently, products with encryption keys over 40 bits
long -- a level of security increasingly viewed as inadequate for many uses
-- generally cannot be exported. The Administration has used these regulations
to support policies whereby moderately stronger systems could be exported
if they guarantee government access to encryption keys through government
or third-party key escrow systems. Moreover, due to the need for international
interoperability and the difficulty of creating domestic and international
product lines, the export controls have had the effect of preventing the
widespread availability of strong encryption products within the United
States.<BR>
<BR>
S. 1726 would relax these export controls:
<UL>
<LI>Any encryption software, or hardware incorporating such software, that
is &quot;generally available, as is, and designed for installation by the
user or purchaser,&quot; or that is &quot;in the public domain,&quot; would
be exportable, regardless of key lengths. &quot;Generally available&quot;
software includes encryption software distributed over the Internet, widely
offered for sale or transfer in the U.S. (including software disseminated
as shareware or freeware), or preloaded on computer hardware. The government
would retain the ability to regulate encryption under the more narrow national
security standards of the Trading With The Enemy Act or International Emergency
Economic Powers Acts. <BR>
<BR>
The category of freely exportable encryption products appears to cover a
broad class of hardware and software. Many of the popular web browsers,
PGP, or encryption in other widely available software would all be exportable
with unlimited key lengths once made publicly available in the U.S. The
basic premise appears to be: If encryption is available in your local software
store, via mail order catalogs, or widely distributed over the Net, then
it should be freely exportable.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Other encryption hardware and software products would be exportable
under license to countries &quot;in which exports of computer software of
similar capability are permitted for use by financial institutions ... not
... controlled in fact by U.S. persons.&quot; Currently,  this scheme makes
non-mass market hardware and software exportable with up to roughly DES-strength
(i.e., 56-bit key length) security. (This represents a minor change from
S.1587, which had the same standard for software but permitted export of
non-mass-market hardware if products of similar security were commercially
available abroad.)<BR>
<BR>
The Secretary of Commerce would be empowered to deny such exports where
there is &quot;substantial evidence&quot; that the products in question
would be &quot;diverted to a military end-use&quot; or &quot;modified for
military or terrorist end-use.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<LI>The Department of Commerce would receive exclusive jurisdiction over
export controls for encryption hardware, software, and technology, except
such encryption technology that is specifically designed or modified for
military use.
</UL>
<STRONG>Domestic Use and Sale of Encryption:</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
No restrictions on sale or distribution of encryption in interstate commerce - 
S.1726 would prohibit the Federal government, or any State, from restricting
or regulating the sale of encryption products in interstate commerce.<BR>
<BR>
Prohibits mandatory key escrow - the bill would also prohibit the Federal
government, or any State, from imposing any key disclosure requirements
as a condition of sale in interstate commerce.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Commerce Department Standards Activities:</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
The bill restricts Commerce Department standard-setting activities on encryption.
 The Department, through the National Institute of Standards or otherwise,
may not &quot;promulgate, or enforce regulations, or otherwise adopt standards
or carry out policies that result in encryption standards for use by businesses
or entities other than Federal computer systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Commerce Department would also be prohibited from promulgating regulations
that impose government-designed encryption standards on the private sector
by restricting exports.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3><CENTER>Comparison of S.1726 with S.1587 (the Leahy-Burns encryption
bill) and H.R. 3011.  </CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
S.1726, the Pro-CODE, provides the electronic commerce equivalent to S.1587,
the pro-privacy encryption bill introduced by Senator Leahy, Burns, Dole,
Pressler and Murray two months ago, and S.1587's House counterpart, H.R.
3011, introduced by Rep. Goodlatte and others.  Pro-CODE would relax export
controls in a roughly similar way, but contains none of the key holder provisions,
and no new crime for using encryption to obstruct justice. Where S.1587
is more narrowly applicable to only wire or electronic communications, S.1726
applies to encryption of both communications and other information such
as stored files. Pro-CODE also contains a new provision to prohibit the
Commerce Department from imposing encryption standards.<BR>
<BR>
Major areas for comparison include:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Encryption of stored information: The definition of encryption in S.1587
applies only to &quot;wire and electronic communications,&quot; while S.1726
includes &quot;wire and electronic communications and information.&quot;
S.1726 would thus appear to protect encryption hardware and software for
non-communicated information, such as encryption of locally stored files
or disk media.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Export provisions: S.1587 and H.R.3011 have very similar export provisions
to S.1726.  In all three, software and hardware that is &quot;generally
available, as is, and designed for installation by the user or purchaser,&quot;
or that is &quot;in the public domain,&quot; would be exportable, regardless
of key lengths. Other encryption hardware and software would be exportable
using the &quot;currently exportable to  foreign financial institutions&quot;
standard (i.e.,  roughly DES strength; see explanation above) under S.1726.
The same standard is used for other software in S.1587 and H.R. 3011, but
hardware is subject to a more liberal test of what is already &quot;commercially
available&quot; abroad.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Key holder provisions:  S.1726 and H.R. 3011 contain none of the extensive
provisions in S.1587 regarding the responsibilities of third-party encryption
key holders, or standards for release of keys to law enforcement.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Use of encryption to obstruct justice: S.1726 does not contain the provision
found in S.1587 and H.R.3011 that would criminalize the use of encryption
to obstruct communications from law enforcement officials in furtherance
of a felony.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Personal use exemption: S.1726 does not contain the broader personal
use exemption for U.S. users of encryption traveling abroad, found in S.1587.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Commerce Department Standards activities: S.1726 prohibits any actions
by the Commerce Department that have the effect of imposing government designed
encryption standards. S.1587 has no analogous provision.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>New findings: S.1726 contains a broad new set of findings emphasizing
the importance of encryption to the development of electronic commerce.<BR>

Dear Senators:

The undersigned companies, associations, and government reform and privacy
organizations are writing in support of your efforts to relax encryption
export controls and make privacy-protecting encryption technologies more
widely available to computer users.  Your leadership in sponsoring the
&quot;Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of
1996&quot; is critical to eliminating the counterproductive regulation in
this area.  To build public support for this initiative, the undersigned
groups will also be sponsoring a series of public education events designed
to raise awareness of encryption's importance to U.S. competitiveness and
individual privacy. We invite you to join us in this campaign.

Current U.S. export controls and other regulations on encryption
technologies are stifling electronic commerce on the Internet, handicapping
U.S. industry in the global marketplace, and preventing computer users from
protecting their privacy online.  The high technology industry and Internet
users labor today under Cold War-era cryptography policies that threaten
U.S. jobs by compromising the competitiveness of U.S. industry.  

The ability of U.S. companies to participate in the global Internet
marketplace for computer sales, online services, and new electronic
commerce applications is undermined by export controls which prevent them
from selling secure products required by their global customer base.  These
products and services are, however, available from foreign competitors. 
Moreover, individuals will not use the Internet if their constitutional
privacy rights are not protected.  Relaxing export controls, as the
Pro-CODE does, is essential to the success of electronic commerce and to
meet the needs of individuals online. 

To support this effort, many of the undersigned groups are sponsoring an
Encryption Education Day this July in Silicon Valley.  We look forward to
your participation in the centerpiece of this education effort, a
roundtable meeting in Silicon Valley between industry leaders, members of
Congress, encryption experts, and the national press, to continue the task
of raising public awareness about this important issue. We are committed to
working with you and other members of Congress towards a new national
encryption policy.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3>CDT Letter to Senate Commerce Committee Members regarding Pro-CODE Committee
Vote</H3>
<BR>
<PRE>September 9, 1996

Dear Senate Commerce Committee Member:

Outdated government regulations on encryption products continue to
jeopardize the privacy and security of our computer networks.  Later
this week, the Senate Commerce Committee will have an opportunity
to address this problem when it acts on S.1726, the Promotion of 
Commerce On-line in the Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act of 1996 co-
sponsored by Senators Burns, Leahy, Pressler, Lott, Wyden, Ashcroft, 
and others.

<STRONG>The Center for Democracy and Technology strongly urges you
to report S.1726 out of the Senate Commerce Committee without
amendment.</STRONG>

Individuals and businesses need strong encryption products to protect 
their personal communications, confidential records, and proprietary 
information online. Such trust in the security of the network is needed 
if we are to realize the tremendous promise of the Internet to 
invigorate our democracy and promote electronic commerce.  Moreover,
the widespread use of strong encryption actually prevents crime and 
protects our sensitive infrastructure from possible &quot;information warfare.&quot;

Yet Cold War-era regulations on encryption continue to restrict the 
export and use of encryption products. Since strong encryption products 
are readily available abroad, these export controls do little to keep 
encryption out of the hands of terrorists, criminals, or foreign 
governments.  It is only law-abiding U.S. computer users who must 
sacrifice their security under current regulations.  The Administration 
has been unable to justify this loss of privacy for millions of computer 
users to satisfy a law enforcement concern that has already been 
compromised.
 
S.1726 would sensibly ease the export controls on encryption while 
guaranteeing the rights of American computer users to choose the 
security products most appropriate for them.  Congressional action is 
urgently needed given growing concerns about the security of our 
information infrastructure and the Administration's continued 
intransigence on this issue. 

As a public interest group deeply involved in promoting democratic 
values in new electronic media, the Center for Democracy and 
Technology has had a chance to see first-hand the real need for privacy
and security online that only widely available strong encryption products
can provide.  Help send a message that Congress is serious about the 
privacy and security of computer users. Please pass the Pro-CODE bill 
out of the Commerce Committee without amendment.

Sincerely,

Jerry Berman
Executive Director

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<STRONG>STATEMENT BY SENATOR CONRAD BURNS (R-MT) <BR>
ON INTRODUCTION OF THE  &quot;PRO-CODE&quot; BILL<BR>
THURSDAY MAY 2, 1996<BR></STRONG>
<BR>
Thank you all for coming this afternoon.  I'd especially like to thank the
original cosponsors of this legislation, some of whom are here today: the
distinguished Majority Leader Senator Dole; Senator Larry Pressler, who
chairs the full committee to which this bill has been referred; Senator
Leahy, our chief Democratic cosponsor; Senator Murray; Senator Wyden;
Senator Nickles; Senator McCain; and Senator Ashcroft.<BR>
<BR>
I'd like to announce today that we are introducing the Pro-CODE bill, the
"Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era."<BR>
<BR>
Like the title of the bill states, my primary objective with this
legislation is to promote commerce both domestically and abroad.  But I
have two other goals that I believe will be achieved by Pro-CODE: one is to
improve the competitiveness of American software companies with their
foreign competitors, the other is to protect the intellectual property and
privacy or both businesses and individuals.<BR>
<BR>
Pro-CODE would have a profound impact on our economy and the way each of us
lives our life from day to day.  It's a relatively simple bill, but it
deals with a term few of us are familiar with: encryption.<BR>
<BR>
Encryption is simply the use of a string of letters or numbers _ or a "key"
_ to render our computer files and transmissions unreadable by people who
have no business reading them.  If you have the right key, you can unlock
the code and have access to that information.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, American businesses and computer users face a threat _ and
it's a threat from their own government _ because the current
administration won't let American companies export encryption at a level
higher than 40 bits.  That's a fancy word, but what I'm told it means is
that it's a level of security that can be cracked by your basic
supercomputer in about one-thousandth of a second at a cost of a tenth of a
cent.  Companies can sell stronger encryption here at home, but it's too
expensive to create two different standards, so they don't.<BR>
<BR>
What this means is that commerce and communication on computer networks
including the Internet is not reaching its full potential.  How many of you
would feel secure sending your credit card number over the Internet _
especially when you learn that reported invasions by computer hackers
increased nine-fold between 1990 and 1994?  Or when Internet World magazine
estimates that the actual number of unwanted computer penetrations in 1992
alone was 1.2 million?  If you were a business, how many of you would feel
secure passing sensitive information to your branches around the world or
around the nation?  If you were an ordinary citizen, would you feel secure
knowing that many of your records and files are subject to the kind of
security that the cyber-criminals of today just laugh at?<BR>
<BR>
Yet that's the problem we face today, and my colleagues here today and I
find it unacceptable. Just three months ago we passed a historic
telecommunications law that is designed to make it easier to interact with
each other.  But that law _ that vehicle which will take us along the
information highway _ is useless without the engine of information security
driving it forward.<BR>
<BR>
Our bill would allow the unrestricted export of mass-market or
public-domain encryption programs.  It would also require the Secretary of
Commerce to allow the export of encryption technologies if products of
similar strength are available elsewhere in the world.  Finally, it would
prohibit the government from imposing a mandatory key-escrow system in
which the government or another third party would have a "back door" to
your computer files.<BR>
<BR>
I come from a state where distances can often keep us apart.  From Eureka,
Montana, in the northwest to Alzada, Montana, in the southeast is the same
distance as from Washington, D.C., to Chicago.  Anything to bring us closer
together will give us benefits only enjoyed now by folks in larger areas.
It will also give the mom-and-pop businesses in our smallest communities a
leg up on their bigger competitors as we enter the information age.<BR>
<BR>
But my concern is also based on the effect the current policy is having on
jobs and industry in this nation.  Because of our current ill-advised
policy, American companies will lose their share of the world market _
which now stands at 75 percent _ to foreign companies who don't have to
abide by such restrictions.  You'll notice, for example, in the press kit
we are making available to you, we have included a Web page from a South
African company that boasts 128-bit encryption.  In many cases, these
encryption programs are available to download from the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
American companies clearly are at a competitive disadvantage.  A study by
the Computer Systems Policy Project found that within just the next four
years, American companies could lose $60 billion in revenues and American
workers could lose 216,000 high-tech jobs.  Our bill is a jobs bill that
I'm sure the administration can agree with.  But it's not only that.  As
you can see, it's also a consumers bill.<BR>
<BR>
One of the questions I have gotten is, "How does this legislation differ
from a bill you are also sponsoring with Senator Leahy?" The answer is, not
a lot.  However, Pro-CODE is narrower in its scope.  It deals exclusively
with the issue of commerce and omits the criminality provisions. In
addition, it does not set up guidelines for a voluntary key-escrow
arrangement.  This is a streamlined measure that I hope to move quickly
through the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation and the
Science, Technology and Space subcommittee, which I chair.  We will have
hearings on this bill, hopefully as soon as this month, and I hope to have
at least one of those in the field where the people are affected most by
this bill.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to the diverse and bipartisan group of senators you see before
you, support for this legislation in the private sector is both broad and
deep.  Letters and statements of support have been made available to you in
the press kit, and I can tell you that's just the tip of the iceberg.  As
you can see on the monitor to my right, there are two homepages on the Web
that are dedicated to tracking encryption legislation and making people
aware of why it is needed.  As with the "blue-ribbon campaign," which you
are probably familiar with, Internet users will be encouraged to download
the golden key and envelope symbol that you can see on this poster to my
left. They will then be able to link to one of the two encryption pages and
show their support for this effort.<BR>
<BR>
A number of supporters have come to the Capitol today and they have offered
to make themselves available if you have any questions after this news
conference, or you can call them later at the numbers we have provided to
you in the press kit.<BR>
<BR>
In addition to that grass-roots effort, I am also sending today an open
letter to the Internet community encouraging support for this bill, and I
expect it to be made available to hundreds of thousands of Internet users.
I will also plan to make myself available for at least two online forums to
discuss my bill with computer users.<BR>
<BR>
I want to thank you again for coming today.  Now I'd like to turn it over
to the distinguished Majority Leader for his remarks.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<STRONG>STATEMENT OF SENATOR LARRY PRESSLER <BR>
ON INTRODUCTION OF THE &quot;PRO-CODE&quot; ENCRYPTION LEGISLATION<BR>
THURSDAY, MAY 2, 1996<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
I am proud to join with my colleagues today to introduce the &quot;Promotion
of On-Line Commerce in the Digital Era Act&quot;(PRO-CODE). This bill will
eliminate outdated, useless rules and regulations so that American companies
can compete effectively thoughtout the world in the global information technology
industry. It will strengthen our economy, create jobs and maintain the United
States' lead in telecommunications and information technology into the twenty-first
century.<BR>
<BR>
The high-tech industry is the crown jewel of the American economy-- growing
exponentially each year and constantly creating new jobs.  This is the future
of our country's economic security.<BR>
<BR>
We are the world  leaders in the technology revolution.  Whether in hardware,
software, browsers, semiconductors, cryptography or other segments of the
industry, we have the talent and capability to retain this lead indefinitely.
 The private sector is doing everything possible to expand this industry.
 Unfortunately, they frequently are held back by unnecessary or antiquated
government rules and regulations.  Government should help, or at the very
least, get out of the way<BR>
<BR>
Outdated government policy must change and it must change immediately. 
The future of this industry, its employees and our country's economy depends
on this change.<BR>
 <BR>
This is why I am an original sponsor of the &quot;Promotion of Commerce
On-line in the Digital Era&quot; (PRO-CODE) which we are introducing today.
 The Senate Commerce Committee will have jurisdiction over this bill, that
basically, would allow unlimited export of commercially available encrypted
software.  I believe that it is important to bring this issue before the
committee I chair-- the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation--as
I am committed to moving this legislation forward immediately and I am joined
by others on the Committee who feel the same way.<BR>
<BR>
The health of our national economy, and my home state of South Dakota's
economy in particular, is heavily dependent upon exports.  We must focus
on expanding our present foreign markets and opening new ones in order to
strengthen our businesses and maintain our economic hegemony.  It is undisputed
that American businesses can compete evenly with their foreign counterparts
when operating on a level playing field.  However, they are not always given
fair treatment.<BR>
<BR>
When U.S. companies are treated unfairly vis-a-vis their foreign competitors,
they lose contracts and their market share suffers.  This leads to lower
profits and less repatriation of those profits to the United States.  we
must do all we can to eliminate foreign trade barriers that restrict U.S.
companies operating aboard.  At the same time, we also must eliminate our
own government's discrimination against our American multinationals.  To
this end, I am working to assist U.S. multinationals companies, and high-tech
companies in particular, by eliminating unnecessary restrictions on their
operations.<BR>
<BR>
The PRO-CODE bill enjoys widespread bi-partisan support. I believe this
change in policy is vital if the United States is to maintain its world
wide lead in the development and sale of software technology.  This is an
industry key to the continued strength of our economy, however, export controls
-- true relics of the Cold War -- are hurting American companies' ability
to sell their products overseas.  We eon the Cold War. We must now disarm
the weapons used to win that war before they are used against us.<BR>
<BR>
It is simply logical to allow U.S. companies to sell overseas some of the
technology they currently are allowed only to sell within the U.S.  As you
know, certain software readily available around the world and on the Internet
is not allowed to be exported from the U.S.  Rules that once made sense
are obsolete and harmful -- only to us -- in today's rapidly changing world.
This encrypted software, which serves to secure communications is the future
of the industry.<BR>
<BR>
If we fail to loosen our export laws, American companies face two unpleasant
choices. First, they can simply stand by and watch their products be replaced
by foreign competitors. This means losing this industry the way we lost
consumer electronics, steel and the auto industry in the past. In the more
likely alternative, these companies will be forced to move their production
and research facilities offshore.If this happens not only will our economy
suffer, but we will lose high-paying, high-tech jobs.  We cannot afford
to allow either alternative to happen.  That is why I am fighting to correct
this problem. We must do so -- before it is to late.<BR>
<BR>
When I led the effort to enact the sweeping Telecommunication Reform Act
my goal was to open up all aspects of the telecommunication industry to
widespread competition.  Without changes in the other laws this goal cannot
be fully achieved.  Indeed without such changes we risk the loss of  markets
such as software to foreign competitors because our own government restricts
the U.S. companies.<BR>
<BR>
The issue is a simple one -- with the globalization of our information systems
we must have secured transmissions.  Those transactions should be protected
by the best encrypted software available. That means American products.<BR>
  <BR>
As the Federal Communications Commission proceeds with implementation of
the Telecommunication Act it is important for Congress to keep a watchful
eye on their deliberations.  For example, some at the FCC  support a mandated
High Definition Television (HDTV)  standard.  Not me.  I will fight any
FCC attempt to set mandated equipment standards.  To establish such mandates
would set a dangerous precedent which could chill competitive gains the
U.S. has made thoughout the world.  The computer industry has grown and
flourished because the government did not set standards or impose mandates.
 The government should not get into mandating standards.<BR>
<BR>
I also am working to bolster our competitiveness through the enactment of
the &quot;International Tax Simplification for American Competitiveness&quot;
bill.  The purpose of this legislation is to make technical corrections
and simplification changes to the U.S. tax code -- eliminating some of the
discriminatory and redundant application of rules to our companies.  This
bill likely will include a provision eliminating the discrimination against
software under the Foreign Sales Corporation rules.  This too will help
U.S. software exporters. This bill contains common sense changes to the
tax code designed to put  U.S. companies on more equal footing with their
key competitors in Japan and Germany.  I intend to introduce this bill in
the next few weeks.  Here too, I expect widespread bi-partisan support.<BR>
<BR>
I want to use my role as Chairman of the Commerce Committee -- with its
jurisdiction over international trade and the Commerce Department -- in
combination with my membership on the Finance Committee -- which has jurisdiction
over trade and tax policy -- to help strengthen American competitiveness
overseas.  Our economic future depends upon diligent <BR>
efforts to ensure our companies are treated equitably not only by foreign
countries,  but by our own as well.  We can compete with anyone given a
fair chance.  It is my goal to put American first.<BR>

<title>Statement of Senator Bob Dole on the Introduction of S. 1726</title>

<h2>Senator Dole's Statement on the Introduction of S. 1726</h2>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<center><b>Dole Supports Legislation Providing "Padlock" to Protect Information Transmitted Electronically; Measure to Bolster U.S. Competitiveness, Create Jobs, & Protect Right to Privacy</b></center>
<p>
<p>
The computer industry is uniquely American.  We created it. Now we dominate it. Our leadership is recognized worldwide. 
<p>
Today, our commanding position is under assault. Not by foreign competitors, but by our very own administration that touts itself as the darling of the high tech community.
<p>
The administration's misguided proposal on encryption amounts to a pair of cement shoes for Silicon Valley.  It seems to me that a new pair of track shoes might be a better answer.  And as Senator Burns has pointed out, that's exactly what we intend to give them with our legislation.
<p>
This measure has strong bi-partisan support and Senator Leahy has pushed this issue for some time.  Strong encryption allows businesses and individuals worldwide to choose strong security features they need to protect information transmitted electronically.  In simple terms, encryption amounts to nothing more than a modern day padlock. That's why Internet grassroots groups call our bill "My lock, My key."
<p>
The administration apparently thinks very little of the right to privacy -- it presumes the government is entitled to all the so-called "keys" or secret passwords which protect computer generated information from prying eyes -- like hackers.  The problem is President Clinton would only take the "keys" of U.S. products, not foreign ones.
<p>
This would hobble our companies in the world market.  After all, why would anyone buy U.S. computer products if they aren't secure?  And they won't be once the government gets hold of the keys.
<p>
Now many of you may be asking, "what's the big deal?"  The administration's big brother proposal will literally destroy America's computer industry.  The administration proposal will force American companies to surrender to foreign competitors, or force our companies to move off-shore in order to remain competitive.
<p>
In short, our bill is pro-American.  It bolsters our competitiveness.  It creates jobs. It protects our right to privacy.  And defends our national security.

<STRONG>STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON INTRODUCTION OF<BR>
&quot;PROMOTION OF COMMERCE ON-LINE IN THE DIGITAL ERA&quot; (PRO-CODE)<BR>
THURSDAY MAY 2, 1996</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
        I am pleased to join a bipartisan group of Senators in supporting
legislation to encourage the development and use of strong, privacy-enhancing
technologies for the Internet by rolling back the out-dated restrictions on the
export of strong cryptography.<BR>
<BR>
        As an Internet user myself, I care deeply about protecting individual
privacy and encouraging the development of the Net as a secure and trusted
communications medium.  Current export restrictions only allow American
companies to export primarily weak encryption technology.  The current strength
of encryption the U.S. government will allow out of the country is so weak that,
according to a January 1996 study conducted by world-renowned cryptographers, a
pedestrian hacker can crack the codes in a matter of hours.  A foreign
intelligence agency can crack the current 40-bit codes in seconds.<BR>
<BR>
        Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet and similar
interactive communications technologies by Americans to obtain critical medical
services, to conduct business, to be entertained and communicate with their
friends, raises special concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of those
communications.  I have long been concerned about these issues, and have worked
over the past decade to protect privacy and security for our wire and electronic
communications.  Encryption technology provides an effective way to ensure that
only the people we choose can read our communications.<BR>
<BR>
        Encryption is critical for electronic commerce really to flourish on the
Internet, and for computer users to trust that their communciations will remain
private.  Today, I have sent out an open letter  to the Internet about this
encryption legislation.  So that people reading the letter can be assured that
it is really me sending it, I am using a popular encryption program called
&quot;Pretty Good Privacy&quot;, or &quot;PGP&quot;,  to authenticate my signature.  This is yet
another practical use of encryption, and an important one for electronic
commerce.<BR>
<BR>
        Maintaining the privacy and confidentiality of our computer
communications and information is very important to all of us both here and
abroad.  I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet about how human
rights groups in the Balkans have had their computers confiscated during raids
by security police seeking to find out the identities of people who have
complained about abuses.  The human rights groups have been able to get for free
from the Internet an encryption program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) to
protect their computer communications and files. These encrypted files are
undecipherable by the police and the names of the people who entrust their lives
to the human rights groups are safe.<BR>
<BR>
        The encryption bill, called the &quot;Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the
Digital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996,&quot; which we introduce today, would:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>Bar any government-mandated use of any particular encryption
system, including key escrow systems and affirm the right of American citizens
to use whatever form of encryption they choose domestically;
<P>
<LI>Loosen export restrictions on encryption products so that
American companies are able to export any generally available or mass market
encryption products without obtaining government approval; and
<P>
<LI>Limit the authority of the federal government to set standards
for encryption products used by businesses and individuals, particularly
standards which result in products with limited key lengths and key escrow.
</UL>
        This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with Senator Burns
and other congressional colleagues this year. Both bills call for an overhaul of
this country's export restrictions on encryption, and, if enacted, would quickly
result in the widespread availability of strong, privacy protecting
technologies. Both bills also prohibit a government-mandated key escrow
encryption system.  While PRO-CODE would limit the authority of the Commerce
Department to set encryption standards for use by private individuals and
businesses, the first bill we introduced, called the &quot;Encrypted Communications
Privacy Act&quot;, S.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement to
follow to obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to read the plaintext of
encrypted communications obtained under court order or other lawful process.<BR>
<BR>
        To satisfy national security and law enforcement concerns, both bills
have important exceptions to restrict encryption exports for military end-uses,
or to terrorist designated or embargoed countries, such as Cuba or North Korea.<BR>
<BR>
        I know this is not enough to satisfy our national security and law
enforcement agencies, who fear that the widespread use of strong encryption will
undercut their ability to eavesdrop on terrorists or other criminals.<BR>
<BR>
        BUT U.S. EXPORT CONTROLS WILL NOT KEEP ENCRYPTION OUT OF THE HANDS OF
CRIMINALS; THESE CONTROLS ONLY HURT LEGITIMATE USERS AND AMERICAN BUSINESS.  Any
criminal intent on encrypting his computer information or messages to avoid
getting caught can go into any Egghead store and buy off-the-shelf Lotus Notes
or Norton Utilities encryption program, both of which contain strong encryption
that cannot be exported. It is then a simple matter just to slip the software
disc into his pocket to smuggle out of the country.<BR>
<BR>
        Actually, it is even simpler than that for a foreign terrorist or any
criminal to get ahold of strong encryption. They don't even have to leave home.
With a computer, a modem and a telephone line, they could download for free off
the Internet from anywhere in the world strong encryption, such as Pretty Good
Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
        Strong encryption has an important use as a crime prevention shield, to
stop hackers, industrial spies and thieves from snooping into private computer
files and stealing valuable proprietary information. We should be encouraging
the use of strong encryption to prevent certain types of computer and online
crime.<BR>
<BR>
        It is clear that the current policy towards encryption exports is
hopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs of individuals and
businesses in the global marketplace.
<BR>
        In one recent example, a major high-tech firm had a multi-million dollar
contract to sell digital television systems to China put at risk due to our
export regulations. Why? The company suffered lengthy delays in getting export
approval because the systems contained encryption technology to scramble TV
signals--a critical component of the system to protect the intellectual property
rights of the programming carried by the signal. Foreign competitors seeking to
get into the vast China market were ready and willing to step into the company's
place if it were unable to fulfill its contractual obligations. Two weeks after
the contractual delivery date, the company finally got the export approval it
sought. This example is particularly ironic since in trade negotiations, the
United States has strongly urged China to protect intellectual property rights
better.<BR>
<BR>
        Encryption expert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted that
current U.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption are having a
&quot;deleterious effect ... on our country's ability to develop a reliable and
trustworthy information infrastructure.&quot;  This sentiment is echoed by the chief
executive officers of 13 major U.S. computer systems companies, including IBM,
Apple, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard and others, which recently reported
that &quot;encryption is the most practical and effective means to protect valuable
and confidential electronic information traveling across open networks.  The
availability of effective encryption is necessary to realize the full potential
of the Global Information Infrastructure (GII).&quot;<BR>
<BR>
        The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our national
encryption policy on the right course. The PRO-CODE bill, as well as the
&quot;Encrypted Communications Privacy Act,&quot; S.1587, are much-needed steps to reform
our nation's cryptography policy.<BR>

     LETTER FROM SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY (D-VT) ON ENCRYPTION
     
May 2, 1996

Dear Friends:

Today, a bipartisan group of Senators has joined me in supporting
legislation to encourage the development and use of strong,
privacy-enhancing technologies for the Internet by rolling back
the out-dated restrictions on the export of strong cryptography.

In an effort to demonstrate one of the more practical uses of
encryption technology (and so that you all know this message
actually came from me), I have signed this message using a
digital signature generated by the popular encryption program
PGP.  I am proud to be the first member of Congress to utilize
encryption and digital signatures to post a message to the
Internet.

As a fellow Internet user, I care deeply about protecting
individual privacy and encouraging the development of the Net as
a secure and trusted communications medium.  I do not need to
tell you that current export restrictions only allow American
companies to export primarily weak encryption technology.  The
current strength of encryption the U.S. government will allow out
of the country is so weak that, according to a January 1996 study
conducted by world-renowned cryptographers, a pedestrian hacker
can crack the codes in a matter of hours!  A foreign intelligence
agency can crack the current 40-bit codes in seconds.

Perhaps more importantly, the increasing use of the Internet and
similar interactive communications technologies by Americans to
obtain critical medical services, to conduct business, to be
entertained and communicate with their friends, raises special
concerns about the privacy and confidentiality of those
communications.  I have long been concerned about these issues,
and have worked over the past decade to protect privacy and
security for our wire and electronic communications.  Encryption
technology provides an effective way to ensure that only the
people we choose can read our communications.

I have read horror stories sent to me over the Internet about how
human rights groups in the Balkans have had their computers
confiscated during raids by security police seeking to find out
the identities of people who have complained about abuses. 
Thanks to PGP, the encrypted files were undecipherable by the
police and the names of the people who entrusted their lives to
the human rights groups were safe.

The new bill, called the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the
Digital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996," would:

     o    bar any government-mandated use of any particular
     encryption system, including key escrow systems and affirm
     the right of American citizens to use whatever form of
     encryption they choose domestically;

     o    loosen export restrictions on encryption products so
     that American companies are able to export any generally
     available or mass market encryption products without
     obtaining government approval; and

     o    limit the authority of the federal government to set
     standards for encryption products used by businesses and
     individuals, particularly standards which result in products
     with limited key lengths and key escrow.

This is the second encryption bill I have introduced with Senator
Burns and other congressional colleagues this year. Both bills
call for an overhaul of this country's export restrictions on
encryption, and, if enacted, would quickly result in the
widespread availability of strong, privacy protecting
technologies. Both bills also prohibit a government-mandated key
escrow encryption system.  While PRO-CODE would limit the
authority of the Commerce Department to set encryption standards
for use by private individuals and businesses, the first bill we
introduced, called the "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act",
S.1587, would set up stringent procedures for law enforcement to
follow to obtain decoding keys or decryption assistance to read
the plaintext of encrypted communications obtained under court
order or other lawful process.

It is clear that the current policy towards encryption exports is
hopelessly outdated, and fails to account for the real needs of
individuals and businesses in the global marketplace.  Encryption
expert Matt Blaze, in a recent letter to me, noted that current
U.S. regulations governing the use and export of encryption are
having a "deleterious effect ... on our country's ability to
develop a reliable and trustworthy information infrastructure." 
The time is right for Congress to take steps to put our national
encryption policy on the right course.

I am looking forward to hearing from you on this important issue.
Throughout the course of the recent debate on the Communications
Decency Act, the input from Internet users was very valuable to
me and some of my Senate colleagues.

You can find out more about the issue at my World Wide Web home
page (http://www.leahy.senate.gov/) and at the Encryption Policy
Resource Page (http://www.crypto.com/). Over the coming months, I
look forward to the help of the Net community in convincing other
Members of Congress and the Administration of the need to reform
our nation's cryptography policy.

Sincerely,

Patrick Leahy
United States Senator

<b>MEMORANDUM FOR INTERESTED PARTIES</b>
<p>
SUBJECT:  Draft Paper, "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security
          and Public Safety in the Global Information
          Infrastructure"
<p><table>
<tr><td>FROM:     </td><td>Bruce W. McConnell [Initials]</td></tr>

<tr><td></td><td>          Co-Chairs, Interagency Working Group on
          Cryptography Policy</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
     Attached for your review and comment is a draft paper
entitled "Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public
Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure." It presents
a vision and course of action for developing a cryptographic
infrastructure that will protect valuable information on
national and international networks.
<p>
     The draft paper is the result of the many discussions we
have had with interested parties concerning the use of
encryption. While those discussions have explored the use of
both key recoverable encryption and non-recoverable
encryption, the draft paper addresses an infrastructure which
uses key recoverable encryption. We believe such a key
management infrastructure, voluntary and supported by *private
sector* key management organizations, is the prospect of the
near future. It would permit users and manufacturers free
choice of encryption algorithm, facilitate international
interoperability, preserve law enforcement access, and, most
importantly, provide strong system security and integrity.
<p>
     Recognizing that a robust infrastructure is not yet a
reality, we are also considering measures to liberalize export
policy for some non-escrowed products. Appendix II of the
draft paper begins to summarize current policy, and we intend
to expand and improve that section.
<p>
     We believe that clearly articulating such a vision will
accelerate the ability of the United States to realize the
full advantages of the global network for commerce, security
and public safety. However, such a vision cannot become a
reality unless it is widely shared. Therefore, rather than
being a finished product, the attached paper is a draft which
we ask you to help us improve. We hope it will contribute to
constructive discussion and promote a clearer understanding of
each others' needs and concerns regarding the use of
encryption.
<p>
     We welcome your comments and look forward to further
discussion. Written comments may be sent to our attention,
Room 10236, NEOB, Washington, D.C. 20503.

<h1>Enabling Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the
Global Information Infrastructure</h1>
<p>
<h3>Statement of the Issue</h3>

     This paper outlines a course of action for developing an
infrastructure that will protect valuable national information
resources on national and international networks. Government
and industry must work together to create a security
management infrastructure and attendant products that
incorporate robust cryptography without undermining national
security and public safety. A policy for escrow of
cryptographic keys which provides a basis for bilateral and
multilateral government agreements must be determined so that
industry can produce products for worldwide interoperability.
Industry will participate in defining algorithms and protocol
standards, and will develop key escrow encryption products
suitable for the protection of both government and private
sector information and which will assure timely, lawful,
government decryption access. Government will help set
standards for the Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) and
deliver a market for robust security products. A KMI
infrastructure and attendant key escrow products will provide
many benefits, both domestic and internationally, as the US
begins to realize the advantages of the global network for
improve commerce, security and public safety.

<hr>

<h1>I.  Introduction</h1>
<p>
     Government can no longer monopolize state of the art
cryptography. It is no longer acceptable to argue that the
only information of a compelling national security interest is
government information. It is unrealistic to believe that
government can produce solutions which keep ahead of today's
rapdily changing information technology. Increasingly, all
institutions, military, civil, or corporate, will communicate
across common links. The nation's commerce is moving to
networking. With these enormous changes, means must be found
to responsibly raise the quality of cryptographic services
without jeopardizing effective law enforcement, imperiling
public safety.
<p>
     Industry and government must partner in the development
of a public key-based key management infrastructure and
attendant products that will assure participants can transmit
and receive information electronically with confidence in the
information's integrity, authenticity, and origin and which
will assure timely lawful government access. When we conduct
transactions, we rely on face-to-face interactions, or
obtaining a signature on a paper, to have confidence that
commitments will be fulfilled. Policies and infrastructure are
needed to assure we can have at least the same degree of
confidence when we interact electronically. Government bears
a significant responsibility to ensure the information
infrastructure has the features that are essential to such
confidence.
<p>
     There is a more compelling rationale for the government
to be a partner in the development of the KMI. Not only has
the Information Age sparked fundamental changes in the way we
interact, but reliance on information systems makes our
institutions vulnerable to an unprecedented degree. Almost all
institutions upon which public safety and national security
depend, ranging from the power grid to military command and
control, are at severe risk because of their presence in and
dependence upon a global information infrastructure.
<p>
     But the proliferation of quality cryptographic services
is not without risk. Keys can be lost, stolen, or forgotten --
rendering encrypted data useless. Additionally, the widespread
use of encryption without safety features such as key recovery
can pose serious risks to society. It will put at risk
important law enforcement and national security investigations
where electronic surveillance and search and seizure are
essential in preserving and prosecuting crimes, and more
importantly, in saving human life.
<p>
     Public key cryptography allows for secure authenticated
transactions with any party, known or unknown, with assurance
of data integrity and non-repudiation of the transaction.
These features, together with increased network reliability,
are needed to support electronic commerce, public services,
redefined business processes and national security.  But to
achieve its promise, public key cryptography must be based on
a key management infrastructure and attendant products that
tie individual and coprorate identities to their public key
through a series of Certificate Authorities (CA). The key
management infrastructure to do this on a global scale will be
very large and complex, but it is an essential foundation.
Without a KMI of trusted certificate authorities, users cannot
know with whom they are dealing on the network, or sending
money to, or who signed a document, or if the document was
intercepted and changed by a third part. Therefore, users will
demand a strong key management infrastructure, which may, in
turn, be based on a voluntary system of commercial certificate
authorities (CAs) operating within prescribed policy and
performance guidelines. To achieve the environment for such an
approach, a number of principles need to be accepted by
government, industry, and other users:
<p>
<ul>
<li>
    Participation in the KMI will be voluntary. Key escrow in
     the KMI will occur naturally through mutually trusted
     authorities.
<li>
    There will be a transition period during which legacy
     equipments which do not support key recovery can be used
     to communicate with users in emerging full featured KMIs.
     Government, industry, and users will need to address the
     legitimate needs of those currently using non-key

<h1>II.  Key Management Infrastructure</h1>
<p>
     In a key management infrastructure (KMI) based on public
key cryptography, each user has one or more pairs of public
and private keys. The public and private keys differ in a such
a way that it is computationally infeasible to determine the
private key from the public key. This allows the public key to
be revealed without endangering the security of the private
key. Users can communicate securely without having to share a
"secret"; they only need to know each other's public key and
that each public key is certified by a trusted authority.
Without assurance on the "binding" of a user to a specific
public key, these keys have little or no value.
<p>
     Public key cryptography supports security services such
as authentication, confidentiality, data integrity and
nonrepudiation. Access to a user's encrypted data for which
the key is lost is a security related service referred to as
data recovery. Providing a secure and trusted means of storing
private keys within the Key Management Infrastructure is one
means of providing data recovery. This capability naturally
supports law enforcement access, under legal warrants. Thus,
the user desire for data recovery and law enforcement's
potential need for access can be accommodated in a single
locale, so long as the user trusts the key storage and law
enforcement has confidentiality of access.(2)

<hr>
<p>
     The simplest model for a KMI meets government access
requirements by relying on the certificate authorities (CAs).
However, the hierarchy could be structured to include a
separate Escrow Authority (EA) to provide law enforcement
access. Provision for split keys to enhance personal privacy
and security can be incorporated into the KMI. Either of these
mechanisms lessens the burden of key escrow on users and on
the producers of security products.
<p>
     To participate in the network a user needs a public key
certificate signed by a CA which "binds" the user's identity
to their public key. One condition of obtaining a certificate
is that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or other
information as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certified
escrow authority to allow access to a user's data or
communications.(3) (As noted before, this might be the CA or
an independent escrow authority). The certificate creation
process is pictured above.
<p>
     For users to have confidence in the KMI, CAs must meet
minimum standards for security, performance, and liability. A
Policy Approving Authority (PAA) certifies CAs for operation.
The PAA sets rules and responsibilities for ensuring the
integrity of the CAs. The PAA is also responsible for setting
CA performance criteria to meet law enforcement needs.
<p>
     If law enforcement has obtained legal authority to access
a user's encrypted data or communications, it would certify
that authorization to the escrow authority. The escrow
authority will then relinquish information sufficient to
access the user's communication.
<p>
----------<br>
(3)  This applies only to keys used for confidentiality
     purposes and not keys used for signing purposes.

<h1>III. Some Issues</h1>
<p>
     Difficult issues include i) how to refine the application
of export controls, ii) whether and to what extent to permit
self-escrow, iii) whether legislation is required and, if so,
what it should accomplish, and iv) the certainty and extent
that government-to-government agreements can be established to
ensure timely law enforcement access to keys/information held
by a foreign country. This section of the White paper briefly
explores each.
<p>
<p>
Export Controls
<p>
     The most contentious issue surrounding encryption is
export control policy. Encryption exports are controlled to
all destinations in the interest of U.S. national security/
foreign policy under the Arms Export Control Act. These export
controls are often criticized as an impediment to the fielding
of interoperable security across the GII and the
competitiveness of U.S. industry. The government is mindful of
these criticisms and has initiated a number of reforms to ease
the impact export controls have on manufacturers and users of
encryption. The task, then, is to find a method of applying
export controls that meets the interest of national security,
public safety, privacy, and competitiveness.
<p>
     Freedom to choose any mutually trusted certificate
authority may accommodate the above interests.(4) In addition,
allowing ready export of products of any bit length to markets
where the key management infrastructure, which complies with
statuatory constraints, is in place to permit government
access to keys, would provide both a level market for U.S.
manufacturers and higher quality security products for users.
Products that meet defined performance requirements and which
will not operate until the key is escrowed with an appropriate
certificate authority will address commercial, public safety
and national security needs. Some law enforcement and national
security concerns would be protected since government agencies
would be able to obtain escrowed keys pursuant to government-
to-government agreements.
<p>
----------<br>
(4)  A mutually trusted authority is an escrow agent trusted
     by users to store keys and trusted by law enforcement to
     provide access upon certification of lawful authority.
<hr>
<p>
Transition
<p>
     We are working toward a policy that permits licensing of
key recovery encryption systems regardless of algorithm, bit
length, or whether implemented in hardware or software, once
needed infrastructure and government-to-government agreements
are in place. In the interim we recognize that the policy must
make it worthwhile for manufacturers and users to invest in
escrowed KMI. With these objectives in mind, and consistent
with applicable statutes, the interim policy will consider:
<p>
Prior to formal government-to-government agreements:
<ul><li>
    Permitting export of products that use an escrowed KMI to
     approved markets, e.g., Europe or Australia, consistent
     with the policies of the destination country.
</ul>

<p>
Prior to multi-national Public Key Infrastructure with Key
Recovery:
<ul><li>
    Reviewing, on a case-by-case basis, proposals to export
     products which require the use of an escrowed KMI to any
     destination with which the U.S. has a government-to-
     government key escrow agreement.
<li>
    Continuing and expanding the administration's previously
     announced key escrow initiative by permitting the export
     of 64 bit S/W or 80 bit H/W key escrow products that meet
     defined performance requirements, after one-time review,
     to any destination if keys will be escrowed in the U.S.,
     or in foreign countries with which the U.S. has a
     government-to-government key escrow agreement.
</ul><p>
In any condition:
<ul><li>
    Permitting the export of other products on a case-by-case
     determination that such exports are consistent with US
     interests.
</ul>
<p>
     The proposals for an interim export control policy are
founded on the assumption that the products will require the
use of an escrowed KMI in a country with which the U.S. has a
government-to-government agreement. Note that the contemplated
exports are to civil end-users; exports to military end-users
will require more extensive product review. The existing
policies applicable to unescrowed products provide substantial
flexibility and will continue as currently defined throughout
the transition period (see Appendix II). Additional requests
for near-term relief will be considered on a case-by-case
basis consistent with existing practice.
<p>
     The interim policy also reflects a judgment that overseas
escrow of key will generally be permissible with suitable
government-to-government arrangements. There is a concern that
U.S. products with keys escrowed in the U.S. will not be
salable overseas. Hence, it may be possible to permit
overseas escrow in Europe, even before government-to-
government arraignments are completed. This exception is
possible since the European countries are already moving to
implement key escrow systems and we can reasonably expect to
enter into law enforcement agreements in the near term. The
OECD's goal of negotiating multilateral cryptography
guidelines by 31 December 1996 is further evidence of European
intent and momentum in infrastructure development.
<p>
     The interim policy reflects a differentiation between
hardware and software products, i.e., hardware products with
greater bit lengths are treated more favorably under this
policy. Hardware implementations of products permit more
confident binding between encryption and the key management,
limiting the risk that the encryption can be easily stripped
from the key management and used independently of key
recovery. Software does not provide similar protection. This
said, the interim policy to permit export of 64 bit software
key recovery products would reflect a significant increase
over the bit length restrictions applicable to non-key
recovery products.
<p>
<p>
Self-Escrow
<p>
     Self-escrow will be a principal concern of many large
corporations that want to provide corporate data recovery,
protect against loss of proprietary data from use of an
outside escrow agent, and simply for reasons of efficiency and
cost. Hence, self-escrow must be considered as an acceptable
option.
<p>
     Escrow requires less architecture if the CA can be the
escrow authority. However, in those cases in which an
individual or corporation serves as its own certificate
authority, government organizations could be compelled to
request escrowed key from the subject of an investigation. The
investigation could be compromised under such circumstances.
While this risk could be avoided by adding independent escrow
authorities as another layer in the PKI, such a solution would
be costly and inefficient.
<p>
     A solution is a national policy which allows CAs for an
organization to serve as escrow authorities if they can meet
necessary performance requirements. These requirements should
be determined by government in consultation with industry and
should address timeliness, security, confidentiality of
requests for, or release of, keys, and independence of the
escrow authority from the rest of the organization. To this
end, the government should seek legislation that would shield
organization certificate authorities from internal pressures
in the course of law enforcement investigations.
<p>
<p>
Legislation
<p>
     There is some consensus that the ultimate legislative
package should include provisions to criminalize the
unauthorized disclosure/use of escrowed key, provisions to
authorize civil actions by victims against those responsible
for the unauthorized disclosure/use of escrowed key,
provisions specifying the circumstances in which escrowed key
may be requested and released (e.g., death of a family member
or employee), and establishing liability protection for
certificate authorities who exercises due prudence in the
fulfillment of their performance obligations.
<p>
     Those who endorse a larger government role would seek
legislation that would, for example, establish the government
as a major participant in the PAA, which would be responsible
to establish policies and guidelines governing certificate
issuance. In this case, the government would be authorized to
assure establishment of standards for the PKI that adequately
provide for systems security and law enforcement access.
Inasmuch as the integrity and reliability of the whole range
of network centered activities, including electronic commerce,
will depend on the integrity and reliability of the key
management certificate process, there is good reason for
government to play a substantial role.
<p>
     The enabling legislation envisioned here should reflect
the stated needs of industry and users. To that end,
government must work closely with industry and other affected
parties to develop such legislation.
<p>
<p>
Government to Government Agreements
<p>
     There is an expressed need by all governments to have
access to information affecting their own security or public
safety. Inevitably there will be situations in which the U.S.
will want access to keys in a foreign country that concern
criminal activities in violation of U.S. laws and vice versa.
The security and other technical protocols that will serve as
the framework of the GII should ensure key recovery is
possible in either circumstance. The U.S. government should
seek to frame and execute law enforcement agreements that:
<ul><li>
    will allow for timely access when authorized
<li>
    minimally impact security products
<li>
    operate within guidelines established for key recovery
     methods including trusted third parties and self-escrow
     standards used in the U.S.
</ul><p>
     It would be recognized that no agreement can guarantee
access to keys/information held in a foreign country, but
established agreements might serve as a framework to request
lawful access to keys/information. Such arrangements will be
based on the philosophy that authorized government access must
be preserved consistent with the legally recognized privacy
interests of the citizens of each country.
<p>

<p>
<p>
<h1>IV.  Actions</h1>
<p>
     Several issues discussed in this paper raise substantial
policy questions that will not be easily resolved. The
government, however, has an interest in seeing good security
products populate the NII and GII as soon as possible.
<p>
     To demonstrate resolve and good faith, the United States
Government should immediately:
<p>
     1.   Collaborate with industry and existing standards
          groups, to develop Key Management Infrastructure
          and attendant products performance requirements
          (with a working draft completed within 6 months);
<p>
     2.   Collaborate with industry on a Federal Information
          Processing Standard (FIPS) within government that
          specifies a suite of algorithms and protocols for
          encryption, key exchange, and digital signature
          functions sufficient to protect government
          information. The resulting FIPS should provide for
          key recovery operations and should be mandatory for
          government use.
<p>
     3.   Establish a security management infrastructure for
          government use which complies with the standards
          developed jointly by industry and government. This
          is the first step in providing a market for
          industry products which support the new FIPS.
<p>
     4.   Determine an appropriate government agency to work
          with industry in specifying security requirements
          for products used in network security applications
          for protecting highly sensitive information.
<p>
     5.   Collaborate with industry to formulate legislation
          to establish viable key management infrastructure.
          Such legislation would, inter alia, set policies
          for assuring the integrity of escrowed key,
          establish an appropriate government role in this
          PAA, and address civil liability issues.
<p>
     6.   Negotiate with other governments arrangements for
          access to escrowed keys consistent with national
          sovereignty, national security, and public safety.
<p>
<p>
     As trusted partners, industry and government can share
expertise and tackle intractable problems such as the insecure
operating system. In times past, the cryptographic algorithm
was the core of the solution: now it is the easy part. The
debate over algorithms and bit lengths should end: it is time
for industry and governments to work together to secure the
GII in such a way that does not put the world at risk.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h1>Appendix I:  One View of a KMI</h1>
<p>
     The discussion given here is intended to provide a
description of how a KMI might be designed and operated
consistent with the tenets of the White Paper. This
description is not intended to preclude consideration of
other, equally suitable, implementations.
<p>
<p>
Introduction to KMI Based Escrow
<p>
     In a KMI based on public key cryptography, each user has
one or more pairs of public and private keys. The public and
private keys differ in such a way that it is computationally
infeasible to determine the private key from the public key.
This allows the public key to be revealed without endangering
the security of the private key. Users can communicate
securely without having to share a "secret", they only need to
know each other's public key. In practice, users may have
multiple public/private key pairs.
<p>
     The key pairs may be used in applications such as key
exchanges and digital signatures. To make use of such
applications, a user's public keys must be available to
intended recipients in a manner that the recipient can
confidently associate the user with his/her public key.
Without assurances on the "binding" of user identities to a
specific public key, these keys have little or no value.
<p>
     Thus, in the context of public key cryptography, the
strength of cryptographic mechanisms relates to protecting the
confidentiality of the private keys and the integrity of the
public keys. Ultimately, the viability of public key
cryptographic applications is dependent on the evolution of a
key management infrastructure.
<p>
<p>
KMI and Certificates
<p>
     The KMI supports the integrity of public keys through the
generation and distribution of public key certificates. The
role of a certificate is to cryptographically bind a specific
user identity with a public key and other security related
information. A trusted system entity, generally called a
Certificate Authority (CA), obtains information from an
individual sufficient to verify the individual is who he says
he is. The CA then generates and digitally signs a certificate
specific to that individual using the CA's private signature
key. Any system user can then validate the contents of that
certificate by verifying the CA's digital signature (via the
CA's public signature key).
<p>
     Certificate contents must be bound together by a
mechanism which can be authenticated. The certificate format
commonly used is based on the structure defined by the CCITT
X.509 Recommendation. This has worldwide support in industry
and governments.
<p>
     The concept of a CA can be easily extended to apply to a
large system of users where a single CA is not feasible.
Providing interoperability within a system containing multiple
CAs leads to a hierarchical structure. At the very top of the
hierarchy is a Root entity which is often referred to as a
Policy Approving Authority (PAA). The PAA represents the
single node in the hierarchy that all system users trust. The
PAA creates the overall guidelines and policies for the
operation of the KMI. The PAA exists to ensure the security
and integrity of each and every entity within the hierarchy.
Security and integrity are enforced by PAA certifying the
public keys of subordinate CAs. Each of these subordinate CAs
may also certify the public keys of other CAs or users. A
sample hierarchy is pictured below. The PAA public signature
key is possessed by all those in the hierarchy.
<p>
<hr>
<pre>
[Hierarchical Diagram]
<p>
                          PAA

                  CA1     CA2    CA3
                   |       |      |
               CA4    CA5     CA6     CA7
                |      |       |       |
     (------------------ Users ----------------)
<p>
</pre><hr>

<p>
     Any two users within a defined hierarchy can validate
each other's public key certificates through a common
certification path. A certification path is an ordered
sequence of certificates between the entity to be validated
and the trusted point in the hierarchy, i.e., PAA. This
defines a path of trust. Validation of any system certificate
requires that each certificate in the certification path be
checked by verifying the digital signature over each
certificate.
<p>
     To maintain trust in the path, the entities making up
certificate authorities must follow prescribed rules for
identifying users, issuing certificates, and protecting keys.
Adherence to these regulations can be enforced by a PAA or as
a condition of cross certification between two Certificate
Authorities.
<p>
     After a CA generates a certificate, it is transferred to
the user along with the certificates in the user's
certification path. Distribution of certificates among system
entities can be accomplished by sending them via e-mail
(quickly becomes unwieldy) or through the use of a Directory
System. Other users can then request and retrieve certificates
directly from a Directory Server.
<p>
     The hierarchical structure is designed to support
multiple communities of users who may need to communicate with
each other. It is also possible that some communities of users
in the system could remain autnomous and yet still be able to
communicate with users outside their immediate community of
interest. The PAA provides the means for such inter-community
communication by functioning as the single mutually trusted
authority for the entire hierarchy.
<p>
<p>
Cross Certification
<p>
     There could exist one or more PAAs within the U.S. and
non-U.S. KMIs. To permit communication between users of
different PAA domains, a common certification path must exist.
Cross certification will be based on the existence of accepted
policies and standard certification criteria. PAAs from each
KMI could then cross certify each other. This is accomplished
by each PAA countersigning the registered public key
certificates of the other. This cross certifying of
certificates provides a valid certification path for all users
in the respective KMIs.
<p>

<center>      Cross Certification Options Between Distinct KMIs</center>

<p>
     This scenario permits specific entities under one PAA to
have a verifiable certification path for communications with
entities serviced by another PAA. It is important to note,
however, that the integrity of this cross certification system
is only assured by limiting cross certification to bilateral
nad direct connection between the two PAAs involved. One PAA
should not rely on the representation of another that a third
PAA has been authenticated.
<p>
<p>
Key Recovery Performance Criteria
<p>
     Key recovery provides for backup storage of a user's
private keys. This backup capability helps ensure the
availability of a user's data even after it has been
encrypted. It also provides for an effective means for law
enforcement access. Key recovery requirements would be viewed
from the perspective of the individual, the corporation, or
governments that require access. Most of the criteria to be
discussed have a dimension for key recovery on an individual
basis as well as from a corporate or government perspective.
The criteria can be grouped into three categories.
<p>
<p>
1.   Key Integrity:
<ul><li>
    Confidentiality - Key recovery storage and release
     mechanisms must preclude simple exploitation.
<li>
    Availability - Key recovery data must be available when
     subject to authorized release.
</ul>
<p>
2.   Key Accessibility:
<ul><li>
    Responsiveness - Timely access to key recovery
     information requires 24 hour responsiveness and real time
     accessibility requires a two hour response window to
     authorized requests.
<li>
    Confidentiality - Confidentiality must be maintained on
     all requests for release of key recovery information.
<li>
    Proof of Approval - Trustworthy on-line or off-line
     mechanisms must exist to support identification and
     authorized release of key recovery information.
</ul>
<p>
3.   Key Recovery Use:
<ul><li>
    Subject Message Recovery - All information related to the
     subject of the recovery request must be accessible
     through the release of key recovery information
     pertaining only to that subject.
<li>
    Release Window - The start and end dates of authorized
     key recovery periods must be enforced.
</ul>

          -->  User A (private keys and certificates)

</pre>
<p>
     Key recovery fits well within a public key KMI.
Interleaving key recovery within the KMI provides for a
concentration of trust that stands to benefit the individuals
from a confidentiality of private key aspect and facilitates
government access by limiting the number of access points. The
most simple model is to rely on the existing CAs within the
KMI to meet government access requirements. If necessary,
however, the hierarchy can be structured to include an Escrow
Authority (EA) as a separate trusted entity.
<p>
     EA hierarchy is intrinsically shallow when compared with
the depth of the CA hierarchy. The structure is more likened
to a peer group of EAs that all fall under the jurisdiction of
the KMIs PAA which creates guidelines and policies for EA
operation. To become a system endorsed EA entity, an EA must
be certified by the PAA. Certification encompasses
satisfactory implementation of the standards and policies put
forth by the PAA. The PAA provides the standardization for the
escrow functions to occur across multiple EA entities with an
equivalent degree of trust. It is important to stress that
some or all of the elements of the escrow infrastructure may
be the same as those in the certificate infrastructure. The
KMI supports both.
<p>
     As with the certification of subordinate CAs, the
recognition of a certified status for a particular EA is
embodied by the PAAs digital signature on the public key
certificate of the EA (thus attesting to the validity of the
service they provide). This allows a particular EA to have a
system-wide recognized signature, one that is traceable back
to a common trusted entity, the PAA.
<p>
     Two examples follow that show how the EA and CA entities
work in tandem to provide both a certificate and data recovery
service for users and law enforcement:
<p>
<p>
1.   Certificate and Recovery Registration.
<ul><li>
    In this example we have a single Escrow Authority
     distinct from the Certificate Authority. In reality, the
     EA may be the same entity as the CA or the EA may be one
     of a set of users certified by the government as an EA.
     The simple protocol described below follows closely the
     key escrow proposal made in 1993 by Silvio Micali of MIT.
<li>
    User A wishes to register, in the form of a public key
     certificate, a public key exchange key with his local
     certified KMI entity. User A does the following:
<ul>
  <li>    Identifies himself and securely distributes the
          public and private components of the key pair he
          wishes to have registered to a certified Escrow
          Authority (EA). This may be done electronically.
          Alternately, the EA could generate these keys for
          User A.
<li>
       Uniquely identifies himself to the CA. This must be
          done physically unless User A already possesses a
          valid signature key.
<li>
         Distributes the public component of the key pair he
          wishes to have certified to the CA.
</ul>
<li>
    The EA does the following:
<ul><li>
         Protectively stores the private component.
<li>
         Notifies the CA that a valid key pair has been
          "escrowed" for user A. (This notification can take
          the form of a signed message from the EA that
          contains the public key of User A.)
</ul>
<li>
    The CA does the following:
<ul><li>
         Verifies the identity of User A.
<li>
         Verifies the signature on the message received from
          the EA. This ensures that only properly escrowed
          keys are entered into the system.
<li>
         Generates a public key certificate that contains
          (at least) the public key exchange key acknowledged
          by the EA, an identifier representing User A, an
          identifier for EA, and validity period for
          certificate management.
<li>
         Digitally signs the certificate using the CA
          private signature key.
<li>
         Distributes the certificate to User A (and
          potentially to a Directory Service). User A then
          verifies the CA signature on the received
          certificate as well as the information it contains.
</ul>
<p>
     To more fully reflect the Key Integrity Criteria, the EA
entity could in fact be a set of EAs that work in conjunction
with a particular CA. Providing multiple EAs allows for
increased flexibility with respect to the generation, storage,
and recovery of key information. Not only would users have
increased flexibility of choice in selecting a certified EA,
but they essentially have a voice in who is entrusted with
protecting their keys. Specifically, the EA entity could be a
set of EAs, each of which only possesses a portion (key split)
for User A's private key component. This provides a recovery
mechanism for User A that more directly protects his private
key component since recovery of the key by other than
authorized requests would require collusion on the part of all
EAs, compromise of all EA storage mechanisms, or compromise of
all of the distribution paths used during recovery from each
EA to User A)
</ul>
<p></ul>
2.   User Key Recovery: An Archiving Example
<ul><li>
    In this example User A stores (archives) his data in
     encrypted form using a locally generated key. He must
     have alternate access to that encrypted data. Consider
     the following:
<ul><li>
         User A generates a private key (session, archive,
          message, etc.)
<li>
User A encrypts his information with this archive
key.
<li>
User A encrypts the archive key with his public key
exchange key (of which the private component is
escrowed).
<li>
The result of this encryption is stored, along with
          public escrow key, in the header portion of the
encrypted file.
<li>
Upon loss of his key exchange key, decryption of
the information is accomplished by requesting
release of the private key exchange key from the
EA.
<li>
User A identifies himself to the EA(s) holding his
private key and requests its release.
</ul>
<li>
The EA(s) does the following:
<ul><li>
Positively identifies the requestor.
<li>
Locates and securely transmits the private key
component to User A.
</ul></ul>
3.   Law Enforcement Key Recovery: An e-mail Example
<ul><li>
In this example the sender of a message, generates a
session key, encrypts the message with the session key
and encrypts the session key he uses to protect his
communications with the recipient's public key exchange
key. This encrypted session key is stored in the header
information of the encrypted message for recipient and
government recovery purposes. The key recovery process
proceeds in the following manner:
<ul><li>
Escrowed data to or from the subject of a lawful
investigation is intercepted.
<li>
The subject's public key certificate is obtained
from the data or a Directory Service.
<li>
The Escrow Authority ID is extracted from the
certificate. This allows law enforcement to locate
the private key components.
<li>
Legal authorization is obtained to receive the
appropriate escrowed private key(s) components.
<li>
Legal authorization is presented to appropriate
EA(s). This may involve working through foreign
governments.
<li>
EA(s) verifies authenticity of request.
<li>
EA(s) securely transmits the private key
component(s) to law enforcement (this could be
accomplished physically or electronically.)
<li>
  Law enforcement forms the private key from its
private key component(s) and decrypts to recover
the session key and the message.
</ul></ul>
<p>
     Law enforcement will destroy keys at the end of the
authorized period of use. Access can be also be time bounded
directly by users by repeating the registration process.
<p>
<hr>
<h1>Appendix II: Current Encryption Export Policies</h1>
     This appendix has been prepared to state clearly the
existing encryption export control policies and procedures.
<p>
     While the government recognizes that further progress is
needed in license processing, changes instituted to date have
resulted in a reduction of average license turnaround time of
39 days in 1993 to an average of 13 days in 1995. Further,
over 99% of export licenses for proposed cryptographic
products are approved each year.
<p>

Authorities
<p>
     The export of cryptographic products is regulated by the
Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act
(AECA) and its implementing International Traffic In Arms
Regulations (ITAR), and by the Department of Commerce pursuant
to the Export Administration Act (EAA) and its implementing
Export Administration Regulations (EAR).
<p>
     No license is required for the import of cryptographic
hardware or software. There are no federal laws regulating the
use of cryptographic products within the United States. A
license is required for the export of cryptographic products
to all destinations except Canada. Applications are reviewed
by the Department of Defense (NSA) for national security
implications and by State for foreign policy concerns. The
export licensing policy is consistent with U.S. national
security and foreign policy.
<p>
     The Department of Commerce controls the export of
rudimentary cryptographic products containing cryptographic
functions generally limited to purposes such as data
authentication, password protection, and access control.
Products which are determined to be covered by the Commerce
Control List (CCL), with certain foreign policy exceptions,
may be exported under a General License.
<p>
<p>
Procedures
<ul><li>
Autolist - For products reviewed and approved by NSA for
export to approved classes of end users and end uses.
Permits Department of State to process license
applications for such products without further review by
NSA.
<li>
Distribution Arrangements - Single license vehicle for
export of approved products to classes of end users in
countries or regions. Avoids need for licenses on an
export-by-export basis.
<li>
Distribution Agreements - Permits single license for
export of approved products to identified distributors.
Again, avoids export-by-export licensing.
<li>
Personal Use Exemption - Products exported for the
personal use of the exporter are excepted from pre-export
license requirements.
</ul>
<p>
Policies
<ul><li>
Products designed to use cryptography for access
control/authentication purposes are export controlled as
dual use commodities pursuant to the Export
Administration Act.
<li>
Product manufacturers determine if their products are
access control/authentication devices.
<li>
Generally, access control/authentication products are
exportable under general license procedures.
<li>
Mass-market software products verified as implementing
RC2/RC4 encryption algorithms, with 40-bit key space
limitations, are designated dual use items, to be
controlled under the Export Administration Act, after a
one-time review completed within 7 working days of
submission.
<li>
Mass-market software implementing other encryption
algorithms and key space lengths for confidentiality are
reviewed on a case-by-case basis for designation as dual
use items and control under the Export Administration
Act. By regulation, reviews must be completed within 15
days of submission.
<li>
Generally, licenses are approved for export of products
to be used in protecting U.S. proprietary information
(i.e., intellectual property).
<li>
U.S. companies and their subsidiaries are allowed to
export products with strong encryption for their internal
use.
<li>
Confidentiality encryption products that incorporate the
Data Encryption Standard (DES) are routinely approved for
export to:
<ul><li>
Financial institutions and financial applications
</ul>
<li>
Protecting financial information in Electronic
commerce applications
</ul>
<li>    Confidentiality encryption products that incorporate the
Data Encryption Standard (DES) are favorably considered
for export to:
<ul><li>
Applications involving protection of personal
medical data
<li>
Parking and toll systems; Debit applications; Other
transaction-based systems in which encryption is
configured to perform identified specific
transactions.

SUBJECT: Preliminary Analysis of &quot;Clipper III&quot; Encryption Proposal<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
The Administration's latest encryption policy proposal, already dubbed &quot;Clipper
III,&quot; would use a new government-sanctioned certification system as
an incentive to virtually impose key escrow on domestic encryption users.
The draft proposal, &quot;Achieving Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public
Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure,&quot; would establish a
new &quot;public key infrastructure&quot; for encryption. Such a public
key infrastructure would enable users of encryption to clearly identify
the people they are communicating with, and is widely viewed as an important
prerequisite for the widespread use of secure electronic communications.
However, the Clipper III proposal would establish this infrastructure at
a price: All users of the public key infrastructure would have to ensure
government access to their encryption keys through an approved key escrow
agent. <BR>
<BR>
Clipper III will not meet the privacy and security needs of Internet users.
While the proposal represents real progress by the Administration in recognizing
the importance of encryption, in reality it provides few provisions to protect
individual privacy. The proposal is hardly voluntary -- it makes key escrow
a virtual precondition for participation in a secure GII. It targets domestic
users of encryption, contains few guidelines for key exchanges with foreign
governments, and encourages collection of highly sensitive private key information.
Moreover, it contains none of the standards for key holder liability, limits
on access to keys by law enforcement, or audit requirements that many have
already identified as crucial to protecting individual privacy in even a
voluntary key escrow system. For these reasons, CDT believes that the Clipper
III proposal is another step in the wrong direction for U.S. encryption
policy.
<H3>Overview of the Administration Proposal</H3>
Taking a nod from the European Commission's recent Trusted Third Party initiative,
the Clipper III proposal would develop a needed public key infrastructure,
couched in the language of privacy and security, and use it as an incentive
for development of a de facto key escrow system. The Clipper III proposal:
<UL>
<LI>Acknowledges the importance of encryption and the need for a public
key infrastructure (PKI) -- The proposal reaffirms the importance of encryption
and the emerging need for a system to certify public encryption keys. Such
a &quot;public key infrastructure&quot; would allow users to certify to
other users that their public keys in fact belonged to them, allowing the
keys to be used and trusted for encrypted commerce and communication. Without
such a system, &quot;users cannot know with whom they are dealing on the
network, or sending money to, or who signed a document, or if the document
was intercepted and changed by a third party.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#note_1">1</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Establishes a complex new Key Management Infrastructure (KMI) -- The
proposal would form a new public key infrastructure to tie encryption users
to their public keys. The KMI would establish new certification authorities
that would guarantee -- and be held liable for -- the identity of a public
key. The new entities proposed under the Administration plan include:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI>Certification Authorities (CAs) - to identify and issue certificates
to users; 
  <LI>Escrow Authorities (EAs) - to hold private key information as required;
and 
  <LI>Policy Approving Authorities (PAAs) -- overarching bodies, possibly
under governmental control, responsible for certifying trusted escrow authorities.
  </UL>
<BR>
<LI>Requires key escrow as a condition of participation in the new public
key infrastructure -- In order to participate in the new Key Management
Infrastructure, users would be required to ensure law enforcement access
to encrypted information. &quot;One condition of obtaining a certificate
is that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or other information
as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certified escrow authority to allow
access to a user's data or communications.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#note_2">2</A></SUP>
The escrow agent could be the certification authority or another third-party,
so long as they meet &quot;minimum standards&quot; including &quot;performance
criteria to meet law enforcement's needs.&quot; Self-escrow would also be
allowed for entities that meet certain unspecified &quot;necessary performance
requirements.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Relaxes export controls for key escrow products as in Clipper II --
The proposal would &quot;continue and expand&quot; the NIST &quot;Clipper
II&quot; export control provisions proposed this fall, allowing 64 bit software/80
bit hardware exports to any destination if keys are escrowed in the U.S.
or if the U.S. has a bilateral escrow agreement. Other exports to certain
markets would be considered, upon case-by-case review and under certain
conditions. Key length limits would presumably expand as law enforcement
confidence in the key escrow authorities grew. 
</UL>
<H3>Critique and Areas of Concern</H3>
Clipper III does represent a major step forward by the Administration in
acknowledging the importance of encryption and public key cryptography:
&quot;Government can no longer monopolize state of the art cryptography.
... It is unrealistic to believe that government can produce solutions which
keep ahead of today's rapidly changing information technology.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#note_3">3</A></SUP>
The proposal goes on to note that, &quot;[Public key cryptography features]
are needed to support electronic commerce, public services, redefined business
processes, and national security.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
However, Clipper III is also a clear attempt to force the widespread adoption
of key escrow by leveraging the need of encryption users to participate
in a public key certification system. Major problems with the proposal include:
<UL>
<LI>It makes key escrow a precondition for participation in the public key
infrastructure - Other than law enforcement access, there is no reason the
public key infrastructure must store private keys. On the contrary, the
essential breakthrough of public key cryptography is the ability it gives
users to share public key information and partake fully in authenticated,
secure communications without revealing any private key information to third
parties. Data recovery -- the ability to recover encrypted data if a private
key is lost -- is the main rationale presented for key escrow. However,
data recovery can be done independently of the public key infrastructure
if desired, and in a more secure manner.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It is not voluntary -- Though participation is theoretically &quot;voluntary,&quot;
under Clipper III users will have no choice but to escrow their keys or
forego participation in the Information Age economy. The proposal itself
calls the key infrastructure a &quot;basic and entirely essential foundation.&quot;
To participate, users will need to escrow their keys; if they choose not
to participate in the KMI, users will be unable to obtain the essential
certifications that the Administration foresees as being the standard for
secure electronic communications and commerce. <BR>
<BR>
<LI>It targets domestic users -- While export controls have ostensibly been
aimed at controlling the use of encryption by foreign users, the Clipper
III proposal is clearly aimed at domestic users of encryption.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It leaves international key exchange problems unresolved -- Without
a system of international agreements, interoperability is at risk. The same
encryption and/or authentication scheme exportable to Germany or France
might not be exportable to India or China in the absence of appropriate
bilateral agreements. Bilateral agreements raise their own issues: under
what standards will keys be released to foreign governments, especially
those with no tradition of Fourth Amendment search and seizure protection?<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It contains no key escrow privacy provisions -- The Administration proposal
only tangentially addresses the privacy problems posed by key escrow systems.
As others have already noted in the encryption policy debate, any key escrow
system (even if voluntary) raises issues regarding the need for: liability
rules for unauthorized key disclosures by escrow agents; standards for law
enforcement access; auditing requirements for escrow agents; and guidelines
for decryption information access.<SUP><A HREF="#note_4">4</A></SUP> Clipper III contains
no such standards or guidelines.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It compromises network security by encouraging storage of private key
information -- Clipper III requires the accumulation of private keys or
other decryption information in dangerous and vulnerable points-of-failure
-- the escrow agents. At the same time as it seeks to design a secure infrastructure,
the proposal builds enormous new vulnerabilities into the system.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>It is not responsive to years of feedback from industry and policy advocates
--The proposal answers few of the concerns repeatedly raised by privacy
advocates or industry. It reflects a policy-making process still driven
by national security and law enforcement concerns rather than the privacy
needs of individuals and the security needs of the online economy. 
</UL>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
As the European Commission prepares to release its Trusted Third Party encryption
proposals in Europe, the very similar Clipper III proposal provides a preview
of the choices being made around the world to sacrifice privacy concerns
in the name of law enforcement access. The Administration proposal has the
potential to hold the budding public key infrastructure -- an important
component of secure communications online -- hostage to the demands of law
enforcement. Instead, CDT believes the Administration should use this opportunity
to develop a more secure and trusted communications infrastructure for all
users, even those in countries without the same tradition of Fourth Amendment
protection afforded to U.S. citizens. CDT looks forward to continuing to
work towards voluntary, private-sector security standards for the information
infrastructure independent of escrow requirements or export controls.<BR>

disclosure are consequently much higher than they need to be, and there

that key escrow is ever used, standards should be put in place to keep access
to encrypted information as narrowly tailored as possible. <BR>

(1) CLINTON ADMINISTRATION FLOATS 'CLIPPER III' KEY ESCROW PROPOSAL

The Clinton Administration Tuesday (5/21) unveiled a new encryption policy
proposal which would use a government-sanctioned key certification system
as an incentive to virtually impose key escrow on domestic users.

The draft proposal, "Achieving Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public
Safety in the Global Information Infrastructure" (already dubbed Clipper
III), seeks to establish a "public key infrastructure" for encryption.
Broadly speaking, a public key infrastructure would enable users to clearly
identify the people they are communicating with and facilitate key
management, and is widely viewed as an important component of a secure and
trusted communications environment. However, the Clipper III would
establish this infrastructure at a price: All users of the public key
infrastructure would have to ensure government access to their encryption
keys through an approved key escrow authority.

A detailed analysis of the Administration's latest draft proposal is
attached below. Among other concerns:

* The proposal is hardly voluntary - Key-escrow would become a
  prerequisite for participation in the Global Information
  Infrastructure.

* The proposal contains few guidelines for how keys would be shared with
  foreign governments.

* The proposal encourages the collection of highly sensitive private key
  information.

* The proposal does not address major privacy concerns such as liability
  for key holders, limitations on law enforcement access, audit
  requirements, and other concerns that many have already identified as
  crucial to protecting individual privacy even in a voluntary key
  escrow system.

CDT believes that the Administration's draft proposal does not meet the
privacy and security needs of Internet users or the demands of the
marketplace.  While the proposal represents real progress by the
Administration in recognizing the importance of encryption and the value of
a public key infrastructure, in reality it provides few provisions to
protect individual privacy.  Moreover, the Clipper III proposal, like its
predecessors, continues to put law enforcement and national security
concerns above the privacy and security needs of the American public.

The latest Administration proposal comes in the midst of Congressional
efforts to relax encryption export controls and encourage the widespread
use of strong, easy-to-use encryption and prohibit the government from
imposing key escrow domestically.  It also comes in the wake of a letter
signed by over 27 Representatives last week urging the Administration to
abandon its key-escrow initiative (See CDT Policy Post 2.19)

A copy of the Draft proposal is available on CDT's encryption policy web
page (http://www.cdt.org/crypto).

SUMMARY OF THE PROPOSAL:
------------------------

Taking a nod from the efforts currently under way through the European
Commission to establish a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in Europe, the
Clipper III seeks to establish a means of ensuring authentication and key
management for Americans.

Among other things, the Clipper III draft proposal:

* RECOGNIZES THAT THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT IMPOSE ENCRYPTION STANDARDS
  ON MARKET: One positive element of the new proposal is an explicit
  recognition of the importance of encryption and the need for private
  sector, as opposed to government solutions.  The draft states,
  "Government can no longer monopolize state of the art cryptography ...
  It is unrealistic to believe that government can produce solutions
  which keep ahead of today's rapidly changing information technology".

* ESTABLISHES KEY MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE: The draft proposal would 
  create a new public key infrastructure designed to tie individuals 
  and entities to their public keys.

* RELAXES EXPORT CONTROLS FOR KEY ESCROW PRODUCTS: The new draft would
  continue and expand the effort started with the Clipper II proposal by
  allowing the export of software with 64 bit key lengths (80 bits for
  hardware) on the condition that products contain a key-escrow
  function. Keys could be escrowed in the United States or where the
  US has a bilateral escrow agreement. Other exports to certain markets
  would be considered on a case-by-case basis.

* PROVIDES FOR 'SELF ESCROW' OF ENCRYPTION KEYS:  Self Escrow (where
  a corporation or individual could become an escrow agent for its own
  private keys) would be permitted, though the exact conditions of and
  obligations are not specified in the draft.

MAJOR FLAWS IN THE CLIPPER PROPOSAL RENDER IT A NON-STARTER
-----------------------------------------------------------

* CLIPPER III IS NOT VOLUNTARY & MAKES KEY-ESCROW A PRECONDITION FOR
  PARTICIPATION IN THE GLOBAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE

While the Administration deserves credit for recognizing that a trusted
public key infrastructure is an important component of a workable National
Encryption policy, the latest proposal attempts to use the need for a
public key infrastructure as a means to impose key escrow domestically.
Although the Administration has repeatedly stressed that any key-escrow
initiative would be a voluntary system, the text of the latest draft
directly contradicts that contention.

The proposal states that in order to participate in the Global Information
Infrastructure, users will need to escrow their keys; if they choose not to
participate in the key infrastructure, "users cannot know with whom they
are dealing on the network, or sending money too, or who signed a document,
or if the document was intercepted and changed by a third party." (page 3).

The proposal goes on to state:

  "To participate in the network a user needs a public key certificate
  signed by a CA [Certification Authority] which 'binds' the user's
  identity to their public key.  One condition of obtaining a
  certificate is that sufficient information (e.g., private keys or
  other information as appropriate) has been escrowed with a certified
  escrow authority to allow access to a user's data or communications."
  (page 5)

In other words, the Clipper III proposal would require individuals and
businesses to use key-escrow encryption as a condition of participating in
the Global Information Infrastructure.  Under the proposal, an individual
cannot obtain certification by a Key Certification Authority (a necessity
under the Clipper III scheme) unless he or she registers with a "certified
escrow authority".

There is no technical or structural reason (beyond law enforcement access)
why key escrow must be a component of a public key infrastructure.  In
fact, a robust example of a public key infrastructure exists today for
exchanging PGP keys (the PGP public key server at MIT
<http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/~bal/pks-toplev.html>).

* CLIPPER III TARGETS DOMESTIC USERS

While export controls have ostensibly been aimed at controlling the use of
encryption by foreign users (and indirectly, at domestic users as well),
the Clipper III proposal is aimed directly at the domestic use of
encryption and seeks to establish a system whereby key escrow becomes a
de-facto component of domestic encryption products.

* RAISES MAJOR QUESTIONS WITH RESPECT TO INTERNATIONAL KEY EXCHANGE

In order to work, Clipper III assumes bi-lateral agreements between the US
and other countries with respect to law enforcement access to escrowed
keys, who could legally be an escrow agent, and other factors.  Currently
no such agreements exist.  Bilateral agreements also raise important
privacy issues, including how to deal with releasing keys to foreign
governments, particularly those without any tradition of privacy
protections. Finally, a patchwork of international agreements can create
problems for interoperability.  The same encryption and or authentication
scheme exportable to Germany or England might not be exportable to India or
China in the absence of a appropriate bi-lateral agreements.

* CONTAINS NO PRIVACY PROTECTIONS/RESTRICTIONS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT ACCESS
  TO ESCROWED KEYS:

Like Clipper and Clipper II, the latest proposal does not squarely address
standards for law enforcement access to escrowed keys, unauthorized
disclosure of keys by escrow agents, and other privacy issues associated
with key escrow.

* CREATES VULNERABILITY AND INSECURITY BY ENCOURAGING STORAGE OF PRIVATE
  KEYS:

The proposal suggests that escrow agents hold either a user's private key
or "other information as appropriate".  Allowing escrow agents to
accumulate private keys creates severe vulnerabilities in the network.
Once a private key is disclosed (either to law enforcement or to an
unauthorized third party), *every* communication using that key is
compromised. Although the draft does attempt to limit this concern by
allowing escrow agents to hold "other information", the proposal no where
specifies what that would be.

NEXT STEPS
----------

Congress is currently considering legislation which would head off the
Administration's efforts to encourage domestic key-escrow encryption
schemes and promote the widesprad avaiability of strong, easy-to-ues
encryption technologies.

Several bills, including S.1726 (the Pro-CODE bill) sponsored by Senators
Burns (R-MT), Leahy (D-VT), Dole (R-KS), Pressler (R-SD), Wyden (D-OR) and
others, along with HR 3011, sponsored by Reps Goodlatte (R-VA), Eshoo
(D-CA), Campbell (D-CA) and over 25 others are currently being considered
by Congress. Both bills would relax export restrictions and prohibit the
government from imposing key escrow domestically.

CDT looks forward to working with Members of Congress to pass legislation
that encourages the widespread availability of strong, easy-to-use
encryption technologies based on marketplace, not government, standards.

<STRONG><CENTER>Burns: Clipper III Strikes Out</CENTER></STRONG>
<CENTER>New Clinton Computer "Wiretap" Plan Circulates With Few Changes</CENTER>

     WASHINGTON, D.C.   Montana Senator Conrad Burns today criticized 
the Clinton administration's latest computer security proposal as yet 
another government-driven mandate and urged swift passage of Burns' 
"Pro-CODE" bill, which addresses export of encryption technology and
prohibits mandatory decryption-key escrow.  Burns reacted to the 
circulation of a draft administration proposal entitled "Achieving 
Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global 
Information Infrastructure."

     The proposal, dated May 10 and dubbed "Clipper III" by critics, 
moves toward the loosening and possibly eventual elimination of 
export controls on encryption technologies, but only if companies and 
individuals surrender a copy of their code keys to a government-approved 
third party.

     "It's three strikes and you're out at the old ball game, and I would 
say that the third version of the administration's Clipper Chip proposal 
is a swing and a miss," Burns said.  "It's time to quit relying on 
government mandates for what is truly a matter of great concern to 
the private sector: the expansion of commerce on the Internet and other 
computer networks.

     "The administration has been using export restrictions as a billy 
club to force American companies into accepting government control 
over the keys to their computer files and transmissions.  At least this 
new proposal admits that the current 40-bit limit on exports is outdated 
and a poor guarantee of electronic security and integrity, but it again
operates from the standpoint that the government, and not the private 
sector, knows best when it comes to key strength and control over 
those keys.

     "We can only stick our heads in the sand for so long.  It is important 
to point out that the criminals and trouble-makers who are apparently 
targets of this plan are unlikely to enroll in any key-escrow system.  
Law-abiding businesses and individuals would suffer at the hands of this 
misguided proposal.

     "While this may appear to be a compromise of the administration's 
earlier positions, we have to remember that an executive action can be 
reversed just as quickly after an election year.  It is crucial that we pass 
legislation to codify a solution to the administration's current outdated 
export policies, and to ensure that the government won't force anyone to 
give up the keys to their computers."

<H2>More of the Same: Gore Announces Administration Statement on Encryption Policy</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on July 12, 1996 || Last Updated on July 12, 1996</FONT>
<P>
In a written statement issued Friday (7/12), Vice President Al Gore 
announced that the Administration will continue to push for the adoption of
a massive public key infrastructure to enable law enforcement access to
encryption communications and continue to rely on cold war-era export
controls.  This despite the growing pressure from Congress, privacy advocates, the computer
industry, and the public for the reform of US encryption policy, the
Administration continues to embrace its Clipper III key-escrow encryption
proposal.
<P>
CDT is disappointed that the Administration's latest statement offered no
new solutions to what is becoming a critical policy issue for the future of
the Internet and the development of a secure and trusted global information
infrastructure.

<H2>National Research Council Report Calls Administration Crypto Policy into  Question</h2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on May 31, 1996 || Last Updated on June 10, 1996</FONT>
<P>
On Thursday May 30, the Computer Science and Telecommunications Board (CSTB) of the National Research Council (NRC) released its comprehensive report on the state of U.S. encryption policy.  The report, "Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information Society," not only highlights the need for strong, reliable encryption, it calls the Administration's current cryptography policy in question.
<P>
Among other things, the report describes how the current US encryption
policy is not working, notes that classified information is not relevant to
the policy debate, and outlines the adverse impact export restrictions have
had on the domestic market.  In addition, the study emphasizes that market
forces and user choices, not law enforcement or national security
interests, should drive the development of encryption technologies and the
debate over US cryptography policy.

Twenty-seven members of the House of Representatives have urged President
Clinton not to proceed with the Administration's key escrow encryption
policy proposal. In a May 15 letter to the President, the bipartisan group
called on the Adminstration instead to "immediately liberalize export
controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products." The
bipartisan group, including Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va), Anna Eshoo (D-Ca),
Tom Campbell (R-Ca) and Eliot Engle (D-NY), argued that "the ability of
companies and individuals to ensure that the information they send over
communications and coputer netwroks is secure is a prerequisite to
exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure."

<PRE>
                                    ***

  Good morning.  In this age of telecommunications and lightning-speed
  advances in computing, keeping private information private gets tougher
  all the time.  Without proper safeguards, personal financial
  transactions, medical records, corporate secrets such as bidding
  information and proprietary research reports may be compromised by
  criminals and corporate spies.  Without proper safeguards, crucial
  information systems such as those of the banking system and the public
  switched telecommunications network may be vulnerable to intrusion by
  terrorists, curious computer hackers, and unfriendly foreign governments.

       One of the best ways to protect electronic information is through
  encryption, which is the use of mathematical formulas to scramble
  information into digital codes.  Once of concern only to spies and the
  military, cryptography has now become a vital tool for protecting the
  legitimate interests of  the nation's businesses and the privacy of its
  citizens.  This change has created a dilemma for the U.S. government
  because encryption also can be used in a wide range of illegitimate
  activities.  Drug dealers, terrorists, and other criminals can use
  cryptography to thwart even legally authorized search and surveillance by
  law enforcement officials; foreign governments can encrypt information
  that the U.S. needs to protect its national security.  Now the federal
  government -- which in the past has sought to restrict the spread of
  encryption --  must weigh the pros and cons of promoting broader use of
  cryptography.

       The National Research Council was asked by Congress to provide
  policy makers with guidance in making this assessment. Our study
  committee was made up of individuals with expertise in many relevant
  fields: technical expertise in computers, communications, and
  cryptography; policy experience in law enforcement, intelligence, civil
  liberties, national security, diplomacy, and international trade;
  business experience in telecommunications and computer hardware and
  software, as well as in protecting information in the for-profit and
  not-for-profit sectors.  It was formed to examine the appropriate balance
  among various national security, law enforcement, business, and privacy
  interests.

       Our committee's broad conclusion is that the advantages of
  cryptography in safeguarding information outweigh the possible
  disadvantages of making apprehension and prosecution of criminals more
  difficult.  Thus, we believe that federal policies should promote rather
  than discourage the use of encryption.  For example, current export
  controls impede the use of strong encryption by U.S. firms with foreign
  customers and suppliers as well as reducing the availability of strong
  encryption domestically. The government needs to make it easier for U.S.
  companies operating internationally to use strong encryption, and for
  U.S. technology vendors to develop and sell cryptography products both in
  this country and abroad.  Indeed, maintaining world leadership for U.S.
  information technology vendors is an important contribution to national
  security, as well as being important to the economy.

       Furthermore, the development of products with encryption should be
  driven largely by market forces rather than by government-imposed
  requirements or standards.  There are no legal limits on the kinds of
  encryption that presently can be sold in the United States and  we
  strongly endorse the idea that no law should bar the manufacture, sale,
  or use of any form of encryption within the United States.

       We do not believe that by adopting such a course the government
  would necessarily be choosing the interests of business and individuals
  over those of national security and law enforcement.  We say this for two
  reasons.  First, availability of encryption technologies will benefit law
  enforcement and national security.  Here's how: by making economic
  espionage more difficult, cryptography supports law enforcement.  By
  protecting elements of the civilian infrastructure such as banking,
  telecommunications, and air traffic control networks, cryptography
  safeguards national security.

       The second reason is that current national policy -- which
  discourages the use of cryptography despite its many valuable
  applications -- can at most delay encryption's spread.  Already, the use
  of such technologies is growing, and in the long run, we believe
  widespread non-governmental use of cryptography in the United States and
  abroad is inevitable.  The government should recognize this changing
  reality and help law enforcement and national security authorities
  develop the new technical capabilities they will need to conduct
  investigations and surveillance in a world in which information will be
  more protected and even unencrypted communications will be harder to
  read.

       Our report also urges that the government should explore escrowed
  encryption rather than the aggressive promotion that is the case today.
  Encrypted information is unintelligible to anyone lacking the keys to
  unlock the digital code.  In escrowed encryption, the decoding key would
  be held by a trusted third-party organization or institution.  This is
  attractive to law enforcement agencies because with a court order, they
  could obtain the key and unlock even the most unbreakable code.  However,
  escrowed encryption is relatively untried and many unresolved issues
  remain, ranging from the liability of these third parties to the
  magnitude of the risk incurred by companies trusting these third parties
  with the keys to their sensitive business plans and trade secrets.

       Rather than aggressively promoting escrowed encryption, our
  committee believes that the government should explore escrowed encryption
  for its own purposes as a way of gaining operational experience with this
  technology and making it more useful to the commercial sector.  Even when
  that occurs, we say that adoption of escrowed encryption or of any other
  specific technology or standard by the commercial sector should be
  voluntary and based on business needs, not government pressure.

            To make it easier for U.S. companies with foreign customers and
  suppliers to protect their information with the best encryption
  technologies, the committee believes that export controls should be
  progressively relaxed, though not eliminated. Right now federal law makes
  it hard to export strong encryption technology.  This helps protect the
  government's ability to gather foreign intelligence.  However, it also
  makes it more difficult for U.S. technology vendors to produce and sell
  cryptography products both here and overseas, and it limits what's
  available here because software companies are reluctant to develop
  different products for U.S. and foreign markets.

       And we call on the executive and legislative branches to develop
  national cryptography policy on the basis of open public discussion.  In
  the past, government officials have treated many aspects of cryptography
  policy as "top secret," to be discussed only behind closed doors.  This
  has led to considerable public distrust and resistance, which makes it
  impossible to achieve consensus.

       In our report we point to a number of specific areas such as
  telecommunications and banking where the government should actively
  promote the adoption of encryption. For example, the privacy of the
  cellular phone and the security of the nation's telecommunications
  networks should be enhanced through the use of cryptography.  In the case
  of the cellular phone many people have at home, the digital signals sent
  between the cell phone and the cell's ground station could be encrypted.
  This would prevent eavesdroppers from listening in on conversations.

       Overall, we believe that adoption of our recommendations would lead
  to enhanced protection and privacy for individuals and businesses in a
  many areas, while also bolstering the international competitiveness of
  U.S. companies.

       My colleagues and I will now entertain questions from the media.
  Before asking a question, please step to an aisle microphone and state
  your name and affiliation.

(1) NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORT CALLS ADMINISTRATION CRYPTO POLICY INTO 
    QUESTION

A blue ribbon panel of experts today released a comprehensive report on the
state of US encryption policy that calls the Administration's current
cryptography policy into question. The 500 page report, sponsored by the
National Research Council (NRC), highlights the need for strong, reliable
encryption to protect individual privacy, provide security for businesses,
and maintain national security.

Among other things, the report describes how the current US encryption
policy is not working, notes that classified information is not relevant to
the policy debate, and outlines the adverse impact export restrictions have
had on the domestic market.  In addition, the study emphasizes that market
forces and user choices, not law enforcement or national security
interests, should drive the development of encryption technologies and the
debate over US cryptography policy.

The report, entitled "Cryptography's Role in Securing the Information
Society", provides an important starting point for an honest and open
debate on this critical issue. A summary of the report's most important
findings and an overview of its policy recommendations is included below.

OVERVIEW OF SOME OF THE REPORT'S MOST IMPORTANT FINDINGS

For the past 3 years, the US government has attempted to leverage the need
for strong encryption and the desire of US businesses to export strong
privacy and security products as a means impose key-escrow encryption. The
result of this has been a policy morass which has stifled innovation,
limited the availability of strong, easy to use encryption technologies,
and endangered the ability of US companies to compete in the global
information marketplace.

While acknowledging the complexities and challenges associated with the
encryption policy debate, the study's findings directly undermine the
Administration's current approach to cryptography policy. The report
concludes by noting that the "[w]idespread commercial and private use of
cryptography in the United States and abroad is inevitable in the long run
and that its advantages, on balance, outweigh its disadvantages.  The
committee concluded that the overall interests of the government and the
nation would best be served by a policy that fosters a judicious transition
toward the broad use of cryptography."

The NRC study identified several critical issues:

* CURRENT US ENCRYPTION POLICY IS NOT WORKING:  The study is highly
  critical of the current ad-hoc approach to US encryption policy,
  particularly the reliance on export controls. The study states
  explicitly, "Current national cryptography policy is not adequate to
  support the information security requirements of an information
  society."

  The study goes on to note, "Indeed, current policy discourages the use
  of cryptography, whether intentionally or not, and in so doing impedes
  the ability of the nation to use cryptographic tools that would help
  to remediate certain important vulnerabilities.  For example, through
  the use of export controls, national policy has explicitly sought to
  limit the use of encryption abroad but has also had the effect of
  reducing the domestic availability to businesses and other users of
  products with strong encryption capabilities."

* CLASSIFIED INFORMATION IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE POLICY DEBATE: The NRC
  report explicitly states that classified information is "not
  particularly relevant" to the policy debate. The study states, "The
  debate over national cryptography policy can be carried out in a
  reasonable manner on an unclassified basis."  The study goes on to
  note, "Although many of the details relevant to policy makers are
  necessarily classified, these details are not central to making policy
  arguments one way or another. Classified material, while important to
  operational matters in specific cases, is neither essential to the big
  picture or why policy has the shape and texture that it does today nor
  required for the general outline of how technology will, and why
  policy should, evolve in the future."

  This is a startling revelation which will profoundly alter the
  encryption policy debate.  No longer can the government claim, "If you
  knew what we knew, you would understand this issue." It also suggests
  that, while national security and law enforcement interests are an
  important element in the debate, there is no "secret-silver-bullet"
  which trumps all other considerations.

  From now on, the debate over cryptography policy should occur in the
  open, with all issues aired publicly.  By removing its arguments from
  the veil of secrecy, the government can go a long way towards building
  the trust of the public.

* EXPORT CONTROLS DO INFLUENCE THE DOMESTIC MARKET AND HARM
  COMPETITIVENESS OF US INDUSTRY: The NRC study confirms what civil 
  liberties advocates and the computer industry have long argued: that
  the current administration policy of limiting the export of strong
  encryption is impacting the domestic market and harming US business.

  The study states, "Export controls also have had the effect of
  reducing the domestic availability of products with strong encryption
  capabilities... Thus, domestic users face a more limited range of
  options for strong encryption than they would in the absence of
  export controls."

* MARKET FORCES, NOT GOVERNMENT INTERESTS, SHOULD DRIVE THE POLICY
  DEBATE: The study stresses that the domestic availability of
  encryption should not be restricted in any way, and that the market of
  individual users, rather than the government's interests, should drive
  the development of technology and policy.

  The study notes, "As cryptography has assumed a greater importance to
  non government interests, national cryptography policy has become
  increasingly disconnected from market reality and the needs of parties
  in the private sector ... A national cryptography policy that is
  aligned with market forces would emphasize the freedom of domestic
  users to determine cryptographic functionality, protections, and
  implementations according to their security needs as they see fit."

The study is without a doubt the most comprehensive and balanced analysis
of the complex encryption policy debate yet published. While stressing
the need for strong encryption to protect individual privacy and to 
maintain the competitiveness of US industry in the global marketplace,
the report also acknowledges the real challenges posed to law
enforcement and national security by the global proliferation of strong
encryption technologies. The authors of the study deserve great credit for
their work in producing what will clearly become the basis for an open and
honest public debate over the need to reform US encryption policy.

OVERVIEW OF THE NRC REPORT'S POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

The report also outlines several recommendations for a national
cryptography policy.  An overview of these recommendations is attached
below. CDT will post an analysis of the NRC's policy recommendations in the
near future.

Recommendations of the Committee for national cryptography policy would:

1. Free domestic manufacture, sale, and use of encryption -- The
   committee argued that any future legal prohibitions on the domestic
   use of any kind of cryptography are "inappropriate." While no such
   prohibitions are currently in effect, many encryption users have been
   concerned over law enforcement's articulated desire to slow the
   domestic use of encryption.

2. Call for open policy-making process -- The report supports the
   development of national cryptography policy based on open public
   discussion. Policy to date has often taken place outside of the
   public eye, and with little guidance from Congress or the general
   public.

3. Align national policy with market and user demand -- The report notes
   that national policy has "become increasingly disconnected from
   market reality and the needs of parties in the private sector."

4. Progressively relax, but not eliminate, export controls -- The
   committee recommends that export controls should be "progressively
   relaxed but not eliminated." This would include:

4.1.  Products that meet "most general commercial requirements" for
      confidentiality should be exportable -- The report suggested that
      56-bit DES products would meet this need and should be exportable
      today, and that this level of security should be increased over
      time. The report noted that DES provides a significantly more
      attractive level of security than 40-bit products currently
      exportable, without imposing too great a burden on national
      security as many sophisticated targets do not use U.S. products
      today.

4.2.  Stronger products should be exportable to a list of approved
      companies if access to decrypted information is provided -- The
      report argues that exports of encryption greater than 56-bit DES
      should be permitted for "trustworthy" users who will guarantee
      access to decrypted information upon a legally authorized request.
      The report does, however, acknowledge the significant privacy and
      security concerns raised by any such "key escrow" plan.

4.3.  The U.S. government should streamline the export licensing process.

5.  Provide assistance for law enforcement -- The report recognizes that
    "cryptography is a two-edged sword" for law enforcement, providing
    both a tool to help prevent crime such as economic espionage, fraud,
    or destruction of the information infrastructure, and a potential
    impediment to law enforcement investigations and signals
    intelligence. Specific suggestions to assist in adjustment to "new
    technical realities of the information age" include:

5.1.  The government should encourage use of encryption for
      authentication and integrity.

5.2.  The government should promote telecommunications security,
      especially for cellular phones and telephone switches.

5.3.  The government should explore escrowed encryption for its own
      uses. The report recommends further use of escrowed encryption for
      government purposes as a testbed for the technical and privacy
      concerns raised by key escrow policies. The report acknowledged
      many of the problems of escrow, and noted that escrow may never be
      adopted freely by the market for real-time communications but that
      such communications will be of less concern to law enforcement
      over time.

5.4.  The government should seriously consider criminalizing "the use of
      encrypted communications in interstate commerce with the intent to
      commit a federal crime." The report acknowledged the risks posed
      by such legislation, including ambiguity about what is an
      encrypted communication, how to deal with automatic or ubiquitous
      encryption, and how to define intent and the need for an
      underlying criminal conviction.

5.5.  Research and development of additional capabilities for law
      enforcement should be given a high priority.

6.  The government should develop a mechanism to promote information
    security in the private sector.

CDT will post an analysis of the report's recommendations soon.  In the
meantime, detailed background information on the encryption policy debate,
including the text of several bills pending before the Congress to
liberalize the export of encryption technology, is available at CDT's

 Title II -- Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act 
  Subtitle D -- Consumer Credit
   Chapter 1 -- Credit Reporting Reform
    Sec. 2422. Federal Reserve Board Study.

      (a) STUDY REQUIRED- The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
          System, in consultation with the other Federal banking agencies 
          (as defined in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act) and
          the Federal Trade Commission, shall conduct a study of whether 
          organizations which, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, 
          are not subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act as consumer 
          reporting agencies (as defined in section 603 of such Act) are 
          engaged in the business of making sensitive consumer identification 
          information, including social security numbers, mothers' maiden 
          names, prior addresses, and dates of birth, available to the general
          public.

      (b) DETERMINATION OF POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD- If the Board of Governors of 
          the Federal Reserve System determines that organizations referred to 
          in subsection (a) are engaged in the business of making sensitive 
          consumer identification information available to the general public, 
          the Board shall determine--

              (1) whether such activities create undue potential for fraud and
                  risk of loss to insured depository institutions (as defined
                  in section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act); and

              (2) if so, whether changes in Federal law are necessary to 
                  address such risks of fraud and loss.

       (c) REPORT TO CONGRESS- Before the end of the 6-month period beginning
           on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Board of Governors of
           the Federal Reserve System shall submit a report to the Congress 
           containing--

              (1) the findings and conclusion of the Board in connection with 
                  the study required under subsections (a) and (b); and

              (2) recommendations for such legislative or administrative
                  action as the Board determines to be appropriate.

<P><CENTER><B>UNITED STATES SENATE<BR>
WASHINGTON, DC  20510</B></CENTER>
<P>October 8, 1996<BR>

<BR>
The Honorable Robert Pitofsky<BR>
Chairman<BR>
Federal Trade Commission<BR>
6th and Pennsylvania Avenue<BR>
Washington, DC  20580<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Chairman Pitofsky:<BR>
<BR>
We are writing to request that the Federal Trade Commission conduct a study
of possible violations of consumer privacy rights by companies that operate
computer data bases.<BR>
<BR>
In recent weeks, a number major new organizations, including USA Today and
the Washington Post, have featured protests by Internet users over the nonconsensual
sale and usage of consumers personal data by companies that operate computer
data bases.  The companies are allegedly obtaining and compiling personal
 background data on individual citizens into electronic transmitted data
bases for sale to private entities or individuals, including attorneys,
banks and credit card companies, without the consent of the targeted individuals.
 the data bases reportedly include social security numbers, drivers licenses
numbers and other identifying information, credit files and medical records.<BR>
<BR>
We have received calls and letters from constituents who are greatly disturbed
about the compilation, sale, and usage of these data bases.  They, as well
as consumers in general, are concerned about the potential intrusion upon,
and violation of individual privacy rights.  There also is concern about
the potential abusive and unlawful usage of the data.  <BR>
<BR>
In light of these concerns, we request the Commission investigate the compilation,
sale and usage of electronically transmitted data bases that include identifiable
personal information of private citizens  without their knowledge.  The
probe should address, but not be limited to, the following questions and
issues:  <BR>
<BR>
(1)   Is the non-consensual compilation, sale, and usage of data- base a
violation of private citizens civil rights?<BR>
<BR>
(2)   Are the data-bases subject to unlawful usage?  Do they create an undue
potential for fraud on consumer?<BR>
<BR>
(3)   Are the compilation, sale and usage of consumers personal data consistent
with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and federal telemarketing regulations?<BR>
<BR>
(4)   Are there ways consumers can prevent data-based service companies
from including their personal background information in commercial data
bases absent their consent?<BR>
<BR>
We believe a study of this matter should begin immediately.  We would like
you to submit a report on  your study within six months of your within six
months of your findings and conclusions for such legislative action as the
Commission deems appropriate.  Please respond as to the Commission's final
declaration regarding this request.<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your assistance<BR>

(1) FTC RECOMMENDS CHANGES TO PROTECT PERSONAL INFORMATION; RECOMMENDATIONS
    FOLLOW NETIZEN COMPLAINTS ABOUT P-TRAK

On Friday, September 20, 1996, the Federal Trade Commission recommended
that Congress take action to protect the privacy of personal information by
amending the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).  The FTC's recommendations --
included in a letter to Sen. Richard Bryan (D-NV) -- come on the heels of
consumer outrage being expressed over the recently-released online database,
P-Trak, offered by the information service Lexis-Nexis.  

P-Trak provides personal information on millions of people across the
country.  For a fee of $85 per search, Lexis-Nexis subscribers can obtain
personal information about an individual that can include name, current and
prior addresses, maiden names, birth month and year, and current telephone
number.  In June, Lexis-Nexis stopped displaying Social Security numbers in
response to complaints from consumers and privacy advocates about the 
availability of that information.  However, P-Trak users can still search the
database by Social Security number.

A primary source for this personal information is credit reports from credit
bureaus, such as Equifax, Experian (formerly TRW), and TransUnion.  The
information is found in the header, or top, of a person's credit report.  
Under the current FCRA, credit bureaus may release and sell the type of 
information contained in the P-Trak database without limitation.  The FTC 
proposes amending the FCRA to prohibit the disclosure of certain personal
information by expanding the definition of "consumer report" to include "any
identifying information other than the consumer's name, generational 
designation, current address and telephone number."   

Currently most people are unaware of the vast amount of information that is 
generated, captured, used and disclosed during daily activities -- from the
membership card scanned in at the grocery store checkout, which neatly
tallies our purchases and spending habits, to departments of motor
vehicles which make a profit selling our personal information for
marketing and other purposes.  As the public learns of the collection and
use of personal information by the private sector -- information that is 
increasingly made available in electronic format -- pressure to address
privacy concerns will grow. 

As Congress moves to adjourn for the session at the end of the week, the 
Senate is currently considering amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act.
CDT believes adoption of the FTC's recommendations would be an important 
first step in acknowledging that individuals have a privacy interest in 
personal information such as social security numbers, prior addresses, and
maiden names.

To preserve privacy in the digital age, CDT believes that the core privacy
principles of notice and individual control over personal information must
inform both the design of the information infrastructure and public policy
decisions.  CDT supports Congressional approval of the FTC's recommendations
in response to the growing public concern over the loss of privacy.

<H2>FTC Response to Sen. Bryan's letter regarding P-Trak</H2>

<PRE>
</PRE>
<CENTER><B>FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION<BR>
Washington, D.C.  20580<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<BR>
September 20, 1996
<P>Senator Richard Bryan<BR>
Ranking Member<BR>
Subcommittee on Financial Institution and<BR>
 Regulatory Relief<BR>
U. S. Senate<BR>
364 Russell Senate Office Building<BR>
Washington, DC 20510-2804<BR>
<BR>
Dear Senator Bryan:<BR>
<BR>
This responds to your September 20, 1996, letter requesting the Commission's
views concerning reports about a database service provider that allows searches
to be performed by entering a consumer's social security number which enables
them to retrieve a name and address.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal Trade Commission has received numerous complaints and Congressional
inquiries concerning recently-introduced, widely-available commercial services
that provide, for a fee, identifying information on individuals.  According
to press reports, at least one tracking service currently furnishes an individual's
name, maiden name, aliases, address, prior address, telephone number and
birth month and year.  To access this information, the service will search
for the data by any elements just listed, or by social security numbers.
 Apparently, social security numbers are no longer displayed, but the search
for all other identifying information can be made on social security number
alone.<BR>
<BR>
The ready availability of this information through the tracking service
may facilitate identity fraud, credit fraud and other illegal activities.
 These concerns may outweigh the limited legitimate uses of this information
for locating individuals.  On August 20 of this year, Commission staff met
with representatives of credit bureaus, creditors, law enforcement agencies,
consumer groups, and a number of additional interested parties.  The staff
learned how, using the kind of information available on this service, fraud
artists could open credit lines in innocent consumers names and run up unpaid
charges, thereby ruining the consumers credit histories.<BR>
<BR>
The interest of the Commission in the potential misuse of this information
stems in part from its responsibilities in enforcing the Fair Credit Reporting
Act,  (&quot;FCRA or ACT&quot;), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1681 et seq  The FCRA,
which was enacted in 1970, is intended, among other things, to promote accurate
consumer reporting and to protect the privacy of consumer report information
compiled by consumer reporting and to protect the privacy of consumer report
information compiled by consumer reporting agencies (also known as credit
bureaus) by restricting access to such information.<BR>
<BR>
Reportedly, this tracking service obtains the consumer information from
a consumer reporting agency that maintains the identifying and other information
in its extensive computer files of data used in the preparing and furnishing
of consumer reports.<A HREF="#one"><SUP>1</SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
Section 603(d) of the FCRA defines a consumer report<A HREF="#two"><SUP>2</SUP></A>, and Section
604 prohibits consumer reporting agencies from furnishing a consumer report
to anyone who does not have a &quot;permissible purpose&quot; to obtain
the report.  If the information provided by the consumer reporting agency
does not meet the definition of a consumer report, however, the FCRA does
not apply and the recipient does not need a permissible purpose to obtain
the information.  No provision of the FCRA specifically prohibits the release
of non-credit related consumer identifying information.<A HREF="#three"><SUP>3</SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the Commission believes that in light of the information it
has recently obtained about credit identity fraud, it may be appropriate
to reexamine the elements of information that consumer reporting agencies
can legally provide to recipients who do not have a statutorily defined
permissible purpose to obtain the information.  Because many otherwise neutral
consumer identifiers are now recognized to be, either individually or in
combination, critical elements in systems of fraud prevention and security,
the Commission believes that these identifiers may warrant the same protections
afforded to other consumer information specified in the FCRA.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, Congress may wish to consider amending the Fair Credit Reporting
Act to provide confidentiality protections to the following elements of
consumer identification: social security number, mother's maiden name, prior
addresses and date of birth.  In order to accomplish this we suggest addition
of the following language as Section 603(k), 15 U.S.C. 1681a(k)<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The term &quot;consumer report&quot; also includes any communication
by a consumer reporting agency of any identifying information other than
the consumers name, generational designation, current address and telephone
number.</BLOCKQUOTE>
Congress may also wish to consider amending Section 602 of the Act, which
sets out the findings and purpose of Congress in enacting the FCRA, as follows:
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>&#167; 602. Findings and purpose</B><BR>
<BR>
(a) the Congress makes the following findings:<BR>
<BLOCKQUOTE>*** <BR>
<BR>
(4) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise
their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, concern for the
confidentiality of consumer information, and a respect for the consumer's
right to privacy.</BLOCKQUOTE>
(b) It is the purpose of this title to require that consumer reporting agencies
adopt reasonable procedures for meeting the needs of commerce for consumer
credit, personal, insurance, and other information in a manner which is
fair and equitable to the consumer, with regard to the confidentiality,
accuracy, relevancy and proper utilization of such information, including
indentifying information, in accordance with the requirements of this title.</BLOCKQUOTE>

If you have any questions or wish to discuss this response further, please
feel free to contact David Medine, Associate Director for Credit Practices,
at (202) 326-3025.<BR>
<BR>
By direction of the Commission.<BR>

To raise the public's awareness of privacy issues in the interactive age, CDT is developing a clearinghouse on privacy policies that contain the policies adopted by various entities operating on the Internet and in other interactive communications media.  Currently the Clearinghouse will allow you to examine <A HREF="online_services/chart.html">the privacy policies of the four major commercial online service providers</A>.  
<P>
In the future, CDT will be providing information on the privacy policies of a range of Internet players.  Eventually you will be able to look for a particular company or web site by name in our Policy Warehouse, or get an overview of policies within specific industries such as commerical online service providers, Internet service providers, Internet web browsers, commercial web sites, political web sites, non-profit web sites, telecommunication services, and financial services.

<BIG><STRONG>Hearing Held on &quot;Children's Privacy&quot; Legislation</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[September 13, 1996]</FONT>
<P>
The increasing use of the Internet by children, combined with the ease of
collecting personal information online, raise serious privacy issues.  Over the past several months, concerns about the availability and use of personal information in the online world, particularly with respect to the collection and use of information about children, have prompted Congress to seriously consider this important issue.
<P>
Legislation designed to restrict the collection and use of personal
information about children without parental consent was introduced
by Rep. Bob Franks (R-NJ) on May 22, 1996.  While the bill (<A HREF="HR3508_text.html">H.R. 3508</A>) is supported by various groups, including Enough is Enough and Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), it has sparked concerns from cyber-rights advocates that it may end up increasing the collection of personal information online and result in restrictions on the free flow of information.
<P>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), People for the American Way (PFAW) Action Fund, Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW), and CDT sent Rep. Franks a letter regarding his legislation on June 4, 1996.  In the letter, the groups expressed concern that the bill, in its current form, raises some of the same privacy and free flow of information concerns raised by the Exon/Coats <A HREF="/cda.html">&quot;Communications Decency Act&quot;</A> to the extent that it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a person visiting a web site is or is not a child without requiring all visitors to identify themselves.
<P>
On September 12, 1996, the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the bill.  CDT sent <A HREF="960911_subcomm_let.html">a letter</A> to subcommittee members reiterating its concerns about the bill.

<H2>Rep. Markey Introduces Online Privacy Legislation</H2>
<FONT SIZE=-1>First Posted on June 24, 1996 || Last Updated on June 24,
1996</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
On June 20, Representative Ed Markey (D-MA) introduced legislation designed
to address concerns over the collection and use of personal information
that is collected online.  The Communications Privacy and Consumer Empowerment
Act (CPCEA) directs the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications
Commission to first examine the ability of user empowerment technologies,
coupled with industry action and standards to provide individuals with these
basic privacy rights.  Where privacy protections do not exist or need to
be buttressed, the bill directs the FCC and FTC to step in and craft rules
to ensure people's privacy is protected online.<BR>
<BR>
At the bill's core are three fundamental privacy rules that will give people
control over the use of personal information:  
<UL>
<LI>People must have <STRONG>Knowledge</STRONG> that information is being
collected;  
<LI>Collectors must give adequate and conspicuous <STRONG>Notice</STRONG>
that they intend to reuse of sell the information; and,  
<LI>Individuals must have the ability to say <STRONG>No</STRONG> to further
use or sale of personal information.  
</UL>
CDT, along with the Center for Media Education, the Consumer Federation
of America, and People for the American Way Action Fund joined Rep. Markey
at a press conference to discuss the bill's introduction.  CDT applauds
Rep. Markey's efforts to put control over personal information back into
the hands of individuals.

<H2><CENTER>America Online's<BR>
Terms of Service Agreement</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>1. Terms of Service Agreement and Rules of the Road.</STRONG> The
America Online service (&quot;AOL&quot;) is provided by America Online Inc.
(&quot;America Online,&quot; &quot;AOL Inc.&quot; or &quot;we&quot;) to
you (&quot;Member&quot; or &quot;you&quot;), subject to the terms of this
Agreement and AOL Inc.s operating policy, which is incorporated herein and
referred to as the &quot;Rules of the Road&quot; or &quot;ROR&quot; and
shall be collectively referred to as &quot;TOS.&quot; (The TOS may be accessed
using KEYWORD TOS.) The TOS comprises the entire agreement between AOL Inc.
and you, and supersedes any prior agreements between you and AOL Inc. with
respect to the subject matter of the TOS; provided, however, that you shall
be subject to any additional terms and conditions which you are notified
of and which may apply when using third party content, software or services.
AOL Inc. may revise the TOS at any time, and such revision shall be effective
thirty (30) days upon posting the revised TOS in the Terms of Service section
of the Member Services Area (KEYWORD TOS), which will include notice of
the date of the last TOS modification (&quot;Notice&quot;). You agree to
review the TOS periodically to be aware of such revisions. If any such revision
is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your membership as provided in
Section 9 below. Your continued use of AOL following notice of any such
revision to the TOS shall be conclusively deemed acceptance of all such
revisions. <A NAME="tos2"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>2. Account Info. </STRONG>YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN
YEARS OLD. By registering as a Member, you will receive a password and a
master account (&quot;Master Account&quot;). You are entirely liable for
all activities conducted through your Master Account and any sub-accounts
or screen-names under your Master Account (&quot;Sub-Accounts&quot;). (A
Member may permit another individual, including a minor, to use the Members
Account or Sub-Accounts subject to Member supervision and with assumption
of all resulting liabilities.) You agree to provide AOL Inc. with accurate,
complete, and updated registration information, and failure to do so shall
constitute a breach of this Agreement and unauthorized access to AOL, and
may result in immediate termination of your account and subject you to civil
and/or criminal liability. You may not select or use a screen name of another
person (unless its also your name), or a name in violation of the intellectual
property rights of any person other than you, or a screen name that AOL
Inc. deems offensive.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>3. Charges.</STRONG> Current rates and surcharges for using AOL
may be obtained by calling AOL Inc.s Customer Service at 800-827-6364 or
by selecting &quot;Billing&quot; under &quot;Member Services&quot; (KEYWORD:
BILLING). AOL Inc.s billing practices are explained under &quot;Explain
Billing Terms.&quot; AOL Inc. reserves the right to change its fees and
billing methods at any time effective thirty (30) days after Notice. If
any such change is unacceptable to you, you may terminate your Membership
as provided in Section 9 below. Your continued use of AOL following any
such change shall be deemed acceptance of such change. Your monthly membership
fee is payable in advance and is not refundable in whole or part. You are
responsible for all charges associated with connecting to AOL. Depending
on your particular location, the nearest access number may or may not be
a local phone call. You should confirm that such access number is a local
call with your phone company. Members accessing AOL from outside the 48
contiguous United States may be assessed communication surcharges on your
AOL bill, which apply even if you are using your trial hours. You are responsible
for all activities and charges under your Master Account and Sub-account(s),
including any unauthorized charges to your account. Each time you use AOL
you agree and reaffirm that AOL Inc. is authorized, as applicable, to charge
your designated card or withdraw funds via electronic funds transfer from
your checking account. You agree that if you want to see the detailed components
of accumulated charges you may do so by using KEYWORD: BILLING. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>4. Rights and Responsibilities. <BR>
<BR>
(a) Content </STRONG>You acknowledge that (i) AOL contains information,
communications, software, photos, video, graphics, music, sounds and other
material and services (collectively, &quot;Content&quot;), and (ii) such
Content is generally provided under license by independent content providers
(&quot;ICPs&quot;) and other AOL subscribers. Each Member and any user of
Members Master Account must evaluate, and bear the risk associated with,
the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any Content. AOL Inc. does not
pre-screen Content as a matter of policy, but AOL Inc. and ICPs shall have
the right, but not the responsibility, to remove Content which is deemed
in their discretion harmful, offensive, or otherwise in violation of the
TOS. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>(b) Rights. </STRONG>You acknowledge that (i) AOL permits access
to Content that is protected by copyrights, trademarks, and other proprietary
(including intellectual property) rights (&quot;Rights&quot;), and (ii)
that these Rights are valid and protected in all media existing now or later
developed and (iii) except as is explicitly provided otherwise, your use
of Content shall be governed by applicable copyright and other intellectual
property laws. (See ROR for details.) You agree that you may upload to the
software files, message boards or otherwise transmit on or through AOL only
Content that is not subject to any Rights, or Content in which any holder
of Rights has given express authorization for distribution on AOL. Unless
specified otherwise in your upload, , by submitting Content to any &quot;Public
Area&quot; (e.g. public chat rooms, message boards, software libraries see
ROR for more details) you automatically grant -- or warrant that the owner
of such Content has expressly granted -- AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual,
irrevocable, non-exclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify,
adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform
and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate
it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed
for the full term of any Rights that may exist in such Content.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>(c) Conduct and Communication. </STRONG>AOL Inc. may elect at its
sole discretion to monitor some, all or none of the Public Areas of AOL
for adherence to the TOS. You agree to use AOL only for lawful purposes.
Any conduct by a Member that in AOL Inc.s sole discretion restricts or inhibits
any other Member, person or entity from using or enjoying AOL or another
service will not be permitted and shall entitle AOL Inc. to immediately
terminate membership without notice. (See the ROR for examples of prohibited
conduct). For AOL Inc.'s policy on Member privacy, refer to Section 7 of
the ROR.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>5. International C&amp;S/Internet. <BR>
<BR>
(a) International Areas. </STRONG>You acknowledge that your use of AOL allows
access to Content originating from subscribers, ICPs and other third parties
located in countries other than the United States (&quot;International C&amp;S&quot;).
Your access to and use of the International C&amp;S will be governed (in
addition to this Agreement) by separate terms and operating policies which
conform to appropriate national laws and customs. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>(b) Internet. </STRONG>AOL offers Members access to the Internet.
The Internet is not owned, operated, managed by, or in any way affiliated
with, AOL Inc. or any of its affiliates. Your use of the Internet is solely
at your own risk and is subject to all applicable local, state, national
and international laws and regulations. AOL Inc. retains the right, but
not the obligation, in its sole discretion and without prior notice or liability,
to restrict or terminate a Members access to the Internet via AOL or to
AOL (See Sections C &amp; D of ROR for details). <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>6. AOL Software.</STRONG> AOL Inc. grants you a non-exclusive, limited
license to use the software through which you access AOL (&quot;AOL Software&quot;)
only for use in connecting to AOL from authorized locations in accordance
with this Agreement.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>7. NO WARRANTY. </STRONG>MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF AOL,
AOL SOFTWARE, AOLS EMAIL SERVICES AND THE INTERNET ARE AT MEMBERS SOLE RISK.
AOL, AOLS EMAIL SERVICES AND AOL SOFTWARE ARE PROVIDED ON AN &quot;AS IS,&quot;
&quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS
OR IMPLIED, UNLESS SUCH WARRANTIES ARE LEGALLY INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION. AOL
INC.s ENTIRE LIABILITY AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO USE OF
AOL AND AOL SOFTWARE SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF ANY DISKETTE FOUND TO BE
DEFECTIVE. AOL INC.s LIABILITY TO YOU FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED
SOLELY TO THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU TO ACCESS AND USE AOL. BECAUSE SOME STATES
DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES AOL INC.s LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO
THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>8. Indemnification. </STRONG>Upon request of AOL Inc., Member agrees
to defend, indemnify and hold harmless AOL Inc., its affiliated companies,
licensees and ICPs from all liabilities, claims and expenses, including
attorneys fees, arising from breach of the TOS by use of, or in connection
with, the transmission by or through Members Master Account or Sub-Accounts
of any Content on AOL. AOL Inc. reserves the right, at its own expense,
to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject
to indemnification by Member hereunder, and in such event, Member shall
have no further obligation to provide indemnification for such matter.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>9. Termination.</STRONG> Either Member or AOL Inc. may terminate
membership at any time. Members only right with respect to any dissatisfaction
with any (i) TOS term, or policy or practice of AOL Inc. in operating AOL,
(ii) Content available through AOL or change therein, or (iii) amount or
type of fees or billing methods, or change therein, is to terminate Membership
by delivering notice to AOL Inc. (KEYWORD: Cancel). Members notice of termination
will be effective upon receipt by AOL Inc. In the event that a Members account
is terminated or canceled, no refund of any fees, including monthly membership
fee, will be granted and any online time credited to Members account(s)
or Sub-Accounts is not convertible to cash or other form of credit.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>10. Law. </STRONG>To the extent of any conflict between this agreement
and the ROR, this agreement shall take precedence. Should any part of the
TOS be held invalid or unenforceable, that portion shall be construed consistent
with applicable law as nearly as possible to reflect the original intentions
of the parties and the remaining portions remain in full force and effect.
The TOS shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, excluding
its conflicts of law rules, and Member and AOL Inc. each submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the Commonwealth of Virginia.<BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>America Online's<BR>
&quot;Rules of the Road&quot;</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>1. General</H3>
<BR>
A. These Rules of the Road (&quot;Rules of the Road&quot; or &quot;ROR&quot;)
set forth how America Online, Inc. will operate the America Online brand
interactive service and how authorized subscribers may use AOL. These ROR
also explain many practical aspects of using AOL. Please read this document
carefully and refer to it as often as necessary. You should also read and
refer to the Terms of Service Agreement (the &quot;TOS). This document,
and the TOS (which were available when you first signed on), are all of
the applicable AOL rules (&quot;AOL Rules&quot;), and, as stated in Section
1 of the TOS, comprise the entire agreement between you and AOL Inc. with
respect to AOL. You can view the TOS or this ROR on AOL at any time without
hourly usage charges in the &quot;Member Services&quot; area. Unless the
context requires otherwise, terms used in the ROR have the meanings given
in the TOS. <BR>
<BR>
B. We believe that our AOL Rules will enhance AOL Inc.s efforts to make
AOL informative, entertaining and, above all, FUN!! for all our Members.
We have tried to explain clearly our AOL Rules, but if any aspect of the
AOL Rules are unclear, we welcome your comments. We hope that our AOL Rules
will foster an online community where there is both free exchange of ideas
and information, and respect for individual and community rights. 
<H3>2. Accessing and Using AOL</H3>
<STRONG>A. Access. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) Equipment. Most Members will access AOL through a standard residential
telephone line, a modem, and a personal computer that you are responsible
for providing. (Please remember that when you are connected to AOL, your
telephone or other communications equipment, e.g., fax, cannot be operated
on the same line at the same time.) There are a variety of personal computers
that are capable of accessing and using AOL. For specific technical questions,
use the keyword &quot;TechLive.&quot; TechLive is currently open from 8
a.m. to 4 a.m. (Eastern time) seven days a week. Access numbers used to
connect to AOL may be owned or operated by independent network service providers
other than AOL Inc. If you are accessing AOL from outside the Continental
United States you may be assessed communications surcharges, the amount
of which is available by accessing keyword &quot;Billing.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
(ii) Telephone Charges. You are responsible for all telephone charges incurred
in connecting to AOL through an available access number. Depending on your
particular location, the nearest access number is usually, but not always,
a local telephone call. To find additional or closer access numbers use
keyword &quot;Access.&quot; If you have any questions about which telephone
number is best or whether an access number is a local call, please check
with your telephone service provider. Any disputes or problems regarding
phone service are strictly between Member and the applicable telephone and/or
long distance service provider. <BR>
<BR>
If you cannot currently find an access number that is a local call, check
the &quot;New Access Number Updates,&quot; which is updated monthly and
available in the Member Services area. (We are continuously expanding the
list of local numbers.) You can also call your long-distance telephone company
to see if a calling plan is available to allow you to call a long-distance
access number for a flat rate, or to purchase blocks of calling time in
advance at a discount. Members who do not have access to a local number
can also use &quot;AOLnet 800 Number Access,&quot; an 800 number operated
by AOL Inc., for a small surcharge rather than pay expensive long distance
phone bills. <BR>
<BR>
(iii) AOL Software. Under Section 6 of TOS, AOL Inc. grants to you a limited
license to use the AOL Software to connect to AOL from authorized locations.
This license is subject to the restriction, that except to the extent expressly
permitted by law, you may not translate, reverse engineer or reverse compile
or decompile, disassemble or make derivative works from AOL Software. You
may not modify AOL Software in any manner or form, or use it in any way
which is not expressly authorized in the AOL Rules, including without limitation
for the purpose of obtaining unauthorized access to AOL (e.g., hacking).
You agree to abide by the U.S. and other applicable export control laws
and not to transfer, by electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content
which is subject to restrictions under such laws to a national or destination
restricted under such laws without first obtaining and then complying with
any requisite government authorization.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Your AOL Account. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) YOU MUST BE AT LEAST EIGHTEEN (18) YEARS OF AGE TO REGISTER FOR AOL
AND OBTAIN A MEMBERS MASTER ACCOUNT; HOWEVER, A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN
MAY AUTHORIZE A MINOR TO USE HIS/HER MASTER ACCOUNT(S) UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION.
In cases where you have authorized another individual, including a minor,
to use your account, you recognize that you are fully responsible for the
online conduct of such user, and for controlling the users access to and
use of AOL, and for the consequences of any misuse, and that the holder
of the Members Master Account(s) is entirely responsible for activities
conducted through those accounts (see Section 4c of the TOS). You acknowledge
that some areas of AOL may contain material that is inappropriate for minors.
AOL offers a &quot;Parental Control&quot; feature that enables the Master
Account holder to restrict access to certain areas and features on AOL,
but makes no warranties with respect to such feature. Please refer to the
Parental Control area in the Member Services area for an explanation of
this feature.<A NAME="ror2bii"></A><BR>
<BR>
(ii) Upon your enrollment as a Member, you will select a unique password.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password
and are liable for any harm resulting from disclosing or allowing disclosure
of any password or from use by any person of your password to gain access
to the Members Master Account(s) or any Sub-Accounts. Therefore, for security
purposes, we recommend that you change your password often. (You can do
this by entering the &quot;Change Your Personal Password&quot; area in the
Member Services area.) At no time should a Member ever respond to an online
request for a password. Employees from AOL Inc. will never ask for a Members
password online. Although AOL offers a feature that allows you to bypass
the password protection, please remember that this feature permits anyone
who has access to your computer to easily access your Master Account and
or Sub-Accounts. Use of this password bypass feature is at Members own risk.
YOU ARE FULLY LIABLE FOR ALL CHARGES UNDER YOUR MASTER ACCOUNT AND/OR SUB-ACCOUNTS,
INCLUDING ANY UNAUTHORIZED CHARGES TO THOSE ACCOUNTS.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Current rates for using AOL may be obtained by calling AOL Inc.s Customer
Service at 800-827-6364 or by selecting &quot;Billing&quot; under &quot;Member
Services.&quot; (Members can also access this area directly by using the
keyword &quot;Billing.&quot;) An explanation of AOL Inc.s billing practices
is provided under the category &quot;Explain Billing Terms.&quot; Such rates
are expressed net of and Member shall pay in addition to them, all sales,
use, value-added, personal property or other governmental tax or levy imposed
on the goods or services billed to his/her Master Account(s), other than
taxes based on net income or profits of AOL Inc. If the payment method for
your Membership is by credit card and payment is not received by AOL Inc.
from the card issuer or its agents, you agree to pay all amounts due upon
demand by AOL Inc. Each time you use AOL you agree and reaffirm that AOL
Inc. is authorized to charge your designated card or withdraw funds via
electronic funds transfer (&quot;EFT&quot;) from your checking account,
if applicable. Your card issuers agreement governs your use of your designated
card in connection with AOL, and you must refer to such agreement and not
this Agreement with respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder.
You agree that AOL Inc. may, at its option, accumulate charges incurred
during your billing cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges
during or at the end of each cycle for EFT from your checking account or
credit card as applicable, meaning that accumulated charges may appear on
the statement you receive from your bank or card issuer. Further, you agree
that AOL Inc. may delay obtaining authorization from your card issuer until
submission of the accumulated charges. You agree that if you want to see
the components of accumulated charges you may do so by using Keyword &quot;Billing.&quot;
If AOL Inc. does not receive the full amount of your AOL account balance
within thirty (30) days of the invoice date, an additional 1.5% (or the
highest amount allowed by law, whichever is lower) per month late charge
will be added to your bill and shall immediately become due and payable.
Member shall also be liable for all attorney and collection fees arising
from AOL Inc.s efforts to collect any unpaid balance of your Master Account(s).
AOL Inc. will provide you with an online statement of charges if requested
by using Keyword &quot;Billing.&quot; Unless you notify AOL Inc. of any
discrepancies within 90 days after they first appear on your account statement,
they will be deemed acceptable by you for all purposes, including resolution
of inquiries made by your card issuer. You release AOL Inc. from all liabilities
and claim of loss resulting from any error or discrepancy that is not reported
to AOL Inc. within 90 days of its publication.<A NAME="ror2biv"></A><BR>
<BR>
(iv) Upon your registration with AOL, you must choose one or more screen
names to identify yourself on AOL. AOL Inc. encourages you to be creative
and have fun with the screen names you choose, but you are also expected
to be reasonable and responsible; vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names
can offend the sensibilities of many Members, and it is only common courtesy
to remember this when you are selecting screen names. You may not select
or use a screen name of another person (unless its also your name), or a
name which violates a trademark right, copyright, or any other proprietary
right, or which AOL Inc. deems in its discretion to be vulgar or otherwise
offensive. If you are unsure about a screen name, send us an email using
the &quot;Write to Community Action Staff&quot; button under keyword &quot;TOS,&quot;
and select the &quot;Names/Profiles Violations&quot; button. Unfortunately,
some Members occasionally select vulgar or otherwise offensive screen names
as a joke, or just a momentary lapse of good judgment. AOL Inc. reserves
the right to delete any such screen name, or to request deletion.<BR>
<BR>
(v) Unless you have written authorization from AOL Inc., you may not register
for additional Master Accounts. Any delinquent or unpaid accounts or accounts
with unresolved issues with the Community Action Department or other AOL
departments must be concluded before you may re-register with AOL Inc. Members
using multiple accounts without express permission from AOL Inc. shall be
terminated.<BR>
<BR>
(vi) Members whose accounts have been terminated by AOL Inc. may not access
AOL in any manner or for any reason without the express written permission
of AOL Inc. Active AOL Members may not knowingly allow former Members who
have been terminated to use their accounts.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. Online Conduct. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(a) Any conduct by you that in AOL Inc.s discretion restricts or inhibits
any other Member from using or enjoying AOL will not be permitted and may
result in termination of Membership. You agree to use AOL only for lawful
purposes. You may not post or use AOL to: <BR>
<BR>
(1) harass, threaten, embarrass or cause distress, unwanted attention or
discomfort upon another Member or user of AOL or other person or entity,
<BR>
(2) post or transmit sexually explicit images or other content which is
deemed by AOL Inc. to be offensive, <BR>
(3) transmit any unlawful, harmful, threatening, abusive, harassing, defamatory,
vulgar, obscene, hateful, racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable
Content,<BR>
(4) cause the screen to &quot;scroll&quot; faster than other Members or
users are able to type to it or any action to a similar disruptive effect,
<BR>
(5) impersonate any person, including but not limited to, an AOL Inc. official
or an information provider, forum leader, guide or host, or communicate
under a false name or a name that you are not entitled or authorized to
use, <BR>
(6) disrupt the normal flow of dialogue in a chat room or otherwise act
in a manner that negatively affects other Members, users, individuals or
entities, <BR>
(7) post or transmit chain letters or pyramid schemes, <BR>
(8) post or transmit any unsolicited advertising, promotional materials,
or other forms of solicitation to other Members, individuals or entities,
except in those areas (e.g., the classified areas) that are designated for
such a purpose,<BR>
(9) violate any operating rule, policy or guideline of any other interactive
service, including but not limited to the operating policies of the International
Areas, or <BR>
(10) intentionally or unintentionally violate any applicable local, state,
national or international law, including but not limited to any regulations
having the force of law. <BR>
<BR>
(i) Offensive Communication. AOL is a community-oriented service composed
of many different communities of people. Our goal is to provide an interesting,
stimulating and fun place for all Members. Using vulgar, abusive or hateful
language undermines this goal and is not allowed. Please use your best judgment
and be respectful of other Members. Remember, there may be children online.
If you use vulgar, or abusive language online, even if masked by symbols
or other characters, you may either receive an &quot;on-screen-warning&quot;
by a Guide or Room Host, or in some cases be terminated immediately. A warning
indicates that your language is not in compliance with the TOS or ROR. Should
you receive such a warning, take the time to read the AOL Rules again, comprising
the TOS and these ROR which you will find posted in the Member Services
area.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Harassment. When a Member targets another individual or entity to cause
distress, embarrassment, unwanted attention, or other discomfort, this is
harassment. AOL Inc. does not condone harassment in any form and may suspend
or terminate the accounts of any Member who harasses others. You may have
a disagreement with someone's point of view -- we encourage lively discussion
in our chat rooms and message boards -- but personal attacks, or attacks
based on a persons race, national origin, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual
orientation, disablement or other such affiliation, are prohibited. If you
have a disagreement with someone's point of view, address the subject, not
the person.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Graphic Files. AOL Inc. prohibits the transfer or posting on AOL of
sexually explicit images or other content deemed offensive by AOL Inc.<BR>
<BR>
(iv) Scrolling. &quot;Scrolling&quot; means repeatedly causing the screen
to roll faster than Members are able to type to it. It is caused by a user
entering a set of random characters or by repeatedly entering a carriage
return or any such action to a similar disruptive effect. Scrolling is an
expressly prohibited form of disruption.<BR>
<BR>
(v) Impersonation. This can involve the portrayal of another person or entity,
such as the impersonation of AOL Inc. staff or an information provider,
authorized Guide or Host, or communication under a false name or a name
that you are not authorized to use. Members must avoid the portrayal of
AOL Inc. personnel or others persons in all forms of online communication,
including, but not limited to, screen names, member profiles, chat dialogue
and message postings.<BR>
<BR>
(vi) Room Disruption. This includes purposefully interfering with the normal
flow of dialogue in a chat room. Room disruption may occur by repeatedly
interrupting conversation between Members, or by acting in such a way as
to antagonize, harass or create hostility in a chat room.<BR>
<BR>
(vii) Chain Letters and Pyramid Schemes. Transmission of chain letters and
pyramid schemes of any kind is not allowed on AOL. This material places
an unnecessary load on our electronic mail (&quot;email&quot;) system and
is considered a nuisance by many Members. Certain chain letters and pyramid
schemes are illegal. Letters or messages that offer a product or service
based on the structure of a chain letter are also of questionable legality.
At minimum, they are a waste of resources and are not permitted on AOL.<BR>
<BR>
(viii) Advertising, Solicitation and Name Harvesting. You may not use AOL
to send unsolicited advertising, promotional material, or other forms of
solicitation to other Members except in those specified areas that are designated
for such a purpose (e.g., the classified area) unless you receive the express
permission of the Member. You may not use AOL to collect or &quot;harvest&quot;
screen names of other Members without the express prior permission of the
Member. AOL Inc. reserves the right to block or filter mass email solicitations
on or through AOL.<BR>
<BR>
If you witness chat in a public chat room that violates the AOL Rules, you
may contact an AOL Service Guide by using the keyword &quot;Guide Pager.&quot;
You may also contact AOL Inc.s Community Action Staff about any violation
by using the &quot;Write to Community Action Staff&quot; icon located in
the TOS area of the Members Services area. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>D. Content. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You recognize that communication over AOL often occurs in real-time, or
is posted on one of AOLs thousands of message boards or libraries, and AOL
Inc. cannot, and does not intend to, screen communication in advance. Moreover,
because AOL Inc. encourages open and candid communication, it cannot determine
in advance the accuracy, or conformance to the AOL Rules, of Content transmitted
on AOL. AOL Inc. is not responsible for screening, policing, editing, or
monitoring such Content. If notified of Content which is alleged not to
conform to the AOL Rules, AOL Inc. may investigate the allegation and determine
in good faith and in its sole discretion whether to remove or request the
removal of such Content from AOL. AOL Inc. shall have no liability or responsibility
to you in respect of its performance or non-performance by AOL Inc. of such
activities, as long as it has acted in good faith.<BR>
<BR>
Please use your best judgment in evaluating all information contained or
opinions expressed on AOL. You should be no less careful in your evaluation
of such information and opinions on AOL as you are in everyday life. It
is AOL Inc.s policy not to endorse, oppose, or edit any opinion expressed
by a Member or information or material provided by an ICP or other independent
party.<BR>
<BR>
All Content is protected by copyright pursuant to U.S., international conventions,
and other copyright laws as a collective work and/or compilation, and AOL
Inc. owns a copyright in the selection, coordination, arrangement and enhancement
of such Content. You may not modify, publish, transmit, participate in the
transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as provided below), create derivative
works from, distribute, perform, display or in any way exploit, any of the
Content, in whole or in part; provided that if no specific restrictions
are applied directly or indirectly in relation to a particular item of Content,
you may make a reasonable number of copies of such item, including copyright
material, provided that the copies are made and used only for your personal
use and that you ensure that any notices contained in the Content such as
all copyright, trademark, and other proprietary rights notices are reproduced
in an unmodified form in all such copies. <BR>
<BR>
You may upload to AOLs software files and message boards or otherwise transmit
on or through AOL only Content that is not subject to any copyright or other
proprietary rights protection (collectively, &quot;Public Domain Content&quot;),
or Content in respect of which the holder of any copyright, trademark or
other proprietary rights (&quot;Rights&quot;) has given express authorization
for distribution on AOL without any restriction whatsoever, and in respect
of which any moral rights of any person or entity have been completely and
irrevocably waived. Any copyright Content submitted with the consent of
a copyright owner other than you should contain a phrase such as &quot;Copyright
owned by [name of the owner]; Used by Permission.&quot; The unauthorized
submission of copyright or Content which is otherwise subject of any third
party Rights constitutes a breach of the AOL Rules and may also render you
liable to the holder of such rights. Remember you, not AOL Inc. or its affiliates
or independent contractors (such as Independent Content Providers or &quot;ICPs&quot;),
are exclusively responsible for any liability resulting from infringement
of Rights arising from such submission or transmission.<BR>
<BR>
By posting shareware or other software to AOLs file libraries, you authorize
AOL to distribute the software through its worldwide network. You may provide
for additional license terms and restrictions in your upload, but AOL shall
have no obligation whatsoever with respect to enforcing such terms and conditions
and reserves the right to remove any software from its network, at its sole
discretion.<BR>
<BR>
By submitting Content to any &quot;Public Area&quot; (Public Area(s) are
those areas of AOL that are generally accessible to other Members, such
as public chat rooms, message boards, and file uploads) you are deemed automatically
to grant -- and/or warrant that the holder of any Rights or Moral Rights
in such Content has completely and effectively waived all such Moral Rights
and expressly, validly and irrevocably granted to you the right to grant
-- AOL Inc. the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive right
(including any moral rights) and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt,
publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform and
display the Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it
in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or hereafter
developed for the full term of any Rights that may exist in such Content.
You also permit any Member to access, view, store and reproduce the Content
for personal use. Subject to the foregoing, the owner of Content placed
on AOL retains any and all rights which may exist in such Content.<BR>
<BR>
The export control laws of the United States and other jurisdictions regulate
the export and re-export of certain technology. This includes the electronic
transmission of certain information and software to particular foreign countries
and foreign nationals. You agree to abide by these laws -- including but
not limited to the United States Export Administration Act, Arms Export
Control Act and their implementing regulations -- and not to transfer, by
electronic transmission or otherwise, any Content derived from AOL which
is governed by or regulated under such laws to a national or a destination
prohibited or restricted under such laws without first obtaining any required
governmental authorization. You further agree not to upload to AOL any data
or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization,
including, but not limited to, certain types of encryption software. This
assurance and commitment shall survive termination of the Agreement. In
addition, because U.S. export control laws currently prohibit nationals
of Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea and Syria from gaining access to certain
Content on AOL, nationals of these countries currently may not legally access
AOL.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>E. Internet Access and Conduct.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
AOL provides you with access to the Internet. Generally, the Internet consists
of the following areas available through AOL: Email, News Groups, Gopher
and WAIS, FTP, and the World Wide Web (See the &quot;Internet Connection&quot;
area on AOL). You are connected to the Internet via the World Wide Web (&quot;Web&quot;)
whenever there appears, on the right hand corner of the screen display,
the spinning AOL triangular logo. The Internet is not owned, or operated
by, or in any way affiliated with, AOL Inc. or any of its affiliates; it
is a separate, independent network of computers and is not part of AOL.
You use of the Internet is solely at your own risk. When using the Internet
and all of its components, Members must conduct themselves responsibly according
to the Internets own particular code of conduct. Participating successfully
on the Internet is really a matter of common sense. Although AOL Inc. does
not control the Internet, your conduct on the Internet when using your AOL
account is subject to the AOL Rules. Because AOL Inc. wants to be a good
Internet citizen, it prohibits Members from engaging in certain conduct
on the Internet through or by means of AOL including the following:<BR>
<BR>
(i) Chain Letters. Chain letters are prohibited on AOL and are inappropriate
on the Internet. Posting a chain letter to an Internet newsgroup (or via
email on the Internet) may result in your AOL account being terminated.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Commercial Communication. The vast majority of newsgroups and mailing
lists on the Internet are not commercial in nature and participants in such
groups may object strongly to commercial postings, solicitations, or advertisements.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Other Inappropriate Posts. Each newsgroup and mailing list on the
Internet focuses on a particular set of topics and posts not related to
these topics are not welcomed by the participants. We suggest that all Members
become familiar with the guidelines, themes, and culture of the specific
newsgroups and mailing list in which they wish to participate. Posting or
distributing patently inappropriate material on the Internet (i.e. spamming
or mail bombing) may result in suspension or termination of your AOL Master
Account and Sub-Accounts.<BR>
<BR>
(iv) Copyright and Proprietary Materials. Transmitting to the Internet copyright
or other material of any kind which is subject to the Rights of any person
or entity without the express permission of the Rights holder is prohibited
and will result in termination of your Membership and possible civil and/or
criminal liability.<BR>
<BR>
(v) Use of Personal Publishing Tools. AOL Inc. provides Members with personal
publishing tools to enable Members to create personal homepages (Keyword:
Personal Publisher) and use of such publishing tools will be subject to
these ROR and TOS. AOL Inc. reserves the right to suspend or terminate at
its discretion Members AOL Master Accounts and Sub-Accounts or to require
the removal of links or other content on or through Members homepages or
personal Internet sites if providing such content or links causes undue
strain on any AOL server either through excessive hits or by excessive bandwidth.
<BR>
<BR>
You understand that except for Content, products or services expressly available
at AOL Inc.s Web site, neither AOL Inc. nor any of its affiliates controls,
provides, operates or is responsible for any Content, goods or services
available on the Internet. All such Content, goods and services are made
accessible on the Internet by independent third parties and are not part
of AOL or controlled by AOL Inc. AOL Inc. neither endorses nor is responsible
for the accuracy or reliability of such Content, goods or services. AOL
Inc. does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, usefulness, quality
or availability of any Content, goods or services available on the Internet,
which are the sole responsibility of such independent third parties, and
your use thereof is solely at your own risk. Neither AOL Inc. nor its affiliates
shall be held responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any loss
or damage caused or alleged to have been caused by your use of or reliance
on any Content, goods or services available on the Internet or a your inability
to access the Internet or any site on the Internet. The foregoing provisions
of this paragraph shall apply with equal force even where AOL features or
displays a link with any particular Web site.<BR>
<BR>
You should be aware that the Internet contains Content, goods and services
that you may find obscene, improper, hurtful or otherwise offensive and
that may not be suitable for certain Members or for minors who are accessing
the Internet through a Sub-Account or Master Account of yours. AOL Inc.
does not have the capability or right to monitor, or review, or restrict
any Content, goods or services made available by third parties on the Internet,
nor to edit or remove any such questionable Content after posting on the
Internet. In addition, you should be aware that the Internet provides access
to users who are not part of AOL and whose conduct and communication may
also be found to be harmful or offensive to Members or which would otherwise
breach the AOL Rules if they were subject to it. Since such users are not
Members of AOL, AOL Inc. does not have the right or capability to restrict
or review their conduct or communication. Accordingly, AOL Inc. and its
affiliates specifically disclaim any responsibility for (and under no circumstances
be liable for) any conduct, Content, goods and services available on or
through the Internet (including without limitation any part of the Web).
Although, AOL Inc. permits parents to restrict access through AOL to certain
material on the Internet (See KEYWORD and hereinafter &quot;PARENTAL CONTROL&quot;),
you acknowledge that Parental Control features are imperfect and you use
Parental Control features at your sole risk. AOL Inc. does not give any
warranty as to the accuracy, completeness or usefulness of any Parental
Control feature or service. <BR>
<BR>
You should be aware that much of the Content available on the Internet is
protected by copyright, trademarks, trade secrets and other Rights of the
independent third parties or their licensors who make such Content available
on the Internet. Members use of such Content will be subject to the specific
restrictions placed on such Content by the owners or licensors of the Rights
in such Content and all applicable laws and regulations.<BR>
<BR>
Your use of the Internet is subject to all applicable local, state, national
and international laws and regulations. Without limiting the other rights
available to AOL Inc. under the AOL Rules, AOL Inc. retains the right, but
not the obligation, in its sole discretion and without prior notice or liability,
to restrict and/or terminate your access to the Internet and AOL if your
use of the Internet violates any such laws or regulations, any prohibitions
upon your conduct in connection with the Internet raised in this Section
E or otherwise restricts or inhibits any other user from enjoying the Internet
or AOL.
<H3>3. Purchasing Products and Services through AOL</H3>
Please remember that AOL Inc. does not endorse, warrant or guarantee any
product or service offered through AOL and will not be a party to or in
any way monitor any transaction between you and third-party providers of
products or services. As with the purchase of a product or service through
any medium or in any environment, you should use your best judgment and
exercise caution where appropriate. Blind opportunity ads and &quot;get
rich quick&quot; schemes should be approached with ample skepticism. AOL
Inc. cannot mediate disputes and cannot assume responsibility for any outcome.
Be careful, be smart, have fun!
<H3>4. Third Party Software and Services</H3>
In addition to content and services provided by Information Providers and
AOL Inc., other third parties may offer additional content, software or
other services to Members. Members may be subject to any additional terms
and conditions relating to the use of such third party content, software
or services and failure to abide by these terms and conditions may result
in termination of Membership. Furthermore, use of other networks, including
areas of the Internet, may be subject to any usage policies of such networks.
<H3>5. Public Communication </H3>
AOL offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally
accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member.
Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members,
such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards.
AOL Inc. will maintain AOL Public Areas as an open forum for discussion
of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc.
will administer standards of online conduct according to the AOL Rules for
the enjoyment of all its Members. While AOL Inc. will endeavor to monitor
the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL
Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in
the role of &quot;Big Brother&quot; by screening public communication in
advance.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content
on AOL which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to any Member, the
communities which comprise AOL, AOL Inc.s and third-parties rights, or to
violate applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc.
nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct,
communication or Content which might violate the AOL Rules prior to transmission
on AOL, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of actually or potentially
violating Content after online posting. Accordingly, you acknowledge that
neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume or have any liability
for any action or inaction by AOL Inc. or any ICP with respect to conduct,
communication or Content on AOL.
<H3>6. Customer Service Communication. </H3>
Please refer to Section 2B(iv) for AOL Inc.s policy on monitoring or disclosing
private communication. In order to ensure quality customer service, AOL
Inc. may monitor Member communication with AOL Inc. customer service employees,
including AOL Sales and Service, Tech Live and Community Action personnel.
<A NAME="ror7"></A>
<H3>7. Privacy Policy</H3>
<STRONG>A. General. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Because protecting your privacy is very important to America Online, we
have adopted the following policies to safeguard your personal information
and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection
and use of personal information or &quot;Individual Information&quot; (as
defined below) to what is necessary to administer our business, provide
you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think
will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information except
in limited circumstances as specifically provided below.<BR>
<BR>
Individual Information means any information, data or records which relate
to your AOL membership or use of AOL and identifies you or your individual
Member account. There are three types of Individual Information: (1) &quot;Member
Identity and Billing Information,&quot; such as your name, street address,
telephone number and billing information, and any screen names associated
with your account; (2) &quot;Navigational and Transactional Information,&quot;
such as information about where you go or what you buy through AOL; and
(3) &quot;Private Communications Content,&quot; such as the contents of
email, or private chat room or instant message communications. <BR>
<BR>
Please be aware that AOL is a private online service which allows access
to the Internet, but is not the Internet. AOL Inc. does not control the
content or services available through the Internet (except for the AOL and
GNN homepages), and providers of Internet sites or services have separate
data and privacy practices which are independent of AOL Inc. Internet areas
may appear to be seamlessly incorporated into AOL; however, currently, you
can tell youre on the Internet whenever there appears a spinning AOL logo,
or when you click on icons labeled as &quot;Newsgroups,&quot; &quot;Web,&quot;
&quot;Link,&quot; &quot;FTP,&quot; &quot;Gopher&quot; or other items relating
to the &quot;Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many of the online areas that you visit on AOL are operated by companies
that are independent from AOL Inc. While AOL Inc. will seek to require these
independent companies (e.g. information providers, advertisers, and merchants)
to adhere to our strong privacy principles, AOL Inc. does not bear responsibility
for their policies or actions. You should be aware that when you voluntarily
disclose personal information (such as your screen name) in public areas
(e.g., the Member Directory, chat rooms, message boards, Internet Newsgroups),
your information can be collected and used by others. (When you visit Internet
sites, your AOL screen name or other Member Identity Information is generally
not identifiable.) Also, ordering products through AOL often requires you
to provide an independent company with limited Individual Information to
enable them to fulfill and ship your order. <BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. actively participates in industry associations and community groups
to support strong and effective privacy guidelines and practices.<A NAME=
"ror7b"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Collection and Storage.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. We maintain the following types
of Member Identity and Billing Information: your name, street address, telephone
numbers, length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep
information on your communications with our Customer Service or Community
Action departments, and general account history, such as accumulated usage
credits, or written complaints relating to your account.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. We may collect and store
certain Navigational and Transactional Information, such as data on the
choices you make among the range of available services or merchandise and
the times and ways you use AOL.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. The AOL computer system does not record
or retain any chat room communications, instant message communications,
or records of with whom you communicate in chat rooms or instant messages.
<BR>
<BR>
The AOL email system retains the contents of private email communications
for a limited period only. Once read, email is permanently deleted from
the system after about five days. Email that is sent, but not read, is permanently
deleted from the system after about thirty days. (Consequently, if you wish
to keep copies of any communications, you should store such communications
on your personal computer hard drive or in print form.)<A NAME="ror7c"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. Use. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. safeguards its Members Individual Information from unauthorized
access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate
business functions are permitted access to Members Individual Information.
Employees who violate AOL Inc.s privacy policies are subject to disciplinary
actions, including termination where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
You acknowledge that private communications directed at a person or entity,
including AOL Inc., may be used or disclosed by the intended recipient(s)
without restrictions relating to privacy or confidentiality.<A NAME="ror7ci"></A><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing. AOL Inc. uses Member Identity and Billing
Information to administer our business, ensure that you are properly billed
and offer you opportunities that may be of interest.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. uses Navigational
and Transactional Information to personalize AOL and for programming and
editorial research. For example, we use Navigational and Transactional Information
to understand our members reactions to menu items, content, services and
merchandise offered through AOL and to customize AOL based on the interests
of our Members.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. treats private communications
on or through AOL as strictly confidential and does not access, use or disclose
the contents of private communications, except in limited circumstances
as specifically provided in Section 7D below. <A NAME="ror7d"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>D. Disclosure.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Because AOL Inc. considers the Individual Information we maintain to be
confidential, our policy is to not disclose Individual Information to third
parties without prior consent (which may be oral or electronic), or unless
specifically provided below. AOL Inc. reserves the right to use agents,
who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and
processing functions. <BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. From time to time, we make
our mailing list available to select companies that offer products and information
we think may be of interest to you. AOL Inc. carefully screens all requests
to use its mailing list to ensure that they are appropriate. AOL does not
release members telephone numbers, credit card numbers or checking account
numbers (or other Individual Information, such as Navigational or Transactional
Information or Private Communications Content). If you do not want your
name released to these companies, simply indicate this on the Member Mailing
Preferences Form. (To access this form, go to Keyword &quot;Member Preferences&quot;
-- then double-click on the heading &quot;Tell Us What Your Preferences
Are&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
It is our policy not to disclose to third parties Member Identity information
that links a Members screen name(s) with a Members actual name, unless required
to do so by law or legal process served on AOL Inc. (e.g., subpoena). AOL
Inc. reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional
circumstances (such as a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected
illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis and at AOL Inc.s sole discretion.
<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. intends to abide by applicable laws governing the disclosure to
governmental entities of Members Individual Information and other records.
When responding to legal process served on AOL Inc. by non-government entities,
unless otherwise ordered, AOL Inc.s current policy is to make reasonable
efforts to notify affected Member(s) in advance of releasing the information
in order to provide Member(s) an opportunity to pursue any available legal
protection.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. will not disclose
to third parties Navigational or Transactional Information (e.g. where you
go or what you buy on or through AOL), except to comply with applicable
law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant or court order). <A NAME=
"ror7diii"></A><BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. does not access or disclose
the contents of private communications (e.g., email, instant messages, member-created
private rooms), unless it in good faith believes that such action is necessary
(a) to comply with applicable law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant
or court order), (b) to protect the rights or property of AOL Inc., or (c)
in emergencies when AOL Inc. believes that physical safety is at risk. AOL
Inc. reserves the right to treat as public, any private chat room whose
directory or room name is published or becomes generally known or available.

<H2><CENTER>CompuServe Online Information Service<BR>
Agreement Terms</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
1. The CompuServe Information Service (the &quot;Service&quot;) consists
of computing and information services and software, information and other
content provided by CompuServe Incorporated (&quot;CompuServe&quot;), as
well as access to services, software, information and other content provided
by third parties (collectively, &quot;Third Party Content&quot;). These
terms and any Operating Rules published over the Service constitute the
entire and only agreement (collectively, the &quot;Service Agreement&quot;)
between CompuServe and member (one who has an account with CompuServe for
the Service), including member's designated users with respect to the Service
and supersede all other communications and agreements with regard to the
subject matter hereof.<BR>
<BR>
2. Upon notice published over the Service, CompuServe may modify this Service
Agreement, (including the Operating Rules) or prices, and may discontinue
or revise any or all other aspects of the Service in its sole discretion
and without prior notice.<BR>
<BR>
3. Unless otherwise agreed, member's right to use the Service or to designate
users is not transferable and is subject to any limits established by CompuServe,
or by member's credit card company if billing is through a credit card.<BR>
<BR>
4. Member agrees to indemnify CompuServe against liability for any and all
use of member's account.<BR>
<BR>
5. Member is responsible for and must provide all telephone and other equipment

6. Member shall pay, in accordance with the provisions of the Billing Option
selected by member, any registration or monthly fees, connect time charges,
minimum charges and other charges<BR>
incurred by member or its designated users at the rates in effect for the
billing period in which those charges are incurred, including but not limited
to charges for any purchases made<BR>
through the Service and any surcharges incurred while using any supplemental
networks or services other than the Service. Member shall pay all applicable
taxes related to use of the Service by<BR>
member or its designated users. Information on connect time charges and
surcharges (if any) that are incurred by a member will be made available
to the member online. Although certain<BR>
areas of the Service may be designated as free of charge, member acknowledges
that CompuServe incurs substantial costs in maintaining these areas. Accordingly,
if in CompuServe's judgment the member's account reflects an excessive number
of hours in such areas, CompuServe reserves the right to charge for such
excess (at normal connect time rates).<BR>
<BR>
Member shall be responsible for all use of the Service accessed through
member's or its designated users' password(s). For example, member may allow
individuals in its household to use the<BR>
Service through member's account. Member acknowledges that member is aware
that areas accessible on or through the Service may contain material that
is unsuitable for minors (persons under 18 years of age). Member agrees
to supervise usage of the Service by minors whom member permits to use the
Service.<BR>
<BR>
7. MEMBER EXPRESSLY AGREES THAT USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT MEMBER'S SOLE RISK.
NEITHER COMPUSERVE NOR ANY OF ITS INFORMATION OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, SERVICE
PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE WILL
BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE; NOR DOES COMPUSERVE OR ANY OF ITS INFORMATION
OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, EMPLOYEES OR AGENTS
MAKE ANY WARRANTY AS TO THE RESULTS TO BE OBTAINED FROM USE OF THE SERVICE.
THE SERVICE IS DISTRIBUTED ON AN &quot;AS IS&quot; BASIS WITHOUT WARRANTIES
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT<BR>

WHICH ARE IMPLIED BY AND INCAPABLE OF EXCLUSION, RESTRICTION, OR MODIFICATION
UNDER THE LAWS APPLICABLE TO THIS SERVICE AGREEMENT. NEITHER COMPUSERVE
NOR ANY OF ITS<BR>
INFORMATION OR CONTENT PROVIDERS, SERVICE PROVIDERS, LICENSORS, EMPLOYEES
OR AGENTS SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF USE OF THE SERVICE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE SERVICE OR OUT OF ANY BREACH OF ANY WARRANTY. MEMBER EXPRESSLY
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT THE<BR>
PROVISION OF THIS PARAGRAPH SHALL ALSO APPLY TO ALL THIRD PARTY CONTENT
AND ANY OTHER CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE. MEMBER AGREES THAT
IT WILL NOT IN ANY WAY HOLD COMPUSERVE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SELECTION OR
RETENTION OF, OR THE ACTS OR<BR>
OMISSIONS OF, THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THOSE
WITH WHOM COMPUSERVE CONTRACTS TO OPERATE VARIOUS AREAS ON THE SERVICE).<BR>
<BR>
8. Except as expressly permitted in the Operating Rules, neither member
nor its designated users may reproduce, redistribute, retransmit, publish
or otherwise transfer, or commercially exploit, any information, software
or other content which they receive through the Service.<BR>
<BR>
9. The provisions of paragraphs 4, 7 and 8 are for the benefit of CompuServe
and its respective contractors, information providers, licensors, employees,

<PRE>Description: About Mailing Lists
Header: About Mailing Lists
Trailer: CIS:FRE-275

In our continuous effort to provide our customers with the best 
possible service, we occasionally utilize our membership list
mailings.  From time to time, special CompuServe mailings may be
sent.  CompuServe also sometimes makes its membership mailing lists
available to other companies who wish to send our members
information about the products or services.

Most members enjoy receiving these mailings, however, you have the
option of including or excluding your name from these various
mailing lists.  Your name will be included on all lists unless you
specify otherwise.  Your choice is not permanent and you can change
it at anytime.  For more information, and to choose to
include/exclude your name, select menu options 2-5 on the previous
menu.

From this area you may also choose to include/exclude yourself from
the Membership directory.  Including your account name and User Id
number in this directory will enable others to communicate with you
through CompuServe Mail.</PRE>

Special CompuServe mailings might include tips and hints for using
a particular service more effectively, a step-by-step tutorial,
announcements of new online services, or maybe even a connect time
credit!  Or one of our Information Providers might send a mailing
about his or her particular service.  In any event, the mailings
would always feature ways to better use CompuServe or a specific

<H2><CENTER>MSN, THE MICROSOFT NETWORK<BR>
MEMBER AGREEMENT</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
The Microsoft Network (&quot;MSN&quot;) is an online service provided by
The Microsoft Network, L.L.C. (&quot;MSP&quot;), through Microsoft Corporation
(&quot;Microsoft&quot;), subject to the terms and conditions of this member
agreement (&quot;Agreement&quot;). This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between you as an authorized user of MSN (&quot;you&quot; or &quot;Member&quot;),
MSP and Microsoft with respect to MSN. By using MSN, you confirm your acceptance
of, and agree to be bound by, this Agreement. <A NAME="gen_info"></A>
<H3>1. Member Information. </H3>
1.1 The name, address and payment information that you provide when you
join MSN, together with information regarding the manner in which you use
MSN, will not be processed or disclosed by MSP except as permitted by this
Agreement. <A NAME="one_two"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.2 By becoming a Member, you agree that MSP may share with other parties
both aggregate information and limited individual information gathered by
MSP in the course of your continuing individual use of MSN. &quot;Aggregate
information&quot; is information that describes the habits, usage patterns
and/or demographics of Members as a group but does not describe or reveal
the identity of any particular Member. &quot;Individual information&quot;
is information about a Member that is presented in a form distinguishable
from information relating to other Members but not in a form that personally
identifies any Member or enables the recipient to communicate directly with
any Member. You also agree that MSP may share and/or use locator information
as provided in Section 1.3. &quot;Locator information&quot; consists of
a Member's name, email address, physical address and/or other data about
the Member that enables the recipient to personally identify the Member.
<A NAME="one_three"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.3 MSP may provide locator information for a Member in the following instances:
first, if the Member orders goods or services on MSN from an independent
content provider (&quot;ICP&quot;), MSP may provide locator information
to the ICP relating to the Member who places the order. Second, although
MSP will not disclose locator information directly to an ICP except in relation
to an order of goods or services, if, based on limited individual information,
an ICP has identified a group of Members to whom it wishes to make a special
offer or communication, MSP may use locator information to forward such
offer or communication via MSN to those Members. Third, MSP may provide
locator information to Microsoft so that Microsoft may notify Members directly
of special offers and communications regarding Microsoft products. <A NAME=
"one_four"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.4 If you do not wish to receive any special offers or communications from
MSP on behalf of ICPs, or directly from Microsoft, check the &quot;opt out&quot;
box that appears during MSN sign-up. If you do not check the &quot;opt out&quot;
box when you sign up as a Member, but wish to do so after you join, you
may access the &quot;opt out&quot; box through an e-form available in the
&quot;Member Assistance&quot; area of MSN. However, a subsequent change
of the &quot;opt out&quot; election will not affect your receipt of offers
and communications from MSP (on behalf of ICPs) or Microsoft that are processed
before you notify MSP that you have changed your &quot;opt out&quot; election.
<A NAME="one_five"></A><BR>
<BR>
1.5 Locator information and individual information will be processed and
stored by MSP in the United States and, if you do not live in the United
States, possibly in your country of residence. You may contact MSP to determine
whether such information has been accurately recorded and, if not, to request
correction of any inaccuracies in the information recorded by MSP.
<H3>2. MSN Usage.</H3>
2.1 You may send and receive electronic mail (&quot;Email&quot;), engage
in conferences and chats, download and upload files and otherwise use MSN
as permitted by this Agreement, MSN's policies and applicable law. Files
that you upload and your activity in conferences and chats are subject to
review, modification and deletion without notice by the forum manager responsible
for the area where your uploading or other activity takes place (or by an
individual designated by the forum manager for such purpose). MSN policies
relating to online conduct, storage and deletion of Email and uploaded files,
conferences, bulletin boards (&quot;BBSs&quot;) and other matters are available
online. MSP reserves the right in its sole discretion to change MSN's policies
at any time. Files uploaded to a BBS may be subject to posted limitations
on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination, and you are responsible for
adhering to such limitations if you download them.<BR>
<BR>
2.2 You are responsible for your communications via MSN. You may not, under
any circumstances, do any of the following: (a) publish, post, distribute
or disseminate defamatory, infringing, obscene or other unlawful material
or information via MSN; (b) use MSN to threaten, harass, stalk, abuse, or
otherwise violate the legal rights (including rights of privacy and publicity)
of others; (c) intercept or attempt to intercept Email; (d) upload files
that contain software or other material protected by intellectual property
laws (or by rights of privacy or publicity) unless you own or control the
rights thereto or have received all necessary consents; (e) upload files
that contain a virus or corrupted data; (f) delete any author attributions,
legal notices or proprietary designations or labels in a file that you upload
to a BBS; (g) falsify the source or origin of software or other material
contained in a file that you upload to a BBS; (h) use MSN in a manner that
adversely affects the availability of its resources to other Members; (i)
send Email to Members for any purpose other than personal communication,
including to advertise or offer to sell goods or services to other Members
(except as otherwise expressly permitted by MSP); (j) download a file that
you know (or reasonably should know) cannot be legally distributed via MSN
(a file may have been uploaded notwithstanding such illegality); or (k)
act, or fail to act, in your use of MSN, in a manner that is contrary to
applicable law or regulation. Your failure to observe any of the foregoing
limitations may result in civil or criminal liability, as well as termination
of your membership.<BR>
<BR>
2.3 You agree to (a) maintain all equipment required for your access to
and use of MSN; (b) maintain the security of your Member identification,
password and other confidential information relating to your MSN account;
and (c) be responsible for all charges resulting from use of your MSN account,
including unauthorized use prior to your notifying MSP of such use and taking
steps to prevent its further occurrence by changing your password. Information
on how to protect the security of your MSN account (including changing your
password) is available online.<BR>
<BR>
2.4 Either you or MSP may terminate your MSN membership at any time, with
or without cause, upon notice. MSP also reserves the right to terminate
or suspend your MSN membership without prior notice, but MSP will confirm
such termination or suspension by subsequent notice.
<H3>3. Operation.</H3>
MSP reserves complete and sole discretion with respect to the operation
of MSN. MSP may, among other things: (a) monitor conferences and chats and
authorize restrictions on access thereto; (b) delete Email if it has not
been accessed by a Member within the time established by MSP's policies;
(c) subject to Section 1, make available to third parties information relating
to MSN and Members; and (d) withdraw, suspend or discontinue any functionality
or feature of MSN. MSP will not distribute uploaded files outside MSN without
the uploading member's consent but may include information about them in
promotional materials and may make such information available to third parties
for promotional purposes and you agree that files that you have uploaded
to MSN may be used in such manner and for such purposes. MSP will not review
or monitor the contents of Email except as required or allowed by applicable
law or legal process. 
<H3>4. Member Representations.</H3>
You represent and warrant that you are at least 18 years of age and that
you possess the legal right and ability to enter into this Agreement and
to use MSN in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to be financially
responsible for your use of MSN (as well as for use of your account by others,
including minors living with you) and to comply with your responsibilities
and obligations as stated in this Agreement.
<H3>5. Content.</H3>
MSP and Microsoft do not endorse or stand behind the accuracy, truthfulness
or reliability of any information (including statements of opinion or advice)
provided on or by means of MSN, other than information provided by authorized
MSP spokespersons. Statements made in forums, conferences and chats reflect
only the views of their authors. Neither forum managers nor ICPs are authorized
MSP spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of MSP
or Microsoft. Advice received via MSN should not be relied upon for important
personal or financial decisions and you should consult an appropriate professional
for specific advice tailored to your situation.
<H3>6. MSN Independent Content Providers.</H3>
Third parties that independently provide content and offer services on MSN
are referred to herein as ICPs. Services provided by an ICP may be subject
to additional charges, terms and conditions as it so determines. You agree
to review any such additional charges, terms and conditions before using
such services and that your use constitutes your acceptance thereof. You
acknowledge that MSP may provide billing and collection services for certain
online transactions, but that MSP is not a party to any transaction involving
you and an ICP. You also agree that MSP and Microsoft are not liable for
any costs or damages arising out of any dispute between you and an ICP with
respect to your use of its service(s) or purchase of its product(s). This
Agreement is for the benefit of ICPs, as well as MSP and Microsoft, and
they have the right to assert and enforce its provisions directly on their
own behalf.
<H3>7. Ownership.</H3>
All programs, services, processes, designs, software, technologies, trademarks,
tradenames, inventions and materials comprising MSN, and all services offered
by ICPs, are wholly owned by MSP or Microsoft and such ICPs, respectively.
MSP has a compilation copyright in MSN but does not possess, claim ownership
of or exert control over individual uploaded files or the intellectual property
contained therein. By uploading a file to a forum, you grant the forum manager
for the forum the right to reproduce and distribute all information, software
and other materials in the file. The forum manager may check uploaded files
for viruses and may remove an uploaded file (in his or her sole discretion)
upon determining that the file is inappropriate for the forum. The forum
manager will notify you if a file that you have uploaded is removed. As
between MSP, ICPs and you, you retain at all times full legal responsibility
for software and other material contained in files which you upload to a
forum.
<H3>8. No Warranties and Limitation of Liability. </H3>
8.1 MSN AND ALL MSN SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED &quot;AS IS,&quot;
AND MSP AND MICROSOFT MAKE NO EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
TO YOU REGARDING THE USABILITY, CONDITION OR OPERATION THEREOF. MSP AND
MICROSOFT MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES REGARDING GOODS OR SERVICES
PROVIDED BY ICPS. MSP AND MICROSOFT DO NOT WARRANT THAT ACCESS TO OR USE
OF MSN WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT MSN OR MSN SOFTWARE
OR SERVICES WILL MEET ANY PARTICULAR CRITERIA OF PERFORMANCE OR QUALITY.
MSP AND MICROSOFT EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, COMPATABILITY, SECURITY OR ACCURACY.<BR>
<BR>
8.2 YOUR USE OF MSN AND ALL MSN SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.
YOU ASSUME FULL RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK OF LOSS RESULTING FROM YOUR DOWNLOADING
AND/OR USE OF FILES OR OTHER MATERIAL (INCLUDING MSN SOFTWARE) OBTAINED
THROUGH MSN. YOU AGREE THAT MSP, MICROSOFT AND PROVIDERS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AND NETWORK SERVICES FOR MSN WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES (INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL
OR SPECIAL DAMAGES) ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE MSN OR
ANY MSN SOFTWARE OR SERVICES, OR THE ACTIONS OR INACTIONS OF ICPS OR THE
GOODS OR SERVICES THEY PROVIDE, AND YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY CLAIMS WITH RESPECT
THERETO, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACTUAL, TORT OR OTHER GROUNDS, EVEN IF MSP
OR MICROSOFT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGES. MSP'S AND MICROSOFT'S
LIABILITY TO YOU FOR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY
PAID BY YOU FOR ACCESS TO AND USE OF MSN, EXCLUSIVE OF PAYMENTS RELATING
TO GOODS AND SERVICES PURCHASED FROM ICPS. YOU HEREBY RELEASE MSP AND MICROSOFT
FROM ANY AND ALL OBLIGATIONS, LIABILITIES AND CLAIMS IN EXCESS OF THIS LIMITATION.
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW IMPLIED WARRANTIES TO BE EXCLUDED OR MODIFIED
OR LIABILITY TO BE LIMITED, SO NOT ALL OF THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY APPLY
TO YOU.
<H3>9. Charges</H3>
9.1 You agree to pay all charges for your use of MSN at the prices then
in effect for your country of residence. All charges will be exclusive of
value added (&quot;VAT&quot;), sales or other taxes. MSP reserves the right
to change prices or institute new charges for access to or use of MSN at
any time upon not less than thirty (30) days' notice to Members. All changes
will be posted online, and you are responsible for reviewing pricing information
posted on MSN regularly to obtain timely notice of such changes. Continued
use of MSN or non-termination of your membership after changes are posted
constitutes your acceptance of the prices as modified by the posted changes.
Your MSN account balance may include charges incurred for your purchase
of goods and services offered by ICPs. The payment terms applicable to such
charges are as stated herein unless you are otherwise notified by MSP or
the ICP from which you purchased such goods or services. You must pay all
taxes due as a result of your use of MSN, including taxes on your purchase
of goods and services from ICPs. VAT, sales and other applicable taxes charged
will be included in the total charges listed on your online statement of
MSN charges, as described in Section 10.1.<BR>
<BR>
9.2 Payment of your MSN account balance is due monthly and, unless you have
a qualified business account, must be made by the credit or debit card designated
by you for MSN use and transactions. If your MSN account is a qualified
business account and is approved by MSP for corporate billing, charges will
be accumulated, identified by Member identification number and invoiced
on a monthly basis. <BR>
<BR>
9.3 Charges are to be paid on a monthly basis in the currency in which billed.
If the payment method for your MSN account is by credit or debit card and
payment is not received by MSP from the card issuer or its agents, you agree
to pay all amounts due upon demand by MSP. Each time you use MSN, you agree
and reaffirm that MSP is authorized to charge your designated card. Your
card issuer's agreement governs your use of your designated card in connection
with MSN, and you must refer to such agreement (not this Agreement) with
respect to your rights and liabilities as a cardholder. You agree that MSP
may (at its option) accumulate charges incurred during your monthly billing
cycle and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the
end of each cycle, and that MSP may delay obtaining authorization from your
card issuer until submission of the accumulated charge(s). This means that
accumulated charges may appear on the statement you receive from your card
issuer. You agree that if you want to see the components of accumulated
charges, you will review your online statement of MSN charges, as described
in Section 10.1. <BR>
<BR>
9.4 Your MSN membership fee is payable in advance and is non- refundable.
You agree that MSP may submit charges for your membership fee each month
without further authorization from you, until you provide prior notice that
you have terminated this authorization or wish to change your designated
card. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before MSP reasonably
could act on your notice.<BR>
<BR>
9.5 You must promptly notify MSP of changes to: (a) the account number or
expiration date of your designated card; (b) your billing address; and (c)
the name of each minor whom you have authorized to use your MSN account.
You must also promptly notify MSP if your card is canceled (e.g., for loss
or theft) or if you become aware of a potential breach of security, such
as the unauthorized disclosure or use of your Member identification or password.<BR>
<BR>
9.6 YOU WILL INCUR CHARGES IN ADDITION TO THE MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE IF
YOUR USAGE OF MSN EXCEEDS THE NUMBER OF HOURS COVERED BY THE MINIMUM CHARGE.
IF YOU ARE USING MSN FROM CERTAIN LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, YOU
MAY ALSO INCUR CHARGES LEVIED BY YOUR LONG DISTANCE CARRIER TO ACCESS MSN.
IF MSP UPGRADES THE SOFTWARE USED FOR MEMBERS' ACCESS TO MSN (OR TO ANY
PARTICULAR FEATURE OF MSN), MSP MAY CAUSE UPGRADED SOFTWARE TO BE DOWNLOADED
AUTOMATICALLY TO YOUR MACHINE, IN WHICH EVENT YOU WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR
ALL RESULTING CONNECT TIME CHARGES IN EXCESS OF THE TIME COVERED BY THE
MINIMUM MONTHLY CHARGE.
<H3>10. Statements and Payment. </H3>
10.1 MSP will provide you with an online statement of charges on your MSN
account approximately as and when such charges are incurred and/or paid.
Unless you notify MSP of any discrepancies or irregularities within seventy-
five (75) days after they first appear in your online account statement,
they will be deemed accepted by you for all purposes, including resolution
of inquiries made by your card issuer. YOU RELEASE MSP AND ALL ICPS FROM
ALL LIABILITY AND CLAIM OF LOSS RESULTING FROM ANY ERROR OR DISCREPANCY
THAT IS NOT REPORTED TO MSP WITHIN SEVENTY-FIVE (75) DAYS OF ITS PUBLICATION
DATE.<BR>
<BR>
10.2 MSP reserves the right to suspend or terminate your MSN membership
without notice upon rejection of any card charges or if your card issuer
(or its agent or affiliate) seeks return of payments previously made to
MSP when MSP believes you are liable for the charge. Such rights are in
addition to and not in lieu of any other legal rights or remedies available
to MSP. You agree to pay a late charge on all amounts due but not timely
paid and which remain unpaid for thirty (30) days after being billed. The
late charge will equal one and one-half percent (1 1/2%) of the past due
amount per month until paid or, if such rate is in excess of the allowable
rate, the maximum rate allowed by law. MSP reserves the right to refer your
MSN account to a third party for collection in the event of ongoing default.
<H3>11. Assignment; Household Use; Minors.</H3>
Your MSN membership is personal. Subject only to this Section 11, you agree
not to assign, transfer or sublicense your rights as a Member. You may allow
other members of your household to use your MSN account, provided that you
hereby agree to pay all charges that they incur and to be responsible for
all other aspects of their usage. You acknowledge that you are aware that
some areas of MSN may contain material that is unsuitable for minors, and
you agree to supervise usage by minors whom you permit to use your MSN account.
<H3>12. Indemnification.</H3>
You agree to indemnify MSP and Microsoft from and against any and all liabilities,
expenses (including attorneys' fees) and damages arising out of claims based
upon use of your MSN account, including any claim of libel, defamation,
violation of rights of privacy or publicity, loss of service by other Members
and infringement of intellectual property or other rights. MSP will notify
you promptly of any claim for which MSP or Microsoft seeks indemnification
and will afford you the opportunity to participate in the defense of such
claim, provided that your participation will not be conducted in a manner
prejudicial to MSP's or Microsoft's interests, as reasonably determined
by MSP or Microsoft.
<H3>13. Notices; Consent.</H3>
Notices given by MSP to you will be given by Email via MSN, or by a general
posting on MSN, or by conventional mail. In any matter requiring MSP's prior
consent, such consent will be considered given only if made by in the foregoing
manner by an authorized representative of MSP. Notices given by you to MSP
must be given by Email via MSN and addressed as set forth in MSN's &quot;Member

<H3>Introduction</H3>
Thanks for joining us. We're pleased that you're part of our worldwide online
community. <BR>
<BR>
MSN The Microsoft Network, enables you to communicate with thousands of
other members around the world. You'll find a wide range of topics to talk
about, subjects to share, and new experiences. Our goal is to create an
atmosphere that encourages intelligent interaction and lively debate. Following
these guidelines will help MSN members have a positive online experience.
<H3>MSN Forums</H3>
Our forums consist of bulletin boards, chat rooms and conferences, and file
libraries. Forums are the place to share your views and interests with large
groups of members. There is a wide array of subjects available, reflecting
members' diverse interests. We encourage the exchange of viewpoints and
information, which is vital to making MSN lively and interesting.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Forum Manager<BR>
</STRONG>The activities in each forum are guided by a forum manager. The
forum manager sets the tone for the forum and might establish guidelines
that are unique to a particular forum. The forum manager might also schedule
conferences, manage the file library, and organize and respond to bulletin
board messages. From time to time, the forum manager will check files and
messages to ensure that they are in keeping with the forum topic and MSN
policies. Forum managers also respond to inquiries from members interested
in the forum.<BR>
Note: If you want to apply to MSN to become a forum manager or provide other
services to members, look in the InfoCenter of the category you are interested
in for the name of the person to contact.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Bulletin Boards (BBS) and File Libraries</STRONG><BR>
Bulletin board messages are public notices that the entire online community
can view. They are the platform for ideas and opinions, discussion and debate,
with information for everyone to share. Bulletin board messages are displayed
for a period of time set by the forum manager.<BR>
<BR>
Some MSN bulletin boards serve as large libraries of files that you can
download. These files are available as attachments to bulletin board messages.
Certain files might be offered to members as shareware. In some areas, there
is a charge for downloading a file. Please be sure to check whether there
are separate charges associated with a particular file. Look up File Libraries
in the MSN Help Index to learn how to view, read about, and download files.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Chat Rooms</STRONG><BR>
Forum chat rooms offer participation in live, real-time conversations related
to the forum topic. A forum might have several chat rooms active at one
time. Chat is not moderated, but either a forum manager or an experienced
member will move in and out of chat rooms to keep the conversations on topic
and free of disruptions.<BR>
<BR>
MSN forums feature special scheduled chat events open to all members. These
special events are arranged and moderated by a host, usually the forum manager.
Special chat events let MSN members meet prominent figures from public life,
the arts, sciences, popular culture, and, of course, computing.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A Note About Adult Content</STRONG><BR>
Certain areas of MSN offer content for members who are at least 18 years
of age. Such content might appear in forums and will also be available over
adult Usenet newsgroups. Usenet is a public network that is not part of
MSN. It consists of several thousand online groups that discuss and debate
topics with varying degrees of focus.<BR>
<BR>
When you first join MSN, you will not have access to adult content. To request
access to adult content that is part of MSN or from Usenet newsgroups:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) Double-click the service you would like to open.<BR>
2) Follow the directions and complete the e-form requesting access.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>E-mail</H3>
Electronic mail (or e-mail) permits direct communication between MSN members
and: 
<UL>
<LI>MSN merchants and advertisers. 
<LI>Members of other online services over the Internet. 
<LI>People connected to the Internet. 
</UL>
E-mail is sent to the addressee and does not appear publicly. MSN will make
every effort to keep members' e-mail private while it is under MSN control;
sending e-mail over the Internet involves networks that are not part of
MSN and might not be as secure.<BR>
<BR>
MSN will not intercept, attempt to intercept, open or attempt to open e-mail
without authorization from the sender or recipient. On rare occasions, MSN
might be required by legal process to disclose the contents of e-mail in
connection with an investigation of alleged illegal activity. <BR>
<BR>
New, unread e-mail is retained online for 45 days. Usually when you read
your MSN e-mail, it is moved from The Microsoft Network to your computer,
where it remains as long as you retain it. However, you can choose instead
to preview your e-mail. In this case, you transfer a copy of your e-mail
to your computer and leave the original on MSN, where it remains for 15
days. The length of time e-mail remains on MSN is subject to change as network
conditions require.<BR>
<BR>
For a detailed description of e-mail reading options, look up E-mail messages
in the MSN Help Index.
<H3>Transferring Files</H3>
The MSN Member Agreement contains full and specific information about permitted
file transfer activity. In brief, you may not: 
<UL>
<LI>Transfer files that contain software or other material protected by
intellectual property laws (or by privacy or publicity rights) over MSN,
unless you own or control the rights to do so or have received all necessary
consents; 
<LI>Transfer files that you know contain a virus or corrupted data over
MSN; 
<LI>Delete any author attribution, copyright notice, or proprietary designation
or label from a file you transfer over MSN; 
<LI>Falsify the source or origin of software in any file you transfer over
MSN; or 
<LI>Transfer a file that you know or have reason to believe cannot be legally
offered by the party distributing it over MSN. 
</UL>
Before downloading a file, look closely at its description to determine
whether it is what you want. Be sure to check every file you download for
viruses or corrupted data before you open the file, regardless of the source.
Neither the forum manager nor MSN is responsible for any difference between
what you download and what you expected to get, or for the results of downloading
any file.<BR>
<BR>
Please let the forum manager know if you believe there is a problem with
files you download. A forum manager can remove files whose content, origin,
or ownership violates the terms of the Member Agreement, or that are not
in the appropriate forum.
<H3>Solicitation and Advertising</H3>
MSN provides a variety of forums where members can share information that
is relevant to their businesses, careers, or avocations. However, you may
not use MSN for solicitation or advertising.<BR>
<BR>
To protect members from receiving unwanted &quot;clutter&quot; on MSN, you
may not use forums or e-mail to advertise, solicit, promote the purchase
of goods or services, or to operate or engage in surveys, contests, chain
letters or commercial enterprises, without the express permission of MSN.
This does not include the sale of personal items, which may be allowed in
designated areas.<BR>
<BR>
If you are aware of such content, please tell us by contacting the forum
manager or Member Support.<BR>
<H3>Courtesy</H3>
MSN is committed to the value of free expression. We encourage lively discussion
and spirited debate. Our membership is international and diverse, so you
will be communicating with people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and
biases.<BR>
<BR>
To create a community that is enjoyable for all members, please treat others
with courtesy and respect when online and when communicating by e-mail.
Be aware that you'll encounter a wide range of opinions and ideas.<BR>
<BR>
Keep it clean -- avoid language that is vulgar or obscene, even if masked
by symbols or other characters. Any material that is grossly offensive to
the online community, including obscene or pornographic material, will not
be tolerated.<BR>
<BR>
Remember that other members see only the words you type. They cannot hear
your tone of voice or see your expression; your words alone represent you.
While spelling need not be precise, typing in all capital letters is considered
shouting online, and should be used sparingly or avoided altogether.<BR>
<BR>
Don't disrupt other members' enjoyment of a forum. Members who repeatedly
interrupt conversations, or deliberately antagonize or harass others, will
be asked to leave.<BR>
<BR>
Post messages to the appropriate forums, and try to avoid unnecessary or
repetitive posts. To understand the topic and purpose of discussions and
forum activities, spend a little time following discussions before you participate.
Contact the forum manager if you have questions; the forum manager's name
appears in the About... information in the forum.<A NAME="identity"></A>
<H3>Responsibility and Liability</H3>
Respect the privacy of others. Don't make statements that are false or hurtful
to others, including persons who are not online. <BR>
<BR>
Your member ID is the &quot;screen name&quot; that identifies you online.
Other members will see your ID when you post BBS messages or chat with them
online. You can choose your ID based on your real name, or a nickname, or
you can make something up. Once you make your choice during MSN sign-up,
your ID stays the same unless it is modified. If you would like to modify
your ID, please contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that when you choose your ID and provide information about
yourself, you may not impersonate or represent yourself as any other person
or entity. Of course, you may not represent yourself as an employee or representative
of MSN under any circumstances. Do not choose an ID which is designed to
be an advertisement of a product or service. Also, in the unlikely event
that you have selected an ID that is already in use, or is reserved for
use by an MSN content provider or advertiser (because it is a product brand
or trade name), you will be asked to choose a different screen name.<BR>
<BR>
Be careful when asked to provide personal or confidential information while
online. Do not give information about your credit card (including account
number or expiration date) in response to e-mail requests that you receive
from people you do not know. Such requests may be fraudulent. This type
of information will only be requested by MSN staff or a content provider
by means of an encrypted eform. If you see any suspicious communications
by anyone who appears to be deceiving members into believing that they are
authorized by MSN or a content provider to receive such information, please
contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Please remember that you can be held legally liable for what you say on
any forum or in e-mail. For example, you can be held accountable for defamatory
comments, threats, and statements that are illegal or fraudulent. MSN is
available in many countries worldwide. Laws vary throughout the world. Remarks
and behavior that are protected in one country might not be protected in
another. MSN might refer certain comments -- for example, threats of harm
to people or property -- to law enforcement authorities. This applies even
to comments that are made in jest.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Advice and Opinion</STRONG><BR>
One advantage of joining an online community is the ability to share information
informally with others. If you have expert knowledge or more online experience,
feel free to offer answers and help to other MSN members. However, when
you receive online advice, keep in mind that its quality and accuracy can
vary widely. This can be particularly true for opinions about law, investments,
and health.<BR>
<BR>
Carefully evaluate advice you receive from any unknown or unfamiliar source.
Check sources, background, and motivation. Find out if the information is
provided by an individual who has a business or financial interest in a
related product or service. When in doubt, consult a qualified professional.<BR>
<BR>
MSN is not responsible for the accuracy or truthfulness of advice or information
provided online and is not responsible for the consequences of acting on
such information.
<H3>Compliance</H3>
Our guidelines are based on common sense and courtesy. If you have questions
about them, please contact our forum managers or Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Members who fail to respect our general guidelines or the particular guidelines
for any individual forum, might receive returned bulletin board messages,
one or more warnings, temporary suspension from a forum, permanent exclusion
from a forum, and/or termination of their MSN membership.<BR>
<BR>
A serious breach or a pattern of disruptive behavior might result in immediate
suspension from a forum or termination of your membership.<BR>
<BR>
MSN reserves the right to remove any material from the service at any time
and for any reason. 
<H3>Membership Terms</H3>
The MSN Member Agreement, which you accepted when you joined, contains full
and specific information about the terms and conditions of your membership.
To review these terms:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) Click the Start menu, point to Find, and then click Files
or Folders. <BR>
2) In the Named box, type legalagr.rtf.<BR>
3) Double-click the file once it has been found.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time, we might modify the Member Agreement. Click Member Assistance
in MSN Central to find out about updates and changes, and to get important
notices about your MSN membership.
<H3>MSN and Children</H3>
MSN welcomes parents and children. Online services offer unique educational
opportunities plus the chance to meet new and interesting people. But please
keep in mind that an online service cannot offer the degree of control over
content and interaction that parents provide. <BR>
<BR>
We encourage parents to remain closely involved in their children's activities
online. Although you must be at least 18 to join MSN, parents might wish
to allow their children to use the service with supervision. In the online
world, children will meet people and make friends on bulletin boards and
by e-mail. As a parent, please exercise the same judgment and control over
online meetings as you would in the real world where your son or daughter
comes in contact with strangers. Be aware of people your child meets or
writes to, and of whatever offline contacts might result from online communication.<BR>
<BR>
Before you allow your child to use the service alone, become familiar with
what we offer. There is much to see, but there might be areas you want your
child to avoid. Also, there might be areas that carry charges not included
in your monthly membership or trial plan. Please be aware of how your child
uses the service; ultimately, you are responsible for all the time you and
your child spend online.<BR>
<BR>
Our favorite places feature is an excellent way to create an inventory of
places you'd like your child to visit. For information, see Help.
<H3>Stay in Touch</H3>
We always welcome your feedback and input. By letting us know what you think,
you can help make MSN more dynamic, fun, and enjoyable to use.

<H2><CENTER>Prodigy Service Agreement</CENTER>
</H2>
<H3>1. Introduction </H3>
Prodigy Services Company (&quot;Prodigy&quot;) is the operator of the PRODIGY
service (&quot;Service&quot;). The Service is an interactive information,
communication and transaction service, used by connecting your receiving
and transmitting equipment (normally a personal computer with a modem connected
to your telephone line) to Prodigy's network of telecommunications and computer
facilities. By completing enrollment and accepting all of the terms of this
Agreement, you become an authorized user of the Service (a &quot;Member&quot;).
Continued acceptance of this Agreement is a condition of Membership. If
you do not wish to be bound by this Agreement, please do not enroll. Prodigy
may change this Agreement at any time. Changes are effective upon notice
to Members (see Section 8 regarding Notices). To read the current Agreement
on the Service at any time, Jump: member agreement.<BR>
<BR>
Each Service Membership can include up to six separate Members. The Member
whose Service ID ends in &quot;A&quot; is the Membership Holder, and may
authorize up to five other people to be Members under the Membership Holder's
account. The Membership Holder has special responsibilities in addition
to the responsibilities of being a Member. Both types of responsibilities
are described in Sections 2 and 3. Members must be individuals, and not
(except with Prodigy's written consent) firms, businesses or institutions.
Prodigy may at any time, without notice or liability, change or eliminate
any Service content, or restrict the use of any portion of the Service,
including limiting the time of its availability, the amount of use permitted,
or the Members who are permitted to use it. Any changes or restrictions
may be applied to all or to individual Members in a Membership, and may
be applied regardless of whether a multiple month Membership has been purchased
or an advance payment of the monthly Service fee has been made. Each Membership
includes periodic issues of various Member newsletters. 
<H3>2. Responsibilities of All Members. </H3>
You are responsible for complying with all terms and conditions of this
Agreement, and with all policies and guidelines posted on the Service. You
are personally responsible for all use of the Service under your ID (including
payment for orders placed) even if you allow someone else to use your ID.
Illegal, fraudulent or abusive use of any ID on the Service is grounds for
termination of Membership, and may be referred to law enforcement authorities.
Enrolling or using any ID on the Service under a name other than your own
is prohibited, except where the Service permits &quot;nicknames&quot;. You
must keep all information that you store on the Service up to date, including
your address, any credit, debit or charge card numbers and expiration dates,
and any Service payment information. You must promptly inform Prodigy if
you suspect any breach of security, such as loss, theft, or unauthorized
disclosure or use of your ID, password or any credit, debit or charge card
number stored on the Service. Until Prodigy is notified of a breach of security
(by notice given as described in Section 8, or by telephone at 1-800-PRODIGY
(1-800-776-3449)) you will remain responsible for any unauthorized use of
the Service occurring under your ID. (Liability for use of credit, debit
or charge cards is subject to your agreement with the card issuer.)<BR>
<BR>
You may use the ordering functions of the Service only to place valid orders
for merchandise, services or other items for which such ordering functions
are intended. The Service is provided for your personal use only. Unless
you have Prodigy's express written consent, you may not resell it, in whole
or part, or otherwise commercially exploit it, or assign or transfer your
Membership to anyone else.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Responsibility of Membership Holders. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You have overall responsibility for your Membership, which includes the
proper use of the Service by all Members of your Membership. You are also
responsible for all fees and charges incurred by the Membership (see Section
3), and for payment for all orders placed by any minor Member in your Membership.
A minor may not be a Membership Holder. Prodigy may terminate, without notice,
any Membership where the Membership Holder is a minor, or, in Prodigy's
sole discretion, may permit an adult to become the Membership Holder under
procedures established by Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
Access to certain portions of Service content by other members of the Membership
may be controlled by and is the responsibility of the Membership Holder.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>PRODIGY Software License. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
PRODIGY software provided to you, and each revised version thereof, is licensed
to you by Prodigy only for use in connecting to the Service from within
the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and Canada
and you may use or copy it only as instructed by Prodigy. Use or copying
for any other purpose is prohibited and is a breach of this Agreement. The
PRODIGY software PM files remain Prodigy's property at all times, and Prodigy
may make changes to the number and/or content of these files directly while
you are connected to the Service. (The PRODIGY software does not affect
or involve any other files in your computer without your authorization.)
You accept the terms of this license by using the PRODIGY software. This
license will terminate upon termination of the Membership for which it was
issued. At that time, the Membership Holder must return the PRODIGY software
to Prodigy or destroy it. Prodigy is not responsible in any way for any
nonProdigy computer programs or devices intended for use in connection with
the Service and/or the PRODIGY software even if such programs or devices
are advertised and/or made available on the Service. 
<H3>3. Fees and Payment</H3>
Membership Holder is responsible for paying all fees and charges (plus applicable
taxes) associated with use of the Service under all of the IDs of the Membership,
including those incurred for extra fee features or options. Prodigy reserves
the right to change the amount of, or basis for determining, any fee or
charge, and to institute new fees or charges. Increases in existing fees
and charges for Service access or use shall become effective no earlier
than 30 days after notice to the Membership Holder given as provided in
Section 8. <BR>
<BR>
All fees or charges that are additional to the monthly Service fee (including
fees or charges for using certain features, functions or modem speeds, or
for using certain features above usage levels established from time to time
by Prodigy) apply, and may be imposed or changed, regardless of whether
a multiple month Membership has been purchased or an advance payment of
the monthly Service fee has been made. All fees and charges are payable
in accordance with billing terms in effect at the time the fee or charge
becomes payable. Prodigy may require payment of any or all fees and charges
to be made by a valid, approved major credit, debit or charge card. Current
fees and charges are posted on the Service. Unless otherwise stated, all
amounts are in U.S. Dollars. Jump: fees. <BR>
<BR>
Upon request to Prodigy, Membership Holders may receive information that
supports charges for use of the Service by themselves or their authorized
Members. For online statement information, Jump: statement.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Ordering Merchandise, Services and Information. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You may order, and are responsible for paying for, many types of merchandise,
services and information from merchants and advertisers (&quot;Merchants&quot;)
through the Service. Merchants are independently owned and operated businesses.
All orders are subject to acceptance by the Merchant. (See Section 7 regarding
information about Members provided to Merchants with orders.) Prodigy will
make reasonable efforts to help ensure your satisfaction in your dealings
with all Merchants, and specifically stands behind your satisfaction with
merchandise purchased through the Service, as set forth in the Prodigy Pledge.
For details, Jump: prodigy pledge. However, since Prodigy is not a party
to these transactions, the purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery,
maintenance and all other matters concerning merchandise, services or information
ordered from Merchants are solely between you and the Merchant. 
<H3>4. Termination of Membership </H3>
Either the Membership Holder or Prodigy may terminate the Membership at
any time and without cause. The only right with respect to dissatisfaction
with any policies, guidelines or practices of Prodigy in operating the Service,
any change in Service content, or any change in the amount or type of fees
and charges associated with the Service, is for the Membership Holder to
terminate the Membership by notice to Prodigy. See Section 8 regarding notices.
Prodigy may terminate the Membership, or suspend any individual Member's
access to all or any part of the Service, without notice, for conduct that
Prodigy believes is a violation of this Agreement or any policies or guidelines
posted by Prodigy on the Service, or for other conduct that Prodigy believes
harmful to other Members, to Merchants or Information Providers, or to the
Service or the business interests of Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
Upon termination of a Membership by either the Membership Holder or Prodigy,
Prodigy will refund any unused portion of prepaid fees or charges (excluding
fees and charges for extra fee features that are stated to be nonrefundable
at the time they are accepted), after satisfying any outstanding balances
owed Prodigy. Termination of service to the Membership Holder automatically
terminates service to all other Members in the Membership. Upon termination
or suspension of service to a Member, that Member's banking, brokerage and
other thirdparty relationships will no longer be accessible through the
Service. Prodigy will have no responsibility for notifying thirdparty service
providers, or for any consequences of such lack of access. (As a courtesy
only, Prodigy may provide relevant information, such as name, ID, address,
and telephone number to such third party service providers.)<BR>
<BR>
Termination or suspension by Prodigy of service to a Member also constitutes
termination or suspension (as applicable) of that Member's license to use
the PRODIGY software. 
<H3>5. Use of the Service</H3>
You are responsible for providing all equipment, devices and software (other
than the PRODIGY software) necessary to receive the Service. Prodigy will
provide telephone numbers to connect to the Service, which for most Members
will include a local number. You are responsible for selecting the best
number for you, and for all telephone fees and charges associated with the
use of the telephone number you select. If you have any question about which
telephone number is best for you, check with your local phone company. The
Service will be available during the hours stated on the Service. Jump:
service hours. Use of the Service, and of specific telephone numbers, is
subject to interruptions at Prodigy's discretion or beyond Prodigy's control.
Unauthorized access to the Service, to restricted portions of the Service,
or to the telecommunications or computer facilities used to deliver the
Service, is breach of this Agreement and a violation of law. Membership
Holders may suspend Service use by other Members in the Membership through
the means provided on the Service. Jump: member access. Prodigy gives the
Membership Holder the ability to limit access of Members in the Membership
to certain content available through the Service, including access to content
on the Internet over which Prodigy exercises no control. The responsibility
for controlling Member access to and use of these content areas is solely
that of the Membership Holder. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>IDs and Passwords.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Use of the Service requires both an ID and a password. Each new Member receives
a unique ID and a temporary password, and must choose a new password upon
enrollment. Your ID is your address on the Service, and you and Prodigy
may disclose it to others. Your password is the key that unlocks access
to your personal information on the Service. Anyone knowing both your ID
and password can gain access to your personal information and misuse it,
so KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECRET; use a password that is hard to guess (for
example, do not use your first or last name); and change your password frequently.
REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD! If you forget your password, Prodigy may disclose
it to you under security procedures determined by Prodigy, but reserves
the right to charge for doing so. For more information on passwords, Jump:
password security. To change your password, Jump: change password. You may
not use another Member's ID without the specific consent of that Member.
Unauthorized use of another Member's ID, or improper solicitation of another
Member's password, are grounds for termination of your Membership, and may
be a violation of law. For your convenience, Prodigy provides an option
that allows you to connect to the Service automatically, without manually
entering your ID and password each time. Software available from third parties
may also offer this function. If you choose to use any automatic connection
function, you must understand that anyone who has access to your computer
can also gain access to and abuse your Service account. For example, anyone
having access to the software or computer containing your automatic connection
information could abuse any credit, debit or charge card information associated
with your ID.

<STRONG>General</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
PRODIGY DOES NOT ENDORSE, ASSERT OR STAND BEHIND THE TRUTHFULNESS OR RELIABILITY
OF OPINIONS, ADVICE OR STATEMENTS GIVEN OR MADE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED
PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS IN ANY MANNER ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN PUBLIC POSTINGS AREAS OF THE SERVICE. EXPERTS, INFORMATION
PROVIDERS AND &quot;MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES&quot; ON THE SERVICE ARE NOT
AUTHORIZED PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS. <BR>
<BR>
Opinions, advice and all other information expressed by Service information
providers under contract with Prodigy (&quot;Information Providers&quot;)
represent their own views and not necessarily those of Prodigy, and should
not be relied on for important personal decisions. For individual situations,
specific professional advice should be sought. The Service lets you share
information with other Members as well as with users of the Internet who
are not Members. You agree not to use the Service to send, or submit for
public posting, any abusive, obscene, profane, sexually explicit, threatening,
or illegal material, or material containing blatant expressions of bigotry,
racism or hate. Prodigy reserves the right (but is not obligated) to review
and edit any material submitted for display or placed on the Service, excluding
private electronic messages. Prodigy may refuse to display or may remove
from the Service any material that Prodigy believes violates this Agreement
or any policies or guidelines posted by Prodigy on the Service, or is harmful
to other Members, to Merchants or Information Providers, or to the Service
or the business interests of Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
You agree not to engage in advertising to, or solicitation of, other Members
or users of the Internet through the Service to buy or sell any products
or services (other than in areas specifically designated for such purposes
by Prodigy) without Prodigy's prior written consent. You are responsible
for material sent through or displayed on the Service under your ID, even
if a claim should arise after termination of the Membership.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Messaging. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Prodigy will comply in all respects with the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986, as amended, relating to private electronic messages sent or
received through the Service. Prodigy will not inspect the contents of private
electronic messages, or disclose their contents to anyone other than the
writer or an intended recipient, without the consent of either the writer
or an intended recipient, except as permitted or required by law. Prodigy
reserves the right to delete private electronic messages from your Message
Center after a period of time established by Prodigy. Prodigy will have
no responsibility for retaining or delivering private electronic messages
that are located in a Member's Message Center at the time of that Member's
suspension or termination, or that are addressed to such Member thereafter.
Prodigy may permit Merchants to send messages to Members for commercial
purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Public Postings Areas.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Public postings area of the Service is any area where Members may submit
material (&quot;Submissions&quot;) for viewing by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, and view Submissions by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, such as Service bulletin boards or chat rooms,
and similar Internet facilities, even if such area is not available to all
Members. A Submission includes the name, ID, chat nickname and/or other
information that would be displayed with the submitted material, as applicable.
You agree to use public postings areas only in accordance with this Agreement
and any policies and/or guidelines for the area that are displayed on the
Service. <BR>
<BR>
You may not submit copyrighted material to public postings areas without
the specific authority of the copyright owner; doing so is a breach of this
Agreement and may subject you to legal liability. <BR>
<BR>
BY SUBMITTING MATERIAL TO A PUBLIC POSTINGS AREA, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY
PRODIGY, AND ITS INFORMATION PROVIDERS, THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS,
AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM ALL CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LIBEL AND SLANDER,
ARISING FROM THE SUBMISSION. Remember: You are responsible (and could be
held liable to others) for all submissions from your ID. Neither Prodigy
nor its Information Providers is responsible or shall have any liability
for material displayed in a public postings area unless posted by its authorized
spokesperson. Experts, Information Providers and &quot;Member Representatives&quot;
are not authorized Prodigy spokespersons. By submitting material to a public
postings area you are irrevocably granting Prodigy permission to do anything
Prodigy may choose with all parts of the Submission, as if it were in the
public domain, including modifying it or using it commercially and authorizing
others to do so. You are also irrevocably granting everyone else (including
nonMembers) permission to reproduce and/or redistribute all or parts of
your Submission in any form for noncommercial purposes. In addition, anyone
is free to use information contained in a Submission for any purpose, at
their own risk.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may establish time limits and/or other criteria under which Submissions
will be automatically removed from public display. Prodigy has the right,
but is not obligated, to maintain archives of Submissions, regardless of
whether they were actually posted on the Service, and Prodigy may use or
disclose archived Submissions in any manner it deems appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Copyright. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Except for public domain material, all material contained in the Service
is copyrighted. You may not reproduce, or redistribute such material, in
whole or in part, in any manner, without the prior consent of the copyright
owner, unless specifically permitted by this Agreement or on the Service.
You may make single copies of copyrighted materials displayed on the Service
if they are solely for your own personal use, and if you preserve any copyright
or other notices contained in or associated with them. You may not distribute
such copies to others, whether or not for a charge or other consideration,
without written permission from Prodigy. Requests for permission to reproduce
portions of the Service for other purposes should be mailed to Prodigy Services

<H3>7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members</H3>
One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability to
personalize editorial and commercial content and offerings to your interests.
Personalization is based on information that you (or the Membership Holder)
provide to Prodigy and information derived during your use of the Service
and during installation of the PRODIGY software on your equipment used to
receive the Service. You may review or update certain personal information
you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools feature on the Service.

be accurate, and Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy
may use or disclose aggregated (not personally identifiable) information
regarding Members for any purpose. Prodigy will not use or disclose information
specifically about you (or your Membership) except as permitted by this
Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Jump: privacy policy.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer, communications
equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY software).
Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiable basis
only to: (i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate
on your equipment; (ii) monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY
software on your equipment; or (iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings
that may become available for your equipment. When you place an order on
the Service, Prodigy may provide your name, address, telephone number, and
other relevant information to the Merchant, including whether you are a
minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannot and will not be
responsible for how Merchants use this information. 
<H3>8. Notices</H3>
Prodigy may give notices to Members by electronic messages through the Service
using the Message Center feature, by a general posting on the Service, or
by conventional mail. Any notice given to the Membership Holder will constitute

<H2><CENTER>Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Company
is committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,
by maintaining the very highest privacy standards.<BR>
<BR>
Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*
[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is
associated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both information
supplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and information
we collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact that
a Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through the
service). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total number
of Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Member
has made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY service
as a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal files
on their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standards
which meet these expectations.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policy
on Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodying
our privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamental
to our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provide
Prodigy's products and services.<BR>
<BR>
These purposes are: <BR>
<BR>
- to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, and
service providers on the PRODIGY service;<BR>
- to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, including
making members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial
offerings that may be of interest;<BR>
- to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings;<BR>
- to serve members when they have questions or problems;<BR>
- to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting;<BR>
- to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;
and<BR>
- as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy's
legal department in each case.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID ends
in &quot;A&quot;) information regarding service usage by other Membership
ID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the Membership
Holder is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect the
privacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access to
personal information are required to follow specific practices concerning
its proper handling.<BR>
<BR>
3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list for
use by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communications
to members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through the
PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,
advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'
private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private while
they are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or disclose
to others the contents of these private messages except with the specific
consent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy's
legal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federal
law.<BR>
<BR>
5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.
Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derived
from private files without the member's authorization.<BR>
<BR>
Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and uphold
this Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><A NAME="opt_out"></A>
<H3><CENTER>Opt Out of Commercial Promotional Mail</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Prodigy's online advertisers often send mail about specials, one-of-a-kind
sales and limited-time promotions they don't want you to miss. <BR>
<BR>
We hope you find this information useful. But it's your mailbox, and your
choice. If you prefer, select Take Me Off the List to stop receiving this
type of mail. You'll still get information about Prodigy features, pricing
changes and your account, but all advertiser mail will be suppressed. Or,
choose Keep Me On the List to continue receiving special offers and Prodigy
news in your mailbox. <BR>

<BR>
7. Privacy Policy</H3>
<STRONG>A. General. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Because protecting your privacy is very important to America Online, we
have adopted the following policies to safeguard your personal information
and are committed to protecting its confidentiality. We will limit the collection
and use of personal information or &quot;Individual Information&quot; (as
defined below) to what is necessary to administer our business, provide
you with the highest quality service, and offer you opportunities we think
will be of interest. We will NOT disclose any Individual Information except
in limited circumstances as specifically provided below.<BR>
<BR>
Individual Information means any information, data or records which relate
to your AOL membership or use of AOL and identifies you or your individual
Member account. There are three types of Individual Information: (1) &quot;Member
Identity and Billing Information,&quot; such as your name, street address,
telephone number and billing information, and any screen names associated
with your account; (2) &quot;Navigational and Transactional Information,&quot;
such as information about where you go or what you buy through AOL; and
(3) &quot;Private Communications Content,&quot; such as the contents of
email, or private chat room or instant message communications. <BR>
<BR>
Please be aware that AOL is a private online service which allows access
to the Internet, but is not the Internet. AOL Inc. does not control the
content or services available through the Internet (except for the AOL and
GNN homepages), and providers of Internet sites or services have separate
data and privacy practices which are independent of AOL Inc. Internet areas
may appear to be seamlessly incorporated into AOL; however, currently, you
can tell youre on the Internet whenever there appears a spinning AOL logo,
or when you click on icons labeled as &quot;Newsgroups,&quot; &quot;Web,&quot;
&quot;Link,&quot; &quot;FTP,&quot; &quot;Gopher&quot; or other items relating
to the &quot;Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Many of the online areas that you visit on AOL are operated by companies
that are independent from AOL Inc. While AOL Inc. will seek to require these
independent companies (e.g. information providers, advertisers, and merchants)
to adhere to our strong privacy principles, AOL Inc. does not bear responsibility
for their policies or actions. You should be aware that when you voluntarily
disclose personal information (such as your screen name) in public areas
(e.g., the Member Directory, chat rooms, message boards, Internet Newsgroups),
your information can be collected and used by others. (When you visit Internet
sites, your AOL screen name or other Member Identity Information is generally
not identifiable.) Also, ordering products through AOL often requires you
to provide an independent company with limited Individual Information to
enable them to fulfill and ship your order. <BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. actively participates in industry associations and community groups
to support strong and effective privacy guidelines and practices.<A NAME=
"ror7b"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Collection and Storage.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. We maintain the following types
of Member Identity and Billing Information: your name, street address, telephone
numbers, length of membership, and payment information. We may also keep
information on your communications with our Customer Service or Community
Action departments, and general account history, such as accumulated usage
credits, or written complaints relating to your account.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. We may collect and store
certain Navigational and Transactional Information, such as data on the
choices you make among the range of available services or merchandise and
the times and ways you use AOL.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. The AOL computer system does not record
or retain any chat room communications, instant message communications,
or records of with whom you communicate in chat rooms or instant messages.
<BR>
<BR>
The AOL email system retains the contents of private email communications
for a limited period only. Once read, email is permanently deleted from
the system after about five days. Email that is sent, but not read, is permanently
deleted from the system after about thirty days. (Consequently, if you wish
to keep copies of any communications, you should store such communications
on your personal computer hard drive or in print form.)<A NAME="ror7c"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. Use. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. safeguards its Members Individual Information from unauthorized
access and only authorized employees or agents who need to carry out legitimate
business functions are permitted access to Members Individual Information.
Employees who violate AOL Inc.s privacy policies are subject to disciplinary
actions, including termination where appropriate.<BR>
<BR>
You acknowledge that private communications directed at a person or entity,
including AOL Inc., may be used or disclosed by the intended recipient(s)
without restrictions relating to privacy or confidentiality.<A NAME="ror7ci"></A><BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing. AOL Inc. uses Member Identity and Billing
Information to administer our business, ensure that you are properly billed
and offer you opportunities that may be of interest.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. uses Navigational
and Transactional Information to personalize AOL and for programming and
editorial research. For example, we use Navigational and Transactional Information
to understand our members reactions to menu items, content, services and
merchandise offered through AOL and to customize AOL based on the interests
of our Members.<BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. treats private communications
on or through AOL as strictly confidential and does not access, use or disclose
the contents of private communications, except in limited circumstances
as specifically provided in Section 7D below. <A NAME="ror7d"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>D. Disclosure.</STRONG> <BR>
<BR>
Because AOL Inc. considers the Individual Information we maintain to be
confidential, our policy is to not disclose Individual Information to third
parties without prior consent (which may be oral or electronic), or unless
specifically provided below. AOL Inc. reserves the right to use agents,
who are bound by strict confidentiality guidelines, to perform storage and
processing functions. <BR>
<BR>
(i) Member Identity and Billing Information. From time to time, we make
our mailing list available to select companies that offer products and information
we think may be of interest to you. AOL Inc. carefully screens all requests
to use its mailing list to ensure that they are appropriate. AOL does not
release members telephone numbers, credit card numbers or checking account
numbers (or other Individual Information, such as Navigational or Transactional
Information or Private Communications Content). If you do not want your
name released to these companies, simply indicate this on the Member Mailing
Preferences Form. (To access this form, go to Keyword &quot;Member Preferences&quot;
-- then double-click on the heading &quot;Tell Us What Your Preferences
Are&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
It is our policy not to disclose to third parties Member Identity information
that links a Members screen name(s) with a Members actual name, unless required
to do so by law or legal process served on AOL Inc. (e.g., subpoena). AOL
Inc. reserves the right to make exceptions to this policy in exceptional
circumstances (such as a bomb or suicide threat, or instances of suspected
illegal activity) on a case-by-case basis and at AOL Inc.s sole discretion.
<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. intends to abide by applicable laws governing the disclosure to
governmental entities of Members Individual Information and other records.
When responding to legal process served on AOL Inc. by non-government entities,
unless otherwise ordered, AOL Inc.s current policy is to make reasonable
efforts to notify affected Member(s) in advance of releasing the information
in order to provide Member(s) an opportunity to pursue any available legal
protection.<BR>
<BR>
(ii) Navigational and Transactional Information. AOL Inc. will not disclose
to third parties Navigational or Transactional Information (e.g. where you
go or what you buy on or through AOL), except to comply with applicable
law or valid legal process (e.g., search warrant or court order). <A NAME=
"ror7diii"></A><BR>
<BR>
(iii) Private Communications Content. AOL Inc. does not access or disclose
the contents of private communications (e.g., email, instant messages, member-created
private rooms), unless it in good faith believes that such action is necessary

<H3>From the Prodigy Service Agreement:</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability to
personalize editorial and commercial content and offerings to your interests.
Personalization is based on information that you (or the Membership Holder)
provide to Prodigy and information derived during your use of the Service
and during installation of the PRODIGY software on your equipment used to
receive the Service. You may review or update certain personal information
you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools feature on the Service.
Jump: tools.<BR>
<BR>
You may be requested to supplement or update your personal information from
time to time. All personal information that you provide on the Service must
be accurate, and Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy
may use or disclose aggregated (not personally identifiable) information
regarding Members for any purpose. Prodigy will not use or disclose information
specifically about you (or your Membership) except as permitted by this
Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Jump: privacy policy. <BR>
<BR>
From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer, communications
equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY software).
Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiable basis
only to: (i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate
on your equipment; (ii) monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY
software on your equipment; or (iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings
that may become available for your equipment. When you place an order on
the Service, Prodigy may provide your name, address, telephone number, and
other relevant information to the Merchant, including whether you are a
minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannot and will not be
responsible for how Merchants use this information. <BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H3>From Prodigy's Frequently Asked Questions:</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>Q.</STRONG> What does Prodigy do with the personal information it
asks for at enrollment?<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Your personal information is treated in accordance with
strict privacy guidelines which are part of Prodigy's business conduct guidelines.
Your information is treated as highly confidential and access to it is strictly
controlled. Prodigy uses this information only for purposes necessary to
provide our products and service and to perform billing, collection and
accounting operations. Individually identifiable information is never sold
or bartered. For details, Jump: privacy policy.<A NAME="priv_policy"></A><BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy<BR>
(&quot;Privacy Policy&quot;)</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Company
is committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,
by maintaining the very highest privacy standards.<BR>
<BR>
Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*
[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is
associated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both information
supplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and information
we collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact that
a Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through the
service). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total number
of Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Member
has made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY service
as a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal files
on their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standards
which meet these expectations.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policy
on Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodying
our privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamental
to our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provide
Prodigy's products and services.<BR>
<BR>
These purposes are: <BR>
<BR>
- to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, and
service providers on the PRODIGY service;<BR>
- to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, including
making members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial
offerings that may be of interest;<BR>
- to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings;<BR>
- to serve members when they have questions or problems;<BR>
- to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting;<BR>
- to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;
and<BR>
- as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy's
legal department in each case.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID ends
in &quot;A&quot;) information regarding service usage by other Membership
ID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the Membership
Holder is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect the
privacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access to
personal information are required to follow specific practices concerning
its proper handling.<BR>
<BR>
3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list for
use by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communications
to members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through the
PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,
advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'
private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private while
they are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or disclose
to others the contents of these private messages except with the specific
consent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy's
legal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federal
law.<BR>
<BR>
5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.
Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derived
from private files without the member's authorization.<BR>
<BR>
Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and uphold
this Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it.<A NAME="opt_out"></A><BR>
<BR>
<HR>
<H2><CENTER>Opt Out of Commercial Promotional Mail</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
Prodigy's online advertisers often send mail about specials, one-of-a-kind
sales and limited-time promotions they don't want you to miss. <BR>
<BR>
We hope you find this information useful. But it's your mailbox, and your
choice. If you prefer, select Take Me Off the List to stop receiving this
type of mail. You'll still get information about Prodigy features, pricing
changes and your account, but all advertiser mail will be suppressed. Or,
choose Keep Me On the List to continue receiving special offers and Prodigy
news in your mailbox. <BR>
<BR>
To return here anytime, Jump: opt out. <BR>

</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<H3>From AOL's Rules of the Road:<BR>
<BR>
5. Public Communication </H3>
AOL offers Members the capability to communicate in Public Areas generally
accessible to other Members or to communicate privately with another Member.
Public Areas are those features that are generally accessible to other Members,
such as, but not limited to, chat rooms, online forums, and message boards.
AOL Inc. will maintain AOL Public Areas as an open forum for discussion
of a wide range of issues and expression of diverse viewpoints. AOL Inc.
will administer standards of online conduct according to the AOL Rules for
the enjoyment of all its Members. While AOL Inc. will endeavor to monitor
the Public Areas to ensure that online standards are being maintained, AOL
Inc. has neither the practical capability, nor does it intend, to act in
the role of &quot;Big Brother&quot; by screening public communication in
advance.<BR>
<BR>
AOL Inc. reserves the right to prohibit conduct, communication, or Content
on AOL which it deems in its discretion to be harmful to any Member, the
communities which comprise AOL, AOL Inc.s and third-parties rights, or to
violate applicable law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither AOL Inc.
nor its Information Providers have the practical ability to restrict conduct,
communication or Content which might violate the AOL Rules prior to transmission
on AOL, nor can they ensure prompt editing or removal of actually or potentially
violating Content after online posting. Accordingly, you acknowledge that
neither AOL Inc. nor any Information Provider shall assume or have any liability
for any action or inaction by AOL Inc. or any ICP with respect to conduct,
communication or Content on AOL.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>From AOL's Terms of Service:</H3>
<H3>4. Third Party Software and Services</H3>
<BR>
In addition to content and services provided by Information Providers and
AOL Inc., other third parties may offer additional content, software or
other services to Members. Members may be subject to any additional terms
and conditions relating to the use of such third party content, software
or services and failure to abide by these terms and conditions may result
in termination of Membership. Furthermore, use of other networks, including
areas of the Internet, may be subject to any usage policies of such networks.

<H3>From the MSN Member Agreement:<BR>
<BR>
3. Operation.</H3>
MSP reserves complete and sole discretion with respect to the operation
of MSN. MSP may, among other things: (a) monitor conferences and chats and
authorize restrictions on access thereto; (b) delete Email if it has not
been accessed by a Member within the time established by MSP's policies;
(c) subject to Section 1, make available to third parties information relating
to MSN and Members; and (d) withdraw, suspend or discontinue any functionality
or feature of MSN. MSP will not distribute uploaded files outside MSN without
the uploading member's consent but may include information about them in
promotional materials and may make such information available to third parties
for promotional purposes and you agree that files that you have uploaded
to MSN may be used in such manner and for such purposes. MSP will not review
or monitor the contents of Email except as required or allowed by applicable
law or legal process. <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<H3>From the MSN Member Guidelines:</H3>
<H3>MSN Forums</H3>
Our forums consist of bulletin boards, chat rooms and conferences, and file
libraries. Forums are the place to share your views and interests with large
groups of members. There is a wide array of subjects available, reflecting
members' diverse interests. We encourage the exchange of viewpoints and
information, which is vital to making MSN lively and interesting.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Forum Manager<BR>
</STRONG>The activities in each forum are guided by a forum manager. The
forum manager sets the tone for the forum and might establish guidelines
that are unique to a particular forum. The forum manager might also schedule
conferences, manage the file library, and organize and respond to bulletin
board messages. From time to time, the forum manager will check files and
messages to ensure that they are in keeping with the forum topic and MSN
policies. Forum managers also respond to inquiries from members interested
in the forum.<BR>
Note: If you want to apply to MSN to become a forum manager or provide other
services to members, look in the InfoCenter of the category you are interested
in for the name of the person to contact.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Bulletin Boards (BBS) and File Libraries</STRONG><BR>
Bulletin board messages are public notices that the entire online community
can view. They are the platform for ideas and opinions, discussion and debate,
with information for everyone to share. Bulletin board messages are displayed
for a period of time set by the forum manager.<BR>
<BR>
Some MSN bulletin boards serve as large libraries of files that you can
download. These files are available as attachments to bulletin board messages.
Certain files might be offered to members as shareware. In some areas, there
is a charge for downloading a file. Please be sure to check whether there
are separate charges associated with a particular file. Look up File Libraries
in the MSN Help Index to learn how to view, read about, and download files.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Chat Rooms</STRONG><BR>
Forum chat rooms offer participation in live, real-time conversations related
to the forum topic. A forum might have several chat rooms active at one
time. Chat is not moderated, but either a forum manager or an experienced
member will move in and out of chat rooms to keep the conversations on topic
and free of disruptions.<BR>
<BR>
MSN forums feature special scheduled chat events open to all members. These
special events are arranged and moderated by a host, usually the forum manager.
Special chat events let MSN members meet prominent figures from public life,
the arts, sciences, popular culture, and, of course, computing.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A Note About Adult Content</STRONG><BR>
Certain areas of MSN offer content for members who are at least 18 years
of age. Such content might appear in forums and will also be available over
adult Usenet newsgroups. Usenet is a public network that is not part of
MSN. It consists of several thousand online groups that discuss and debate
topics with varying degrees of focus.<BR>
<BR>
When you first join MSN, you will not have access to adult content. To request
access to adult content that is part of MSN or from Usenet newsgroups:
<BLOCKQUOTE>1) Double-click the service you would like to open.<BR>
2) Follow the directions and complete the e-form requesting access.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<H3>From Prodigy's Frequently Asked Questions:</H3>
<BR>
<STRONG>Q.</STRONG> Why doesn't PRODIGY do something about notes on the
public bulletin boards that clearly violate the guidelines?<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A.</STRONG> Due to the high volume of posted notes on a daily basis
(in excess of 70,000), PRODIGY cannot possibly read each and every note.
We rely upon electronic scanners to scan all notes for offensive and inappropriate
language and return those that violate our guidelines. We also rely upon
our members to alert us to problem notes on the boards or areas where members
are being otherwise disruptive to the bulletin board community.<BR>
<BR>
To alert us to problem situations on the board, select the Guidelines &amp;
Info button off the main menu of the board where the problem exists. Then
write to us with the details (date, time, BB, topic/subject, IDs) of the
problem note by selecting the Problem Note Alert mailbox option. We process
and review notes sent to this mailbox regularly throughout the day, and
we take down any notes that violate the BB guidelines.<BR>

<H3><A NAME="six"></A>From Prodigy's Service Agreement:<BR>
6. Information on the Service</H3>
<STRONG>General</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
PRODIGY DOES NOT ENDORSE, ASSERT OR STAND BEHIND THE TRUTHFULNESS OR RELIABILITY
OF OPINIONS, ADVICE OR STATEMENTS GIVEN OR MADE BY ANYONE OTHER THAN AUTHORIZED
PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS IN ANY MANNER ON OR THROUGH THE SERVICE, INCLUDING,
WITHOUT LIMITATION, IN PUBLIC POSTINGS AREAS OF THE SERVICE. EXPERTS, INFORMATION
PROVIDERS AND &quot;MEMBER REPRESENTATIVES&quot; ON THE SERVICE ARE NOT
AUTHORIZED PRODIGY SPOKESPERSONS. <BR>
<BR>
Opinions, advice and all other information expressed by Service information
providers under contract with Prodigy (&quot;Information Providers&quot;)
represent their own views and not necessarily those of Prodigy, and should
not be relied on for important personal decisions. For individual situations,
specific professional advice should be sought. The Service lets you share
information with other Members as well as with users of the Internet who
are not Members. You agree not to use the Service to send, or submit for
public posting, any abusive, obscene, profane, sexually explicit, threatening,
or illegal material, or material containing blatant expressions of bigotry,
racism or hate. Prodigy reserves the right (but is not obligated) to review
and edit any material submitted for display or placed on the Service, excluding
private electronic messages. Prodigy may refuse to display or may remove
from the Service any material that Prodigy believes violates this Agreement
or any policies or guidelines posted by Prodigy on the Service, or is harmful
to other Members, to Merchants or Information Providers, or to the Service
or the business interests of Prodigy.<BR>
<BR>
You agree not to engage in advertising to, or solicitation of, other Members
or users of the Internet through the Service to buy or sell any products
or services (other than in areas specifically designated for such purposes
by Prodigy) without Prodigy's prior written consent. You are responsible
for material sent through or displayed on the Service under your ID, even
if a claim should arise after termination of the Membership.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Messaging. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Prodigy will comply in all respects with the Electronic Communications Privacy
Act of 1986, as amended, relating to private electronic messages sent or
received through the Service. Prodigy will not inspect the contents of private
electronic messages, or disclose their contents to anyone other than the
writer or an intended recipient, without the consent of either the writer
or an intended recipient, except as permitted or required by law. Prodigy
reserves the right to delete private electronic messages from your Message
Center after a period of time established by Prodigy. Prodigy will have
no responsibility for retaining or delivering private electronic messages
that are located in a Member's Message Center at the time of that Member's
suspension or termination, or that are addressed to such Member thereafter.
Prodigy may permit Merchants to send messages to Members for commercial
purposes.<BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>Public Postings Areas.</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Public postings area of the Service is any area where Members may submit
material (&quot;Submissions&quot;) for viewing by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, and view Submissions by other Members or by nonMembers
using Internet facilities, such as Service bulletin boards or chat rooms,
and similar Internet facilities, even if such area is not available to all
Members. A Submission includes the name, ID, chat nickname and/or other
information that would be displayed with the submitted material, as applicable.
You agree to use public postings areas only in accordance with this Agreement
and any policies and/or guidelines for the area that are displayed on the
Service. <BR>
<BR>
You may not submit copyrighted material to public postings areas without
the specific authority of the copyright owner; doing so is a breach of this
Agreement and may subject you to legal liability. <BR>
<BR>
BY SUBMITTING MATERIAL TO A PUBLIC POSTINGS AREA, YOU AGREE TO INDEMNIFY
PRODIGY, AND ITS INFORMATION PROVIDERS, THEIR EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS,
AND HOLD THEM HARMLESS FROM ALL CLAIMS, INCLUDING CLAIMS FOR LIBEL AND SLANDER,
ARISING FROM THE SUBMISSION. Remember: You are responsible (and could be
held liable to others) for all submissions from your ID. Neither Prodigy
nor its Information Providers is responsible or shall have any liability
for material displayed in a public postings area unless posted by its authorized
spokesperson. Experts, Information Providers and &quot;Member Representatives&quot;
are not authorized Prodigy spokespersons. By submitting material to a public
postings area you are irrevocably granting Prodigy permission to do anything
Prodigy may choose with all parts of the Submission, as if it were in the
public domain, including modifying it or using it commercially and authorizing
others to do so. You are also irrevocably granting everyone else (including
nonMembers) permission to reproduce and/or redistribute all or parts of
your Submission in any form for noncommercial purposes. In addition, anyone
is free to use information contained in a Submission for any purpose, at
their own risk.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may establish time limits and/or other criteria under which Submissions
will be automatically removed from public display. Prodigy has the right,
but is not obligated, to maintain archives of Submissions, regardless of
whether they were actually posted on the Service, and Prodigy may use or
disclose archived Submissions in any manner it deems appropriate.<BR>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<H3>From MSN's Member Guidelines:<BR>
<BR>
E-mail</H3>
Electronic mail (or e-mail) permits direct communication between MSN members
and: 
<UL>
<LI>MSN merchants and advertisers. 
<LI>Members of other online services over the Internet. 
<LI>People connected to the Internet. 
</UL>
E-mail is sent to the addressee and does not appear publicly. MSN will make
every effort to keep members' e-mail private while it is under MSN control;
sending e-mail over the Internet involves networks that are not part of
MSN and might not be as secure.<BR>
<BR>
MSN will not intercept, attempt to intercept, open or attempt to open e-mail
without authorization from the sender or recipient. On rare occasions, MSN
might be required by legal process to disclose the contents of e-mail in
connection with an investigation of alleged illegal activity. <BR>
<BR>
New, unread e-mail is retained online for 45 days. Usually when you read
your MSN e-mail, it is moved from The Microsoft Network to your computer,
where it remains as long as you retain it. However, you can choose instead
to preview your e-mail. In this case, you transfer a copy of your e-mail
to your computer and leave the original on MSN, where it remains for 15
days. The length of time e-mail remains on MSN is subject to change as network
conditions require.<BR>
<BR>
For a detailed description of e-mail reading options, look up E-mail messages

Dear Deirdre:<BR>
<BR>
Thank you for your questions regarding PRODIGY's handling of e-mail. PRODIGY
will hold a member's unopened email for a period of 30 days, after which
it is deleted from the system. Once a member opens an email message, it
remains in the system for three days, and is then deleted. If they wish,
members can instruct PRODIGY to store a message for an additional 15 days,
or they can delete the message and it will be purged from the system within
24 hours.<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

<H3>From the MSN Member Agreement:<BR>
<BR>
2. MSN Usage.</H3>
<BR>
2.3 You agree to (a) maintain all equipment required for your access to
and use of MSN; (b) maintain the security of your Member identification,
password and other confidential information relating to your MSN account;
and (c) be responsible for all charges resulting from use of your MSN account,
including unauthorized use prior to your notifying MSP of such use and taking
steps to prevent its further occurrence by changing your password. Information
on how to protect the security of your MSN account (including changing your
password) is available online.<BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="75%"></CENTER>
<P>
<H3>From the MSN Member Guidelines:</H3>
<H3>Responsibility and Liability</H3>
Respect the privacy of others. Don't make statements that are false or hurtful
to others, including persons who are not online. <BR>
<BR>
Your member ID is the &quot;screen name&quot; that identifies you online.
Other members will see your ID when you post BBS messages or chat with them
online. You can choose your ID based on your real name, or a nickname, or
you can make something up. Once you make your choice during MSN sign-up,
your ID stays the same unless it is modified. If you would like to modify
your ID, please contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Keep in mind that when you choose your ID and provide information about
yourself, you may not impersonate or represent yourself as any other person
or entity. Of course, you may not represent yourself as an employee or representative
of MSN under any circumstances. Do not choose an ID which is designed to
be an advertisement of a product or service. Also, in the unlikely event
that you have selected an ID that is already in use, or is reserved for
use by an MSN content provider or advertiser (because it is a product brand
or trade name), you will be asked to choose a different screen name.<BR>
<BR>
Be careful when asked to provide personal or confidential information while
online. Do not give information about your credit card (including account
number or expiration date) in response to e-mail requests that you receive
from people you do not know. Such requests may be fraudulent. This type
of information will only be requested by MSN staff or a content provider
by means of an encrypted eform. If you see any suspicious communications
by anyone who appears to be deceiving members into believing that they are
authorized by MSN or a content provider to receive such information, please
contact Member Support.<BR>
<BR>
Please remember that you can be held legally liable for what you say on
any forum or in e-mail. For example, you can be held accountable for defamatory
comments, threats, and statements that are illegal or fraudulent. MSN is
available in many countries worldwide. Laws vary throughout the world. Remarks
and behavior that are protected in one country might not be protected in
another. MSN might refer certain comments -- for example, threats of harm
to people or property -- to law enforcement authorities. This applies even
to comments that are made in jest.<BR>

    <TITLE>Prodigy Security Practices</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<STRONG>From the Prodigy Service Agreement:<BR>
<BR>
5. Use of the Service</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
You are responsible for providing all equipment, devices and software (other
than the<BR>
PRODIGY software) necessary to receive the Service. Prodigy will provide
telephone<BR>
numbers to connect to the Service, which for most Members will include a
local number.<BR>
You are responsible for selecting the best number for you, and for all telephone
fees and<BR>
charges associated with the use of the telephone number you select. If you
have any<BR>
question about which telephone number is best for you, check with your local
phone<BR>
company. The Service will be available during the hours stated on the Service.
Jump:<BR>
service hours. Use of the Service, and of specific telephone numbers, is
subject to<BR>
interruptions at Prodigy's discretion or beyond Prodigy's control. Unauthorized
access to<BR>
the Service, to restricted portions of the Service, or to the telecommunications
or<BR>
computer facilities used to deliver the Service, is breach of this Agreement
and a violation<BR>
of law. Membership Holders may suspend Service use by other Members in the<BR>
Membership through the means provided on the Service. Jump: member access.
Prodigy<BR>
gives the Membership Holder the ability to limit access of Members in the
Membership to<BR>
certain content available through the Service, including access to content
on the Internet<BR>
over which Prodigy exercises no control. The responsibility for controlling
Member<BR>
access to and use of these content areas is solely that of the Membership
Holder. <BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>IDs and Passwords. </STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Use of the Service requires both an ID and a password. Each new Member receives
a<BR>
unique ID and a temporary password, and must choose a new password upon<BR>
enrollment. Your ID is your address on the Service, and you and Prodigy
may disclose it<BR>
to others. Your password is the key that unlocks access to your personal
information on<BR>
the Service. Anyone knowing both your ID and password can gain access to
your<BR>
personal information and misuse it, so KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECRET; use a<BR>
password that is hard to guess (for example, do not use your first or last
name); and<BR>
change your password frequently. REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD! If you forget<BR>
your password, Prodigy may disclose it to you under security procedures
determined by<BR>
Prodigy, but reserves the right to charge for doing so. For more information
on<BR>
passwords, Jump: password security. To change your password, Jump: change<BR>
password. You may not use another Member's ID without the specific consent
of that<BR>
Member. Unauthorized use of another Member's ID, or improper solicitation
of another<BR>
Member's password, are grounds for termination of your Membership, and may
be a<BR>
violation of law. For your convenience, Prodigy provides an option that
allows you to<BR>
connect to the Service automatically, without manually entering your ID
and password<BR>
each time. Software available from third parties may also offer this function.
If you<BR>
choose to use any automatic connection function, you must understand that
anyone who<BR>
has access to your computer can also gain access to and abuse your Service
account. For<BR>
example, anyone having access to the software or computer containing your
automatic<BR>
connection information could abuse any credit, debit or charge card information<BR>
associated with your ID. <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="49%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>7. Information Supplied to Prodigy by Members</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
One of the valuable and unique features of the Service is its ability to
personalize editorial<BR>
and commercial content and offerings to your interests. Personalization
is based on<BR>
information that you (or the Membership Holder) provide to Prodigy and information<BR>
derived during your use of the Service and during installation of the PRODIGY
software<BR>
on your equipment used to receive the Service. You may review or update
certain<BR>
personal information you have provided to Prodigy by using the Tools feature
on the<BR>
Service. Jump: tools.<BR>
<BR>
You may be requested to supplement or update your personal information from
time to<BR>
time. All personal information that you provide on the Service must be accurate,
and<BR>
Prodigy reserves the right to verify its accuracy. Prodigy may use or disclose
aggregated<BR>
(not personally identifiable) information regarding Members for any purpose.
Prodigy<BR>
will not use or disclose information specifically about you (or your Membership)
except<BR>
as permitted by this Agreement and Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member
Privacy.<BR>
<BR>
Jump: privacy policy. <BR>
<BR>
From time to time, Prodigy may record information about your computer,<BR>
communications equipment and operating system software (but no other nonPRODIGY<BR>
software). Prodigy will use this information on an individually identifiable
basis only to:<BR>
(i) analyze how current or future Service features may operate on your equipment;
(ii)<BR>
monitor or improve the performance of the PRODIGY software on your equipment;
or<BR>
(iii) tell you about enhancements and offerings that may become available
for your<BR>
equipment. When you place an order on the Service, Prodigy may provide your
name,<BR>
address, telephone number, and other relevant information to the Merchant,
including<BR>
whether you are a minor and how long you have been a Member. Prodigy cannot
and will<BR>
not be responsible for how Merchants use this information. <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="49%"></CENTER>
<P>
<H2><CENTER>Prodigy's Policy on Protecting Member Privacy</CENTER>
</H2>
<BR>
As a leader in the growing medium of online services, Prodigy Services Company
is committed to respecting the privacy of our PRODIGY(R) service members,
by maintaining the very highest privacy standards.<BR>
<BR>
Our members expect that Prodigy will not misuse their personal information.*
[*Personal information is any information in Prodigy's possession that is
associated with a specific Member or household. It consists of both information
supplied directly by the Member (such as a name or address), and information
we collect about how Members use the PRODIGY service (such as the fact that
a Member uses the Sports Club, or has purchased merchandise through the
service). It does not include aggregate information (such as the total number
of Members who are more than 18 years old), or information which a Member
has made public on the PRODIGY service.] They rely on the PRODIGY service
as a secure way to send private messages. They regard the personal files
on their computers as private. And they trust Prodigy to have standards
which meet these expectations.<BR>
<BR>
We recognize our responsibility to justify this trust. Prodigy's Policy
on Protecting Member Privacy reaffirms our commitment to our members, embodying
our privacy standards in five key principles that have been fundamental
to our business since we first introduced the PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
1. Prodigy uses personal information only for purposes necessary to provide
Prodigy's products and services.<BR>
<BR>
These purposes are: <BR>
<BR>
- to process requests and orders placed with advertisers, merchants, and
service providers on the PRODIGY service;<BR>
- to personalize the PRODIGY service based on members' interests, including
making members aware of editorial features, advertisements, and commercial
offerings that may be of interest;<BR>
- to communicate with members, including promoting new Prodigy offerings;<BR>
- to serve members when they have questions or problems;<BR>
- to perform normal business operations, such as billing, collection, and
accounting;<BR>
- to investigate complaints and protect the PRODIGY service and its members;
and<BR>
- as provided by law or in case of emergency, as determined by Prodigy's
legal department in each case.<BR>
<BR>
Prodigy may disclose to the Membership Holder (the member whose ID ends
in &quot;A&quot;) information regarding service usage by other Membership
ID's to document Prodigy's invoices or other matters for which the Membership
Holder is responsible.<BR>
<BR>
2. Prodigy uses strict procedures and safeguards designed to protect the
privacy of all personal information. All Prodigy employees with access to
personal information are required to follow specific practices concerning
its proper handling.<BR>
<BR>
3. Prodigy does not rent, sell, barter, or give away its member list for
use by any outside party. Prodigy may send approved commercial communications
to members on behalf of outside parties, but will do so only through the
PRODIGY service.<BR>
<BR>
4. Prodigy keeps the private messages that its members send to other members,
advertisers, or merchants absolutely private. Prodigy also keeps members'
private messages sent to or from other systems absolutely private while
they are under Prodigy's control. Prodigy employees never inspect or disclose
to others the contents of these private messages except with the specific
consent of the sender or recipient, or as specifically authorized by Prodigy's
legal department in the narrowly-defined situations established under federal
law.<BR>
<BR>
5. Prodigy respects the privacy of personal files in members' computers.
Prodigy does not access, read, upload, or store data contained in or derived
from private files without the member's authorization.<BR>
<BR>
Each Prodigy Services Company employee is required to abide by and uphold
this Policy, and to take responsibility for enforcing it.<BR>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H2>Letter to Crime Subcommittee regarding H.R. 3508</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
September 11, 1996<BR>
<BR>
Members of the Crime Subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee <BR>
and Interested Parties:<BR>
<BR>
The Center for Democracy and Technology urges the Crime Subcommittee to
cast a critical eye on the &quot;Children's Privacy Protection and Parental
Empowerment Act&quot; (CPPPEA) (HR 3508).  While we commend the bill's sponsor,
Representative Franks, and Chairman McCollum, as well as the members of
the Committee for their efforts to protect children's privacy, we believe
that the solutions proposed in the CPPPEA -- particularly as they relate
to the exchange of information on the Internet -- will increase the collection
of information about children in certain circumstances and criminalize behavior
in a vast array of unintended situations, thereby compromising the free
flow of information online.  <BR>
<BR>
CDT is committed to advancing individual privacy on the Internet.  We believe
that protecting children's privacy is a subject in need of exploration and
action, however we urge the Committee to seek solutions that both protect
privacy and respect our First Amendment freedoms.  <BR>
<BR>
As stated by CDT, Voters Telecommunications Watch, People for the American
Way, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation in a June 1996 letter to Representative
Franks (attached), the CPPPEA raises a number of significant privacy and
First Amendment concerns.  
<UL>
<LI>Compliance with the bill could well lead to an increase in the collection
of information about children and adults, compounding privacy risks.  Information
providers on the Internet currently have no way of distinguishing children
from adults.  Given marketers and other information providers desire to
continue their business, it is likely that they will seek to collect more
intrusive information about children's ages and their parents in an effort
to limit their liability and garner parental consent.  In the worst case
scenario this could lead to an unacceptably intrusive national ID system
for the Internet (a system that none of us support).  
<LI>The term &quot;list broker,&quot; is drafted to cover any entity which
exchanges personal information in the course of its operation.  The vast
majority of World Wide Web site operators, as well as anyone who operates
a listserv, mailing list or other information distribution mechanism, all
collect, store, and may well exchange, email addresses.  Unless Web site
operators obtain parental consent before collecting information, they risk
criminal penalties for violation of section (a)(4). <BR>
 <BR>
<LI>The requirement to disclose the source and content of personal information
about children to parents creates unclear new obligations on Internet information
providers.  In fact, many of the information providers who would be covered
by the CPPPEA do not keep track of the source of their information and thus
may not have the ability to comply with the statute.  Compliance with this
section could well lead to an increase in the overall collection of personal
information about Internet users, thereby compounding privacy risks.  <BR>
<BR>
<LI>Requiring parental consent in all instances and requiring providers
to disclose information to parents collected from children fails to acknowledge
the distinction between young children and teenagers and their rights under
the Constitution.  Such a provision as applied to a fourteen or fifteen
year old child may fail to respect the youth's independent First Amendment
and privacy interests.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Imposed identification procedures applied to the World Wide Web under
the threat of criminal penalties would limit all Internet users' ability
to read, speak, receive information and interact online under constitutionally-protected
conditions of anonymity. <BR>
 <BR>
<LI>Section (a)(6) which criminalizes any distribution or receipt of personal
information where the receiver has knowledge or &quot;reason to believe
that the information will be used to abuse the child or physically harm
the child&quot; is well-intentioned, but potentially so broad as to cover
anyone who receives and discloses personal information about a child, or
on the Internet anyone who allows a child to &quot;post&quot; information
about his or herself.  The bill establishes no clear standard of care or
level of knowledge necessary to meet this requirement, leaving everyone
on the Internet in doubt about whether or not they may be violating this
new crime.  Schools and organizations who publish directories as well as
newspapers who publish the identity of a child in a news story could be
subject to prosecution because they had &quot;reason to know&quot; that
the information may end up in the possession of bad actors.
</UL>
The Internet offers children unprecedented and important new educational
and recreational opportunities.  But, the medium also may offer access to
inappropriate material, and exposure to unfair marketing or information
collection practices.  Solutions to these problems must be carefully analyzed
and should take into account both the unique nature of the Internet, as
well as the multitude of First Amendment and privacy rights at stake for
all who seek to read, communicate, and associate with others in the online
environment.   <BR>
<BR>
Given the importance of addressing children's privacy issues, we suggest
that the Committee examine alternatives.  Empowering parents to protect
their children's privacy with existing technological tools, fair information
practices by the industry, and the enactment of more narrowly tailored legislation,
will help ensure that the Internet continues to grow and thrive for both
commercial and noncommercial endeavors.  For example, software already on
the market such as Cyberpatrol, as well as industry-standard technologies
such as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS) enable people
-- including parents and their children -- to restrict access to sites which
practice objectionable marketing and information collection techniques.<BR>
<BR>
At present, PICS technology, along with other innovative products, allows
parents to filter and block-out materials that contain objectionable content
or block access to sites with inappropriate or abusive marketing practices.
 Current technology can enable parents to: 
<UL>
<LI>prevent their children from accessing Web sites with inappropriate information
practices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy organization
of the parent's choice; 
<LI>prevent their children from revealing personal information such as name,
address, and e-mail address to others; 
<LI>install security measures such as passwords that prevent their child
from changing rules about Web site access or information disclosure, collection
and use that the parent has established. 
</UL>
CDT strongly believes that parents should be given the tools and legal remedies
necessary to ensure a safe, educational, and enjoyable online experience
for their children.  It is possible to craft a policy that will ensure children's
safety and protect children's privacy, consistent with the First Amendment.
 We urge the Committee to seek a policy that will protect the privacy of
users of the Internet, foster free speech, and continue the Internet's development
as a robust platform for social, political and economic activities.<BR>

Sincerely,  <BR>

<BR>
Dear Representative Franks:<BR>
<BR>
We are writing to commend your efforts to protect children's privacy. We
are pleased that you have begun a process to put these important issues
at the center of the political debate. We believe, however, that the solutions
recommended in your bill, -- the &quot;Children's Privacy Protection and
Parental Empowerment Act&quot; (HR 3508) -- particularly as they relate
to the exchange of information on the Internet, will not only increase the
collection of information about children in certain circumstances but will
also criminalize behavior in a vast array of unintended situations, thereby
compromising the free flow of information online.<BR>
<BR>
With the rising popularity of the Internet and commercial online services,
concerns regarding the vulnerabilities of unsupervised children's activities
online must be addressed. Indeed, although the Internet offers children
unprecedented and important new educational and recreational opportunities,
the medium also may offer access to inappropriate material, or exposure
to unfair marketing or information collection practices.  Solutions to these
problems must be carefully analyzed and should take into account both the
unique nature of the Internet, as well as the multitude of First Amendment
and privacy rights at stake for all who seek to read, communicate, and associate
with others in the online environment. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC), whose responsibility it is to police the existence and proliferation
of unfair or deceptive advertising and information practices has scheduled
hearings for June 4 and 5 to look at these very issues as they apply to
the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
Because your bill was drafted to apply to all media we are concerned that
its application in the Internet context may lead to unintended consequences.
We ask that you examine, together with the FTC, the unique qualities of
the Internet and the problems that result from regulating activity at the
information publisher or Web site operator end.<BR>
<BR>
In its application to the Internet, the Children's Privacy Protection and
Parental Empowerment Act is both over-inclusive, covering virtually all
who participate in the Internet, and ineffective, in that it leaves substantial
loopholes for those who engage in the behavior at which the bill is targeted.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;personal information,&quot; the basic regulatory target of
the bill, is defined in such as way that it may include nothing more than
an electronic mail address which by its nature, gives no indication of the
age or physical location of a user.  Furthermore, the term &quot;list broker,&quot;
is drafted to cover any entity which exchanges personal information in the
course of its operation. The vast majority of World Wide Web site operators,
as well as anyone who operates a listserv, mailing list or other information
distribution mechanism, all collect, store, and may well exchange, email
addresses.  Then, unless Web site operators obtain parental consent before
collecting information, they risk criminal penalties for violation of section
(a)(4).<BR>
<BR>
The difficulty in compliance is two-fold. First, information providers on
the Internet have no way of distinguishing children from adults.  In fact,
compliance with the bill could well lead to an increase in the collection
of information about children and adults, only compounding privacy risks.
Even with the imposition of an unacceptably intrusive national ID system
(a system that none of us support), it would still be essentially impossible
for an information publisher or Web site operator to establish the age of
the user visiting the providers site. Second, the requirement to disclose
the source of personal information about children to parents creates unclear
new obligations on Internet information providers.  In fact, many of the
information providers who would be covered by your bill do not keep track
of the source of their information and thus may not have the ability to
comply with the statute.  Compliance with this section could well lead to
an increase in the overall collection of personal information about Internet
users, thereby compounding privacy risks.<BR>
<BR>
Imposed identification procedures applied to the World Wide Web under the
threat of criminal penalties would limit all Internet users' ability to
read, speak, receive information and interact online under constitutionally-protected
conditions of anonymity. Further, requiring parental consent in all instances
or requiring providers to disclose information to parents collected from
children fails to acknowledge the distinction between young children and
teenagers and their rights under the Constitution.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, section (a)(6) which criminalizes any distribution or receipt of
personal information where the receiver has knowledge or &quot;reason to
believe that the information will be used to abuse the child or physically
harm the child&quot; is well-intentioned, but potentially so broad as to
cover anyone who receives and discloses personal information about a child.
The bill establishes no clear standard of care or level of knowledge necessary
to meet this requirement, leaving everyone on the Internet in doubt about
whether or not they may be violating this new crime. Schools and organizations
who publish directories as well as newspapers who publish the identity of
a child in a news story could be subject to prosecution because they had
&quot;reason to know&quot; that the information may end up in the possession
of bad actors.<BR>
<BR>
Given all of these difficulties in applying your bill to the Internet, and
given the importance of addressing children's privacy issues, we suggest
that examination of alternatives is in order. Empowering parents to protect
their children's privacy with existing technological tools and fair information
practices by the industry will help ensure that the Internet continues to
grow and thrive for both commercial and noncommercial endeavors. For example,
software already on the market such as Cyberpatrol, as well as industry-standard
technologies such as the Platform for Internet Content Selection (PICS)
enable people -- including parents and their children -- to restrict access
to sites which practice objectionable marketing and information collection
techniques.<BR>
<BR>
At present, PICS technology, along with other innovative products, allows
parents to filter and block-out materials that contain objectionable content
or block access to sites with inappropriate or abusive marketing practices.
Current technology can enable parents to:
<UL>
<LI>prevent their children from accessing Web sites with inappropriate information
practices -- as defined by the parent or a consumer or privacy organization
of the parent's choice;
<LI>prevent their children from revealing personal information such as name,
address, and e-mail address to others;
<LI>install security measures such as passwords that prevent their child
from changing rules about Web site access or information disclosure, collection
and use that the parent has established.
</UL>
The Internet community is already considering extensions to the PICS specifications
which will enable individual users and parents to block the transmission
of their personal information to Web sites they visit and to express a preference
about how and to what extent they are willing to have personal information
reused. PICS, Cyberpatrol and other technologies can help eradicate the
deceptive and inappropriate practices your bill seeks to address without
compromising the rights of users or content providers.<BR>
<BR>
Several of us have had the opportunity to talk with you and your staff about
this legislation. We appreciate your willingness to discuss these issues
and look forward to working with you in this important area in the hopes
that technological alternatives combined with better industry practices
and much more narrowly crafted legislation will help protect this nation's
children in the online world, consistent with First Amendment and privacy
principles.<BR>
<BR>

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) CONGRESS/FTC FOCUS ON ONLINE PRIVACY - OFFER DIVERGENT SOLUTIONS

The increasing use of the Internet by children, combined with the ease of
collecting personal information online, raise serious privacy issues.
However, while there is broad consensus on the goal of giving people more
control over the collection and use of personal information online, some of
the solutions being offered may have far-reaching, though perhaps
inadvertent, impact on the free flow of information in interactive media.

Over the past several months, concerns about the availability and use of
personal information in the online world, particularly with respect to the
collection and use of information about children, have prompted the
Congress and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to seriously consider this
important issue.

The approaches to this issue fall broadly into two distinct categories:

* Create Criminal Penalties For The Collection And Use Of Personal
  Information About Kids Without Parental Consent.

* Encourage The Development And Use Of Technologies That Enable Users
  and Parents To Limit The Amount Of Personal Information They and Their
  Children Reveal Online.

Legislation designed to restrict the collection and use of personal
information about children without parental consent was recently introduced
by Rep Bob Franks (R-NJ). The bill has sparked concerns from cyber-rights
advocates that it may end up increasing the collection of personal
information online and result in restrictions on the free flow of
information (see the attached letter from EFF, People for the American Way
Action Fund, VTW, and CDT below).

Recent hearings before the FTC emphasized the broad consensus about the need
to give individuals more control over the collection and use of personal
information. The FTC hearings highlighted the availability of technologies
which empower users and parents to exercise more control over the collection
and use of such information, and the possibility that existing methods,
including the PICS standards, can be enhanced to enable users to express
preferences about how and to what extent they are willing to have personal
information reused (although much work needs to be done before this is fully
implemented).

In addition, Rep. Ed Markey (D-MA), a long time champion of privacy issues,
told the FTC panel that he would like to encourage the development of
technologies that enable users to control the amount of personal 
information they reveal online. Markey also emphasized that Congress should
consider legislation in this area if such technologies are not developed or
are not effective.  Markey told the FTC:

 "We should see if there are technological tools that can empower
  consumers. Where they don't exist, or where a particular industry
  refuses to embrace this code of electronic ethics in a way that solves
  this problem, then the government is obliged to step in and do
  something."

Markey also announced that he intends to introduce legislation soon to give
consumers the right to know that information is being collected about them,
notice that personal information may be reused or sold, and the right to
say "no" to the reuse or sale of their personal information.  Markey's
legislation would also commission a study of existing online privacy
practices (The full text of Rep. Markey's statement is available at CDT's
privacy issues web page URL below.)

The FTC hearings illustrated that there is broad concern about the
collection and use of personal information online. There was also great
substantial support expressed for technological solutions to address this
issue.  As a result, the FTC has requested that the industry report back to
the Commission in 6 months on progress towards developing technologies that
enhance user control over the collection and use of personal information
online.

CDT is encouraged that Congress and the FTC have taken such strong interest
in the issue of online privacy, and we look forward to working with all
interested parties to ensure that solutions give users control over the
collection and use of personal information and do not adversely affect the
free flow of information online.

Markey's statement, and a demonstration illustrating the amount of personal
information collected during the normal course of surfing the Web, can be

(2) Letter from EFF, PFAW Action Fund, VTW & CDT to Rep. Bob Franks 
    Regarding "Children's Privacy" (HR 3508) Bill

The following letter was sent last week to Representative Bob Franks (R-NJ)
regarding the "Children's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment Act"
(HR 3508) from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, People for the American
Way Action Fund, the Voters Telecommunications Watch, and the Center for
Democracy and Technology.

Among other things, the groups expressed concern that, as currently
drafted, the bill raises some of the same privacy and free flow of
information issues raised by the Exon/Coats "Communications Decency Act" to
the extent that it is extremely difficult to know whether or not a person
visiting a web site is or is not a child without requiring all visitors to
identify themselves.

While commending Rep. Franks for his efforts and expressing support for the
goal of his legislation, the letter outlines several concerns about the
impact of the bill on the Internet.  The groups pledged to work with Rep.
Franks and other interested members of Congress to explore technological
solutions which empower users and parents to control the use of personal
information and preserve the free flow of information.

The Franks bill enjoys broad support from a number of conservative
"pro-family" groups such as the Christian Coalition, Enough Is Enough!, and
the National Law Center for Children and Families, as well as privacy
groups such as EPIC, Privacy Times Publisher Evan Hendricks and Privacy
Journal Publisher Robert Ellis Smith.

The text of HR 3508 is available at: http://www.cdt.org/privacy/children/

The full text of the letter from EFF, PFAW Action Fund, VTW and CDT follows:

Representative Bob Franks

Washington, DC 20515

Dear Representative Franks:

We are writing to commend your efforts to protect children's privacy.
We are pleased that you have begun a process to put these important issues
at the center of the political debate. We believe, however, that the

(3) Join Senator Conrad Burns Live Online to Discuss Encryption Policy The
    Night Before His Subcommittee Holds a Hearing On the Issue!

 --> Visit http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/ for details <--

In what is becoming the newest way for Congress to read the net.community's
opinion on issues, Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will be on HotWired on June
11th @ 10pm EST to discuss the encryption issue with all attendees. The 
next day, Senator Burns will chair the first of two scheduled hearings on
the encryption issue with industry luminaries.

Never before has the public had this much access to legislators without
geographical proximity.  Cheaper than teleconferencing, and more direct
and unfiltered than the traditional press, online chats allow the public
to directly question and hear the answers of Congress.

Have a question about encryption policy that you've never been able to find
out from the government?  Come to the HotWired chat and ask Senator Burns
to be your advocate to press the witnesses and the White House on these
issues.

The online chat is at 10pm EDT (7pm PDT) on Tuesday June 11, the night 
before the first hearing. HotWired's WiredSide chat is at:

     http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/

Next Tuesday's forum is another in a series of planned events, and is part
of a broader project coordinated by CDT and the Voters Telecommunications
Watch (VTW) designed to bring the Internet Community into the debate and
encourage members of Congress to work with the Net.community on vital
Internet policy issues.

The transcript from last week's discussion with Congressman Rick White is
now available -- for information about the transcript, previous events with
other members of Congress, and upcoming events, please check CDT's newest

<PRE>
Good Morning.  Thank you very much for inviting me to be with 
you here today.  The issue of privacy in the information age and 
in particular, children's privacy protection is quite timely as the 
nation becomes ever more linked by the Internet.  It is important 
that we tackle these issues now before we travel down the 
information superhighway too far and realize perhaps we've 
made a wrong turn.

Yesterday, I had the privilege of addressing a conference at MIT 
on how the Internet and other telecommunications technologies 
can enhance the educational experience for millions of 
schoolkids.

Yet the "wire" -- and I use the term "wire" as shorthand for any 
telecommunications infrastructure such as phone, cable, 
computer or wireless networks -- the wondrous wire that brings 
new services to homes, businesses and schools will have a 
certain Dickensian quality to it:  it will be the best of wires and the 
worst of wires.  It can uplift society as well as debase it.  It can 
allow people to telecommute to work and obtain distance 
learning classes.  New digital technologies and other innovations 
allow corporations to become more efficient, workers more 
productive, and businesses to conduct commerce almost 
effortlessly in digital dollars.

This same technology however, will avail Corporate America of 
the opportunity to track the clickstream of a citizen of the Net, to 
sneak corporate hands into a personal information "cookie jar" 
and use this database to compile sophisticated, highly personal 
consumer profiles of people's hobbies, buying habits, financial 
information, health information, who they contact or converse 
with, when and for how long.  In short, that wondrous wire may 
also allow digital desperadoes to roam the electronic frontier 
unchecked by any high tech sheriff or adherence  to any code of 
electornic ethics.

It is this issue of personal information hijacking that we are 
concerned about and we are obviously concerned when kids are 
the target. 

As many of you may know, I have long battled to establish 
privacy protections in the telecommunications area.  I fought 
successfully to include privacy provisions in the recently-signed 
Telecommunications Act that were based upon legislation that I 
previously passed through the House of Representatives in 1994.  
In fact, in the Telecommunications Act, I was able to convince 
my colleagues to greatly expand the privacy protections 
traditionally accorded consumers of telephone services.

In short, the Telecommunications Act recognizes that many 
additional players in the telecommunications industry will now 
be privy to personal information similar to what telephone 
companies can obtain.  for this reason, the Act extends privacy 
protections to residential consumers and ensures that all 
"telecommunications carriers" -- rather than simply local phone 
companies -- are prohibited from utilizing personal consumer 
information except in narrowly tailored circumstances -- such as 
to render and bill service -- or with the approval of the user.

It is becoming increasingly apparent, however, that the existing 
privacy protections granted to consumers with respect to 
information gathered by telecommunications carriers are not 
alone sufficient to protect consumer privacy rights.  Further 
protections are needed to ensure the privacy rights are retained 
and respected in cyberspace by other entities doing business there 
as well.

In addition to my work on telecommunications privacy, I also 
have spent considerable time fighting to maximize the benefits of 
the information revolution for children.  Last week, I sent a letter 
to the FCC with the signatures of 220 Members of the House of 
Representatives -- a majority of the House -- requesting that that 
agency adopt a minimum standard as part of the Children's 
Television Act.  This minimum standard would require 
America's television broadcasters to air at least 3 hours per week 
of educational and information programming designed for 
children.

In addition, I have advocated establishing "learning links" to 
schools and libraries.  I believe that the very telecommunications 
companies to whom so much opportunity has been given in the 
Telecommunications Act have an obligation to harness a small 
portion of their economic activity to do something noble and 
necessary to prepare the next generation of Americans for the 
fiercely competitive global economy of the future.

Thirdly, I fought over a number of years to get the TV industry to 
adopt the V-chip and finally won its approval as part of the 
Telecommunications Act.  The V-chip will allow parents -- in a 
1st Amendment-friendly way -- to exercise the marketplace 
option of turning off TV content that they believe is 
inappropriate for their young daughter or son.

Yet, the V-chip will only work because the television industry 
decided earlier this year that, rather than further opposing the 
concept and litigating it, they would work with parents to give 
them the information and tools they needed to make informed 
decisions.  I think that model is quite instructive in this situation.

The issue of children's privacy, and indeed, adult privacy in an 
electronic environment, must find its ultimate solution in 
technology, industry action, government oversight or regulation.  
Or, some combination of any or all of the above.

Without question, the issues posed here today are tremendously 
complex.  The ever-evolving nature of the Internet does not lend 
itself to easy solutions.  My colleague, Congressman Bob Franks, 
has recently introduced legislation to help protect kids from 
harm and deceptive marketing practices.  I want to commend and 
congratulate him for his work and I agree 100 percent with the 
goals of his bill.  It's application, however, to the Internet -- as 
distinct from other electronic media -- is problematic.

Being able to distinguish, for instance, a child from an adult in an 
online environment is quite difficult.  Determining the age of the 
user behind the modem is tough to do as well.  Imposing 
criminal penalties for the distribution or receipt of personal 
information where the recipient of that information has "reason 
to believe" that it will be used to abuse a child is a commendable 
sentiment.  I would note, however, that it is hard to enforce 
because no standard exists in the bill to ascertain the level of 
knowledge necessary to meet this requirement.

This leaves the citizenry of the Net not knowing their 
obligations.  Many World Wide Web sites collect information for 
distributing content electronically and often exchange such "e-
mailing lists."  Do they have "reason to believe" when they 
exchange such lists that this data may end up in the hands of 
unscrupulous people?

Again, how best to protect kids is a complex issue.  How to put 
teeth into privacy protections is also important to figure out.  
What may have worked for privacy protection or parental 
empowerment in the phone or cable or TV industry may not 
adequately serve as a model when these technologies converge.  
Therefore I believe we must pursue other alternatives.

I suggest we step back from all the complexity for a moment and 
focus instead on the core principles we want to advance.

We must recognize that children's privacy is a subset of a 
parent's privacy rights.  I believe that regardless of the technology 
that consumers use, their privacy rights and expectations remain 
a constant.  Whether they are using a phone, a TV clicker, a 
satellite dish, or modem, every consumer should enjoy a Privacy 
Bill of Rights for the information age.  These core rights are 
embodied in a proposal I have advocated for many years and I 
call it "Knowledge, Notice and No."

In short, irrespective of the telecommunications medium 
consumers use, they should get the following 3 basic rights:

1) KNOWLEDGE that information is being collected about them.  
This is very important because digital technologies increasingly 
allow people to electronically glean personal information about 
users surreptitiously.

2)  Adequate and conspicuous NOTICE that any personal 
information collected is intended by the recipient for reuse for 
sale.

And, 3)  the right of a consumer to say "NO" and to curtail or 
prohibit such reuse or sale of their personal information.

I will introduce legislation before the end of next week that will 
canvass privacy policies governing the telecommunications 
universe -- from NYNEX to NETSCAPE -- to figure out whether 
consumers are able to obtain and exercise these rights.  And 
secondly, in the case of children, to see whether these rights can 
be exercised adequately by their parents.

We should see if there are technological tools that can empower 
consumers.  Where they don't exist, or where a particular 
industry refuses to embrace this code of electronic ethics in a way 
that solves the problem, then the government is obliged to step 
in and do something.

Pilfering personal information from kids online, under the guise 
of giving them prizes or letting them play a game, is wrong, just 
plain wrong.  We must say it is wrong and the industry itself 
should condemn such practices.  The telecommunications 
industry is full of talented individuals and they can clearly help 
to find solutions and thereby limit the need for government 
action.  For instance, in my congressional district in 
Massachusetts a company called Microsystems has developed 
CyberPatrol to help parents better supervise their kids' activities 
online.  Software that helps establish privacy preferences on the 
Internet that adequately gives consumers the tools they need to 
prevent the unwanted dissemination of their personal data is 
clearly needed.

I implore the industry to act swiftly because the current situation 
is utterly unacceptable.  At risk is consumer confidence in the 
medium.  When consumer confidence plummets so will 
economic activity on the Internet.

My legislation will establish "Knowledge, Notice, and No" as the 
goal and will require government action where the technology of 
the industry fails to protect consumers and kids.

I look forward to working with the Commission on finding a 
solution.  I welcome consumer as well as industry input 
in further developing my legislative proposal.  And I want to 
work with my colleagues in Congress to ensure that we work 
together in a way that respects the 1st Amendment and the new 
issues raised by the Internet.
Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to come 
here today to speak today.

<BIG><STRONG>UPDATE</STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>[updated August 5, 1996]</FONT><P>
<H3>Safe for Now:  Senate to Vote on Revised Counter-Terrorism Bill in September</H3>
On Friday August 2, the House of Representatives passed a revised counter-terrorism bill by a margin of 389 to 22.  The bill does not contain provisions relating to encryption or expanded wiretapping authority.  
<P>
However, the Senate did not vote on the bill before they recessed for the month.  The Senate will take up consideration of the bill when Congress returns in September.  So while the current version of the bill does not contain the privacy-threatening provisions that were previously discussed, they will likely resurface when the Senate considers the bill.
<P>
In the coming days and weeks, CDT will work with Congressional leaders, privacy advocates, and the net.community to ensure that constitutional civil liberties and the openness of the Internet are protected as Congress considers counter-terrorism measures.
<P>
Thanks to everyone who called Congress to object to the new sweeping
surveillance provisions that were dropped from the bill!

At a news conference Tuesday, January 28, Senators Conrad Burns (R-MT), Patrick Leahy
(D-VT), and Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced that they will re-introduce the
&quot;Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era&quot; (Pro-CODE) bill. The &quot;Pro-CODE&quot; bill,
which attracted significant bi-partisan support last year, would relax
exports controls on encryption technologies and promote the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies for
the Internet.

  _______________________________________________________________
  
  For Immediate Release                         November 15, 1996
  
  
  
                        TEXT OF A LETTER FROM
                   THE PRESIDENT TO THE SPEAKER OF
                   THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND
                     THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE
  
  
                          November 15, 1996
  
  
  
  Dear Mr. Speaker:     (Dear Mr. President:)
  
  In order to take additional steps with respect to the 
  national emergency described and declared in Executive 
  Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and continued on August 15, 
  1995, and August 14, 1996, necessitated by the expiration of 
  the Export Administration Act (EAA) on August 20, 1994, I hereby 
  report to the Congress that pursuant to section 204(b) of the 
  International Emergency Economic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(b) 
  (the "Act"), I have today exercised the authority granted by the 
  Act to issue an Executive order (a copy of which is attached) to 
  revise the provisions that apply to the administration of the 
  export control system maintained by Department of Commerce in 
  the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 et seq.
  
  The new Executive order relates to my decision to transfer 
  certain encryption products from the United States Munitions 
  List administered by the Department of State to the Commerce 
  Control List administered by the Department of Commerce.  
  When I made that decision I also decided to amend Executive 
  Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, which sets forth procedures 
  for the interagency review and disposition of dual-use export 
  license applications, to include the Department of Justice 
  among the agencies that have the opportunity to review such 
  applications with respect to encryption products transferred 
  to Department of Commerce control.
  
  Also, in issuing the new order, I provided for appropriate 
  controls on the export and foreign dissemination of encryption 
  products transferred to the Department of Commerce.  Among 
  other provisions, I determined that the export of encryption 
  products transferred to Department of Commerce control could 
  harm national security and foreign policy interests of the 
  United States even where comparable products are or appear to 
  be available from foreign sources.  Accordingly, the new order 
  makes clear that any EAA provision dealing with issuance of 
  licenses or removal of controls based on foreign availability 
  considerations shall not apply with respect to export controls 
  on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this, the 
  Secretary of Commerce retains the discretion to consider the 
  foreign availability of comparable encryption products in any 
  particular case.

  SUBJECT:  	 Encryption Export Policy
  
  
  Encryption products, when used outside the United States, can 
  jeopardize our foreign policy and national security interests.  
  Moreover, such products, when used by international criminal 
  organizations, can threaten the safety of U.S. citizens here 
  and abroad, as well as the safety of the citizens of other 
  countries.  The exportation of encryption products accordingly 
  must be controlled to further U.S. foreign policy objectives, 
  and promote our national security, including the protection of 
  the safety of U.S. citizens abroad.  Nonetheless, because of 
  the increasingly widespread use of encryption products for the 
  legitimate protection of the privacy of data and communications 
  in nonmilitary contexts; because of the importance to U.S. 
  economic interests of the market for encryption products; 
  and because, pursuant to the terms set forth in the Executive 
  order entitled Administration of Export Controls on Encryption 
  Products (the "new Executive order") of November 15, 1996, 
  Commerce Department controls of the export of such dual-use 
  encryption products can be accomplished without compromising 
  U.S. foreign policy objectives and national security interests, 
  I have determined at this time not to continue to designate such 
  encryption products as defense articles on the United States 
  Munitions List.
  
  Accordingly, under the powers vested in me by the Constitution 
  and the laws of the United States, I direct that:
  
  1.  Encryption products that presently are or would be 
  designated in Category XIII of the United States Munitions 
  List and regulated by the Department of State pursuant to 
  the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq.) shall 
  be transferred to the Commerce Control List, and regulated 
  by the Department of Commerce under the authority conferred 
  
                                 more
  
       	    	      	   	     	       	    (OVER)

                                  2
  
  in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (as continued on 
  August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996), Executive Order 12981 
  of December 5, 1995, and the new Executive order except 
  that encryption products specifically designed, developed, 
  configured, adapted, or modified for military applications 
  (including command, control, and intelligence applications), 
  shall continue to be designated as defense articles, shall 
  remain on the United States Munitions List, and shall continue 
  to be controlled under the Arms Export Control Act.  The 
  transfer described in this paragraph shall be effective upon 
  the issuance of final regulations (the "Final Regulations") 
  implementing the safeguards specified in this directive and 
  in the new Executive order.
  
  2.  The Final Regulations shall specify that the encryption 
  products specified in section 1 of this memorandum shall be 
  placed on the Commerce Control List administered by the 
  Department of Commerce.  The Department of Commerce shall, 
  to the extent permitted by law, administer the export of such 
  encryption products, including encryption software, pursuant 
  to the requirements of sections 5 and 6 of the former Export 
  Administration Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the 
  regulations thereunder, as continued in effect by Executive 
  Order 12924 of August 19, 1994 (continued on August 15, 1995, 
  and on August 14, 1996), except as otherwise indicated in or 
  modified by the new Executive order, Executive Order 12981 of 
  December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders and laws cited 
  therein.
  
  3.  The Final Regulations shall provide that encryption 
  products described in section 1 of this memorandum can be 
  licensed for export only if the requirements of the controls 
  of both sections 5 and 6 of the former Export Administration 
  Act (50 U.S.C. App. 2405 and 2406), and the regulations 
  thereunder, as modified by the new Executive order, Executive 
  Order 12981 of December 5, 1995, and any Executive orders 
  and laws cited therein, are satisfied.  Consistent with 
  section 742.1(f) of the current Export Administration 
  Regulations, the Final Regulations shall ensure that a license 
  for such a product will be issued only if an application can 
  be and is approved under both section 5 and section 6.  The 
  controls on such products will apply to all destinations.  
  Except for those products transferred to the Commerce Control 
  List prior to the effective date of the Final Regulations, 
  exports and reexports of encryption products shall initially be 
  subject to case-by-case review to ensure that export thereof 
  would be consistent with U.S. foreign policy objectives and 
  national security interests, including the safety of U.S. 
  citizens.  Consideration shall be given to more liberalized 
  licensing treatment of each such individual product after 
  interagency review is completed.  The Final Regulations shall 
  also effectuate all other specific objectives and directives set 
  forth in this directive.
  
  4.  Because encryption source code can easily and mechanically 
  be transformed into object code, and because export of such 
  source code is controlled because of the code's functional 
  capacity, rather than because of any "information" such code 
  might convey, the Final Regulations shall specify that 
  encryption source code shall be treated as an encryption 
  product, and not as technical data or technology, for export 
  licensing purposes.
  
  5.  All provisions in the Final Regulations regarding 
  "de minimis" domestic content of items shall not apply with 
  respect to the encryption products described in paragraph 1 
  of this memorandum.
  
                                 more

                                  3
  
  6.  The Final Regulations shall, in a manner consistent with 
  section 16(5)(C) of the EAA, 50 U.S.C. App. 2415(5)(C), provide 
  that it will constitute an export of encryption source code 
  or object code software for a person to make such software 
  available for transfer outside the United States, over radio, 
  electromagnetic, photooptical, or photoelectric communications 
  facilities accessible to persons outside the United States, 
  including transfer from electronic bulletin boards and Internet 
  file transfer protocol sites, unless the party making the 
  software available takes precautions adequate to prevent the 
  unauthorized transfer of such code outside the United States.
  
  7.  Until the Final Regulations are issued, the Department of 
  State shall continue to have authority to administer the export 
  of encryption products described in section 1 of this memorandum 
  as defense articles designated in Category XIII of the United 
  States Munitions List, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.
  
  8.  Upon enactment of any legislation reauthorizing the 
  administration of export controls, the Secretary of Defense, 
  the Secretary of State, and the Attorney General shall reexamine 
  whether adequate controls on encryption products can be 
  maintained under the provisions of the new statute and advise 
  the Secretary of Commerce of their conclusions as well as any 
  recommendations for action.  If adequate controls on encryption 
  products cannot be maintained under a new statute, then such 
  products shall, where consistent with law, be designated or 
  redesignated as defense articles under 22 U.S.C. 2778(a)(1), 
  to be placed on the United States Munitions List and controlled 
  pursuant to the terms of the Arms Export Control Act and the 
  International Traffic in Arms Regulations.  Any disputes 
  regarding the decision to designate or redesignate shall be 
  resolved by the President.

       ADMINISTRATION OF EXPORT CONTROLS ON ENCRYPTION PRODUCTS
  
  
       By the authority vested in me as President by the 
  Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, 
  including but not limited to the International Emergency 
  Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), and in order to 
  take additional steps with respect to the national emergency 
  described and declared in Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 
  1994, and continued on August 15, 1995, and on August 14, 1996, 
  I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of 
  America, have decided that the provisions set forth below shall 
  apply to administration of the export control system maintained 
  by the Export Administration Regulations, 15 CFR Part 730 
  et seq. ("the EAR").  Accordingly, it is hereby ordered as 
  follows:
  
       Section 1.  Treatment of Encryption Products.  In order 
  to provide for appropriate controls on the export and foreign 
  dissemination of encryption products, export controls of 
  encryption products that are or would be, on this date, 
  designated as defense articles in Category XIII of the 
  United States Munitions List and regulated by the United States 
  Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act, 
  22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq. ("the AECA"), but that subsequently are 
  placed on the Commerce Control List in the EAR, shall be subject 
  to the following conditions:  (a)  I have determined that the 
  export of encryption products described in this section could 
  harm national security and foreign policy interests even where 
  comparable products are or appear to be available from sources 
  outside the United States, and that facts and questions 
  concerning the foreign availability of such encryption products 
  cannot be made subject to public disclosure or judicial review 
  without revealing or implicating classified information that 
  could harm United States national security and foreign policy 
  interests.  Accordingly, sections 4(c) and 6(h)(2)-(4) of 
  the Export Administration Act of 1979 ("the EAA"), 50 U.S.C. 
  App. 2403(c) and 2405(h)(2)-(4), as amended and as continued 
  in effect by Executive Order 12924 of August 19, 1994, and 
  by notices of August 15, 1995, and August 14, 1996, all 
  other analogous provisions of the EAA relating to foreign 
  availability, and the regulations in the EAR relating to such 
  EAA provisions, shall not be applicable with respect to export 
  controls on such encryption products.  Notwithstanding this, 
  the Secretary of Commerce ("Secretary") may, in his discretion, 
  consider the foreign availability of comparable encryption 
  products in determining whether to issue a license in a 
  particular case or to remove controls on particular products, 
  but is not required to issue licenses in particular cases or 
  to remove controls on particular products based on such 
  consideration;
  
       (b)  Executive Order 12981, as amended by Executive 
  Order 13020 of October 12, 1996, is further amended as follows:
  
       (1)  A new section 6 is added to read as follows:  
  "Sec. 6.  Encryption Products.  In conducting the license 
  review described in section 1 above, with respect to export 
  controls of encryption products that are or would be, on 
  November 15, 1996, designated as defense articles in Category

       	    	      	   	     	       	    (OVER)

                                  2
  
  XIII of the United States Munitions List and regulated by the 
  United States Department of State pursuant to the Arms Export 
  Control Act, 22 U.S.C. 2778 et seq., but that subsequently are 
  placed on the Commerce Control List in the Export Administration 
  Regulations, the Departments of State, Defense, Energy, and 
  Justice and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency shall have 
  the opportunity to review any export license application 
  submitted to the Department of Commerce.  The Department of 
  Justice shall, with respect to such encryption products, be a 
  voting member of the Export Administration Review Board 
  described in section 5(a)(1) of this order and of the Advisory 
  Committee on Export Policy described in section 5(a)(2) of this 
  order.  The Department of Justice shall be a full member of the 
  Operating Committee of the ACEP described in section 5(a)(3) of 
  this order, and of any other committees and consultation groups 
  reviewing export controls with respect to such encryption 
  products."
  
       (2)  Sections 6 and 7 of Executive Order 12981 of 
  December 5, 1995, are renumbered as new sections 7 and 8, 
  respectively.
  
       (c)  Because the export of encryption software, like the 
  export of other encryption products described in this section, 
  must be controlled because of such software's functional 
  capacity, rather than because of any possible informational 
  value of such software, such software shall not be considered 
  or treated as "technology," as that term is defined in 
  section 16 of the EAA (50 U.S.C. App. 2415) and in the EAR 
  (61 Fed. Reg. 12714, March 25, 1996);
  
       (d)  With respect to encryption products described in this 
  section, the Secretary shall take such actions, including the 
  promulgation of rules, regulations, and amendments thereto, as 
  may be necessary to control the export of assistance (including 
  training) to foreign persons in the same manner and to the same 
  extent as the export of such assistance is controlled under the 
  AECA, as amended by section 151 of Public Law 104-164;
  
       (e)  Appropriate controls on the export and foreign 
  dissemination of encryption products described in this section 
  may include, but are not limited to, measures that promote the 
  use of strong encryption products and the development of a key 
  recovery management infrastructure; and
  
       (f)  Regulation of encryption products described in this 
  section shall be subject to such further conditions as the 
  President may direct.
  
       Sec. 2.  Effective Date.  The provisions described in 
  section 1 shall take effect as soon as any encryption products 
  described in section 1 are placed on the Commerce Control List 
  in the EAR.
  
       Sec. 3.  Judicial Review.  This order is intended only to 
  improve the internal management of the executive branch and to 
  ensure the implementation of appropriate controls on the export 
  and foreign dissemination of encryption products.  It is not 
  intended to, and does not, create any rights to administrative 
  or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust 
  responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable 
  by a party against the United States, its agencies or 
  instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other 
  person.

<P><CENTER><B>VICE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCES SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY<BR>
President Signs Executive Order Transferring Jurisdiction of Encryption
Technology</B></CENTER>

<P>WASHINGTON -- Vice President Gore today (11/15) announced that President
Clinton has taken two significant actions to implement the encryption export
liberalization plan announced in October.<BR>
<BR>

First, President Clinton has signed an executive order directing the transfer
of jurisdiction for the export control of commercial encryption products
from the State Department to the Commerce Department. Second, President
Clinton has designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography.<BR>
<BR>

&quot;We are moving forward to implement the encryption export liberalization
plan that I announced in October,&quot; said Vice President Gore. &quot;These
two actions will help to promote the growth of international electronic
commerce and robust secure global communications in a manner that protects
the public safety and our national security.&quot;<BR>
<BR>

On October 1, 1996, Vice President Gore announced an Administration plan
to make it easier for Americans to use stronger encryption products -- whether
at home or abroad -- to protect their privacy, intellectual property and
other valuable information. The plan comprises a comprehensive set of actions
to promote the development of key recovery products and an encryption key
management infrastructure. Specifically, it allows the export of 56-bit
key length encryption products under a general license contingent upon industry
commitments to build and market future products that support key recovery.
It also called for transferring jurisdiction for controlling the export
of commercial encryption technology from the State Department to the Commerce
Department.<BR>
<BR>

Key recovery presumes that a trusted party (such as a bank or, in some cases,
a party internal to the user's organization) could recover a confidentiality
key to the encrypted data for the user or for law enforcement officials
acting under proper court authority.<BR>
<BR>

The Executive Order, &quot;Administration of Export Control on Encryption
Products,&quot; and a Presidential Memorandum on Encryption Export Policy,
signed by President Clinton today, directs the transfer of jurisdiction
for the export control of commercial encryption products from the State
Department to the Commerce Department. The transfer becomes effective upon
promulgation of regulations by the Commerce Department, expected before
the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>

This action subjects licensing application decisions to strict time lines
for governmental response, while providing for interagency consultation
on those decisions. Under the executive order, concerned agencies will have
the opportunity to participate in Commerce Department licensing decisions.
No agency will have a veto over decisions to export encryption products.
The computer and communications industries have called for the jurisdiction
transfer, and it was recommended in the recent report of the National Research
Council.<BR>
<BR>

Vice President Gore also announced today that President Clinton has designated
Ambassador David L. Aaron as Special Envoy for Cryptography, with the responsibility
to promote the growth of international electronic commerce and robust, secure
global communications in a manner that protects the public safety and national
security.<BR>
<BR>

Ambassador Aaron will carry out his responsibilities as Special Envoy while
retaining his position as the United States Permanent Representative to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in Paris.
As Special Envoy, Ambassador Aaron will promote international cooperation,
coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governments on encryption matters
and provide a focal point for identifying and resolving bilateral and multilateral
encryption issues.<BR>
<BR>

Ambassador Aaron has served in both government and the private sector. He
has been a member of the boards of several major private sector organizations,
and served as Deputy National Security Adviser to President Jimmy Carter.
He has been the Permanent Representative at the OECD since 1993.<BR>

 A graduate of Occidental College and Princeton University, he entered the
Foreign Service in 1962, where he had a variety of posts including NATO
and the strategic arms limitations talks.  After leaving the Foreign Service,
he continued in government in several positions, including Legislative Assistant
to Senator Walter E. Mondale and Deputy National Security to President Jimmy
Carter.  In the latter capacity he served as a confidential Presidential
emmissary to Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Asia. 
He was awarded the National Defense Medal in 1981.<BR>
<BR>

Upon leaving government, Mr. Aaron became Vice President for Mergers and
Acquisitions at Oppenheimer and Company, a member of the board of Oppenheimer
International, and subsequently a member of the board of Oppenheimer's Quest
for Value Dual Purpose Fund.<BR>
<BR>

(1) PRESIDENT TAKES FIRST STEPS TOWARDS CLIPPER 3.1.1

In a move that leaves major unanswered questions about the privacy of global
communications on the Internet,  President Clinton has taken the first
concrete steps towards implementing the government's controversial key
recovery encryption proposal.  On Friday November 15, the President appointed
an ambassador-level "Special Envoy for Cryptography" and signed an Executive
Order that gives the Commerce Department jurisdiction over encryption exports
but includes the Justice Department in all such export decisions.  These
developments do little to change the underlying regulations on encryption 
that have prevented the development of a strong worldwide encryption standard
needed to protect privacy and security on the Internet.

The full text of the executive order and other relevant background materials
are available on CDT's Encryption Policy Page: 

     http://www.cdt.org/crypto/

Friday's White House announcements demonstrate the Administration's 
commitment to its dangerous key recovery approach to worldwide encryption. 
This approach fails to meet the fundamental privacy needs of computer users
and industry because: 

*  International communications are still vulnerable since products sold 
   by the dominant U.S. hardware and software manufacturers must conform 
   to U.S. export controls.

*  Key recovery won't protect privacy internationally and institutionalizes
   a global government surveillance mechanism without privacy safeguards.

*  U.S. exports are still controlled and uncompetitive making it harder for
   the market to develop a secure global encryption standard.

The Administration policy, initially announced on October 1st and dubbed 
"Clipper 3.1.1," leaves Internet users without the technical means to secure
their communications or the international legal standards needed to protect
their privacy.

In other developments this week, Hewlett-Packard and other companies announced
preliminary approval to export new "dormant encryption" products, which
contain strong encryption that can only be activated with a special license. 
While this new architecture is expected to make it easier for industry to
market encryption products, this technology does not change the underlying
privacy problems created by the Administration's export control policy.
Granting of licenses to use strong encryption will still be subject to the
current export controls limiting key length and requiring key recovery for
strong encryption.

CONTINUING A DANGEROUS KEY RECOVERY POLICY 

The Administration's announcements mark the first real steps towards 
implementing an approach to encryption policy based on the dangerous and
untested idea of global key recovery.  This approach would institutionalize
worldwide governmental access to encrypted communications without providing
any privacy standards for electronic communications or stored data.

The Administration's approach leaves computer users at risk operating on a
global network without the technical security provided by strong encryption 
or the legal privacy rights afforded here in the United States by the Fourth
Amendment and federal law.  For example, the Administration policy would not
solve the following privacy problems:

*  International communications are still vulnerable.  For example, an
   American individual doing business with someone in France would still 
   be forced to use weaker forms of encryption, or use key recovery systems 
   that make their communications accessible to law enforcement officials of 
   both countries.

*  Key recovery won't protect privacy internationally.  A Chinese dissident 
   communicating with supporters in the U.S. and fearful of weaker encryption
   would be to forced to use key recovery. The Administration indicates that 
   such key recovery mechanisms would be based on bilateral key-access 
   arrangements between governments. Even if the dissidents keys were 
   recoverable only in the U.S., such a global key access policy would 
   almost certainly make those keys accessible to the Chinese government. If
   the United States expects China to assist U.S. law enforcement with key 
   recovery for issues of national interest, such as anti-piracy efforts in 
   China, we can also expect China to require U.S. disclosure of keys to its 
   law enforcement community.

*  Exports are still controlled and uncompetitive.  A Japanese company using
   exportable U.S. encryption products would be forced to use lower strength
   encryption -- or use an key recovery agent approved by the U.S. law 
   enforcement community. This is unlikely to help the global market develop
   a worldwide standard for secure communications.

As a result of this policy, computer users all over the world will be left 
with a lowest common denominator infrastructure that does not provide for
either technical security or legal privacy for sensitive communications and
data. CDT believes that any workable U.S. encryption policy must be designed
to protect the privacy and security of Internet users.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) DETAILS OF THE EXECUTIVE ORDER

The Executive Order signed by the President on Friday does not change the 
type of encryption products that will be exportable. Rather, it lays the
groundwork for the eventual transfer of encryption export control 
jurisdiction from the State Department to the Commerce Department pending
Final Regulations by both departments. 

Encryption exports have traditionally been regulated as "munitions" 
controlled by the State Department. While the Commerce Department is widely
viewed as more sensitive to the needs of business and individual encryption
users, Commerce is still constrained by Administration encryption policy. 
Additional provisions of the Executive Order indicate that the Commerce
Department's encryption controls will continue to be dominated by law
enforcement and national security interests:

*  New Justice Department role in export review committee -- In an unusual 
   step, the Order adds the Justice Department to the interagency group 
   reviewing Commerce encryption export decisions.

*  Source code treated as a "product" -- The Order specifically singles out 
   encryption source code to be given the stricter review scrutiny of a 
   "product" rather than a "technology."

*  Broad definition of export -- The export of encryption source code or 
   object code is extended to explicitly include posting to FTP sites or 
   electronic bulletin boards unless "adequate" precautions are taken to 
   prevent transfer abroad. As reflected by a recent Federal Court finding 
   in the CDA indecency case that Internet users rarely have control over 
   the parties accessing materials via FTP, Usenet, or the Web, this 
   provision could have the chilling effect of preventing most 
   dissemination or discussion of new cryptographic tools on the Internet.

The Administration's announcements will have little effect on the existing
encryption privacy problem unless the underlying policies governing the 
export and use of encryption are changed. These announcements do little to
address the unanswered questions about how privacy will be protected in the
key recovery system envisioned by the Administration.

APPOINTMENT OF THE "SPECIAL ENVOY FOR CRYPTOGRAPHY"

On Friday the President also designated Ambassador David L. Aaron as the 
new "Special Envoy for Cryptography."  According to the White House, this
Special Envoy will have "responsibility to promote the growth of electronic
commerce and robust, secure global communications in a manner that protects
the public safety and national security. . . . Ambassador Aaron will promote
international cooperation, coordinate U.S. contacts with foreign governments
on encryption matters and provide a focal point for identifying and resolving
bilateral and multilateral encryption issues."  Ambassador Aaron is currently
the U.S. Ambassador to the OECD.

CDT hopes that the new Special Envoy, as a representative of the United 
States, will work to represent the needs of Americans to communicate 
privately in the currently insecure global environment.  Until now, U.S.
encryption representation abroad has been dominated by law enforcement and
national security interests. CDT hopes that the new Special Envoy will also
consult with the computer user community, consumers, privacy advocates, and
industry to promote their need for secure networks worldwide.

NEXT STEPS

In the coming months, both the Department of Commerce and the State 
Department must issue rules to implement the Administration's new encryption
policy.

*  The State Department will issue a rule transferring its jurisdiction of 
   encryption licensing  to the Commerce Department. 

*  The Commerce Department will issue rules spelling out exactly how it will 
   approve products for export, and what the requirements for approved key 
   recovery centers and key recovery plans will look like.  

CDT hopes and expects that the Administration will provide an opportunity 
for public comment in the rulemaking process to allow input from those
concerned about privacy and security in the formulation of U.S. encryption
policy.

<P>The Honorable Michael Kantor<BR>
Secretary<BR>
Department of Commerce<BR>
Washington, D.C. 20230</P>

<P>Dear Secretary:</P>

<P>We write to express our serious concerns about the Administration's
most recent policy announcement on export restrictions on encryption technology.</P>

<P>First we agree with the October 4, 1996, New York Times editorial that
characterized the Administration's plan as &quot;needlessly restrictive
and probably unworkable&quot; and (though better than previous Administration
proposal) &quot;risks doing more harm than good.&quot; We recognize that
this issue involves a careful balancing of commercial, consumer, law enforcement
and national security considerations. However, the well-respected 1996
report by the National Research Council on this matter emphasized that
U.S. law enforcement and national security would be enhanced -- not weakened
-- by broader use of stronger U.S. encryption technologies both at home
and abroad. Furthermore, the report stressed that efforts to control international
trade in encryption technologies will only be effective if implemented
on a comprehensive, multilateral basis.</P>

<P>Unfortunately, the Administration's most recent encryption initiative
shortchanges both U.S. business and law enforcement interests. The proposal
is flawed for four reasons: it fails to recognize that top-down, government-imposed
policies are doomed to defeat: export policies must be directly linked,
or indexed, to advances in technology; export controls must be fully multilateral
in order to be effective; and export control decisions will be further
delayed by granting the FBI new veto authority over U.S. exports.</P>

<P>We fear these defects will continue to leave U.S. companies at a disadvantage
in the world market, leave users of U.S. encryption uncertain about the
security of their information and leave U.S. law enforcement and national
security agencies behind the cryptography-curve.</P>

<P>Although we were not consulted in the formulation of this policy, we
nevertheless hope that in the coming months you will work with us and industry,
consumer and user groups to refine it further. In addition to conducting
oversight hearing in the next Congress on the Administration's proposal,
we also want to assure you that we will continue to pursue legislative
solutions toward this end.</P>

(1) END OF SESSION WRAP-UP OF CRYPTO POLICY REFORM EFFORTS

In two letters released this week, Members of Congress have promised to
renew their efforts to reform US encryption policy when Congress returns in
January. An open letter to the Internet Community from Senator Conrad Burns
(R-MT), along with a letter from 20 Republican and Democratic members of
both the House and Senate sent to Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor on
October 15, are attached below.

The letters cap off an active year in which the Internet community made
real progress towards reforming US encryption policy to promote privacy and
security on the Internet. While the Administration continues to promote key
escrow and export controls, a growing segment of Congress has recognized
the importance of encryption policy reform to the viability of the Internet
and the future of privacy in the information age.  This growing bi-partisan
support, along with an increasingly mobilized Net community, has resulted
in several significant accomplishments:

* Three bills designed to promote privacy and security on the Internet
  were introduced in the House and Senate:

  - The Burns/Leahy "Encrypted Communications Privacy Act" (S. 1587)
  - The Goodlatte/Eshoo "Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE)
    Act" (HR 3011), and
  - The Burns/Leahy/Pressler "Promotion of Commerce Online in the
    Digital Era (Pro-CODE) Act" (S. 1726).

  The bills, which would have relaxed export controls on encryption
  technology and prevented the government from imposing "key-escrow"
  schemes domestically, enjoyed broad bi-partisan support.

* Congress held four hearings on encryption reform legislation, and
  heard testimony from privacy advocates, cryptographers, computer
  industry leaders, and others.  These hearings provided a critical
  opportunity for the Internet community to make its case on the need
  for encryption policy reform.

* Through online forums and the first ever cybercasts of Congressional
  encryption hearings, the voice of the Internet user community is
  finally beginning to be heard in Congress, and is helping to educate
  the Congress about the importance of encryption.

* The Adopt your Legislator Campaign (http://www.crypto.com/) is linking
  Netizens with members of Congress to create a dialogue about the
  encryption issue.

* Nearly 9000 Netizens have signed the online petition
  (http://www.crypto.com/petition) in support of encryption policy
  reform.

* Leaders from the computer and communications industry joined with
  members of Congress, public interest organizations from across the
  political specturm, and the Internet community in Stanford California
  on July 1 to raise awareness about the need for encryption policy
  reform.

* Other developments include progress on three ongoing legal challenges to
the encryption export controls, efforts by privacy advocates to impact the
encryption debate in the international encryption policies through the
OECD, and the long awaited National Research Council Report which
criticized current US encryption policy as "failing to meet the needs of an
information age society."

Despite these accomplishments, supporters of encryption policy reform still
have a long way to go. In late October, the Clinton Administration
announced yet another encryption policy initiative relying on export
controls and "key-recovery" systems. As the Administration continues to
push its plans to satisfy law enforcement concerns, the Internet community
must be ready to work hard to protect privacy and security on the Internet.
Fortunately, as a result of our efforts this year, we have strong and
supportive allies in Congress.

When Congress returns in January, expect a renewed effort to enact serious
encryption policy reform legislation.  With your help, we can ensure that
the Internet develops into a secure platform for free expression, commerce,
and privacy.

WHAT YOU CAN DO NOW:

Congress and the Administration are now focused on the elections.  Help
raise the voice of the Internet community and educate our elected officials
about the importance of privacy and security on the Internet.

* ADOPT YOUR LEGISLATOR - Join an innovative online campaign designed to
  help Netizens create an ongoing dialogue with their elected officials
  on critical Internet policy issues like encryption policy reform

  http://www.crypto.com/adopt/adopt.cgi?genre=crypto

* SIGN THE PETITION - Add your name to the online petition and join the
  fight for privacy and security on the Internet.  Nearly 9000 Netizens
  have signed on so far.

(2) AN OPEN LETTER TO THE INTERNET COMMUNITY FROM SENATOR BURNS

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT), who along with Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT)
led the fight this year for the Pro-CODE bill, asked us to forward the
following letter to the Internet community:

 X-POP3-Rcpt: jseiger@mailserver
 From: Conrad_Burns@burns.senate.gov
 Date: Fri, 18 Oct 96 17:49:32 EST
 To: jseiger@cdt.org
 Subject: To Interested Members of the Internet Community:

     I am writing to thank you for all your help and support of my
     effort this year to pass legislation to enhance privacy and
     security on the Internet.

     As you all know by now, the 104th Congress adjourned before it had
     a chance to act on S. 1726, the Promotion of Commerce Online in the
     Digital  Era Act of 1996.  The bill, which was co-sponsored by
     Senators Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott (R-MS), Wyden (D-OR)
     and many other Senators from both parties, would have encouraged
     the widespread availability of strong, easy to use privacy and
     security tools for Internet Users.

     Although the Senate was not able to act on Pro-CODE this year, our
     efforts have laid the groundwork for real reform of US encryption
     policy in the 105th Congress.  And despite significant opposition
     from the administration, Netizens had a significant impact on the
     Congressional debate on the encryption issue.  I am honored to have
     helped to arrange the first ever Cybercasts of Congressional
     hearings, and I enjoyed the many online discussions I had with
     Netizens.  Together, we have helped to show the Congress that the
     Internet user community can and should have a voice in debates over
     critical Internet policy issues.

     Finally, just days before adjournment, the Administration announced
     yet another encryption policy initiative.  The proposal continues
     to insist on key escrow as a condition for lifting encryption
     export controls, and raises numerous questions about privacy and
     competitiveness.

     This debate is not over by any stretch of the imagination.  I
     intend to move forward on pro-encryption legislation soon after the
     105th Congress begins in January.

     You can find out more about this issue by visiting my web site
     (http://www.senate.gov/~burns). You can also visit the Encryption
     Policy Resource Page (http://www.crypto.com/) and the Internet
     Policy Coalition page (http://www.privacy.org/ipc/). Set up by
     experts to provide resources on the encryption policy debate, these
     sites also contain information on how you can get more involved.

     Thanks again for all your support. Next year, with your help, we
     can reach a commonsense solution to the critical policy crisis on
     encryption.

     Sincerely,

     U. S. Senator Conrad Burns

(3) BI-PARTISAN GROUP OF 21 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT
    ADMINISTRATION'S LATEST ENCRYPTION INITIATIVE

Last week, a bi-partisan group of 21 members from both houses of Congress
sent the attached letter to Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor expressing
their concerns about the Administration's latest encryption policy
initiative (see http://www.cdt.org/crypto for details).

The members, many of whom were co-sponsors of the Burns/Leahy Promotion of
Commerce Online in the Digital Era "Pro-CODE" Act (S. 1726) or the
Goodlatte/Eshoo Security and Freedom through Encryption "SAFE" Act (HR.
3011), called the latest administration effort "flawed" and pledged to
continue to pursue legislation to reform US encryption policy.

(1) FBI Director to Testify at Senate Crypto Hearing; Netizens can 
    Participate in Hearing Live Online, Submit Testimony for the Record

On Thursday July 25 the Full Senate Commerce Committee will hold a hearing
to consider S. 1726, the 'Pro-CODE' bill designed to relax export controls
on encryption.  FBI Director Louis Freeh and other high-ranking
Administration officials are scheduled to testify. A second panel of
computer industry leaders, including Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale and others,
will also give testimony for the committee.

In an effort to ensure that concerned Internet users can participate in
this important policy debate, the Senate Commerce Committee has arranged
with CDT, VTW, HotWired, and DIGEX to bring the hearing live online.
Netizens will also be able to submit testimony for the record.  Details on
the cybercast can be found below, or by visiting:

      <A HREF="http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/">http://www.crypto.com/events/072596/</A>

This full committee hearing represents another important step forward
towards passage of legislation designed to make encryption more widely
available to computer users.

Sponsored by Sen. Conrad Burns (R-MT), Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Senate 
Commerce Committee Chairman Larry Pressler (R-SD), Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), 
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-MS), Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and 
others, the Pro-CODE bill is designed to encourage the widespread 
availability of strong privacy and security technologies for the Internet.
The bill was the subject of two hearings held on June 12 and June 26 before
the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Space, and Technology.  The 
June 26th hearing was the first Congressional hearing ever to be cybercast
live on the Internet. (Details about that cybercast can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.crypto.com/events/062696/">http://www.crypto.com/events/062696/</A>).

From: Philip Zimmermann

<STRONG>Testimony of Philip R. Zimmermann to
the Subcommittee on Science, Technology, and Space
of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation
26 June 1996
</STRONG>
Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, my name is Philip 
Zimmermann, and I'm Chairman and Chief Technology Officer for PGP 
Inc, a newly-formed company that provides cryptographic products.  
I'm here to talk to you today about S.1726 and the need to change 
US export control policy for cryptographic software.  I want to 
thank you for the opportunity to be here to speak in favor of this 
bill.

I'm the creator of PGP (Pretty Good Privacy), a public-key 
encryption software package for the protection of electronic mail.  
Since PGP was published domestically as freeware in June of 1991, 
it has spread organically all over the world, and has since become 
the de facto worldwide standard for encryption of E-mail, winning 
numerous industry awards along the way.  For three years I was the 
target of a criminal investigation by the US Customs Service, who 
assumed that laws were broken when PGP spread outside the US.  
That investigation was closed without indictment in January 1996.

Computers were developed in secret back in World War II mainly to 
break codes.  Ordinary people did not have access to computers, 
because they were few in number and too expensive.  Some people 
postulated that there would never be a need for more than half a 
dozen computers in the country, and assumed that ordinary people 
would never have a need for computers.  Some of the government's 
attitude toward cryptography today were formed in that period, and 
mirrors the old attitudes toward computers.  Why would ordinary 
people need to have access to good cryptography?

In addition to the limited availability of computers, another 
problem with cryptography in those days was that cryptographic 
keys had to be distributed over secure channels so that both 
parties could send encrypted traffic over insecure channels. 
Governments solved that problem by dispatching key couriers with 
satchels handcuffed to their wrists.  Governments could afford to 
send guys like these to their embassies overseas.  But the great 
masses of ordinary people would never have access to practical 
cryptography if keys had to be distributed this way.  No matter 
how cheap and powerful personal computers might someday become, 
you just can't send the keys electronically without the risk of 
interception. This widened the feasibility gap between government 
and personal access to cryptography.

Today, we live in a new world that has had two major breakthroughs 
that have an impact on this state of affairs.  The first is the 
coming of the personal computer and the information age.  The 
second breakthrough is public-key cryptography. 

With the first breakthrough comes cheap ubiquitous personal 
computers, modems, FAX machines, the Internet, E-mail, the World-
Wide Web, digital cellular phones, personal digital assistants 
(PDAs), wireless digital networks, ISDN, cable TV, and the data 
superhighway.  This information revolution is catalyzing the 
emergence of a global economy.

But this renaissance in electronic digital communication brings 
with it a disturbing erosion of our privacy.  In the past, if the 
government wanted to violate the privacy of ordinary citizens, it 
had to expend a certain amount of effort to intercept and steam 
open and read paper mail, and listen to and possibly transcribe 
spoken telephone conversation.  This is analogous to catching fish 
with a hook and a line, one fish at a time.  Fortunately for 
freedom and democracy, this kind of labor-intensive monitoring is 
not practical on a large scale.

Today, electronic mail is gradually replacing conventional paper 
mail, and is soon to be the norm for everyone, not the novelty it 
is today.  Unlike paper mail, E-mail messages are just too easy to 
intercept and scan for interesting keywords.  This can be done 
easily, routinely, automatically, and undetectably on a grand 
scale. This is analogous to driftnet fishing-- making a 
quantitative and qualitative Orwellian difference to the health of 
democracy.

The second breakthrough came in the late 1970s, with the 
mathematics of public key cryptography.  This allows people to 
communicate securely and conveniently with people they've never 
met, with no prior exchange of keys over secure channels.  No more 
special key couriers with black bags.  This, coupled with the 
trappings of the information age, means the great masses of people 
can at last use cryptography.  This new technology also provides 
digital signatures to authenticate transactions and messages, and 
allows for digital money, with all the implications that has for 
an electronic digital economy.  (See appendix)

This convergence of technology-- cheap ubiquitous PCs, modems, 
FAX, digital phones, information superhighways, et cetera-- is all 
part of the information revolution.  Encryption is just simple 
arithmetic to all this digital hardware.  All these devices will 
be using encryption.  The rest of the world uses it, and they 
laugh at the US because we are railing against nature, trying to 
stop it.  Trying to stop this is like trying to legislate the 
tides and the weather. It's like the buggy whip manufacturers 
trying to stop the cars-- even with the NSA and the FBI on their 
side, it's still impossible.  The information revolution is good 
for democracy-- good for a free market and trade. It contributed 
to the fall of the Soviet empire.  They couldn't stop it either.

Today, every off-the-shelf multimedia PC can become a secure voice 
telephone, through the use of freely available software such as 
PGPfone.  When you combine that with the strong political will 
that exists in the American people to have their privacy, it's 
going to require extreme measures to control this technology.  
What does this mean for the government's Clipper chip and key 
escrow systems?

Like every new technology, this comes at some cost.  Cars pollute 
the air and cause traffic jams.  Cryptography can help criminals 
hide their activities.  People in the law enforcement and 
intelligence communities are going to look at this only in their 
own terms.  But even with these costs, we still can't stop this 
from happening in a free market global economy.  Most people I 
talk to outside of government feel that the net result of 
providing privacy will be positive.

Law enforcement and intelligence interests in the government have 
attempted many times to suppress the availability of strong 
domestic encryption technology.  

In 1991, Senate Bill 266 included a non-binding resolution, which 
if it had become real law, would have forced manufacturers of 
secure communications equipment to insert special &quot;trap doors&quot; in 
their products, so that the government could read anyone's 
encrypted messages.  Before that measure was defeated, I wrote and 
released Pretty Good Privacy.  I did it because I wanted 
cryptography to be made available to the American public before it 
became illegal to use it.  I gave it away for free so that it 
would achieve wide dispersal, to inoculate the body politic.

The 1994 Digital Telephony bill mandated that phone companies 
install remote wiretapping ports into their central office digital 
switches, creating a new technology infrastructure for &quot;point-and-
click&quot; wiretapping, so that federal agents no longer have to go 
out and attach alligator clips to phone lines.  Now they'll be 
able to sit in their headquarters in Washington and listen in to 
your phone calls.  Of course, the law still requires a court order 
for a wiretap.  But while technology infrastructures tend to 
persist for generations, laws and policies can change overnight.  
Once a communications infrastructure optimized for surveillance 
becomes entrenched, a shift in political conditions may lead to 
abuse of this new-found power.  Political conditions may shift 
with the election of a new government, or perhaps more abruptly 
from the bombing of a Federal building.

A year after the 1994 Digital Telephony bill passed, the FBI 
disclosed plans to require the phone companies to build into their 
infrastructure the capacity to simultaneously wiretap one percent 
of all phone calls in all major US cities.  This would represent 
more than a thousandfold increase over previous levels in the 
number of phones that could be wiretapped.  In previous years, 
there were only about 1000 court-ordered wiretaps in the US per 
year, at the federal, state, and local levels combined.  It's hard 
to see how the government could even employ enough judges to sign 
enough wiretap orders to wiretap 1% of all our phone calls, much 
less hire enough federal agents to sit and listen to all that 
traffic in real time.  The only plausible way of processing that 
amount of traffic is a massive Orwellian application of automated 
voice recognition technology to sift through it all, searching for 
interesting keywords or searching for a particular speaker's 
voice.  If the government doesn't find the target in the first 1% 
sample, the wiretaps can be shifted over to a different 1% until 
the target is found, or until everyone's phone line has been 
checked for subversive traffic.  The FBI says they need this 
capacity to plan for the future.  This plan sparked such outrage 
that it was defeated in Congress, at least this time around, in 
1995.  But the mere fact that the FBI even asked for these broad 
powers is revealing of their agenda.  And the defeat of this plan 
isn't so reassuring when you consider that the 1994 Digital 
Telephony bill was also defeated the first time it was introduced, 
in 1993.  

Advances in technology will not permit the maintenance of the 
status quo, as far as privacy is concerned.  The status quo is 
unstable.  If we do nothing, new technologies will give the 
government new automatic surveillance capabilities that Stalin 
could never have dreamed of.  The only way to hold the line on 
privacy in the information age is strong cryptography.  
Cryptography strong enough to keep out major governments.

The government has a track record that does not inspire confidence 
that they will never abuse our civil liberties.  The FBI's 
COINTELPRO program targeted groups that opposed government 
policies.  They spied on the anti-war movement and the civil 
rights movement.  They wiretapped Martin Luther King's phone.  
Nixon had his enemies list.  And then there was the Watergate 
mess.  The War on Drugs has given America the world's largest per-
capita incarceration rate in the world, a distinction formerly 
held by South Africa, before we surpassed them during the eighties 
even when apartheid was in full swing.  Recently, we've seen the 
images and sounds of the Rodney King beatings, Detective Mark 
Fuhrman's tapes boasting of police abuses, and the disturbing 
events of the Ruby Ridge case.  And now Congress and the Clinton 
administration seem intent on passing laws curtailing our civil 
liberties on the Internet.  At no time in the past century has 
public distrust of the government been so broadly distributed 
across the political spectrum, as it is today.

The Clinton Administration seems to be attempting to deploy and 
entrench a communications infrastructure that would deny the 
citizenry the ability to protect its privacy.  This is unsettling 
because in a democracy, it is possible for bad people to 
occasionally get elected-- sometimes very bad people.  Normally, a 
well-functioning democracy has ways to remove these people from 
power.  But the wrong technology infrastructure could allow such a 
future government to watch every move anyone makes to oppose it.  
It could very well be the last government we ever elect.

When making public policy decisions about new technologies for the 
government, I think one should ask oneself which technologies 
would best strengthen the hand of a police state.  Then, do not 
allow the government to deploy those technologies.  This is simply 
a matter of good civic hygiene.

In addition to the human rights arguments, there are technological 
reasons why the current export control regime makes no sense 
anymore.

There has been considerable debate about allowing the export of 
implementations of the full 56-bit Data Encryption Standard (DES). 
At an academic cryptography conference in 1993, Michael Wiener of 
Northern Telecom in Ottawa presented a paper on how to crack the 
DES with a special machine.  He has fully designed and tested a 
chip that guesses DES keys at high speed until it finds the right 
one.  Although he has refrained from building the real chips so 
far, he can get these chips manufactured for $10.50 each, and can 
build 57000 of them into a special machine for $1 million that can 
try every DES key in 7 hours, averaging a solution in 3.5 hours.  
$1 million can be hidden in the budget of many companies.  For $10 
million, it takes 21 minutes to crack, and for $100 million, just 
two minutes.  That's full 56-bit DES, cracked in just two minutes.  
I'm sure the NSA can do it in seconds, with their budget.  This 
means that DES is now effectively dead for purposes of serious 
data security applications. If Congress acts now to enable the 
export of full DES products, it will be a day late and a dollar 
short.

Knowledge of cryptography is becoming so widespread, that export 
controls are no longer effective at controlling the spread of this 
technology.  People everywhere can and do write good cryptographic 
software, and we import it here but cannot export it, to the 
detriment of our indigenous software industry.

I wrote PGP from information in the open literature, putting it 
into a convenient package that everyone can use in a desktop or 
palmtop computer.  Then I gave it away for free, for the good of 
democracy.  This could have popped up anywhere, and spread.  Other 
people could have and would have done it.  And are doing it.  
Again and again.  All over the planet.  This technology belongs to 
everybody.

PGP has spread like a prairie fire, fanned by countless people who 
fervently want their privacy restored in the information age.

Today, human rights organizations are using PGP to protect their 
people overseas.  Amnesty International uses it.  The human rights 
group in the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
uses it.  It is used to protect witnesses who report human rights 
abuses in the Balkans, in Burma, in Guatemala, in Tibet.

Some Americans don't understand why I should be this concerned 
about the power of government.  But talking to people in Eastern 
Europe, you don't have to explain it to them.  They already get 
it-- and they don't understand why we don't.

I want to read you a quote from some E-mail I got in October 1993 
from someone in Latvia, on the day that Boris Yeltsin was shelling 
his Parliament building:  

&quot;Phil I wish you to know: let it never be, but if 
dictatorship takes over Russia your PGP is widespread from Baltic 
to Far East now and will help democratic people if necessary.

<STRONG>Appendix -- How Public-Key Cryptography Works </STRONG>

In conventional cryptosystems, such as the US Federal Data 
Encryption Standard (DES), a single key is used for both 
encryption and decryption.  This means that a key must be 
initially transmitted via secure channels so that both parties 
have it before encrypted messages can be sent over insecure 
channels.  This may be inconvenient.  If you have a secure channel 
for exchanging keys, then why do you need cryptography in the 
first place?

In public key cryptosystems, everyone has two related 
complementary keys, a publicly revealed key and a secret key.  
Each key unlocks the code that the other key makes.  Knowing the 
public key does not help you deduce the corresponding secret key.  
The public key can be published and widely disseminated across a 
communications network. This protocol provides privacy without the 
need for the same kind of secure channels that a conventional 
cryptosystem requires.

Anyone can use a recipient's public key to encrypt a message to 
that person, and that recipient uses her own corresponding secret 
key to decrypt that message.  No one but the recipient can decrypt 
it, because no one else has access to that secret key.  Not even 
the person who encrypted the message can decrypt it.  

Message authentication is also provided.  The sender's own secret 
key can be used to encrypt a message, thereby &quot;signing&quot; it.  This 
creates a digital signature of a message, which the recipient (or 
anyone else) can check by using the sender's public key to decrypt 
it.  This proves that the sender was the true originator of the 
message, and that the message has not been subsequently altered by 
anyone else, because the sender alone possesses the secret key 
that made that signature.  Forgery of a signed message is 
infeasible, and the sender cannot later disavow his signature. 

These two processes can be combined to provide both privacy and 
authentication by first signing a message with your own secret 
key, then encrypting the signed message with the recipient's 
public key. The recipient reverses these steps by first decrypting 
the message with her own secret key, then checking the enclosed 
signature with your public key.  These steps are done 
automatically by the recipient's software.

<H3>How Current U.S. Encryption Policy Fails to Meet the Needs of American
Internet Users<BR>
<A NAME="intro"></A><BR>
I. Introduction and Overview</H3>
Good morning, my name is Jerry Berman, Executive Director of the Center
for Democracy and Technology (CDT). The Center is pleased to have this 
opportunity
to testify today. CDT is an independent, non-profit public interest policy
organization in Washington, D.C. The Center's mission is to develop and
implement public policies to protect and advance individual liberties and
democratic values in new digital communications media. The Center achieves
its goals through policy development, public education, and coalition building.
CDT also coordinates the Digital Privacy and Security Working Group (DPSWG),
an ad hoc coalition of more than 50 computer, communications, associations,
and public interest organizations working on communications privacy issues.
In the past, CDT and members of the Working Group have strongly opposed
the Administration's Clipper Chip proposals.<A NAME="overview"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A. Overview: Encryption Policy in the Internet Age</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
With the recent Federal court ruling in Philadelphia enjoining the 
Communications
Decency Act, the remaining major legal obstacle to the development of electronic
commerce is outdated U.S. encryption policies. The Administration's cryptography
policy, based upon a narrow national security perspective that ignores the
privacy needs of individual users, cannot form the sound basis for a secure
communications infrastructure. A cryptography policy without explicit privacy
protections will never gain the trust of users or be embraced by the 
international
marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
In the two years since the Senate last held hearings on encryption policy,
the looming crisis in privacy and security has become more urgent, yet remains
unresolved: 
<OL>
<LI><STRONG>The Internet Perspective</STRONG> -- U.S. encryption policy
has failed to account for the emergence of the Internet as a model for 
communications:<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI><STRONG>The Internet is not like the telephone system</STRONG> --
The Internet encompasses a range of social functions far beyond simple two-way
voice communication. These broad activities demand a heightened capacity
for users to protect their security and privacy online. The traditional
approach to wiretapping cannot simply be exported to this new medium.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>The Internet is a global, decentralized medium</STRONG> --
Efforts to impose unilateral national policies -- such as export controls
or key escrow proposals -- are unlikely to be accepted widely. Decentralized
user choice solutions to privacy problems are preferable to and more effective
than centralized government mandates.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI><STRONG>On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance</STRONG>
-- Constitutional guarantees offer no protection to U.S. citizens whose
communications regularly cross national borders. Policies should be designed
to protect Americans outside of the shelter of U.S. law.<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI><STRONG>Current encryption policy fails to meet users' needs</STRONG>
-- Widely available strong encryption is essential if users are to ever
trust their private and sensitive information to the Global Information
Infrastructure (GII). Yet export controls and other policies have kept good
encryption tools out of the hands of everyday users and capped security
at a 40-bit key length that many experts judge to be &quot;inadequate 
protection.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#foot_1">1</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>Administration encryption policy remains hostage to a law 
enforcement
and national security rationale that is outdated and unsubstantiated</STRONG>
-- National security arguments have been undermined by the increasing 
availability
of strong encryption outside of the United States. The law enforcement problem
posed by encryption is real, but narrowly focused around real-time surveillance
of electronic communications. The massive invasions of privacy and the high
cost of the Administration's export controls and key escrow policies cannot
be justified on these narrow and eroding grounds. 
</OL>
Congressional action is needed. Encryption policy is the weak link creating
a crisis in electronic commerce and individual privacy. Only Congress is
in a position to demand that law enforcement justify its policies. Only
Congress can act quickly to reverse the policies of the Administration.
CDT strongly commends those of you who have supported S.1726, the Protecting
Commerce Online in the Digital Era (PRO-Code) Act of 1996, authored by Senator
Burns, and S.1587, the Encrypted Communications Privacy Act of 1996, authored
by Senator Leahy. The Congress should act to immediately liberalize export
controls and provide American Internet users with the strong security and
privacy they so badly need.<A NAME="user"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>B. Internet User Involvement is Crucial</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
CDT is pleased to be here as part of these important Congressional efforts
to address the crisis that exists today in U.S. encryption policy. The Center
wishes to express its thanks to you, Mr. Chairman, to Senator Pressler,
Senator Wyden, and the other sponsors of S.1726 for your work in support
of Internet privacy and security, and to Senator Leahy, who has been a long-time
supporter of efforts to ease encryption controls. <BR>
<BR>
We are particularly concerned that the voice of Internet users be heard
in this forum. We are pleased to have been a part of the Committee's efforts
to solicit input from everyday computer users for this hearing, via the
World Wide Web. We are also pleased to be working with HotWired and Digex
to make this the first Senate hearing ever simulcast live over the Internet
-- making these proceedings accessible to millions worldwide. We commend
the Committee for reaching out to the growing community of computer users
who care deeply about this issue.<A NAME="pub_policy"></A>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<P>
<H3>II. Communications Privacy in the Age of the Internet: Public Policy
Principles</H3>
For years encryption policy has been driven, substantially unchallenged,
by the needs of the national security establishment. With the arrival of
the personal computer and the Internet, that narrow focus is plainly no
longer acceptable. The policies that may have been appropriate for the Age
of the Mainframe Computer will not meet the needs of individuals and society
in the Age of the Internet. We suggest that any policy that addresses privacy
and security on the Internet should do so in light of the following policy
principles: 
<UL>
<LI>The Internet is not like the telephone system. 
<LI>The Internet is a global medium: Decentralized user choices are preferable
to centralized government mandates. 
<LI>On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a local ordinance.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_2">2</A></SUP>
</UL>
Application of these principles to today's encryption policy logjam leads
to the inescapable conclusion that fundamental change is needed. S.1726
has CDT's full support for its effort to move this policy debate beyond
the Cold War-era Mainframe model, into the Age of the Internet.<A NAME=
"phone"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>A. The Internet Is Not Like The Telephone System<BR>
</STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium
of worldwide human communication.&quot; Court's Findings of Fact, &#182;81,
ALA v. Dept. of Justice<SUP><A HREF="#foot_3">3</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
If there is one truth that policymakers have learned about the Internet
in the last year, it is that the Internet is not just another telephone
system. Current encryption policy is justified, in part, by law enforcement
arguments that they must continue to conduct electronic surveillance in
the same manner as they are able to on the telephone network. But efforts
to simplisticly apply assumptions about wiretapping from the telephone system
to the Internet risk grave threats to individual privacy. In a similar vein,
congressional attempts in the Communications Decency Act to impose content-based
restrictions on speech from the phone system onto the Internet have recently
been harshly rebuffed by the Federal courts.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_4">4</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
From a constitutional privacy perspective, the single most significant 
difference
between the Internet and traditional telephone service is the vast array
of uses that the Internet currently serves, as well the even larger range
of new applications bound to come in the future. The Internet is not simply
a new-fangled digital telephone. Rather, Internet services will likely 
facilitate
the following important social functions now or in the near future: 
<UL>
<LI>wallet 
<LI>first class mail envelope 
<LI>carrier of credit card transaction 
<LI>face-to-face contact with a bank or a merchant 
<LI>public library 
<LI>neighborhood bookstore 
<LI>movie theater 
<LI>doctor's office 
<LI>town square, coffee shop, union hall, political clubhouse, or community
center where we discuss politics 
<LI>local art museum 
<LI>romantic night spot for intimate conversations 
</UL>
The Internet is much more than simply a means of instantaneous communications
like telephone conversations, which are short and largely support other
activities that transpire in the physical world. Instead, the Internet is
itself a platform where all of the activities listed above can take place.
On the Internet, people do business, engage in politics, conduct intimately
private interactions with health care professionals, participate in culture,
and even fall in love. The vast breadth of activities conducted online demand
that individuals have the greatest ability possible to protect their privacy
and ensure their security. These activities also demand greater protection
against government intrusions on individual privacy, free expression, and
freedom of association.<BR>
<BR>
The privacy protections embodied in the U.S. law today are the product of
a long and thorough debate in which the concerns of law enforcement were
aired and carefully weighed against the rights of citizens. Congress should
not allow law enforcement concerns to unravel this delicate balance by imposing
the wiretapping paradigm on this new medium without careful deliberation.<BR>
<A NAME="case"></A>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>Case Study: Application of wiretapping to the virtual corporation
challenges Fourth Amendment principles<BR>
</STRONG><BR>
Wiretapping and other electronic surveillance has always been recognized
as an exception to the fundamental Fourth Amendment prohibition against
secret searches. Even with a valid search warrant, law enforcement agents
must &quot;knock and announce&quot; their intent to search a premises before
proceeding. Failure to do so violates the Fourth Amendment. Until now, the
law of search and seizure has made a sharp distinction between, on the one
hand, seizures of papers and other items in a person's physical possession,
and on the other hand, wiretapping of communications. Seizure of papers
or personal effects must be conducted with the owner's knowledge, upon 
presentation
of a search warrant. Only in the exceptional case of wiretapping -- and
with the heightened procedural and substantive requirements that accompany
a wiretap request -- may a person's privacy be invaded by law enforcement
without simultaneously informing that person. <BR>
<BR>
In the era where people work for &quot;virtual corporations&quot; and conduct
personal and political lives in &quot;cyberspace,&quot; the distinction
between communication of information and storage of information is increasingly
vague. The organization in which one works may constitute a single virtual
space, but be physically dispersed. The papers and files of the organization
or individual may be moved within the organization by means of 
telecommunications
technology. Instantaneous access to encryption keys, without prior notice
to the communicating parties, thus present a much broader intrusion. Such
access may well constitute a secret search, if the target is a virtual 
corporation
or an individual whose &quot;papers&quot; are physically dispersed.<BR>
<A NAME="global"></A>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>
<P><STRONG>B. The Internet Is A Global Medium: Decentralized User Solutions
Are Preferable To Centralized Government Mandates</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
On of the Internet's great strengths is the ease with which it spans the
globe: information flows as effortlessly from New York to Nairobi as from
Washington, DC to West Virginia. Moreover, a communication from New York
to Nairobi might travel through the United Kingdom and four countries one
day, but through France and five other countries the next day. For this
reason, national controls are unlikely to work in a global medium like the
Internet. Privacy solutions should not rely on centralized policies and
control, but instead should be oriented towards the user and robust enough
to exist in the highly decentralized environment that characterizes the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
The rapid pace of Internet development has occurred with some important
government support, but entirely without the interference of the traditional
regulatory process. The flexibility of the Internet community in developing
new solutions to meet user needs has been nothing short of astonishing.
Yet the one area in which the innovative energy of the Internet has been
most stifled has been in the area of security and privacy. Just as we cannot
expect the United States government to have anticipated the architecture
of the World Wide Web, so it is foolhardy to expect that the national security
establishment of the United States can anticipate and provide for the security
needs of all Internet users. S.1726 properly gets the government out of
the business of controlling this vital part of the emerging information
infrastructure. <A NAME="rights"></A><BR>
<BR>
<STRONG>C. On the Internet, the Bill of Rights is a Local Ordinance</STRONG><BR>
<BR>
Both data security solutions against private intrusion and privacy protections
against unwarranted government surveillance must be suited to the global
nature of the Net. Good data security demands strong encryption to foil
threats wherever they are in the world. And good data security and privacy
policies must recognize that the Bill of Rights in the United States 
Constitution
is nothing more than a local law.<BR>
<BR>
United States Constitutional protections against unreasonable search and
seizure offer little protection to U.S. citizens whose Internet communications
regularly cross borders. Foreign governments and others can intercept these
messages without the knowledge of the senders, and beyond the ability of
the United States government to protect the privacy rights of its citizens.
For similar reasons, the key escrow agents called for in recent Administration
policy proposals would create an enormous new vulnerability for Internet
users -- both from private data intruders and from governments which may
not have adequate law enforcement safeguards or may not accord the same
privacy protections to United States citizens.<BR>
<BR>
The global nature of the Internet thus demands that users have access to
the highest quality encryption technology. We strongly agree with the many
individuals, fellow privacy advocates, and industry leaders who praise S.1726's
effort to lift export controls and allow the market to provide the security
and privacy that global Internet users need.<A NAME="locks"></A><BR>

<H3>III. The Need for Locks and Keys on the GII: Users Need Encryption</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;On balance, the advantages of more widespread use of 
cryptography
outweigh the disadvantages.&quot;<SUP><A HREF="#foot_5">5</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
The use of encryption is an inevitable and essential part of life online.
As the National Research Council found in its long-awaited encryption White
Paper, not only do users need encryption, but it is actually in America's
national interest to promote the widespread use of good cryptography.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_6">6</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
A secure, private, and trusted Global Information Infrastructure (GII) is
essential to promote economic growth and meet the needs of Information Age
society. Developing that secure and trusted GII requires strong, flexible,
widely-available cryptography. Individuals need to have confidence in the
GII to realize the full democratic potential of free association and personal
communications. Competitive businesses need to protect proprietary information
as it flows across insecure global communications networks. <BR>
<BR>
In recent months the public has been made increasingly aware of the dangers
of computer crime and the vulnerability of current cryptography implementations.
Rapid advances in the speed and sophistication of hardware and software
have laid siege to the 40-bit key systems currently approved for export,
as well as the popular 56-bit DES algorithm.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_7">7</A></SUP>
If we are to maintain the trust of the public and realize the full potential
of the GII, individual users will need widely available good encryption
to protect themselves online: 
<UL>
<LI>Individuals need encryption in order to trust the GII with confidential
data such as financial transactions, medical records, or private 
communications.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Businesses need encryption to provide individuals with privacy protection
and to protect proprietary information as it flows across vulnerable global
networks. Moreover, businesses need good encryption to protect the growing
stores of personal information that they accumulate about individuals --
such as medical, insurance, credit, or financial records.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_8">8</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI>Government users need encryption. Government itself needs good encryption
to protect sensitive military, law enforcement, financial, or private citizen
information.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_9">9</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI>America needs encryption to promote national security and prevent crime.
The widespread use of strong encryption is widely considered one of our
best defenses in the battle to protect America's information infrastructure
from information warfare and other security threats. It is ironic that the
very players within the Administration who should be promoting the use of
encryption to promote national security and prevent crime online are actively
working to stop it. FBI Director Louis Freeh testified in the Senate this
Spring about the massive losses attributed to industrial espionage in this
country, estimated in the hundreds of billions of dollars. CIA Director
John Deutch has testified just yesterday about the increasing vulnerability
of our financial, utility, government, and telecommunications information
infrastructure to &quot;information terrorists&quot; and other bad actors.
Yet the lack of strong encryption use today has left computer users vulnerable
to the prying eyes of hackers, corporate competitors, and even foreign 
governments.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_10">10</A></SUP>
</UL>
The GII will not fully develop without widely available and strong cryptography.
The lack of any international standard for strong cryptography has already
hindered the deployment of highly secure systems worldwide. Moreover, national
and regional governments are increasingly considering regulations on the
use of encryption. Such actions threaten to create a patchwork of international
regulations which would hinder the deployment of secure global communications
and leave users without the security and privacy they need.<BR>
<BR>
In this context, the sole focus on national security needs embodied in the
Administration's cryptography policies is unlikely to meet the needs of
GII users. By maintaining 40-bit key length restrictions on exports, these
policies leaves users hamstrung with insecure systems. By proposing unattractive
interoperability restrictions and minimal privacy protections for key escrow
systems, these policies discourage the deployment of secure systems in U.S.
products. Rather than being seamlessly incorporated into popular products,
secure communications will remain out of reach for less sophisticated GII
users. The resulting loss of security will have a chilling effect on the
development of electronic commerce and the information infrastructure as
the privacy and security needs of users are not met.<A NAME="naked"></A><BR>

Users' Needs Go Unmet</FONT></STRONG>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Current national policy is not adequate to support the
information security requirements of an information society.&quot;<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_12">12</A></SUP></BLOCKQUOTE>
Current Administration encryption policy has failed to meet the needs of
computer users. Export controls and other government policies keep good
encryption out of the hands of users. These policies act to coerce the domestic
market for encryption. The 40-bit key length encryption available under
these policies is widely viewed by experts as inadequate. Worse, the export
controls are intrusive and ineffective at meeting their stated national
security goals. U.S. encryption policy is in a state of crisis, with users
unable to get the privacy because of unsupportable national security and
law enforcement rationale. Moreover, the Administration's Clipper Chip and
subsequent policy proposals have barely acknowledged privacy concerns in
any meaningful way, and have been greeted with distaste and scorn by the
marketplace and the public.<BR>
<BR>
Current Administration policy restricts the export of &quot;strong&quot;
encryption hardware or software products with keys greater than 40 bits
long (the length of the &quot;keys&quot; indicates the security of a system).
Many experts believe that 40 bit security is woefully inadequate.<SUP><A 
HREF="#foot_13">13</A></SUP>
Export controls actually keep domestic users from getting good encryption.
Most U.S. software and hardware companies have been held hostage as they 
try to make their domestic products interoperable with and subject to the
same restrictions as their exportable products. <STRONG>The result is a
government policy that hurts American businesses and individuals:</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>It hurts individuals</STRONG> by not allowing them to choose
the encryption systems that best meet their security needs. A recent study
by a panel of renowned cryptographers found that the systems currently 
exportable
under government policies &quot;offer virtually no protection from brute-force
attacks.&quot;<A HREF="#foot_14"><SUP>14</SUP></A><BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>It hurts U.S. industry</STRONG> by not allowing companies to
provide secure products in the face of strong foreign competitors who are
not restricted by export controls. A recent report by the CEOs of 13 large
American technology companies concluded that the American computer industry
could lose up to $60 billion annually by the year 2000 due to these export
controls.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_15">15</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
<LI><STRONG>It doesn't even meet the needs of national security.</STRONG>
The Software Publishers Association has documented hundreds of foreign 
encryption
products already widely available abroad. Criminals, terrorists, and foreign
governments will always have access to good encryption; it is law-abiding
citizens who sacrifice their privacy under current law. 
</UL>
Recent Administration proposals would only allow the export of moderately
stronger encryption, and then only with &quot;key escrow&quot; restrictions
to guarantee U.S. government access to individuals' keys -- restrictions
which are bound to fail in the competitive international marketplace. <A
NAME="admin"></A><BR>
<P><CENTER><HR WIDTH="25%"></CENTER>
<P>
<H3>V. Putting the Administration's Arguments in a Box: Law Enforcement
Has Not Made It's Case</H3>
Law enforcement has been unable to justify massive losses of privacy it
proposes in return for minor gains in surveillance capabilities. The law
enforcement problem posed by encryption is real, but narrowly focused around
real-time surveillance of electronic communications. The massive invasion
of privacy and high cost of the Administration export controls and key escrow
cannot be justified by the law enforcement's last, hopeless grasp to expand
their capabilities is an area where those capabilities are already largely
gone.<BR>
<BR>
Law enforcement faces a real, but narrowly focused, problem with encryption.
The vast majority of encrypted information will be accessible to law enforcement
by legal process. Stored information, corporate and business information,
and even much electronic communication will be largely available to law
enforcement through similar legal process available today (See Figure 1
below): 
<OL>
<LI>Stored business information -- Stored corporate records and business
information, encrypted for security and privacy purposes, represents a large
part of the use of encryption and will be almost completely accessible to
law enforcement using the same sorts of court orders, warrants, and even
subpoena processes that are available today to access similar unencrypted
data.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Stored information by individuals -- Will be similarly available by
legal process, just as it is today. In certain narrow circumstances, access
to encrypted information may be thwarted by assertion of a Fifth Amendment
privilege against self-incrimination.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Business communications -- Business communications will be largely 
accessible
to law enforcement. Today, electronic communications almost always become
stored information at one end or the other, and often both, and often as
plaintext. (For example, consider the instructive example of the archived
email in the Bush Administration). Such stored information will be readily
available to law enforcement as noted above. Thus, most communications will
be accessible --<BR>
<BR>
  <UL>
  <LI>As data stored, often in plaintext, by communicating parties and available
via court order;<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Through stored decryption keys available via court order; or<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>Through other kinds of authorized surveillance.<BR>
<BR>
  </UL>
<LI>Individual communications -- Similarly to business communications, the
bulk of individual communications will be accessible to law enforcement
through legal process in some manner. Fifth Amendment privileges for individuals
may protect some of these communications. 
</OL>
The remaining problem for law enforcement can be narrowed to the real-time
interception of communications without any notice to the party under 
surveillance.
While this represents a problem for law enforcement, it is a narrow problem.
There are currently only on the order of 1100 wiretaps conducted by law
enforcement in the U.S. each year.<SUP><A HREF="#foot_16">16</A></SUP><BR>
<BR>
The widespread use of compression algorithms, a vast array of text, audio,
and video applications, and even 40-bit encryption have already made real-time
electronic interception dramatically more difficult. The widespread use
of strong encryption by our more sophisticated national enemies makes many
of those interceptions impossible. The days of a vast positive signals 
intelligence
operation are numbered, with or without U.S. export controls. We must find
ways to help law enforcement and national security to adjust to this new
world, without limiting effective privacy for individuals and businesses
on the GII.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the information economy presents new and powerful tools and 
opportunities
for law enforcement. Online interaction leaves a detailed trail of electronic
transactions, credit card purchases, online communications, and Web-based
clickstream data presenting new traffic analysis opportunities. This information
offers law enforcement unprecedented new tools to obtain evidence of criminal
activity. The balance of power in an online world is tilting further towards
law enforcement and away from individual liberty. Encryption may represent
one of the rare opportunities to reclaim individual liberty in the face
of the steady erosion of privacy and individual autonomy brought on by 
technology
and the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
The federal government is granted the ability to monitor a specific telephone
line. It has never been prospectively guaranteed the ability to intercept
all communications of all individuals, and understand them. Wiretap targets
have always been able to use other phones, or speak in unintelligible code.
More importantly, the ability to hear a specific phone conversation is not
nearly as invasive as the ability to intercept, without notice or consent,
the full panoply of life online including health records, financial 
transactions,
online entertainment, intimate letters and conversations. Law enforcement
has been unable to justify this new, unwarranted expansion of surveillance
capabilities sought through the control of encryption technologies.<BR>

<H3>VI. Conclusion</H3>
Current U.S. encryption policy fails to recognize the needs of users and
the changes brought on by the Internet Age. The Internet is not like a phone
system, so the extension of wiretapping authority to the Internet is 
inappropriate.
The Internet is a global medium, so centralized control schemes like current
U.S. encryption policy are likely to be ineffective. And the Internet makes
U.S. Constitutional protections a local ordinance, so U.S. encryption policy
should seek to guarantee the privacy and liberty of Americans in their 
communications
outside of the United States. <BR>
<BR>
In the current policy standoff between eroding law enforcement arguments
and the emerging and acute privacy and security needs of the Information
Age, Congressional action is needed. Only Congress is in the position today
to change U.S. encryption policy and get Americans the privacy and security
tools they need. The private sector cannot do it. The Administration will
not do it. The courts may do it, but not without a protracted struggle.
Congress must act. CDT supports the legislative approaches embodied in S.1726,
S.1587, and H.R. 3011. The Congress should act to immediately liberalize
export controls and provide Americans on the Internet with the strong security
and privacy they so badly need.<A NAME="footnotes"></A><BR>

<BR>
JUNE 26, 1996</CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Thank you for the opportunity to speak with you about the technical impact
of encryption policy.  It is a privilege to be here, and I hope my perspective
will be useful to you.<BR>
<BR>
Let me begin by describing my own background and biases.  I am a Principal
Research Scientist in the area of computer security and cryptology at AT&amp;T
Research in Murray Hill, New Jersey.  I also hold a number of ancillary
appointments related to computer security; among others, I teach an occasional
graduate course in the subject at Columbia University, and I serve as co-chair
of the Federal Networking Council Advisory Committee subcommittee on security
and privacy (which advises Federal agencies on computer networking issues).
 However, the views I am presenting here today are my own, and should not
be taken to represent those of any organization with which I happen to be
affiliated.<BR>
<BR>
I am a computer scientist by training; my Ph.D. is from the Princeton University
Computer Science department, and my primary research areas are cryptology,
computer security, and large-scale distributed systems.  Much of my research
focuses on the management of encryption keys in networked computing systems
and understanding the risks of using cryptographic techniques to accomplish
security objectives. Recent government initiatives in encryption, such as
the &quot;Clipper Chip,&quot; have naturally been of great interest to me,
in no small part because of the policy impact they have on the field in
which I work, but also because they present a number of very interesting
technical and scientific challenges in their own right.<BR>
<BR>
My testimony today focuses on three areas.  First, I will discuss the role
and risks of cryptographic techniques for securing the current and future
electronic world.  Next, I will examine in more detail the security implications
of the limitations imposed on US-based cryptographic systems through the
government's export policies. Finally, I will discuss the technical aspects
of the Administration's current approach to cryptography policy, which promotes
&quot;key escrow&quot; systems.
<H3>I.  THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF ENCRYPTION</H3>
The importance of cryptographic techniques for securing modern computer
and communications systems is widely recognized today. Evidence of the scope
of this recognition can be found in the increasing number of hardware, software,
and system vendors that offer encryption in their products, the increasing
demand for high-quality encryption by users in a widening array of applications,
and the growing, thriving community of cryptologic researchers of which
I am a part.  It is vital that those who formulate our nation's policies
and official attitude toward encryption understand the nature of the underlying
technology and the reasons for its growing importance to our society.<BR>
<BR>
The basic function of cryptography is to separate the security of a message's
content from the security of the medium over which it is carried.  For example,
we might encrypt a cellular telephone conversation to guard against eavesdroppers
(allowing the call to be transmitted safely over easily-intercepted radio
frequencies), or we might use encryption to verify that documents, such
as contracts, have not been tampered with (removing the need to safeguard
a copy of the original).  The idea that this might be possible is not a
new one; history suggests that the desire to protect information is almost
as old as the written word itself.  Perhaps as a consequence of the invention
of the digital computer, our understanding of the theory and practice of
cryptography has accelerated in recent years, with a number of new techniques
developed and many new applications emerging. Among the most important of
the recent techniques is &quot;public key cryptography.&quot;  It allows
secure messages to be exchanged without the need for specific advance arrangements
between parties.  A related notion is the &quot;digital signature,&quot;
which allows messages to be &quot;signed&quot; in a way that verifiably
associates the signer of a message with its content.<BR>
<BR>
Modern cryptographic techniques are based on the application of simple,
if repetitive, mathematical functions, and as such lend themselves nicely
to implementation by computer programs.  Any information that can be represented
digitally can be protected by encryption, including computer files, electronic
mail messages, and even audio and video signals such as telephone calls,
radio, and television.  Encryption can be performed by means of software
on general-purpose computers, through special-purpose hardware, or by special
programming of microprocessor-based electronic products such as the next
generation of cellular telephones.  The basic cost of encryption in terms
of computational power required is quite low, and the marginal cost of including
encryption in a software-based computer program or a programmable electronic
product is essentially zero.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, has encryption recently enjoyed so much attention?  The reasons
can be found from two perspectives: the technology of modern communication
systems, and the new purposes for which we are relying on digital information.<BR>
<BR>
First, the technology and economics of modern communications and computing
systems strongly favors media that have little inherent security.  For example,
wireless telephones have great advantages in convenience and functionality
compared with their familiar wired counterparts and are comprising an increasing
proportion of the<BR>
telephone network.  This also makes eavesdropping much easier for curious
neighbors, burglars identifying potential targets, and industrial spies
seeking to misappropriate trade secrets.  Similarly, decentralized computer
networks such as the Internet have lower barriers to entry, are much less
expensive, are more robust and can be used to accomplish a far greater variety
of tasks than the proprietary networks of the past, but, again, at the expense
of intrinsic security.  The Internet makes it virtually impossible to restrict,
or even predict, the path that a particular message will traverse, and there
is no way to be certain where a message really originated or whether its
content has been altered along the way.  It is possible, even common, for
electronic mail messages to route through the computers of competitors.
 This is not a result of sloppy design or poor planning on the part of the
Internet's architects; on the contrary, these properties are a direct consequence
of the technological advances that make the Internet efficient and useful
in the first place.<BR>
<BR>
Second, electronic communication is becoming increasingly critical to the
smooth functioning of our society and our economy and even to protect the
safety of human life. Communication networks and computer media are rapidly
replacing less efficient, traditional modes of interaction whose security
properties are far better understood.  As<BR>
teleconferencing replaces face-to-face meetings, electronic mail replaces
letters, electronic payment systems replace cash transactions, and on-line
information services replace written reference materials, we gain a great
deal in efficiency, but our assumptions about the reliability of very ordinary
transactions are often dangerously out-of-date.<BR>
<BR>
Put another way, the trend in communication and computing networks has been
away from closed systems in favor of more open ones and the trend in our
society is to rely on these new systems for increasingly serious purposes.
 There is every reason to believe that these trends will continue, and even
accelerate, for the foreseeable future. Cryptography plays an important
and clear role in helping to provide security assurances that at least mirror
what we have come to expect from the older, more familiar communications
methods of the not-so-distant past.
<H3>II.  KEY LENGTH AND SECURITY</H3>
The &quot;strength&quot; of an encryption system depends on a number of
variables, including the mathematical properties of the underlying encryption
function, the quality of the implementation, and the number of different
&quot;keys&quot; from which the user is able to choose. It is very important
that a cryptosystem and its implementation be of high<BR>
quality, since an error or bug in either can expose the data it protects
to unexpected vulnerabilities.  Although the mathematics of cryptography
is not completely understood and cipher design is an exceptionally difficult
discipline (there is as yet no general &quot;theory&quot; for designing
cipher functions), there are a number of common<BR>
cipher systems that have been extensively studied and that are widely trusted
as building blocks for secure systems.  The implementation of practical
systems out of these building blocks, too, is a subtle and difficult art,
but commercial experience in this area is beginning to lead to good practices
for adding high-quality encryption systems to<BR>
software and hardware.  Users and developers of secure systems can protect
against weaknesses in these areas by choosing only cipher functions that
have been carefully studied and by ensuring that their implementation follows
good engineering practices.<BR>
<BR>
The most easily quantified variable that contributes to the strength of
an encryption system is the size of the pool of potential values from which
the cryptographic keys are chosen.  Modern ciphers depend on the secrecy
of the users' keys, and a system is considered well-designed only if the
easiest &quot;attack&quot; involves trying every possible key, one after
the other, until the correct one is found. The system is secure only if
the number of keys is large enough to make such an attack infeasible.  Keys
are usually specified as a string of &quot;bits,&quot; and adding one bit
to the key length doubles the number of possible keys.  An important question,
then, is the minimum key length sufficient to resist a key search attack
in practice.<BR>
<BR>
Last November, I participated in a study, organized by the Business Software
Alliance, aimed at examining the computer technology that might be used
by an &quot;attacker&quot; in order to determine the minimum length keys
that should be used in commercial applications.  We followed an unusually
conservative methodology in that we assumed that the attacker would have
only available standard &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; technology and is constrained
to purchase in single-unit quantities with no economies of scale.  That
is, our methodology would tend to produce a recommendation for shorter keys
than would an analysis using the more conventional approach of giving the
potential attacker every benefit of the doubt in terms of technological
advantages he might enjoy.  Nonetheless, we concluded that the key lengths
recommended in existing U.S. government standards (e.g., the Data Encryption
Standard, with a 56-bit key) for domestic use are far too short and will
soon render data protected under them vulnerable to attack with only modest
resources.  We concluded that keys today should be a bare minimum of 75
bits long, and that systems being fielded today to secure data over the
next twenty years must employ keys of at least 90 bits. I have included
a copy of our report as an appendix to my testimony.<BR>
<BR>
Attempting to design systems &quot;at the margins&quot; by using the minimum
key length needed is a dubious enterprise at best.  Because even a slight
miscalculation as to the technology and resources available to the potential
attacker can make the difference between a secure system and an insecure
one, prudent designers specify keys that are longer than the minimum they
estimate is needed to resist attack, to provide a margin for error.<BR>
<BR>
Current U.S. policy encourages the designers of encryption systems to take
exactly the opposite approach.  Encryption systems designed for export from
the United States at present generally must use keys no more than 40 bits
long.  Such systems provide essentially no cryptographic security, except
against the most casual &quot;hacker.&quot; Examples of 40 bit systems being
&quot;broken&quot; through the use of spare computer time on university
computer networks are commonplace. Unfortunately, it is not only users outside
the U.S. who must make do with the inferior security provided by such short
keys. Because of the difficulty of maintaining multiple versions of software,
one for domestic sale and one for export, and the need for common interoperability
standards, many US-based products are available only with export-length
keys.<BR>
<BR>
There is no technical, performance, or economic benefit to employing keys
shorter than needed.  Unlike, for example, the locks used to protect our
homes, very secure cryptographic systems with long keys are no more expensive
to produce or any harder to design or use than weaker systems with shorter
keys.  The only reason vendors design systems with short keys is to comply
with export requirements.<BR>
<BR>
The key length figures and analysis in this section are based on so-called
&quot;secret key&quot; cryptosystems.  For technical reasons, current public
key cryptosystems employ much longer keys than secret key systems to achieve
equivalent security (public keys are measured in hundreds or thousands of
bits).  However, virtually all systems that use public key cryptography
also rely on secret key cryptography, and so the overall strength of any
system is limited by the weakest encryption function and key length in it.
<H3>III.  THE RISKS OF KEY ESCROW</H3>
A number of recent Administration initiatives have proposed that future
cryptosystems include special &quot;key escrow&quot; provisions to facilitate
access to encrypted data by law enforcement and intelligence agencies. 
In a such systems, copies of keys are automatically deposited, in advance,
with third parties who can use them to arrange for law enforcement access
if required in the future. Several key escrow systems have been proposed
by the Administration, differing in the details of how keys are escrowed,
and who the third party key holders are.  In the first proposal, called
the &quot;Clipper chip,&quot; the system is embedded in a special tamper-resistant
hardware-based cryptosystem and copies of keys are held by federal agencies.
 In the more recent &quot;public key infrastructure&quot; proposal, keys
are escrowed at the time a new public key is generated and are held by the
organization (public or private) responsible for certification of the public
key.<BR>
<BR>
Although the various key escrow proposals differ in the details of how they
accomplish their objective, there are a number of very serious fundamental
problems and risks associated with all of them.<BR>
<BR>
There are some appropriate commercial applications of key escrow techniques.
 A properly designed cryptosystem makes it essentially impossible to recover
encrypted data without the correct key.  This can be a double-edge sword;
the cost of keeping unauthorized parties out is that if keys are lost or
unavailable at the time they are needed, the owner of encrypted data will
be unable to make use of his own information.  This problem, of balancing
secrecy with assurances of continued availability, remains an area of active
research, and commercial solutions are starting to emerge.  The Administration's
initiatives do not address this problem especially well, however.<BR>
<BR>
The first problem with key escrow is the great increase in engineering complexity
that such systems entail.  The design and implementation of even the simplest
encryption systems is an extraordinarily difficult and delicate process.
 Very small changes can introduce fatal security flaws that often can be
exploited by an attacker.  Ordinary (non-escrowed) encryption systems have
conceptually rather simple requirements (for example, the secure transmission
of data between two parties) and yet, because there is no general theory
for designing them, we still often discover exploitable flaws in fielded
systems. Key escrow renders even the specification of the problem itself
far more complex, making it virtually impossible to assure that such systems
work as they are intended to.  It is possible, even likely, that lurking
in any key escrow system are one or more design weaknesses that allow recovery
of data by unauthorized parties. The commercial and academic world simply
does not have the tools to analyze or design the complex systems that arise
from escrow.<BR>
<BR>
Key escrow is so difficult that even systems designed by the classified
world can have subtle problems that are only discovered later.  In 1994
I discovered a new type of &quot;protocol failure&quot; in the Escrowed
Encryption Standard, the system on which the Clipper chip is based.  The
failure allows, contrary to the design objectives of the system, a rogue
user to circumvent the escrow system in a way that makes the data unrecoverable
by the government.  Other weaknesses have been discovered since then that
make it possible, for example, to create incriminating messages that appear
to have originated from a particular user.<BR>
<BR>
It should be noted that these weaknesses have been discovered in spite of
the fact that most of the details of the standard are classified and were
not included in the analysis that led to the discovery of the flaws.  But
these problems did not come about because of incompetence on the part of
the system's designers.  Indeed, the U.S. National Security Agency is likely
the most advanced cryptographic enterprise in the world, and is justifiably
entrusted with developing the cryptographic systems that safeguard the government's
most important military and state secrets.  The reason the Escrowed Encryption
Standard has flaws that are still being discovered is that key escrow is
an extremely difficult technical problem, with requirements unlike anything
previously encountered.<BR>
<BR>
A second problem with key escrow arises from the difficulty of operating
a key escrow center in a secure manner.  According to the Administration
(for example, see the May 20, 1996 White House draft report &quot;Enabling
Privacy, Commerce, Security and Public Safety in the Global Information
Infrastructure&quot;), key escrow centers must be prepared to respond to
law enforcement requests for escrowed data 24 hours a day, completing transactions
within two hours of receiving each request.  There are thousands of law
enforcement agencies in the United States authorized to perform electronic
surveillance, and the escrow center must be prepared to identify and respond
to any of them within this time frame.  If the escrow center is also a commercial
operation providing data recovery services, it may also have tens of thousands
of additional private sector customers that it must be prepared to serve
and respond to.  There are few, if any, secure systems that operate effectively
on such a scale and under such tightly-constrained response time.  The argument,
advanced by the Administration, that escrow centers can use the same procedures
that protect classified data is a curious one, since classified information
is by its nature available to a far smaller and more carefully-controlled
potential audience than are escrowed keys.  It is simply inevitable that
escrow centers that meet the government's requirements will make mistakes
in giving out the wrong keys from time to time or will be vulnerable to
fraudulent key requests.  Key escrow, by its nature, makes encrypted data
less secure because the escrow center introduces a new target for attack.<BR>
<BR>
A third problem with the Administration's key escrow proposals is that they
fail to distinguish between cryptographic keys for which recovery might
be required and those for which recoverability is never needed. There are
many different kinds of encryption keys, but for the purposes of discussing
key escrow it is sufficient to divide keys into three categories.  The first
includes keys used to encrypt stored information, which must be available
throughout the lifetime of the data.  The owner of the data has an obvious
interest in ensuring the continued availability of such keys, and might
choose to rely on a commercial service to store &quot;backup&quot; copies
of them.  A second category of key includes those used to encrypt real-time
communications such as telephone calls.  Here, the key has no value to its
owner once the transaction for which it was used has completed. If a key
is lost or destroyed in the middle of a conversation, a new one can be established
in its place without permanent loss of information.  For these keys, the
owner has no use for recoverability; it is of value only to law enforcement
and others who wish to obtain access to a conversation without the knowledge
or cooperation of the parties.  Finally, there are the keys used not for
secrecy but for signature and authentication, to insure that messages indeed
originated from a particular party.  There is never a need for anyone, law
enforcement or the key owner, to recover such keys, since their purpose
is not to obscure content but rather to establish authorship. If the owner
looses a signature key, a new one can be generated easily at any time.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, however, the current Administration proposal exposes all
three types of keys equally to the risks introduced by the escrow system,
even though recoverability is not required for all of them. Partly this
is because there is no intrinsic difference in the structure of the different
types of keys; they are usually indistinguishable from one another outside
of the application in which they are used.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, there is the problem that criminals can circumvent almost any escrow
system to avoid exposure to law enforcement monitoring.  All key escrow
systems are vulnerable to so-called &quot;superencryption,&quot; in which
a user first encrypts data with an unescrowed key prior to processing it
with the escrowed system.  Most escrow systems are also vulnerable to still
other techniques that make it especially easy to render escrowed keys useless
to law enforcement.  The ease of avoiding law enforcement when convenient
raises an obvious question as to whether the reduced security and high cost
of setting up an escrow system will yield any appreciable public safety
benefit in practice.
<H3>IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</H3>
The wide availability of encryption is vitally important to the future growth
of our global information infrastructure.  In many cases, encryption offers
the only viable option for securing the rapidly increasing range of human,
economic and social activities taking place over emerging communication
networks.  It is no exaggeration to say that the availability of encryption
in the commercial marketplace is and will continue to be necessary to protect
national security. Unfortunately, current policy, through export controls
and ambiguous standards, discourages, rather than promotes, the use of encryption.<BR>
<BR>
Current encryption policy is enormously frustrating to almost everyone working
in the field.  Export controls make it difficult to deploy effective cryptography
even domestically, and we can do little more than watch as our foreign colleagues
and competitors, not constrained by these rules, are matching our expertise
and obtaining an ever-increasing share of the market.  A large part of the
problem is that the current regulations were written as if to cover hardware
but are applied to software, including software in the public domain or
aimed at the mass market.  The PRO-CODE bill goes a long way toward moving
the regulations in line with the realities of the technology.<BR>

(1) JOIN SENATOR BURNS LIVE ONLINE =TONIGHT= at 10PM EDT: Preview Tomorrow's
    Hearing on "Pro-CODE" Encryption Bill

 --> Visit http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/ for details <--

Senator Conrad Burns (R-MT) will be on HotWired's WiredSide chat TONIGHT
(6/11) at 10pm EDT to discuss tomorrow's scheduled hearing on his 
"Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996" ("Pro-CODE")
encryption bill. 

Tonight's WiredSide chat is a great opportunity to join Senator Burns on
the eve of an important hearing to ask questions about encryption policy
and get a preview of what the Senator expects to occur at the hearing.

Senator Burns will chair the first of two scheduled hearings on his 
"Pro-CODE" bill tomorrow at 9:30 EDT in Room 253 of the Russell Senate
Office Building.  The hearing will take place in the Commerce Subcommittee
on Science, Technology and Space.  This is the first Congressional hearing 
in recent memory to discuss "pro-encryption" legislation that would relax
current restrictive encryption export controls.

Never before has the public had this much access to legislators without
geographical proximity.  Cheaper than teleconferencing, and more direct
and unfiltered than the traditional press, online chats allow the public
to directly question and hear the answers from members of Congress.

The online chat is at 10pm EDT (7pm PDT) TONIGHT (6/11). HotWired's 
WiredSide chat is at:

     http://www.hotwired.com/wiredside/

Tonight's forum is another in a series of planned events, and is part
of a broader project coordinated by CDT and the Voters Telecommunications
Watch (VTW) designed to encourage members of Congress to work with the
Net.community on vital Internet policy issues and to bring the Internet
Community into the debate about those issues.

Transcripts from previous online chats are available -- for transcript

  First Pro-CODE Hearing Slated
  Burns' Subcommittee to Hear High-Profile Executives, Witnesses

          WASHINGTON, D.C. _ Montana Senator Conrad Burns today announced
  the first of two Senate hearings on S. 1726, the Promotion of Commerce
  Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996, or "Pro-CODE."  The hearing will
  take place in the Commerce Subcommittee on Science, Technology and Space,
  of which Burns is chairman.

          The hearing is scheduled Wednesday, June 12, at 9:30 a.m. in room
  253 of the Russell Senate Office Building.

          Scheduled to testify are: Michael Zisman, president and CEO of
  Lotus; Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of Netscape Communications; Jim
  Bidzos, president and CEO of RSA Data Security; Tim Krauskopf, V.P. and
  co-founder of Spyglass Inc.; Kenneth Dam, chairman of the National
  Research Council; Douglas J. McGowan, director of the SmartCard Alliance
  for Hewlett-Packard; Computer Systems Policy Project representative
  (invited); Joe Holmes, chief technology officer for EDS; Joel S. Lisker,
  senior V.P. for security and risk management at MasterCard; Danne
  Buchanan, president of Zion's Data Services Company; Jack Valenti,
  executive director of the Motion Picture Association of America; Aharon
  Friedman, chairman, founder and chief technical officer of Digital
  Secured Networks Technology Inc.; Steve Case, president and CEO of
  America Online (invited); and Robert Bigomy, senior V.P. and director of
  strategic marketing, government and space technology group, for Motorola.

          Burns said the focus of the hearing is on commerce and business
  issues.  He said a second hearing, which will focus on privacy, law
  enforcement and national security issues, is scheduled in his
  subcommittee on June 26.

          The bipartisan Pro-CODE bill would ease export restrictions on
  computer security, or "encryption," for software and hardware.  It would
  also prohibit mandatory systems in which users or companies would have to
  place a code-breaking "key" in the hands of a third party.

<H2>Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) Letter in Support
of Pro-CODE Legislation</H2>
<BR>
<BR>
May 16, 1996<BR>
<BR>
The Honorable Robert Dole<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
Washington, DC  20510<BR>
<BR>
The Honorable Larry Pressler<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
Washington, DC  20510<BR>
<BR>
The Honorable Conrad Burns<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
Washington, DC  20510<BR>
<BR>
The Honorable Patrick J. Leahy<BR>
United States Senate<BR>
Washington, DC  20510<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dear Senators Dole, Pressler, Burns and Leahy:<BR>
<BR>
On behalf of high-technology companies in the United States, we want to
recognize your efforts to ensure that our industry continues to be the global
leader, driving the creation of jobs at a rapid rate here.<BR>
<BR>
The explosive growth of the Internet promises great benefits for education,
healthcare as well as the ability of U.S. businesses to compete around the
world.  It is becoming a significant driver of new jobs in the U.S. economy.
 But the ability to ensure the security, integrity and confidentiality of
the information that flows over this network of networks is the key to its
growth.<BR>
<BR>
In particular, we want to thank you for your strong support of legislation
designed to make certain that U.S. companies are not placed at a disadvantage
in selling software globally that allows companies to protect sensitive
and proprietary information that is sent over the Internet, the 
global network of networks.  As original co-sponsors of both the &quot;Promotion
of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era (PRO-CODE) Act of 1996,&quot; and
the &quot;Encrypted Communications Privacy Act&quot; you have demonstrated
your commitment to changing the Administration's ill-conceived, &quot;Big
Brother&quot; policy which restricts U.S. exports and mandates a &quot;key
escrow&quot; regime.  The Administration's policy only allows the use of
good, effective encryption if the &quot;key&quot; or password is made available
to the government.<BR>
<BR>
The legislation you have sponsored recognizes the legitimate needs of national
security and law enforcement while ensuring that if a level of information
security is generally available, U.S. companies should not be placed at
a disadvantage in the international marketplace.  Without such 
changes in policy, the U.S. software industry will lose $60 billion in revenues
and 200,000 jobs in the next four years to foreign competition.<BR>
<BR>
Some of you also played a significant role in another significant issue
for the high-technology industry:  securities litigation reform.  As a result
of Congress overturning the President's ill-considered veto, high-tech companies
will no longer suffer from &quot;legal extortion&quot; whenever a company's
stock price fluctuates.  The result will be a more competitive U.S. technology
industry, translating into U.S. jobs.<BR>
<BR>
We look forward to working with you in passing the Internet encryption legislation,
and thank you again for your recognition of the significance of our high-technology
industry for the broad U.S. economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sincerely,<BR>

<P>
Twenty-seven members of the House of Representatives have urged President
Clinton not to proceed with the Administration's key escrow encryption
policy proposal. In a May 15 letter to the President, the bipartisan group
called on the Adminstration instead to "immediately liberalize export
controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products." The
bipartisan group, including Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va), Anna Eshoo (D-Ca),
Tom Campbell (R-Ca) and Eliot Engle (D-NY), argued that "the ability of
companies and individuals to ensure that the information they send over
communications and coputer netwroks is secure is a prerequisite to
exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure."

<BIG><STRONG>Senators Burns, Dole, Leahy, and Pressler Introduce Legislation to Challenge Clinton Administration's Encryption Export Controls</A></STRONG></BIG> <FONT SIZE=-1>May 2, 1996</FONT><BR>
<P>
In a move to replace the Cold War-era regulations on encryption with
policies that make sense for the global Internet, Senators Burns (R-MT),
Dole (R-KS), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Wyden (D-OR), and others today
introduced legislation to roll back the restrictions prohibiting the export
of strong encryption technology.  This historic legislation promises to
inject the debate over privacy and security on the Internet into the 1996
presidential campaign.
<P>
The bill, entitled the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996", is designed to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies for
the Internet. It is similar to a bill introduced in March by Senators Leahy
and Burns, though the new bill does not contain criminal provisions or
provisions imposing liability for third party key holders.

<BIG><STRONG>Important Hurdle Cleared in Court Battle to Overturn Crypto Export Controls</STRONG></BIG> <font size = -1>(April 17, 1996)</font>
<p>
A Federal judge in San Francisco has denied a Government request to dismiss a lawsuit brought by Daniel Bernstein and the Electronic Frontier Foundation that challenges the government's export restrictions on cryptography.  Judge Marilyn Hall Patel ruled that "source code is speech" and is thus entitled to heightened First Amendment protection.  The ruling has important policy implications on the future of cryptography exports and on privacy and electronic commerce.  The ruling could also affect the ongoing legislative battle to lift export controls on cryptography.

<H2>Administration Statement on Commercial Encryption Policy<BR>
July 12, 1996</H2>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration is proposing a framework that will encourage
the use of strong encryption in commerce and private communications while
protecting the public safety and national security.  It would be developed
by industry and will be available for both domestic and international use.<BR>
<BR>
The framework will permit U.S. industry to take advantage of advances in
technology pioneered in this country, and to compete effectively in the
rapidly changing international marketplace of communications, computer networks,
and software.  Retaining U.S. industry's leadership in the global information
technology market is of longstanding importance to the Clinton Administration.<BR>
<BR>
The framework will ensure that everyone who communicates or stores information
electronically can protect his or her privacy from prying eyes and ears
as well as against theft of, or tampering with, their data.  The framework
is voluntary; any American will remain free to use any encryption system
domestically.<BR>
<BR>
The framework is based on a global key management infrastructure that supports
digital signatures and confidentiality.  Trusted private sector parties
will verify digital signatures and also will hold spare keys to confidential
data.  Those keys could be obtained only by persons or entities that have
lost the key to their own encrypted data, or by law enforcement officials
acting under proper authority.  It represents a flexible approach to expanding
the use of strong encryption in the private sector.<BR>
<BR>
This framework will encourage commerce both here and abroad.  It is similar
to the approach other countries are taking, and will permit nations to establish
an internationally interoperable key management infrastructure with rules
for access appropriate to each country's needs and consistent with law enforcement
agreements.  Administration officials are currently working with other nations
to develop the framework for that infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
In the expectation of industry action to develop this framework internationally,
and recognizing that this development will take time, the Administration
intends to take action in the near term to facilitate the transition to
the key management infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
The measures the Administration is considering include:
<OL>
<LI>Liberalizing export controls for certain commercial encryption products.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Developing, in cooperation with industry, performance standards for
key recovery systems and products that will be eligible for general export
licenses, and technical standards for products the government will purchase.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Launching several key recovery pilot projects in cooperation with industry
and involving international participation.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Transferring export control jurisdiction over encryption products for
commercial use from the Department of State to the Department of Commerce.
</OL>
Administration officials continue to discuss the details of these actions
with experts from the communications equipment, computer hardware and software
industries, civil liberties groups and other members of the public, to ensure
that the final proposal balances industry actions towards the proposed framework,
short-term liberalization initiatives, and public safety concerns.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration does not support the bills pending in Congress that would
decontrol the export of commercial encryption products because of their
serious negative impact on national security and law enforcement.  Immediate
export decontrol by the U.S. could also adversely affect the security interests
of our trading partners and lead them to control imports of U.S. commercial
encryption products.<BR>
<BR>
A Cabinet Committee continues to address the details of this proposal. 
The Committee intends to send detailed recommendations to the President
by early September, including any recommendations for legislation and Executive
Orders.  The Committee comprises the Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce
and Treasury; the Attorney General; the Directors of Central Intelligence
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation; and senior representatives from
the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget, and
the National Economic Council.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H2>US Cryptography Policy:  Why We Are Taking the Current Approach<BR>
July 12, 1996</H2>
<BR>
We live in an age of electronic information.  Information technology is
transforming society, creating new businesses, new jobs and new careers.
 The technology also creates new opportunities for crime, and new problems
in investigating and prosecuting crime.  As a result, electronic information,
be it corporate trade secrets, pre-release government crop statistics, or
a patient's medical records, must have strong protection from uninvited
modifications of disclosure.  Cryptography enables that protection.<BR>
<BR>
The United States is the world leader in information technology.  US firms
continue to dominate the US and global information systems market.  Retaining
this leadership is important to our economic security.  The Clinton Administration,
through its National Information Infrastructure initiative, has long recognized
that government has an important role as a facilitator and catalyst for
the industry-led transformation of the way we use computer and communications
technology to work and live.<BR>
<BR>
In particular, government has a strong interest in promoting the legitimate
use of robust encryption to support US international competitiveness, foster
global electronic commerce, prevent computer crime, and ensure that the
information superhighway is a safe place to conduct one's business.  At
the same time, there is a growing recognition, affirmed most recently by
the National Academy of Science that the use of encryption to conceal illegitimate
activities &quot;poses a problem for society as a whole, not just for law
enforcement and national security.&quot;  In brief, criminals can use encryption
to frustrate legal wiretaps and render useless search warrants for stored
electronic data.  We know of no technical solution to the problems that
would result from the global proliferation of strong cryptography <A HREF="#cracking">(see box)</A>.
 The implications of this are no small matter.<BR>
<BR>
Encrypted computer files have hampered the prosecution of child pornographers.
 Militia groups advise their members to use encryption to hide illicit weapons,
financial, and other criminal activities.  Aldrich Ames was instructed by
his Soviet handlers to encrypt computer files that he passed to the Soviets.
 And international terrorists and drug dealers increasingly use encryption
to prevent law enforcement officials from reading their voice and data transmissions.
 Grave crimes, such as a plot to shoot down several airliners over Chicago,
have been foiled by the use of wiretaps.  Had the FBI been unable to read
those transmissions, however, a major tragedy might have ensued.<BR>
<BR>
No restrictions apply to the US domestic use of cryptography, and the Administration
has no plan to seek restrictions.  Cryptography has long been controlled
for export for national security reasons, so as to keep it from getting
into the hands of foreign governments.  But is has today become a dual-use
technology, and international businesses want to use the same security products
both domestically and abroad.  The Administration is thus under strong pressure
to provide relief from cryptography export controls.<BR>
<BR>
For our cryptography policy to succeed, it must be aligned with commercial
market forces and operate on an international basis.  Further, it should
preserve and extend the strong position that US industry enjoys in the global
information systems marketplace.  Accordingly, the US government is working
with US industry and our international trading partners on an approach that
will protect information used in legitimate activities, assure the continued
safety of Americans from enemies both foreign and domestic, and preserve
the ability of the US information systems industry to compete worldwide.<BR>
<H3>Key Management and Recovery</H3>
A consensus is emerging around the vision of a global cryptography system
that permits the use of any encryption method the user chooses, with a stored
key to unlock it when necessary.  The encryption key would be provided voluntarily
by a computer user to a trusted party who holds it for safe keeping.  This
is what many people do with their house keys -- give them to a trusted neighbor
who can produce them when something unexpected goes wrong.  Businesses should
find this attractive because they do not want to lock up information and
throw away the key or give an employee -- not the company -- control over
company information.  An individual might also use this service to ensure
that she can retrieve information stored years ago.  This will require a
new infrastructure, consisting of trusted parties who have defined responsibilities
to key owners.  Under law, these trusted emergency key recovery organizations
would also respond in a timely manner to authorized requests from law enforcement
officials who required the key to decode information lawfully obtained or
seized from a subject of investigation or prosecution.<BR>
<BR>
The Federal government will use key recovery encryption on its own computers
because it makes good management sense.  It would be irresponsible for agencies
to store critical records without key recovery, risking the loss of the
information for programmatic use and the inability to investigate and prosecute
fraud or misuse of the information.<BR>
<BR>
A number of US and international companies are working with the US and other
governments to create a system of trusted parties who are certified to safeguard
the keys.  In some cases, organizations might guard their own keys.  In
other cases, persons will use the key recovery services provided by third
parties, one of a suite of services that will include electronic directories
and electronic &quot;notaries&quot; in support of online commerce.  Persons
will be free to choose the type and strength of encryption that provide
the degree of security they believe appropriate for their use.  Taken together,
an overall key management infrastructure is needed to make electronic commerce
practical on a global scale.<BR>
<BR>
Some commercial products and services which provide emergency key recovery
are already available.  Testing and refinement is needed before a widespread,
robust infrastructure is put in place.  The US government is committed to
supporting the development of such a key management infrastructure through
pilots and experimental trials.  The State Department is expediting the
review of several export license applications that test commercial key recovery
on an international scale.  An interagency working group is identifying
several potential governmental uses of commercial cryptography - both internal
transactions and in communications with the public - where key recovery
can be tested.  A plan outlining these government tests will be available
in August.  The government will be purchasing key recovery products for
its own use, and will adopt a Federal standard for evaluating such products
to assure agency purchasers that the key recovery features operate properly.
 The Department of Commerce will be establishing an industry-led advisory
committee to make recommendations regarding such a standard this Summer.<BR>
<BR>
While we are open to other alternatives, a key recovery system is the only
approach we know of that accommodates all public safety interests.  And
even it is imperfect.  Some people will not join voluntary systems, preferring
to run the risk of losing their keys and being unable to recover their encrypted
information.  Although in some countries (e.g., France) mandatory key escrowing
is already in effect, we are pursuing a market-driven approach in part because
we hope and believe that key recovery will develop as a cost-effective service
in an electronic commerce infrastructure.  We are encourage in this effort
by recent discussions we have had at the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) that are leading to international cryptography management
principles which support key recovery.<BR>
<H3>Export Controls</H3>
No matter how successful we are in realizing this vision, American users
of computer technology are demanding stronger encryption for international
use now.  Although we do not control the use of encryption within the US,
we do, with some exceptions, limit the export of non-escrowed mass market
encryption to products using a key length of 40 bits.  (The length of the
encryption key is one way of measuring the strength of an encryption product.
 Systems using longer keys are harder to decrypt.)  US industry asserts
that it is losing overseas sales to its European and Japanese competitors
because it cannot include stronger cryptography as a component of its commercial
software and hardware products.  It warns that loss of a significant share
of the world information systems market would cause serious economic damage
to the US economy, and could reduce the US government's ability to influence
the long term future of global cryptography.  It also argues that because
customers do not want to use one product in the US and a different one overseas,
export controls are causing US firms to provide an unsatisfactory level
of protection to their electronic information, making them vulnerable to
industrial espionage by their competitors and foreign governments.<BR>
<BR>
While 40 bit encryption products are still strong enough for many uses,
the Administration recognizes that some export liberalization may be useful
to build support for a key management regime.   Accordingly, we are actively
considering measures that would provide limited, temporary relief from cryptographic
export controls in exchange for real, measurable commitments from industry
(e.g., investments in products that support key recovery) toward the building
of a key management infrastructure.  The liberalization proposals under
discussion, which would continue the current one-time review of products
by the National Security Agency, include: permitting products using longer
key lengths to be exported to specific industry sectors such as health care
or insurance (similar to current policy for the financial sector); allowing
export of non-escrowed products to a list of trustworthy firms beyond those
sectors, with provisions for monitoring compliance to prevent product diversion
to other firms; export of cryptography-ready operating systems; and, most
dramatically, the transfer of jurisdiction over commercial encryption products
from the State Department's munitions list to the Commerce Department's
list of dual-use technologies.  Our goal is to obtain commitments from industry
by the Fall.<BR>
<BR>
We must, however, be careful in any relaxation of controls.  Other governments'
law enforcement and national security needs to access material encrypted
with US products could drive them to erect trade barriers by imposing import
controls on strong non-escrow encryption products.  In addition, we do not
want to do anything that would damage our own national security or public
safety by spreading unbreakable encryption, especially given the international
nature of terrorism.  Even 40 bit encryption, if widespread and not escrowed,
defeats law enforcement.<BR>
<BR>
It is for these reasons that we oppose the legislation (S.1726) introduced
in this Congress by Senator Burns and co-sponsored by Senator Lott and former
Senator Dole.  Although it contains some provisions, such as the transfer
of export control jurisdiction for commercial cryptography to the Commerce
Department, with which we could agree if constructed with appropriate safeguards,
the bill is unbalanced, and makes no effort to take into account the serious
consequences of the proliferation it would permit.<BR>
<BR>
The importance of the US information technology industry, the security stakes,
and increasing Congressional interest make it clear that there is an urgent
need for clear policy and direction.  The Administration's proposed approach
is broadly consistent with industry suggestions and conclusions reached
by the National Academy of Sciences in its report.  That report recognizes
the need to address a complex mix of commercial and security issues in a
balanced manner.  We agree with that need.  We also agree with the report's
recommendation that export controls on encryption products need to be relaxed
but not eliminated, and are actively considering ways of providing short
term relief. (We do not agree with the report's recommendation that we eliminate
most controls on 56-bit key length products.)  Finally, we agree that key
escrow is a promising but not fully tested solution, and are promoting the
kinds of testing the report recommends as a way of demonstrating the solution's
viability while providing stronger encryption internationally.<BR>
<BR>
We will continue discussion with industry, other members of the private
sector, the Congress, and governments at all levels to arrive at a solution
that promotes a future of safe computing in a safe society.<BR>

<H3>Cracking Coded Messages</H3>
We should not underestimate how difficult is to decode encrypted electronic
information.  One approach advanced in the popular debate is to provide
our law enforcement officials with more computing power.  At first glance,
this suggestion seems promising, because in theory any encrypted message
can be decoded if enough computing cycles are applied.  This approach fails
for five reasons:<BR>
<BR>
First, it relies on mathematical theory, not operational reality.  Digital
technology reduces voice, faxes, images, and text in any language to indistinguishable
1's and 0's.  A great variety of encryption products are also available.
 Under ideal conditions -- if the type of communication or file, language,
and encryption algorithm are known with certainty, and a short key is used
to encrypt the information -- a large, specially-designed computer could
decode a single message relatively quickly.  But State, local, and Federal
law enforcement officials do not operate in the clean confines of a high-tech
computer center.  They must first capture the 1's and 0's and discern what
kind of encryption they have encountered.<BR>
<BR>
Second, after the decoding problem is isolated, acquiring a machine to decode
a message is neither quick, easy or inexpensive.  Commercially available
computers could not be used because they will not have sufficient capacity.
 It would, for example, take years for the computers used to process all
social security claims, payments and earnings years to decode one message
using the Data Encryption Standard (DES), a widely used system originally
developed by the US government that uses a 56-bit key.<BR>
<BR>
Third, this approach betrays a misunderstanding of how crimes are prevented.
 Used only in the most critical cases, legally authorized wiretaps provide
crucial information just before a crime is to occur.  Thus a near real-time
ability to decode messages is needed.  Days or weeks are too long to wait
to find out that a terrorist attack is about to happen.<BR>
<BR>
Fourth, this approach fails to acknowledge the volume of messages that could
need decoding.  Each wiretap results in the collection of thousands of messages
relevant to the investigative purpose of the wiretap.  Even under the most
ideal conditions, had these messages been encrypted, the computing resources
required to decrypt them quickly would simply not be available.  And this
example does not include the additional burden of decrypting, if possible,
any digital information such as computer disks that are seized as evidence
after a crime has been committed.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, revealing the precise capabilities of law enforcement agencies
to decode messages, as would be necessary in order to present the fruits
of that work as evidence in court, could provide a tutorial to criminal
elements bent on eluding law enforcement.<BR>

(1) NO NEW NEWS ON ENCRYPTION - VP GORE REITERATES SUPPORT FOR KEY ESCROW

Despite the growing pressure from Congress, privacy advocates, the computer
industry, and the public for the reform of US encryption policy, the
Administration continues to embrace its Clipper III key-escrow encryption
proposal.  In a written statement issued Friday, the Vice President
announced that the Administration will continue to push for the adoption of
a massive public key infrastructure to enable law enforcement access to
encryption communications and continue to rely on cold war-era export
controls.

[The full text of the announcement is available on CDT's Encryption
 Policy Issues Page: http://www.cdt.org/crypto/]

CDT is disappointed that the Administration's latest statement offered no
new solutions to what is becoming a critical policy issue for the future of
the Internet and the development of a secure and trusted global information
infrastructure.

Friday's announcement comes amid growing concern from bi-partisan members
of Congress, computer industry leaders, privacy advocates, and the public.
Recent calls for changes in current US encryption policy include:

* Bipartisan legislation in both the House and Senate designed to relax
  US encryption export controls and encourage the widespread
  availability of strong, easy to use encryption technologies.

* The Security and Freedom through Encryption (SAFE) Forum, held on July
  1st, where members of Congress, computer industry leaders, privacy
  advocates and the public discussed the need to reform US encryption
  policy.

* The recent report by the National Research Council which criticizes
  current policy as failing to address the needs of an information age
  society.

These developments represent a growing consensus among members of Congress,
the computer industry, and privacy advocates that current US encryption
policy is harming the competitiveness of US industry and endangering the
privacy of computer users. Our understanding of this consensus does not
match the conclusion the Vice President reaches that: "A consensus is
emerging around the vision of a global cryptography system that permits the
use of any encryption method the user chooses, with a stored key to unlock
when necessary". CDT sees no evidence of broad support for a key escrow
approach.

While the Administration seems to acknowledge the importance of encryption
for privacy and electronic commerce, neither the current policy nor its
predecessors have met the needs which virtually all involved in this debate
now see. Since 1992, the Administration has continued to offer solutions
which fail to recognize the privacy needs of individual computer users and
the realities of the global economy.  While law enforcement and national
security considerations are important factors which must be addressed, the
Administration's current proposal, along with Clipper I and Clipper II,
continues to put law enforcement and national security concerns above the
privacy and security needs of the American public.

SUMMARY OF VICE PRESIDENT GORE'S STATEMENT

While putting forward an initiative ostensibly designed to make encryption
more available to computer users, the Administration would do so at a high
price: Individuals would be required to place their most private personal
encryption keys in the hands of third parties.

Today's statement is essentially a re-statement of the Clipper III proposal
released in May.  Among other things, the Vice President:

*  Called for the liberalization of export controls provided computer
   users participate in a "global key management infrastructure"
   designed to make personal encryption keys accessible to law
   enforcement.

*  Reiterated the Administration's opposition to the bipartisan
   encryption legislation introduced this Spring in the House and
   Senate, which would ease export controls.

*  Announced that a Cabinet Committee will send detailed
   recommendations regarding implementation of this proposal to the
   President by early September.

*  Indicated that the Administration "is considering" interim measures
   until a key escrow system is in place, including:

   -  Liberalizing export controls for certain industries,

   -  Developing performance standards for key recovery systems that
      will be eligible for export.

   -  Launching key recovery pilot projects.

   -  Moving jurisdiction over encryption export licenses from
      the State Department to the Commerce Department (The Burns/Leahy
      Pro-CODE bill contains a similar provision).

The full text of the Vice President's Statement, along with the Clipper III
proposal, the text of the Pro-CODE bill and other legislation, and
detailed background information on the encryption policy debate, is
available on CDT's encryption policy resource page:

   http://www.cdt.org/crypto/

CDT believes that a far more sensible approach to encryption is offered by
the bipartisan legislation introduced this Spring to ease export controls,
including:  S. 1726, the Pro-Code Act introduced by Senators Burns (R-MT),
Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Lott (R-MS), Wyden (D-OR), Simpson (R-WY),
Murray (D-WA), and others; S.1567, authored by Sen. Leahy with many of the
same co-sponsors; and H.R. 3011, introduced by in the House of
Representatives by Reps. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Anna Eshoo (D-CA), Tom
Campbell (R-CA) Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), and a bi-partisan group of over 20
others.

NEXT STEPS

CDT will continue to work with Senators Burns, Leahy, Pressler, Wyden and
Reps, Eshoo, Goodlatte, and others to encourage the widespread availability
of strong encryption by pushing for passage of legislation to relax export
controls on encryption.  The full Senate Commerce Committee, chaired by
Senator Larry Pressler (R-SD), is expected to hold hearings on the Pro-CODE
bill during the week of July 22. CDT is working to cybercast that hearing
live on the Internet. Please continue to visit CDT's encryption policy
issues page for the latest information on this issue.

<TITLE>CDT | Leahy Statement on Admin Policy, 7/12/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<H3>Statement of <A HREF="http://www.senate.gov/~leahy">Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT)</A> Regarding The Vice President's<BR>
Announcement on Commercial Encryption Policy<BR>
July 12,1996</H3>
<PRE>
The Vice President's announcement today shows forward movement.
Unfortunately, this movement can be measured in inches rather than leaps
and bounds.  While most of us had hoped the Administration would take some
bold steps forward, they have only crept ahead inches.  Considering where
the Administration has been, I am thankful at least for this very timid
move.

The Administration appears ready to sit down at the table and talk
to Members of Congress, civil liberties groups and industry about
legislation that will ensure the freedom of Americans to use any encryption
systems domestically, liberalize export controls, transfer jurisdiction
over the export of encryption products to the Commerce Department from the
State Department, and encourage development by industry--not the
government--of strong encryption for commercial use.  These are all key
elements of encryption legislation I have sponsored with Senators Burns,
Lott,  Murray, Wyden and others.

I remain concerned that the Administration places too much reliance
on a system in which individuals must turn over their most private decoding
keys to another party.  But I look forward to working with the
Administration in a bipartisan manner to make sure that progress is made
this Congress.  There is much at stake here for our privacy and our
economy. We urgently need, as the Vice President acknowledges, a "clear
policy and direction."

<PRE>
                                    ***

  Good morning.  In this age of telecommunications and lightning-speed
  advances in computing, keeping private information private gets tougher
  all the time.  Without proper safeguards, personal financial
  transactions, medical records, corporate secrets such as bidding
  information and proprietary research reports may be compromised by
  criminals and corporate spies.  Without proper safeguards, crucial
  information systems such as those of the banking system and the public
  switched telecommunications network may be vulnerable to intrusion by
  terrorists, curious computer hackers, and unfriendly foreign governments.

       One of the best ways to protect electronic information is through
  encryption, which is the use of mathematical formulas to scramble
  information into digital codes.  Once of concern only to spies and the
  military, cryptography has now become a vital tool for protecting the
  legitimate interests of  the nation's businesses and the privacy of its
  citizens.  This change has created a dilemma for the U.S. government
  because encryption also can be used in a wide range of illegitimate
  activities.  Drug dealers, terrorists, and other criminals can use
  cryptography to thwart even legally authorized search and surveillance by
  law enforcement officials; foreign governments can encrypt information
  that the U.S. needs to protect its national security.  Now the federal
  government -- which in the past has sought to restrict the spread of
  encryption --  must weigh the pros and cons of promoting broader use of
  cryptography.

       The National Research Council was asked by Congress to provide
  policy makers with guidance in making this assessment. Our study
  committee was made up of individuals with expertise in many relevant
  fields: technical expertise in computers, communications, and
  cryptography; policy experience in law enforcement, intelligence, civil
  liberties, national security, diplomacy, and international trade;
  business experience in telecommunications and computer hardware and
  software, as well as in protecting information in the for-profit and
  not-for-profit sectors.  It was formed to examine the appropriate balance
  among various national security, law enforcement, business, and privacy
  interests.

       Our committee's broad conclusion is that the advantages of
  cryptography in safeguarding information outweigh the possible
  disadvantages of making apprehension and prosecution of criminals more
  difficult.  Thus, we believe that federal policies should promote rather
  than discourage the use of encryption.  For example, current export
  controls impede the use of strong encryption by U.S. firms with foreign
  customers and suppliers as well as reducing the availability of strong
  encryption domestically. The government needs to make it easier for U.S.
  companies operating internationally to use strong encryption, and for
  U.S. technology vendors to develop and sell cryptography products both in
  this country and abroad.  Indeed, maintaining world leadership for U.S.
  information technology vendors is an important contribution to national
  security, as well as being important to the economy.

       Furthermore, the development of products with encryption should be
  driven largely by market forces rather than by government-imposed
  requirements or standards.  There are no legal limits on the kinds of
  encryption that presently can be sold in the United States and  we
  strongly endorse the idea that no law should bar the manufacture, sale,
  or use of any form of encryption within the United States.

       We do not believe that by adopting such a course the government
  would necessarily be choosing the interests of business and individuals
  over those of national security and law enforcement.  We say this for two
  reasons.  First, availability of encryption technologies will benefit law
  enforcement and national security.  Here's how: by making economic
  espionage more difficult, cryptography supports law enforcement.  By
  protecting elements of the civilian infrastructure such as banking,
  telecommunications, and air traffic control networks, cryptography
  safeguards national security.

       The second reason is that current national policy -- which
  discourages the use of cryptography despite its many valuable
  applications -- can at most delay encryption's spread.  Already, the use
  of such technologies is growing, and in the long run, we believe
  widespread non-governmental use of cryptography in the United States and
  abroad is inevitable.  The government should recognize this changing
  reality and help law enforcement and national security authorities
  develop the new technical capabilities they will need to conduct
  investigations and surveillance in a world in which information will be
  more protected and even unencrypted communications will be harder to
  read.

       Our report also urges that the government should explore escrowed
  encryption rather than the aggressive promotion that is the case today.
  Encrypted information is unintelligible to anyone lacking the keys to
  unlock the digital code.  In escrowed encryption, the decoding key would
  be held by a trusted third-party organization or institution.  This is
  attractive to law enforcement agencies because with a court order, they
  could obtain the key and unlock even the most unbreakable code.  However,
  escrowed encryption is relatively untried and many unresolved issues
  remain, ranging from the liability of these third parties to the
  magnitude of the risk incurred by companies trusting these third parties
  with the keys to their sensitive business plans and trade secrets.

       Rather than aggressively promoting escrowed encryption, our
  committee believes that the government should explore escrowed encryption
  for its own purposes as a way of gaining operational experience with this
  technology and making it more useful to the commercial sector.  Even when
  that occurs, we say that adoption of escrowed encryption or of any other
  specific technology or standard by the commercial sector should be
  voluntary and based on business needs, not government pressure.

            To make it easier for U.S. companies with foreign customers and
  suppliers to protect their information with the best encryption
  technologies, the committee believes that export controls should be
  progressively relaxed, though not eliminated. Right now federal law makes
  it hard to export strong encryption technology.  This helps protect the
  government's ability to gather foreign intelligence.  However, it also
  makes it more difficult for U.S. technology vendors to produce and sell
  cryptography products both here and overseas, and it limits what's
  available here because software companies are reluctant to develop
  different products for U.S. and foreign markets.

       And we call on the executive and legislative branches to develop
  national cryptography policy on the basis of open public discussion.  In
  the past, government officials have treated many aspects of cryptography
  policy as "top secret," to be discussed only behind closed doors.  This
  has led to considerable public distrust and resistance, which makes it
  impossible to achieve consensus.

       In our report we point to a number of specific areas such as
  telecommunications and banking where the government should actively
  promote the adoption of encryption. For example, the privacy of the
  cellular phone and the security of the nation's telecommunications
  networks should be enhanced through the use of cryptography.  In the case
  of the cellular phone many people have at home, the digital signals sent
  between the cell phone and the cell's ground station could be encrypted.
  This would prevent eavesdroppers from listening in on conversations.

       Overall, we believe that adoption of our recommendations would lead
  to enhanced protection and privacy for individuals and businesses in a
  many areas, while also bolstering the international competitiveness of
  U.S. companies.

       My colleagues and I will now entertain questions from the media.
  Before asking a question, please step to an aisle microphone and state
  your name and affiliation.

REP. GOODLATTE ASKS PRESIDENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH ENCRYPTION POLICY

Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), lead sponsor of S.A.F.E., the Security and 
Freedom Through Encryption Act, was joined by Tom Campbell (R-CA), Zoe 
Lofgren (D-CA), Anne Eshoo (D-CA), Bob Barr (R-GA), Eliot Engle (D-NY), and 
a bipartisan group of 21 of their colleagues in the House in writing 
President Clinton asking him not to proceed with his Administration's key 
escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize 
export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products.

&quot;I have received recent information that the Administration is 
circulating yet another version of a key escrow proposal for comments 
from selected individuals.  In my opinion this proposal is a non-starter and 
will not do.  It's just a back door approach for more big government 
intrusion into every American's privacy,&quot; said Goodlatte.

The Honorable William J. Clinton
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. President:

 We are writing to ask you not to proceed with your Administration's key 
escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize 
export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products.

 Many of us have sponsored H.R. 3011, the &quot;Security and Freedom 
Though Encryption (SAFE) Act&quot; which would ensure the continued
ability of Americans to use and sell good encryption and would permit
the export of generally available software with encryption capabilities
and other such software and hardware under license when certain 
conditions are met.  We understand that the Administration has developed
a key escrow encryption proposal and is not at this time willing to ease 
export restrictions on encryption programs and products which are widely
available from domestic and foreign companies and the Internet.

 We share the concerns of a wide range of businesses and privacy interests
that a key escrow approach will not adequately address security concerns.
The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that the information they
send over communications and computer networks is secure is a prerequisite
to exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure.  For 
example, U.S. small businesses are beginning to harness the Internet to enter
foreign markets.  The Internet in effect lowers the barriers to entry for 
these companies.  But they will not be able to rely on the Internet if their 
information is not secure.

 We also have serious concerns about the impact of the Administration's 
policy on the U.S. economy and job creation.  (Indeed, it is our strong belief
the U.S. economic interests must be a primary consideration in encryption 
policy discussions with other countries, the OECD, and in other forums.  It is 
not clear that this has been the case in the discussions held up to this point).

 A recent report entitled &quot;A Study of the International Market for 
Computer Software With Encryption&quot; prepared by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce and the National Security Agency indicated that U.S. companies will 
lose market share given the availability of stronger encryption products 
overseas.  The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that unless the U.S. 
relaxes out-of-date export controls, the U.S. technology industry will lose $60 
billion in revenues and 200,000 jobs by the year 2000.
	
 As Congress begins to consider H.R. 3011 we would greatly appreciate knowing 
whether the Administration plans to publish a final rule implementing a key 
escrow encryption proposal or, alternatively, will relax export controls on 
encryption programs and products which do not have a key escrow feature.

					Sincerely,


Tom Campbell          Bob Goodlatte

<H2>Closing Comments<BR>
By Chairman Robert Pitofsky</H2>
<P>
<H3>FTC Public Workshop on Consumer Privacy<BR>
on the Global Information Infrastructure
<P>
June 5, 1996</H3>
<P>

<PRE>
     Chairman Pitofsky:  The hour is late and I will be 
brief.  We started off by thanking the staff for putting 
together this wonderful set of hearings.  I would like 
to thank with equal enthusiasm the participants in these 
programs, and the audience, for playing a part in such 
an informed an thoughtful way.
     This agency has a history of bringing people 
together, exchanging views, gathering facts, framing 
issues.  And I can't think of a more appropriate area to 
do that in than where the commercial world meets the 
future.  And that's the way I felt about these two days 
of hearings.
     I am extremely encouraged by the efforts that have 
already taken place by people who are drafting 
guidelines, and I share Dan Jaffe's thought that there 
is some convergence here.  At least there is a 
convergence in the sense that all participants think 
this is an important problem that needs to be addressed.
     There has been some talk, especially in the last 
hour or so, about whether voluntary guidelines ever 
work.  I don't think it's appropriate to go into a 
project like this with the assumption that voluntary 
guidelines will not work.
     This agency has been burned in the past by groups 
who suggested voluntary guidelines and then they weren't 
worth the paper they were written on.  On the other 
hand, there are other voluntary groups that developed 
self-regulatory programs that worked very well.  And 
were supplemented, in some instances, by agency 
enforcement behind those guidelines.
     It's one thing to be skeptical, and to be demanding 
and rigorous about what the guidelines are.  But I just 
don't see any -- I don't think it's appropriate to start 
off with the assumption that they won't work and that we 
have to have government regulation.
     Believe it or not, there are some people who think 
government regulation doesn't work all that well either.  
And in an era in which all of government must do more 
with less, we cannot afford to ignore the possibility 
that cooperation and collaboration will lead to the 
appropriate result.
     We will prepare a report on these sessions.  The 
report will, I hope, reflect all, or most, of the views 
that were expressed here.  I think that several people 
have suggested focus groups on some of these subjects, 
and I gather there is already some interest on the part 
of independent groups of doing exactly that sort of 
thing.
     There is too much information, too many issues have 
been explored here to try to digest them at this point, 
but we will have a report.  And with that report, we 
will see where we go from there.
     I want to thank all of you for your excellent 
participation in these sessions.
     (Whereupon, at 1:12 p.m., the workshop was 
adjourned.)

    <TITLE>CDT Press Release - Markey/Online Privacy</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffcc">
<H2>CDT Press Release regarding Rep. Markey Legislation</H2>
<BR>
For Immediate Release<BR>
June 20, 1996<BR>
<H3>CDT APPLAUDS LEGISLATION TO PROTECT PRIVACY IN CYBERSPACE</H3>
<BR>
The Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) commends Congressman Markey
(D-MA) on the introduction of the Communications Privacy and Consumer Empowerment
Act (CPCEA).  The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal
Communications Commission to ensure that the developing communications infrastructure
supports the core privacy principles of notice and individual control. 
The FTC is currently examining privacy on the Internet.  The CPCEA directs
the FTC and FCC to report their findings to Congress within one year and
directs each to issue rules where they find a lack of privacy protection.<BR>
<BR>
Currently few people are aware of the vast amount of personal information
generated and captured -- and potentially used and disclosed -- during the
use of interactive communications media.  Most individuals visit Web sites,
read articles, and examine pictures under the false illusion that their
activities are anonymous or at least unobserved.  In an effort to increase
public demand for privacy protection, CDT recently launched a <A HREF="http://www.cdt.org/privacy/">privacy
demonstration Web site  -- http://www.cdt.org.privacy/</A> -- which greets
each visitor with detailed personal information including their name, email
address, computer and browser type and the universal resource locator (URL)
indicating the Web site from which they came.  <BR>
<BR>
While interactive media offers new challenges to privacy, CDT believes that
the development and implementation of technologies that empower users of
interactive communications media to affirmatively control personal information
can fundamentally shift the balance of power between the individual and
those seeking information.  CDT believes this technological shift is possible
and necessary, and offers us an unprecedented opportunity to advance individual
privacy.  However, this shift will only occur if interactive media is harnessed
to advance individual privacy.  <BR>
<BR>
The CPCEA strongly embodies this approach.  It looks to Government as the
ultimate guarantor of core privacy principles of notice and informed consent
regarding personal information collection and dissemination on the information
highway, but adopts a process which looks to the private sector and consumer
and privacy organizations to work together to develop standards, practices
and individual control technologies---such as the Platform for Internet
Content Selection (PICS), cyberpatrol, and surfwatch--- to empower people
to control personal information about themselves during interactions with
commercial and non-commercial entities online.  As Jerry Berman, CDT Executive
Director stated, &quot;It is designed to provide strong privacy protection,
but avoid centralized, burdensome data board solutions which could cripple
the Internet and threaten free speech rights with the creation of a veritable
'Privacy Exon'.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Rather than responding to the very real risks posed by new technology
with the Luddite-call of &quot;smash the machine,&quot; we are calling for
a reversal of the technological status quo by demanding that technology
be designed to empower people.  We are pleased that Congressman Markey recognizes
the unique potential of the Internet to advance individual control over
personal information,&quot; said CDT Deputy Director Janlori Goldman. <BR>
<BR>
CDT hails the introduction of the CPCEA, and believes that if enacted it
will help to spur all content providers and access providers to establish
the important privacy principles of &quot;Knowledge, Notice, and No&quot;
as rules of the road for the Digital Age. <BR>

REP. GOODLATTE ASKS PRESIDENT NOT TO PROCEED WITH ENCRYPTION POLICY

Congressman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), lead sponsor of S.A.F.E., the Security and 
Freedom Through Encryption Act, was joined by Tom Campbell (R-CA), Zoe 
Lofgren (D-CA), Anne Eshoo (D-CA), Bob Barr (R-GA), Eliot Engle (D-NY), and 
a bipartisan group of 21 of their colleagues in the House in writing 
President Clinton asking him not to proceed with his Administration's key 
escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize 
export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products.

&quot;I have received recent information that the Administration is 
circulating yet another version of a key escrow proposal for comments 
from selected individuals.  In my opinion this proposal is a non-starter and 
will not do.  It's just a back door approach for more big government 
intrusion into every American's privacy,&quot; said Goodlatte.

The Honorable William J. Clinton
The White House
Washington, D.C. 20500

Dear Mr. President:

 We are writing to ask you not to proceed with your Administration's key 
escrow encryption policy proposal and instead to immediately liberalize 
export controls on non-key escrow encryption programs and products.

 Many of us have sponsored H.R. 3011, the &quot;Security and Freedom 
Though Encryption (SAFE) Act&quot; which would ensure the continued
ability of Americans to use and sell good encryption and would permit
the export of generally available software with encryption capabilities
and other such software and hardware under license when certain 
conditions are met.  We understand that the Administration has developed
a key escrow encryption proposal and is not at this time willing to ease 
export restrictions on encryption programs and products which are widely
available from domestic and foreign companies and the Internet.

 We share the concerns of a wide range of businesses and privacy interests
that a key escrow approach will not adequately address security concerns.
The ability of companies and individuals to ensure that the information they
send over communications and computer networks is secure is a prerequisite
to exploiting the potential of the Global Information Infrastructure.  For 
example, U.S. small businesses are beginning to harness the Internet to enter
foreign markets.  The Internet in effect lowers the barriers to entry for 
these companies.  But they will not be able to rely on the Internet if their 
information is not secure.

 We also have serious concerns about the impact of the Administration's 
policy on the U.S. economy and job creation.  (Indeed, it is our strong belief
the U.S. economic interests must be a primary consideration in encryption 
policy discussions with other countries, the OECD, and in other forums.  It is 
not clear that this has been the case in the discussions held up to this point).

 A recent report entitled &quot;A Study of the International Market for 
Computer Software With Encryption&quot; prepared by the U.S. Department of 
Commerce and the National Security Agency indicated that U.S. companies will 
lose market share given the availability of stronger encryption products 
overseas.  The Computer Systems Policy Project estimates that unless the U.S. 
relaxes out-of-date export controls, the U.S. technology industry will lose $60 
billion in revenues and 200,000 jobs by the year 2000.
	
 As Congress begins to consider H.R. 3011 we would greatly appreciate knowing 
whether the Administration plans to publish a final rule implementing a key 
escrow encryption proposal or, alternatively, will relax export controls on 
encryption programs and products which do not have a key escrow feature.

					Sincerely,


Tom Campbell          Bob Goodlatte

(1) NEW EXPORT CONTROL REPEAL BILL CHALLENGES CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S GRIP ON
    US ENCRYPTION POLICY

In a move to replace the Cold War-era regulations on encryption with
policies that make sense for the global Internet, Senators Burns (R-MT),
Dole (R-KS), Leahy (D-VT), Pressler (R-SD), Wyden (D-OR), and others today
introduced legislation to roll back the restrictions prohibiting the export
of strong encryption technology.  This historic legislation promises to
inject the debate over privacy and security on the Internet into the 1996
presidential campaign.

The bill, entitled the "Promotion of Commerce On-Line in the Digital Era
(Pro-CODE) Act of 1996", is designed to encourage the widespread
availability of strong, easy-to-use privacy and security technologies for
the Internet. It is similar to a bill introduced in March by Senators Leahy
and Burns, though the new bill does not contain criminal provisions or
provisions imposing liability for third party key holders.

Over 25 public interest organizations, and computer and communications
companies, including Microsoft, Netscape, America Online, EFF, VTW, and
Americans for Tax Reform, expressed support for this effort in a letter
sent today to the sponsors of the bill.  A list of signatories and excerpts
of the letter are included below.

Among other things, the "Pro-CODE" would:

* Allow the export of "generally available" or "public domain"
  encryption software such as PGP and popular World Wide Web browsers
  without requiring NSA authority.

* Allow the export of encryption hardware and software not available in
  the "mass market" or "public domain" under an export scheme that would
  allow up to roughly DES-strength (i.e., 56 bit key-length) security.
  if a product of similar strength is commercially available from a
  foreign supplier

* Prohibit the government from imposing mandatory key-escrow encryption
  schemes domestically, or from restricting the sale of commercial
  encryption products within the United States

* Prohibit the Department of Commerce from imposing government designed
  standards for encryption technologies (such as Clipper and Clipper
  II).

For more information, including the text of the bill, analysis, and
relevant background materials, visit CDT's Cryptography Policy Issues Page
at (http://www.cdt.org/crypto/).

CDT commends Senators Burns, Dole, Leahy, Wyden, Pressler, and the other
sponsors of this proposal for their efforts to bring strong privacy and
security technologies into the hands of Internet users, and for creating an
opportunity for a national debate on the need to reform US policy towards
encryption. We look forward to working with these and other members of
Congress, the computer and communications industry, public interest groups,
and the Internet Community as the bill makes its way through Congress.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* SENATORS TO GO ONLINE TO DISCUSS BILLS, TAKE COMMENTS FROM NETIZENS

In an effort to bring the Internet Community into the debate and encourage
members of Congress to work with the Net.community on vital Internet policy
issues, Senator Burns and Senator Leahy will participate in live, online
discussions of the new legislation. CDT and VTW, who are helping to
coordinate these events, will publish the transcripts of the sessions and
encourage Netizens to participate.

Please join Senator Burns live online to discuss the Pro-CODE bill on:

* MONDAY, MAY 6 AT 9:00 PM ET IN AMERICA ONLINE'S NEWS ROOM AUDITORIUM

  Note that you will have to join AOL participate in this chat. (If you
  aren't currently an AOL member, you can obtain the software by either
  a) finding one of those pervasive free floppy disks, or b) by using
  ftp to get it from ftp.aol.com (ftp://www.aol.com/)

* MONDAY, MAY 13 AT 9:00 ET AT HotWired's CLUB WIRED

  Visit http://www.hotwired.com/ for more information.

Senator Leahy will also conduct sessions on America Online and HotWired in
the next several weeks, dates and times are TBA (visit
http://www.crypto.com for updates)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
* BROAD COALITION OF BUSINESSES, PUBLIC INTEREST GROUPS ANNOUNCE SUPPORT FOR
  ENCRYPTION EXPORT RELIEF, LAUNCH PUBLIC EDUCATION EFFORT

In a letter sent to Senators Burns (R-MT), Dole (R-KS), Leahy (D-VT),
Pressler (R-SD) Wyden (D-OR), Murray (D-WA) and the other sponsors of the
Pro-CODE proposal, a broad coalition of computer and communications
companies, public interest and privacy organizations across the political
spectrum announced support for legislative efforts to relax encryption
export controls as well as plans to conduct a broad effort to raise public
awareness on the need to reform encryption policy.

The letter states, "Current U.S. Export controls and other regulations on
encryption technologies are stifling electronic commerce on the Internet,
handicapping U.S. industry in the global marketplace, and preventing
computer users from protecting their privacy online."

The full text of the letter is available at CDT's Crypto issues web page
(http://www.cdt.org/crypto/).

Some of the 25 groups joining the effort include the American Bankers
Association, Americans for Tax Reform, America Online, Bellcore, Business
Software Alliance, CDT, Compuserve, EFF, the Institute for Justice, Lotus,
The Media Institute, Microsoft, Netscape, Novell, Oracle Corp., Pacific
Telesis, People for the American Way, Prodigy, Securities Industry
Association, Software Publishers Association, Sybase, the Telecommincations
Industry Association, the Voters Telecommunications Watch (VTW), and
others.

The groups also announced a large-scale public education campaign designed
to raise public awareness of the importance of encryption to US
competitiveness and individual privacy, including an "encryption education
day" to be held in California's Silicon Valley in early July. The event
will bring together industry leaders, members of Congress, encryption
experts, and others to discuss the need to reform US encryption policy.
Similar events, to be held throughout the US and on the Net, are also being
planned.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2) BACKGROUND ON THE ENCRYPTION POLICY DEBATE

* Why is this issue important to Internet users?

Encryption technologies are the locks and keys of the Information age.
Encryption technology allows vital personal and commercial communications
to travel securely over insecure and inexpensive communications networks
like the Internet.

For far too long, the debate over US encryption policy has been dominated
by the NSA, FBI, and Clinton Administration, who continue to insist that
privacy, security, and the competitive advantage of the US computer and
communications industry must take a back seat to national security and law
enforcement interests.

While encryption products like PGP do allow the most computer-savvy among
us to communicate securely, there are few strong, widely available,
easy-to-use encryption applications available to Internet users.  This is
due in part to the Federal regulations which prohibit the export of strong
encryption.  As a result of these laws, US companies tend to build only one
version of an encryption product, with relatively weak encryption, in order
to sell to the global market.  This results in the limited availability of
strong encryption for domestic Internet users.

Worse, the Clinton Administration has attempted to leverage the desire of
US companies to sell strong encryption overseas to include features in
products that will allow the Federal Government easy access to the plain
text of encrypted communications.  The Administration has used the
standards promotion power of the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) to serve the narrow interests of the NSA as compared to
the broader interest of Internet users and US businesses.  These
"key-escrow" proposals, known as Clipper and Clipper II, have met with
stiff resistance from civil libertarians, Internet users, and the US
computer and communications industries.

While legitimate law enforcement and national security issues are important
factors in this debate, the need for individual privacy and security for
personal and commercial communications and data is vital to the future of
the Internet and other interactive communications technologies.  As a
result, the outcome of this policy debate will have tremendous implications
on your privacy and the future of the Internet.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=4>
On January 23, 1997, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) held an open forum to
explore the issue of congestion on the Internet.  That issue is part
of a larger debate over whether Internet service providers (ISPs) and
commercial online service providers should be charged access fees for the
use of the local telephone network.  CDT along with other public interest
reprsentatives, telephone companies, ISPs, and commercial online service
providers spoke at the forum:

<LI><A HREF="http://www.internetaccess.org/" TARGET="NEW">Internet Access Coalition</A>, an organization of industry groups opposed to the imposition of access charges for the use of local telephone networks.
</UL>

The FCC bandwidth forum comes amidst an FCC inquiry on the current state of
the Internet infrastructure.  Recently, several regional bell companies
have raised concerns that Internet usage is creating significant
congestion problems on their networks, and have suggested access charges as
a solution.  Online service providers and ISP's argued that the imposition
of access charges would harm the future growth of the Net.
<P>
CDT believes this issue is critically important to the future of the
Internet, and is working to ensure that the future Internet infrastructure
develops in a way that maximizes the democratic potential of the Net and
encourages a decentralized, open architecture. In the coming months we will
be holding public forums and other education events. Please continue to

an FCC ruling in this area would immediately restrict the ability
of Internet users to choose Internet software applications, and

On Thursday Feb 1, 1996, Congress approved legislation to dramatically restrict the First Amendment rights of Internet users.  With this act of Congress, the very same materials which are legally available today in book stores and libraries would be illegal if posted on World Wide Web sites or usenet newsgroups. With the stroke of President Clinton's pen, this bill transformed the Internet overnight from the freest communications medium to the most heavily regulated medium in the United States.
<p>
The measure, known as the <a href = "cda.html">Communications Decency Act</a>,  was part of a massive telecommunications reform bill which President Clinton signed into law Thursday Feb. 8, 1996.  In response, <a href = "#orgs">The Coalition to Stop Net Censorship</a> 
asked everyone, everywhere, to turn their World Wide Web pages black to show just  how broadly these new restrictions will  impact the Internet.  The protest was a tremendous succe
ss.  It received coverage in virtually every story about the President signing the Telecommunications Reform bill in national and regional newspapers, radio programs, and televison such as CNN, Headline News, and ABC news.
<p>
<a href = "black_links.html">Over 1500  Web Sites Participated in the 
Protest</a>, including: <ul> 
<li><a href  ="http://www.senate.gov/~leahy">Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT)</a>

<h2>More than 115,000 Signatures were collected in just under 5 months. Thank you to all who signed -- you made a difference!</h2>
<p>
<font size = +1>On August 4, 1995, the House of Representatives voted 420 - 4 to approve the Cox/Wyden Internet Freedom and Family Empowerment Amendment to the Telecommunications Reform bill (HR 1555). The Cox/Wyden bill would prevent the FCC from regulat


ing content on the Internet or other interactive media. The House also passed the Klink/Leahy study amendment.
<p>
The Exon/Coats Communications Decency Act was NOT passed by the House.
<p>
The House and Senate Telecommunications reform bills are currently being reconciled in a conference committee. No word yet on when the vote on final passage will occur. CDT and other online activist organizations are working to ensure that the Cox/Wyden b

<p>
<B>The Petition Statement</b>
<p>
We the undersigned users of the Internet are strongly opposed to the "Communications Decency Act" (Title IV of S. 652), which is currently pending before the Senate. This legislation will severely restrict our rights to freedom of speech and privacy guara


nteed under the constitution.
<p>
Based on our Nation's longstanding history of protecting freedom of speech, we believe that the Federal Government should have no role in regulating the content of constitutionally protected speech on the Internet.
<p>
We urge the Senate to halt consideration of the Communications Decency Act and consider in its place S. 714, the "Child Protection, User Empowerment, and Free Expression In Interactive Media Study Bill", an alternative approach offered by Senator Patrick 




Leahy (D-VT).

<p>
<b>Petition Rationale</b></a>
<p>
We oppose the "Communications Decency Act", sponsored by Senators James Exon (D-NE) and Slade Gorton (R-WA), for the following reasons:
<p>
<ul>
<li>It criminalizes the transmission of constitutionally protected speech, including the private communications between consenting individuals;
<p>
<li>It would violate privacy rights by protecting system administrators who take steps to ensure that their networks are not being used to transmit prohibited content, even if those steps include reading all messages.
<p>
<li>It fails to account for the unique characteristics of interactive media, including the tremendous control users have over the content they or their children receive.
<p>
<li>It would give the Federal Communications Commission jurisdiction over online speech by giving the FCC authority to establish rules governing the distribution of content online;
</ul><p>
The Internet and other interactive communications technologies offer a unique opportunity for the free exchange of information and ideas, and embody the very essence of our nation's democratic traditions of openness, diversity and freedom of speech.  
<p>
As users of these technologies, we know perhaps better than anyone that there are other, less restrictive ways to protect children from controversial materials while preserving the First Amendment and the free flow of information.
<p>
Senator Leahy's bill provides an opportunity to address the issues raised by the Communications Decency Act without restricting the free speech and privacy rights of users.

<p>
<P>
<b>Status of the CDA -- Senate Vote Expected Soon</b>
<p>
The Senate is expected to on vote the Communications Decency Act (CDA, a.k.a. the Exon Bill) within the next three weeks. 
<p>
The Communications Decency Act, in its current form, would severely restrict your rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression online, and represents a grave threat to the very nature and existence of the Internet as we know it today. Without you


r help now, the Communications Decency Act will likely pass and the net may never be the same again.
<p>
Although the CDA has been revised to limit the liability of online service providers, it would still criminalize the transmission of any content deemed "obscene, lewd, lacivious, filthy, or indecent," including the private communications between consentin


g adults. Even worse, some conservative pro-censorship groups are working to amend the CDA to make it even more restrictive.
<p>
Currently, Senator Exon is negotiating with conservative pro-censorship groups and commercial entities that would be affected by the CDA. The voices of Internet users must be heard now. We need to demonstrate that we are a political force to be reckoned w


ith.
<p>
In an effort to preserve your rights in cyberspace, Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) has introduced the only legislative alternative to the Communications Decency Act.  Senator Leahy is willing to offer his bill as a substitute for the CDA, but needs your sup


port behind his efforts.
<p>
Senator Leahy's legislation would commission a study to examine the complex issues involved in protecting children from controversial content while preserving the First Amendment, the privacy rights of users, and the free flow of information in cyberspace


. 
<p>
<a href ="#sign">Sign the Petition</a>
<a name ="another"></a>
<hr size = 2>
<p>
<b>ANOTHER PETITION?</b>
<p>
Yes.  With a strong showing of support from the net.community, Senator Leahy can offer his bill as a substitute for the Communications Decency Act when the Senate votes on the issue later this month.  Senator Leahy needs and wants to demonstrate to his co


lleagues in the Senate that the net.community is behind him in his efforts. We must rise to the task and demonstrate that we will not sit idly by as our rights are threatened.
<p>
Senator Leahy, a strong civil liberties advocate, has been the Senate's most vocal critic of the Exon/Gorton Communications Decency Act, and has taken a leading role in defending the rights and civil liberties of Internet users.  Senator Leahy has taken a


great political risk in representing the interests of Internet users on Capitol Hill.  The time has come for us to show our appreciation and our support for his efforts.
<p>
The previous petition against the Communications Decency Act generated over 108,000 signatures, and was instrumental in Senator Leahy's decision to offer his alternative   As the Senate moves to vote on the CDA, we must act quickly to ensure that our coll


ective voice continues to be heard.
<p>
<a href ="#sign">Sign the Petition</a>
<a name ="leahy"></a>
<hr size = 2>
<p>
<b>WHAT IS LEAHY PROPOSING?</b>
<p>
Senator Leahy's bill, S. 714, would direct the Department of Justice and the Department of Commerce to commence a 5 month study to examine:
<ul>
<li>Current law enforcement authority to prosecute the distribution of pornography over computer networks;
<p>
<li>Whether any additional law or law enforcement resources are necessary;
<p>
<li>The availability of technological capabilities, consistent with the First Amendment and the free flow of information in Cyberspace, to protect children from accessing controversial commercial and non-commercial content;
<p>
<li>Ways to promote the development and deployment of such technologies.
</ul><p>
After conducting the study, the Justice Department must report to Congress on its findings, and, if necessary, recommend changes in current law.
<p>
Leahy's bill represents the only substantive legislative alternative to the Communications Decency Act, and will buy important time to have a detailed and rational discussion about the issues involved in protecting children from controversial content, and


 avoid the rush to censorship which is occurring now on the Senate Floor.  
<p>
Without a strong show of support for Leahy's bill, the Communications Decency Act is very likely to pass.

<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy Part III: State of Current Law</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Part III. Prosecution of Obscenity, Child Pornography, and Other 
Violations of Criminal Law in Interactive Media Proceeding Under Current Law</h2>
<p>
As the Internet and other interactive media become more fully 
integrated into the fabric of our society it is sad, but not surprising, that 
criminal behavior has begun to appear online.  Already cases of consumer 
fraud and theft of intellectual property have been reported and prosecuted.  
Traffickers in obscenity and child pornography, too, have begun to use the 
Internet to facilitate their criminal behavior.  Notwithstanding the recent 
appearance of crime online, cyberspace is not left in a state of anarchy.  Federal 
criminal laws against transportation of obscenity, child pornography, and 
harassment have all been used successfully to prosecute criminal behavior 
online.
<P>
More vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws may be necessary, 
but law enforcement agencies and some prominent pro-family groups agree 
current laws already enable prosecutions of online obscenity violations.  The 
Justice Department has repeatedly stated that there are no gaps in current 
federal criminal laws prohibiting the distribution by computer of obscenity 
and child pornography.  Following this logic, it is unnecessary to amend 
federal law to prohibit distribution of obscenity by computer, since existing 
law already criminalizes such conduct, as well as threats made by computer.
<p>
<h2>A.	There is no anarchy in cyberspace:  Federal and state criminal 
laws already are used to prosecute criminal conduct in interactive media</h2>
<P>
Tough obscenity, child pornography and harassment laws are already 
in the federal criminal code.  Under existing Federal law trafficking in 
<b>obscenity</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.Sec.1462, 1464, 1466), <b>child pornography</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.2252), <b>harassment</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.875(c)), <b>illegal solicitation or luring of minors </b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.2423(b)), and <b>threatening to injure someone</b> (18 U.S.C. Sec.875(c)) have already been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer networks.  Notwithstanding all of the concern in the popular media and the United States Senate about this issue, all indications are that these and other laws fully cover all serious criminal behavior that may be perpetrated in cyberspace.
<p>
The Department of Justice and the American Family Association agree 
that existing laws already criminalize obscenity online.  The American Family 
Association, a prominent pro-family, anti-pornography group lead by a 
former federal prosecutor from the Reagan and Bush administrations wrote 
to Chairman Thomas Bliley:
<p>
"[T]he federal criminal code currently prohibits distribution of 
both child pornography and obscenity by computer."[1]
<P>
In a communication to Senator Leahy, the Justice Department agrees with 
this assessment:
<p>
"[W]e have applied current law to this emerging problem. . . . 
The Department's Criminal Division has, indeed, successfully 
prosecuted violations of federal child pornography and obscenity 
laws which were perpetrated with computer technology." [2]
<p>
Thus, while more enforcement resources may or may not be required, no case 
has been made that any new criminal laws are needed in this area. 
<p>
<h3>B.	Violations of obscenity, child pornography, and other criminal 
law online are being prosecuted</h3>
<p>
Even as the Congress rushes to enact new criminal laws, online 
obscenity and child pornography crimes are being prosecuted around the 
country under existing law.  According to the Justice Department:
<p>
<blockquote>"The Criminal Division's Child Exploitation and Obscenity 
Section is aggressively investigating and prosecuting the 
distribution of child pornography and obscenity through 
computer networks, and the use of computers to locate minors 
for the purpose of sexual exploitation."[3]</blockquote> 
<p>
To the extent that any obstacles arise, Congress should examine 
whether there is a need for additional training and resources for enforcement.  
The Justice Department, the agency responsible for investigating and 
prosecuting these crimes, sees no urgent need for legislation and instead has 
urged -- prior to any congressional action -- "in-depth analysis" of the 
"number of complex legal and policy issues" raised by the need to protect 
children while respecting the First Amendment and privacy rights of 
computer users.  The precise constitutional parameters, for example, of 
criminal obscenity laws and the application of community standards doctrine 
to interactive media are currently being decided by the courts.  If 
Congressional investigation determines that there are actual gaps in current 
law, it may, then, be appropriate to investigate modernization or clarification 
of existing law.
<p>
Ironically, the Communications Decency Act as passed by the United 
States Senate as part of the telecommunications reform bill, fails to add any 
protections against online stalking and child solicitation.  Everyone is 
concerned about protecting children from threats online and off.  The Senate-
passed Communications Decency Act, however, only punishes indecency and 
obscenity, not stalking or solicitation.  It offers no help to prosecutors or police 
in prevention of prosecution of online crimes against children.

<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy: Part I -- The Unique Nature of 
Interactive Media</title>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Part I.	Public Policy Reflecting Unique Nature of Interactive 
Media is Essential to Ensure the Potential of the National 
Information Infrastructure and Protect Children</h2>
<p>
<p>
The Internet and other interactive communications media are 
fundamentally decentralized media.  Unlike centralized broadcast radio and 
television services, there are no central control points through which either a 
single network operator or government censors can control particular 
content.  On the Internet there are literally millions of speakers and 
publishers.  This proliferation of individual speakers stands in sharp contrast 
to broadcast television or even cable television, where one may count five, 
ten or perhaps one hundred speakers, each of whom controls a channel.  
Federal broadcast content regulators can direct their regulations at the 
operators of a particular channel in order to enforce their regulations.  
However, content control on the Internet would have to be targeted at each 
and every one of the millions of US citizens and international users that 
speak daily online.  Any attempt to impose centralized content control in a 
bureaucratic manner on this fundamentally decentralized medium is bound 
to stifle the growth of the medium, squander the democratic potential of the 
Internet, and may even cut the United States off from the growing global 
information infrastructure.
<p>
<h3>A.	Attempts at "Command and Control" regulation of content 
online will stifle innovation in interactive media</h3>
<p>
As a decentralized medium, the Internet and other interactive services 
have flourished in a largely unregulated environment.  Indeed, recent 
Congressional decisions to commercialize the Internet has lead to a 
tremendous increase in the number of users who have access to the Internet 
and great innovations such as the World Wide Web.  Indeed, the innovative, 
entrepreneurial Internet marketplace has even produced a variety of software 
and services that help protect children from inappropriate material online.  
Imposition of content regulations and extension of Federal Communications 
Commission jurisdiction over standards and technologies would seriously 
retard the growth of the Internet marketplace.  What's more, FCC content 
control is unlikely to be effective in protecting children.
<p>
<h3>B.	Heavy-handed content regulation will squander the democratic 
potential of interactive media</h3>
<p>
As the popularity and accessibility of the Internet and commercial 
online services grows, and as the medium becomes easier to use, the political 
uses of the net have flourished.  Political discourse is facilitated by a variety of 
different communications techniques possible online, including newsgroups, 
mailing list discussion groups, chat sessions, and a host of electronic 
publishing capabilities.  Any regulation creating criminal penalties for 
communication of indecent material would have a substantial chilling effect 
on all who use interactive media.  Such a chilling effect would severely 
inhibit the growth of the Internet as a political forum.  
<p>
Political groups[1] left,[2] right,[3] and center are using the Internet to 
communicate, to organize, and to advocate their own views.  Advocacy 
organizations have found World Wide Web services are critical to political 
education activities, and an increasing number of grass roots and community 
groups are coming to rely on the Internet to keep in touch with members and 
constituents.  In fact, even some Senators offices are using the World Wide 
Web to communicate with and solicit feedback from constituents.[4]  As a 
nation we should be encouraging political discourse in this new medium, 
because of it potential to raise the level of political discussion beyond the 
sound bite and to involve more citizens in the political process.  Encouraging 
political discourse in interactive media requires that all users are assured that 
their First Amendment and privacy rights will be respected fully.
<p>
Indeed, the Internet and other online services are fast becoming a new 
public forum for political discourse for American citizens.  In order to 
preserve the freedom and openness of this new political arena, it is critical to 
avoid creating a chilling effect on individual expression.

<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy: Part II -- Parental Control 
Technologies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Part II.	Parental and User Control Technologies Available Today 
to Screen Unwanted Content</h2>
<p>
<p>
<h3>Overview -- Dealing With Inappropriate Material in Cyberspace Through Technology</h3>
<p>
Interactive media such as the Internet and commercial online services 
such as America Online and Prodigy offer users tremendous control over the 
information that they and their children receive. Unlike traditional mass 
media which "assaults" viewers with content, interactive media requires 
users to seek out information from any number of the millions of available 
World Wide Web sites, online file archives (ftp, and gopher), and from any of 
the more than 3000 Usenet newsgroups.
<p>
The vast majority of the content available on interactive media is 
related to normal every day topics such as politics, educational resources, 
sports, consumer information, shopping, to name just a few. In addition, 
millions of people use the Internet every day to conduct business, socialize, 
organize political activities, and communicate on issues of interest to them. 
However, just like in the terrestrial world, there are areas of cyberspace which 
may contain materials that are not appropriate for children. 
<p>
Preventing children from successfully gaining access to such material is 
an important issue which must be addressed. However, because cyberspace is 
a global network with millions of users, active policing of content by 
governments, besides the obvious implications for free speech and privacy 
rights, is simply not a practical or effective solution.
<p>
There is a growing market for applications that empower users and 
parents to control their children's access to inappropriate materials on the 
Internet and commercial online services.  This document provides an 
extensive (though by no means exhaustive) overview of some of the 
technologies currently available.  All but two of the tools mentioned here are 
currently available to consumers across the country.
<p>
Four categories of technological options are examined here, each 
provides a slightly different, but equally effective, point of intervention.
<p>
<b>1.	Commercial Online Services Parental Control Features</b>
<p>
The Parental Control Feature of three of the most popular commercial 
online services (America Online, Prodigy, an Compuserve) are illustrated. 
These features are embedded in the service and are available to all subscribers 
of these services at no additional charge.
<p>
<b>2.	Features for the Home PC and Direct Internet Access</b>
<p>
For families that do not subscribe to one of the commercial online 
services but instead receive direct access to the Internet, there are a variety of 
products that run right on the home PC (SurfWatch, NET NANNY, and 
CYBERsitter). Some of these products are also compatible with and can run in 
addition to the parental control features available on the commercial services.
<p>
<b>3.	Applications for Schools and Businesses</b>
<p>
Schools and corporations can employ server based technologies such as 
the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack to prevent users from accessing 
inappropriate content while in the classroom or at the office.
<p>
<b>4.	Proposals for the Future</b>
<p>
In addition to these examples of products currently on the market, 
there is a innovative proposal being offered by Nathaniel Borenstein and 
Darren New. KidCode, a proposed Internet protocol, is a voluntary rating 
system that can prevent children from accessing content that may not be 
appropriate.
<p>
<p>
<h3>A. 	Child Protection in Commercial Online Services</h3>
<p>
Commercial online services such as America Online, Compuserve, 
and Prodigy offer technologies that allow parents to block their children's 
access to certain online forums where children might be exposed to 
inappropriate content.  Other services run filtering software which 
automatically screens messages posted to public forums that contain language 
inappropriate to children.
<p>
<b>1.	America Online Parental Control Features</b>
<p>
America Online (AOL), one of the large commercial online service 
providers, contains a feature which allows parents to prevent their children 
from accessing interactive discussion forums (a.k.a. "Chat Rooms"). A small 
minority of these forums, which are areas provided by America Online and 
are accessible only to AOL's subscribers, sometimes contain language and 
other discussion which may not be suitable for children. Parents are 
empowered to prevent their children from accessing these areas simply by 
selecting a menu option and entering a password. The block out function 
cannot be de-activated without the password. 
<p>
America Online also offers parents the ability to block access to Usenet 
newsgroups based on keywords, subject matter, or specific newsgroups. For 
example, parents can configure their system to block access to newsgroups 
containing the word "sex", or can block access to specific news groups such as 
"alt.sex.binaries.pictures". This mechanism is not exclusive to sexually 
explicit materials -- the software can be configured to block access to groups 
based on any keyword. Configuring this system is as simple as clicking a 
button and describing the keywords or groups to be blocked. 
<p>
Concerned parents, even if they are less computer literate than their 
childnre, have easy access to these control features.  AOL provides telephone 
help, detailed instructions and advice for parents. There is no additional cost 
for this service, and, like the other parental control features on AOL, the 
feature cannot be turned off without a password known only to the parent.
<p>
Finally, on July 17, 1995, America Online announced that they had 
entered a partnership with SurfWatch Software (described below).  Starting in 
the fall of 1995 AOL will provide SurfWatch as part of is regular service, 
preventing children from accessing sites on the Internet known to contain 
sexually explicit material.  SurfWatch will run continuously, unless disabled 
by the parent, and will provide a further layer of protection for children who 
use America Online.
<p>
<b>2.	Prodigy Internet access restrictions</b>
<p>
Prodigy runs special screening software that monitors messages posted 
to public bulletin boards and chat rooms on the Prodigy network, and 
automatically blocks messages which contain language  (such as the "seven 
dirty words"), and other content deemed inappropriate for children.
<p>
Like all the major commercial online services, Prodigy offers users 
access to the Internet. Prodigy will not provide customers access to the 
Internet without the authorization by the head of the household (the 
principal account holder). The authorization is made at the time of the 
account setup and requires credit card verification. This additional child 
protection feature is designed to ensure that parents are aware that their child 
has access to the Internet where Prodigy cannot control the content.
<P>
Finally, Prodigy offers parents the ability to monitor which sites their 
child has visited on the World Wide Web.  Each time a site is visited, the 
Prodigy software records that site in a log which can be displayed at a later 
time.  Parents can keep track of where their children have gone in cyberspace, 
and can instruct their children not to visit sites which may contain 
inappropriate materials (based on their own personal values).
<p>
<b>3.	Compuserve: Internet in a Box for kids</b>
<p>
Compuserve, another of the large commercial online services, recently 
announced a partnership with SPRY Inc. (makers of the popular "Internet in 
a Box") and is currently developing two child protection features: Internet In 
a Box for Kids, and KidNet.
<p>
Internet In a Box for Kids contains a program called Crossing Guard, 
which will allow parents to control their children's access to the by blocking 
access to sites that may contain inappropriate materials. Crossing Guard will 
also allow parents to monitor their children's online activities and set timers 
to control when and how long their children can surf the net.
<p>
Parents who purchase Internet In a Box for Kids will automatically 
become subscribers to KidNet, an electronic community designed specifically 
for kids. The site will allow members to congregate, chat, exchange 
information, shop, and play interactive games. All content on KidNet will be 
closely monitored to ensure that it is appropriate for children. The area will 
also be designed to offer teachers and adults access to educational sites, school 
networks and other resources for education and information geared to kids. 
KidNet will also include a home page builder that will allow kids to develop 
their own Internet resources.
<p>
The product will begin shipping in the Fall of 1995. Information 
is currently available at the Compuserve/Spry Home Page: 
http://www.spry.com
<p>
<h3>B.	Parental Empowerment Applications for the Home PC and 
Direct Internet Access</h3>
<p>
Although many parents subscribe to commercial online services such 
as those mentioned above, access to the global information highway is not 
limited to commercial online services. Many parents, educational 
institutions, and corporations choose to access the directly through an 
Internet Access Provider.  Unlike commercial online services, access 
providers generally do not provide any of their own content.  Because of this, 
parental control features must be initiated on the Home PC. 
<p>
There are a variety of software developers working on parental control 
features for this market. Some of these applications can be used in 
conjunction with commercial online services, over and above the parental 
control features provided by commercial services, while others are designed 
specifically for direct access.
<p>
<b>1.	'Surf Watch'</b>
<p>
Surf Watch Software is designed to provide parental control for 
families who do not subscribe to commercial online services.  SurfWatch 
allows parents to block their children's access to Usenet newsgroups, World 
Wide Web sites, gopher and file archives (ftp sites) which are known to 
contain sexually explicit material.  When activated with a private password 
held only by a parent, Surf Watch completely prevents any user from 
accessing these areas. The program is launched when the computer is started 
up, and operates when the parent is not present.
<p>
SurfWatch employs a group of professional "net.surfers" to find out 
and log sites on the where sexually explicit material is located. Sites are 
reviewed by a group of concerned parents and educators to determine the 
nature of the content, and those sites which meet specific criteria are added to 
a list which is embedded in the program.
<p>
SurfWatch software resides on the home PC. When activated, the 
program cross-checks every attempt to access Usenet newsgroups, world wide 
web, gopher, and ftp sites. Sites which are included on the list are blocked 
automatically.  Because the new sites are constantly appearing on the net, 
SurfWatch provides a subscription service that automatically updates the list 
of sites to be blocked, without any intervention required from the user. 
Subscribers can receive updates as frequently as they choose.
<p>
Surf Watch Software maintains the list of sites the program will block, 
and will make custom lists available if requested. SurfWatch will also soon 
provide users the ability to add an delete sites to their own custom lists  
<p>
SurfWatch is available now for under $50.00. Information on 
SurfWatch is available on the world wide web: 
http://www.surfwatch.com/
<p>
<b>2.	NET NANNY</b>
<p>
NET NANNY, developed by Net Nanny Ltd. of Vancouver BC Canada, 
is designed to prevent children from accessing areas on the Internet that a 
parent deems inappropriate, prevent children from giving their name, 
address, telephone number, credit card, or other personal information to 
strangers via email or chat rooms, and can log off an online service or shut 
down the computer when the child attempts any of these activities.
<p>
The program contains a dictionary in which the parent can enter the 
names of sites known to contain sexually explicit or other[1] material (e.g., the 
Usenet newsgroup "alt.sex" hierarchy, or the web site http://www.playboy.com). Parents may also enter phrases such as "what's 
your name?", "what's your phone number", "where do you live", or "are 
your parents home?". If anyone attempts to ask these questions, NET 
NANNY will automatically log off the network or shut down the computer.
<p>
NET NANNY can also be configured to block access to files on the PC's 
hard drive, floppy drive and CD-ROM, to prevent a child from accessing and 
altering the parent's financial records, work related files, and programs and 
files intended only for adults.
<p>
Finally, the program keeps a log of all activity that occurs on the 
computer, allowing parents to monitor their children's use of the computer.  
By using this feature, parents can determine if their children are using the 
computer to access inappropriate material, and can then augment the 
Dictionary to prevent further access.
<p>
NET NANNY is compatible with commercial online services and 
direct Internet access providers. The program is launched when the computer 
is started up, and operates when the parent is not present.
<p>
The program is available for Windows users for $49.95. More 
information can be found on the World Wide Web: 
http://www.netnanny.com/netnanny
<p>
<b>3.	'CYBERsitter'</b>
<p>
CYBERsitter, developed by Solid Oak Software in Santa Barbara 
California, allows parents to monitor their children's computer activity and 
can prevent a child from downloading image, sound, and video files. It will 
also prevent children from accessing files on the home PC hard drive such as 
financial information, business related files, CD-ROM titles, and anything else 
a parent determines their children should not have access to. The program is 
launched when the computer is started up, and operates when the parent is 
not present.
<p>
CYBERsitter keeps a log of all activity on the computer, including 
access to the, commercial online services, and local files on the hard drive, 
CD-ROMs and floppy disks, enabling parents to monitor their children's use 
of the computer.
<p>
CYBERsitter is available for $29.95. More information, and a free 
demonstration version of the product (for Windows) is available 
on the world wide web: http://www.solidaok.com/~solidoak
<p>
<h3>C.	Solutions in the Schools and Businesses -- Server Based 
Applications</h3>
<p>
In addition to the commercial online services and home access 
environments, may schools (from K-12 to universities) and corporations are 
beginning to provide access to the Internet. Many of these organizations are 
becoming increasingly concerned about the availability of not only sexually 
explicit materials, but also games, sports information, gambling sites, and 
other areas which may not be appropriate for access during school and work 
hours.
<p>
Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and WEBTrack provide 
schools and businesses the ability to block specific sites from access by all uses 
on the network, and to track an monitor use of the Internet.
<p>
<b>1.	Netscape Proxy Server</b>
<p>
The Netscape Proxy Server, developed by Netscape Communications 
Corporation (the developer of the popular World Wide Web browser), allows 
schools and business to block access to specific sites on the Internet, 
individual computers (IP addresses) and other information.  The Server 
operates in the background and does not require teachers or employees to 
have sophisticated programming knowledge or configure any feature. The 
systems administrator is responsible for operating the server and for 
maintaining the list of sites to be blocked.
<p>
The Server can be configured to block access to specified World Wide 
Web, file archives (ftp), and Gopher sites on the for users on the network on 
which the server is deployed. In other words, a school or business which runs 
the Netscape proxy server can prevent students or employees from accessing 
sites known to contain sexually explicit materials, information about drugs, 
gambling, sports, games, and anything else determined to be inappropriate for 
users on the network.
<p>
<b>2.	WEBTrack</b>
<p>
WEBTrack, developed by Webster Network Strategies in Naples 
Florida, allows businesses to block access to certain pre-determined sites on 
the Internet. The product gives businesses the capability to restrict access to 15 
categories of World Wide Web, Gopher, and ftp sites (including sexually 
explicit material, games, gambling, job search information, drugs, online 
merchandising, sports, humor, and others), while allowing full access to a 
wide variety of resources. The product is designed to promote the use of the 
Internet for business purposes while restricting recreational use.
<p>
On July 17, 1995, Webster Network Strategies announced that it would 
provide its software free to K-12 schools, ensuring that all of America's 
children who access the Internet from the classroom will not be able to 
stumble upon inappropriate material.
<p>
WEBTrack also allows corporate systems administrators to monitor 
employee use of the network in order to determine if an employee is using 
the to access materials which violate stated corporate policy.
<p>
WEBTrack is available for most major network servers, and 
costs approximately $7,500.  Updates of the site list are available 
on a subscription basis for $1,500 per year.
<p>
<b>D.	Future Applications and Protocol Solutions</b>
<p>
<b>1.	Information Highway Parental Empowerment Group</b>
<p>
A consortium assembled by Microsoft, Netscape Communications, and 
Progressive Networks recently announced plans to develop technical 
standards to enable voluntary rating of a variety of content available through 
the Internet and other online services.  These standards would enable content 
creators to voluntarily label their own content so that individuals and 
families can block the material, if they chose.  In addition, the Information 
Highway Parental Empowerment Group (IHPEG) will create standards to 
allow "third-party" rating of content online.  Much as TV Guide rates TV 
shows on broadcast television, IHPEG would enable multiple third-party 
rating of content available online.
<p>
<b>2.	KidCode</b>
<p>
Among the more innovative of proposals on the drawing boards is 
KidCode, currently being developed by Nathaniel Borenstein and Darren 
New. KidCode, a proposal for an Internet protocol designed to block access to 
sites based on a common voluntary rating system, is in the early stages of 
development, but would be compatible with all of the parental control 
applications currently on the market. 
<p>
KidCode is a proposed convention for labeling World Wide Web and 
other sites on the Internet as containing material which may not be suitable 
for children. There are an infinite number of possible categories (e.g., sexually 
explicit material, violent material, drug related material, etc.). 
<p>
Content providers and individuals who create web 'Home Pages' could 
voluntarily incorporate a standardized KidCode tag in the address of the site. 
Browser applications would be configured to read these tags and determine if 
the content on the site is appropriate for the viewing.
<p>
In addition, KidCode can accommodate third party ratings, age 
verification, and other factors. Finally, because KidCode is a voluntary rating 
system that may not be employed by every content provider on the, it can be 
configured to block access to sites that do not contain KidCode tags. In other 
words, if a site chooses not to use KidCode, a child using a KidCode enabled 
program would not be able to access that site regardless of the content it 
contains.
<p>
The Borenstein-New KidCode proposal is still in the early stages 
of development and has not yet been deployed. Further 
information can be obtained automatically by sending email to 
nsb+faq@nsb.fv.com. 
<p>
<h3>Prospects for the future</h3>
<p>
The products described here represent only a fraction of what is 
currently available to empower parents to protect their children from 
inappropriate material on the Internet.  Moreover,  these are only the 
beginning, as the industry is committed to developing more and better 
solutions, and the open nature of the Internet provides a wealth of 
possibilities for parental empowerment tools that may not yet have been 
imagined.
<p>
The availability of material on the Internet which may be 
inappropriate for children is a serious issue and one of `legitimate concern,  
However, because the Internet is a global network with millions of users, top-
down, command and control content restrictions simply cannot effectively 
control the availability of such materials.  The only effective way to protect 
children from inappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage the 
continued development and deployment of tools that empower parents to 
control their children's online activities based on their own individual tastes 
and preferences. The products descried here provide parents these tools, and 
can do so without the need for burdensome legislation or government 
imposed content restrictions. 
<p>

<i><b>Footnotes</i></b>
<p>
1 NOTE: The list of blocked sites is entirely determined by the parent. The parent can block access to sites that contain any materials they do not wish their children to access, including but not limited to games, drugs, rap music, violence, or guns. A Net Nanny spokesman indicated that pre-programmed lists will be available from the company soon.

<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy, Part IV -- Constitutional Issues Raised by 
Gvt. Content Restrictions in Interactive Media</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<h2>IV.	Censorship of Indecent Communications In Interactive 
Media Suffers Fundamental Constitutional Infirmity</h3>
<p>
Indecency restrictions have the acknowledged important purpose of 
protecting minors from access to controversial and inappropriate sexually 
explicit material.  However, such restrictions, especially if imposed on new 
interactive media, would be subject to serious constitutional challenge.  This 
section of the report will demonstrate five key constitutional points:
<p><ol>
<li><b>Censorship of indecent communications prohibited:</b>  General 
bans on indecent material are unconstitutional.
<p>
<li><b>Impermissibly intrusive means of achieving legitimate goal: </b> 
First Amendment jurisprudence requires that restrictions on 
speech adopt the "least restrictive means" available for 
achieving a compelling purpose.  Due to the availability of 
programs such as Surf Watch and the parental control features 
on America Online and other commercial services, blanket 
indecency restrictions are clearly not the "least restrictive 
means", and are unconstitutional on their face.
<p>
<li><b>Invasion of privacy:</b>  By criminalizing the content of private, 
non-obscene messages, the Senate-passed Communications 
Decency Act would force an invasion of the realm of private 
electronic communications and end the individual's ability to 
control the content of information he or she chooses to access in 
private.
<p>
<li><b>Creation of private censors:</b>  Holding service providers 
criminally-liable for the content of all messages that they carry 
will force providers to become private censors and prescreen all 
communications traveling across their system.
</ol><p>
Most importantly, statist, bureacratic command and control regulation 
of indecent material online fails to take advantage of the empowering aspects 
of new interactive media, which can allow parents and other users to exercise 
control over the information that to which they and their children have 
access.  
<p>
Legislating about new interactive media requires a careful 
understanding of the unique attributes of this new medium.  First and 
foremost, interactive media enable users (including parents) to exercise choice 
over the information to which they and their children have access.  In sharp 
contrast to older media, government content regulation is simply not 
necessary in order to shield children from possibly inappropriate 
information.  Furthermore, given the heavily fact-based determination 
required to justify regulation of indecency, legislative findings based on open 
hearings and a public record are essential before any legislation could pass 
constitutional muster.
<p>
Indecency restrictions for interactive media would enshrine in statute a 
sharp distinction between the print medium and new interactive media.  For 
example, though an individual is allowed to go into a bookstore and buy a 
sexually-explicit magazine or a "lewd" work of art, one would not be able to 
access the identical information over the Internet.  Both the interactive media 
and the print media are arenas in which individuals and organizations 
exercise core First Amendment free speech rights.  Before Congress elects to 
diminish the First Amendment protections available in this new medium, 
we believe that careful, public consideration is required.
<p>
<h3>A.	General prohibitions against indecent communications are 
unconstitutional</h3>
<p>
A general prohibition against indecent communications in interactive 
media would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United 
States.  The principle that each person should decide for him or herself the 
"ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration and adherence" lies 
at the heart of the First Amendment. Turner Broadcasting v. FCC, 114 U.S. 
2445 (1994)  This principle has been interpreted to mean that individuals 
should be able to speak freely and frankly about issues of their choosing, 
without fear of reprisal because many people may not agree with or appreciate 
the nature and content of their messages.  At the same time, the Supreme 
Court has recognized that despite this fundamental guarantee, there are 
certain kinds of speech that fall into a category of unprotected speech -- 
obscenity is one such category, indecency is not.[1]  
<p>
Because of the difficulty in defining obscenity in the context of the First 
Amendment, it took numerous attempts for the Supreme Court to find five 
justices to agree on defining principles.[2]  Finally, in 1973 the Supreme Court 
in Miller v. California,[3] established the definition of obscenity and the narrow area of sexually explicit speech that is unprotected by the Constitution.[4]  Since that time, the definition has not been expanded or changed.
<p>
By contrast, indecent speech which may include important political 
views, even if crudely stated, is protected by the First Amendment.  As such, 
government cannot enact a ban on such speech without illustrating a 
compelling governmental interest, and any restrictions on such speech must 
be accomplished in the least restrictive manner.[5]  
<p>
<h3>B.	Restrictions on indecent communications are unconstitutional 
for failure to adopt least restrictive means</h3>
<p>
<b>1.	Censorship of indecent, but not obscene, communications for 
the purpose of protecting minors must employ the least restrictive means available to accomplish their goal</b>
<p>
Indecent communications are protected by the First Amendment, 
unlike obscenity which is altogether unprotected.  Sable Communications of 
California v. FCC, 492 US 115; 109 S.Ct. 2829; 106 L.Ed. 2d 93 (1989). Indecent 
communications, which do not rise to the level of obscenity, can only be 
limited in order to serve a compelling state purpose and must be done using 
the least restrictive means possible.  Id. at 125.  The Sable court found that the 
protection of minors from access to indecent material is a compelling state 
purpose, but that "it is not enough that the Government's ends are 
compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends." Id.6  
<p>
As a threshold matter, the Sable court found that the constitutional 
basis for upholding indecency regulations in broadcast media articulated in 
Pacifica Foundation v. FCC, 438 US 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed. 2d 1073 (1978), 
were inapplicable in any other media besides over-the-air broadcasting.7  492 
U.S. at 127.  Pacifica upheld the FCC content regulation based on the dual 
finding that 1) radio was a "uniquely pervasive medium"8 that intruded 
(dirty words and all) into peoples homes, and 2) the only way to protect 
children from exposure to objectionable content was to keep it off the air 
altogether.9  Sable rejects this finding of "pervasiveness" as "emphatically 
narrow" and irrelevant to other media such as telephone audiotext services. 
492 U.S. at 127
<p>
Thus, the Sable "least restrictive means" standard became the test by 
which all regulations on access to indecent, but constitutional-protected, 
material were judged.  Nearly ten years of litigation along with adjustment of 
the statute and regulation were required before the current statute was found 
constitutional under this standard.  See Dial Information Services v. 
Thornburg, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir., 1991)(finding FCC regulations 
implementing Sec. 223(b) constitutional).  During the course of the dispute over 
the application of Sec. 223 to audiotext services, courts considered and rejected a 
number of means by which carriers were required to shield minors from 
access to indecent information.  First, time channeling rules, requiring that 
services only be accessible during hours when children were asleep, were 
found to violate the First Amendment because they had the effect of denying 
access to adults as well as children.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 749 F.2d 
113, 121 (2d Cir. 1984) (Carlin I).  Next, the courts rejected a requirement that 
carriers provide access to indecent services only once customers entered access 
codes or passwords, which were to be issued after verification that the 
customer was over 18.  Carlin Communications v. FCC, 787 F.2d 846 (2d Cir. 
1986)(Carlin II).
<p>
The finding of the Dial court, approving the constitutionality of Sec. 223 
and associated regulations depended on the legislative determination that the 
telephone company blocking of service pending age verification or use of a 
credit card are the only means to enable parents to restrict their children from 
access to indecent audiotext services.10  
<p>
<b>2.	Background on dial-a-porn rules:</b> 
<p>
As was the case for broadcast indecency restrictions considered in 
Pacifica, the dial-a-porn restrictions were only found constitutional because of 
the uniquely intrusive and uncontrollable nature of the audiotext services.  A 
key legislative motivation for imposing these rules during the 1980s was that 
indecent information available through audiotext services in the telephone 
system were openly available to children in such a way that it was difficult for 
parents to control access by their children.  The views of Congressman Bliley 
recounts the prevailing view of the need for the legislation: "It constitutes an 
attractive nuisance in every home in America where children are present. 
There is no completely effective way to prevent children from being exposed 
to "indecent" or "obscene" dial-a-porn so long as it is lawfully and 
commercially marketed. . . ."  Bliley continues:
<p>
<blockquote>"Telephones are precisely like radio and television because of their easy accessibility to children and the virtual impossibility for parents to monitor their use . . . . [D]ial-a-porn is presently in the home whether the homeowner wants it or not.  Today one cannot have telephone service in the privacy of one's family environment without being required to [have] dial-a-porn with it. Families with children must give up telephone service to be "left alone" from exposure of their children to this intruder."[11] </blockquote>
<p>
The current statute and Federal Communications Commission 
regulations promulgated thereunder were found constitutional after nearly 
ten years of litigation and efforts by Congress and the Commission to bring 
the statute within constitutionally acceptable bounds. Indecency restrictions 
applied to interactive media would require a wholesale review of the 
constitutionality as applied to new media such as online services and the 
Internet.  Interactive media operates in such a different manner, that the 
constitutional issues must be considered afresh given the new factual 
backdrop.  Mere extension of the current dial-a-porn rules to new media 
would be found unconstitutional in interactive media given the standards set 
out by the courts reviewing the Sec. 223 rules as they applied to older telephone 
technology.
<p>
<b>3.	Reliance on government censorship to restrict access to indecency fails to take into account the fact that interactive media offers parents a much greater degree of control then broadcast services or 900 number services.</b>
<p>
Indecency restrictions in interactive media would presumably be 
motivated by the same goal of protecting minors as the existing statute.   
However, the means adopted for achieving the goal are impermissible under 
the First Amendment because they are not the least restrictive means of 
accomplishing the legitimate government purpose.  Interactive media is 
materially different from analog telephone and audiotext technology in that it 
offers users the ability to exercise control over precisely what information one 
accesses.  Given the dramatic difference between telephone technology and 
interactive services such as the Internet and other interactive media, we 
believe that blocking by the carrier as demanded by Sec. 223 would not meet the 
"least restrictive means" test.  Just as the Sable court found broadcast 
indecency regulations inapplicable to the telephone system because of 
differences in the medium, regulations designed for audiotext services in the 
telephone system are constitutionally inapplicable to new interactive media.  
Indeed, indecency restrictions on material transport by US Mail have also 
been struck down by the Supreme Court precisely because "the receipt of mail 
is far less intrusive and uncontrollable"[12] than broadcast information that 
was the subject of the Pacifica case.
<p>
Technologies already exist that enable users to access certain information based on a variety of characteristics, or, to exclude certain types of 
information from access.[13]  With such filtering technology, users, instead of 
the government or network operators, can exercise control over the 
information content that they receive in an interactive network 
environment.  User control could be exercised in two ways.  First, one could 
screen out all messages or programs based on information in the header.  If a 
parent wanted to prevent a child from seeing a particular movie or from 
participating in a particular online discussion group, then the computer or 
other information appliance used by the child could be set by the parent to 
screen out the objectionable content.  Such features can often be protected 
with passwords which would be assigned, for example, by the responsible 
adults in the house.  Second, the same systems can be used to enable blocking 
of content based on third-party rating systems.
<p>
Given the flexibility of interactive technology, we need not rely on just 
one rating system.  In fact, a single rating system or a single set of filters would 
merely replace a single government censor with a single private censor, with 
no real gain for the free flow of information.  Properly implemented, 
interactive media can accommodate multiple filtering systems, giving users 
and parents the opportunity to select and block information based on a true 
diversity of criteria.  The national Parent Teachers Association or different 
religious organizations could set up rating systems which would be available 
on the network to those who desired them.  Rather than relying on the 
judgment of the government, or of the service provider, viewers can limit 
access to content based on the judgment of a group whose values they share.
<p>
Interactive media can enable individuals and parents to prevent 
themselves or their children from using their PCs or TVs (in particular, their 
children) from accessing certain kinds of content.  With such control 
mechanisms within the practical reach of parents, the governmental purpose 
generally cited for indecency regulations -- the protection of children -- could 
be accomplished without government content restrictions.  In particular, the 
reasoning of Pacifica (unsought intrusion of the indecent message into 
homes) and Sable (inability of parents to exercise control) would no longer 
justify most content regulation in new interactive media.  
<p>
<h3>C.	Forcing  online service providers to become private censors 
impairs First Amendment values by restricting the free flow of 
information</h3>
<p>
Holding carriers responsible for the content of all information and 
communication on their systems is a grave policy error which will restrict the 
free flow of information and is contrary to First Amendment and presonal 
privacy values.  If service providers are held liable for all of the content on 
their networks, then they will be forced to attempt to screen all content before 
it is allowed to enter the system. In many cases, this would simply be 
impossible. But even where it is possible, such prescreening can severely 
limit the diversity and free flow of information in the online world. To be 
sure, some system operators will want to offer services that prescreen content. 
However, if all systems were forced to do so, the usefulness of digital media as 
communication and information dissemination systems would be drastically 
limited. Where possible, we must avoid legal structures that force those who 
merely carry messages to screen their content.
<p>
Relying on user control is a real alternative to the draconian approach 
now being considered and sure to be proposed again and again.  A media 
environment in which parents -- or anyone else who has particular 
preferences about the content of information to which he or she is exposed -- 
would give users the control that courts have determined they lack in the 
mass media, without involving the government in content control which we 
believe would not survive appropriate First Amendment scrutiny in this 
new medium.
<p>
<h3>D.	Banning private, sexually-explicit communications violates 
constitutional privacy rights</h3>
<p>
Regulation of private, indecent communications between individuals 
raises constitutional privacy concerns.  The Supreme Court has made clear 
that absolute restrictions on indecency cannot pass constitutional muster 
under the Fourth Amendment's guarantee of personal privacy.  Though the 
Court has explicitly recognized that while the government may have an 
interest in protecting in public, Paris Adult Theater I v. Slaton, 413 U.S. 49 
(1973) or in a place that caters to the public, Schad v. Mt Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61 
(1981); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972). it does not have a right to ban 
information maintained in private.  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.S. 557 (1969).  
"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no 
business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or 
what films he may watch."  Id. at 598.  If enacted, the Senate-passed 
Communications Decency Act would empower federal authorities to intrude 
on the private communications and information used by individuals, in clear 
violation of Stanley.
<p>
As reflected in passage of the Video Privacy and Library Protection Act 
of 1988 (protecting records of video rentals), and the Electronic 
Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986 (18 U.S.C Sec. 2510), Congress has 
long recognized the privacy interest in information that we read and 
otherwise use.  A number of surveys have confirmed that Americans care 
deeply about their privacy.  In a 1983 analysis of their survey results, Louis 
Harris & Associates concluded:
<p>
<blockquote>Particularly striking is the pervasiveness of support for tough new [privacy protection] ground rules governing computers and other information technology . . . .  This support permeates all subgroups in society and represents a mandate for initiatives in public policy.  (L. Harris, The Road after 1984:  A Nationwide Survey of the Public and its Leader on the New Technology and its Consequences for American Life, December, 1983).</blockquote>
<p>
Enforcement of indecency restrictions by online service providers would 
require that online service providers violate the privacy rights, and statutory 
protections established by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, in 
order to assure that criminal violations do not occur.  ECPA established that 
users of online communications systems have a substantial privacy interest 
in the communications that they transmit over computer networks.  ECPA 
also set out clear conditions under which law enforcement agencies, and, in 
narrow cases, system operators, could access these private communications.  
Holding system operators liable would presume a dramatic change in the 
privacy protected established in ECPA, thereby forcing service providers and 
system operators to invade the privacy of user communications.  While there 
may be some justification for regulation of communication and information 
made public, there must be no intrusion on private or closed group 
communications unless there is evidence of criminal wrongdoing.
<p>
<h3>E.	Constitutional alternatives to the Communications Decency Act 
censorship regime</h3>
<p>
Alternative means of achieving the goal of protecting minors from 
access to material considered inappropriate by their parents would include:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Maximum reliance on technology to empower parents:</b>  
Interactive media offers parents and other users the ability to 
filter certain kinds of content.  Instead of relying on government 
content restrictions, or even government-imposed rating 
systems, parents should be able to block the delivery of certain 
information to their children.
<p>
<li><b>Clear protection for constitutionally-permissible speech:</b>  Any 
alternative legislation must provide affirmative protection for 
constitutionally-permissible speech, even if it is lewd or filthy.  
Controversial speech must be treated separately than that which 
is clearly obscene and unprotected.
<p>
<li><b>Emphasis on enforcement of existing statutes:</b>  Federal and state 
law already prohibits transportation of obscenity, child pornography, as well as, in many instances threats, stalking and harassment.  To the extent that there are obstacles to enforcing these laws in the new on-line environment, Congress should examine whether or not more resources for enforcement are 
required, including training for law enforcement in interactive 
services and cooperative efforts with the industry.
</ul><p>
The regulation of speech, commerce, and privacy rights in new 
interactive communications systems raises many difficult issues of public 
policy and constitutional law.  Before proceeding with legislation, Congress 
must provide the opportunity for public hearings to identify clearly the 
problems that exist, and to identify solutions that are appropriate to the new 
technology.  Failure to do so will result in ineffective policy, years of 
constitutional litigation, and a disastrous chilling effect on the development 
and growth of a very promising new communications medium.

1 In very limited circumstances, the Supreme Court has found indecency to be "unprotected" speech. See Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U. S. 629 (1969)(holding indecency unprotected where distributed to minors).  See the discussion of proposed Section 223(b)  below.

3 413 U.S. 15 (1973)(adopting standards that were later rejected by the Supreme 
Court).  Given the national and international reach of new interactive media, 
determinations of obscenity based on traditional "community standards" doctrine also raises a whole host of questions. 
<p>
4 The Court in Miller held that the guidelines for determining obscenity are as follows: "(a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value."

7  Pacifica held that the  FCC had authority to enforce a rule which barred the 
comedian George Carlin and others from repeating the "seven dirty words" in over-the-air radio broadcasts.  Pacifica did not,however, specifically approve the substance of  the indecency rule promulgated by the Commission.
<p>
8  Id. at 748
<p>
9  Id at 749-50.  The Pacifica court recognized that the radio station (WBAI in New York City) had actually broadcast a warning as to the possibly objectionable content, but that this warning failed to protect those who tuned in after it was given.  Id. at 731.
<p>
10  Rep. Blilely asserts as much in his comments on the legislation.  He states, "...It became clear that there was not a technological solution that would adequately and effectively protect our children from the effects of this material. We looked for effective alternatives to a ban -- there were none." 134 Cong. Rec. H1691.

New York, NY                                                         
                                                                     
Are 20,000 phone calls a lot? 30,000? 50,000? They are if you're one of a
handful of Congressional staffers trying to field them. Tuesday, December
12th was the Internet's Day of Protest. A variety of net-activists and
telecommunications-related services exhorted the on-line community to call
a selected group of Senators and Representatives to declare their
opposition to the threat of Internet censorship. And call they did. 

As the Senate members of the Telecommunications Reform conference
committee contemplated portions of legislation that would censor
"indecent" material on-line, their staffers were being overwhelmed with
phone calls. Senator Inouye's office said they were "getting lots and lots
of calls and faxes." Senator Lott's said they were "flooded with calls." 
At Senator Stevens' office there were so many calls they couldn't keep
a complete tally.

At Senator Exon's office, the fax machine was "backed up."  And at one
point, activists couldn't even get through to Senator Gorton's office to
ask. Exon is the Senator whose Communications Decency Act started the
nearly year-long struggle between those who would create special
regulations to restrict speech on-line (even, in certain instances,
private email between two individuals) to a greater extent than even
traditional broadcast media; regulations that, according to the ACLU and
many other civil liberties groups, will certainly be proven to be
unconstitutional if passed into law. 

"We've never seen anything like it," said Stanton McCandish of the
Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). The EFF is one member of the on-line
coalition that has been fighting an array of censorship legislation since
this spring, when Senator Exon introduced his Communications Decency Act. 

"We may have almost overwhelmed our provider," said Shabbir Safdar, head
of Voter's Telecommunications Watch (VTW). VTW is the organization that
organized the on-line coalition. Their on-line connectivity is provided by
Panix.com, a New York-area Internet service provider. "Panix has been
doing some maintenance work today, so it's hard to tell," Safdar
continued. "But we think it's actually made a dent in their connection 
to the rest of the Net." 

How many calls were actually made? No one can tell. For Leslie Miller, a
reporter for USA Today, it took much of the afternoon to get some counts
from Congressional staffers, and she couldn't get any report from the
Senate's Sergeant-At-Arms, the office nominally responsible for the
Senate's telephone system. VTW may be the only organization that can
really make an educated guess. 

"In our Alerts we ask that people drop us an email note after they call,"
explained VTW board member Steven Cherry. "The message count peaked in the
late afternoon at over 70 per minute. Many of those were from people who
called several offices. By 7:30 P.M. (EST) we had gotten 14,000 messages.
By Wednesday morning the count was over 18,000. And of course there are
the people who called but didn't send us email. So all told, our very
rough guess is there were well over 50,000 phone calls and faxes made on
the one day." 

"The Net is coming of age, politically," said Jerry Berman, Director of
the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT), another member of the
on-line coalition. Safdar, of VTW, concurred, saying, "I think Washington
got the message today that there's a new grass-roots interest group
around, and we're going to be a big part of the 1996 elections." (VTW's
initial election activities can be found at http://www.vtw.org/pledge.)

In addition to the Day of Protest, rallies are scheduled on Thursday,
December 14th, in San Francisco and Seattle, and a protest will be held
that day at 2:00 in New York City. 

The protest in New York will be held at the CyberCafe, at 273A Lafayette
St, New York NY, 10012.  It will start at 2pm, Thurs December 12, 1995.
Press can call Steven Cherry at the number above for more info.

<h1><center>The National Day of Protest Against Internet Censorship Legislation Is Huge Success!</h1></center>
<p>
<font size = +1>
On Tuesday December 12 1995, over 20,000 concerned net.citizens flooded key members 
of Congress with phone calls, faxes, and email messages urging them to oppose
legislation which would prohibit the transmission of "indecent" material online. This was the largest demonstration of the strength of the Internet Community to date. Thank you to 
those who participated.
<p>
Congress has not yet completed work on the final Telecommunications Reform Legislation, which includes the Communications Decency Act. There is still time to contact your representatives in Congress and urge them to protect the Internet and preserve its potential for democracy, education, and commerce. You will find information on what you can do to help below. It is never too late to get involved!

<title>Methods to Communicate over the Internet</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Methods to Communicate over the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>52.  Once an individual has access to the Internet,
there are a wide variety of different methods of communication
and information exchange over the network.  These numerous
methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly
evolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely. 
The most common methods of communications on the Internet (as
well as within the major online services) can be roughly grouped
into six categories:  one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"),
one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"), distributed message
databases (such as "USENET newsgroups"), real time communication
(such as "Internet Relay Chat"), real time remote computer
utilization (such as "telnet"), and remote information retrieval
(such as "ftp," "gopher," and the "World Wide Web").  Most of
these methods of communication can be used to transmit text,
data, computer programs, sound, or visual images.

<p>53.  <strong>One-to-one messaging.</strong>  The simplest method of
communication on the Internet is via electronic mail, or "e-
mail," the modern equivalent to a first class letter.  An
individual can address and transmit a message to one or more
specific other individuals.  E-mail on the Internet is not routed
through any central control point, and can take numerous and
varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail, simple e-
mail is not "sealed" or secure, and can be accessed or viewed on
intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless
the message is encrypted).

<p>54.  <strong>One-to-many messaging.</strong>  The Internet also contains
automatic mailing list services (such as "listserv") that allow
simple and efficient communications about particular subjects of
interest.  For example, individuals can subscribe to a "listserv"
mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The
individual can submit messages on the topic to the listserv that
are automatically forwarded (via e-mail) to anyone who has
subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message
can reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to
everyone on the mailing list.  This service provides the
capability to keep abreast of developments or events in a
particular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing lists
automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services
on the Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands of
subscribers.

<p>55.  <strong>Distributed message databases.</strong>  Similar in
function to listservs -- but quite different in how
communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as "USENET newsgroups."  Like listservs,
newsgroups are open discussions and exchanges on particular
topics.  Users, however, need not subscribe to the discussion
mailing list in advance, but can instead access the database at
any time.  An individual user can post a message to a newsgroup,
and the message is then automatically forwarded to all other
computers that furnish access to the newsgroups (but not to any
individual users).  The messages are temporarily stored on each
receiving computer, where they are available for review and
response.  The messages are automatically and periodically purged
from each system to make room for new messages.  Responses to
messages -- like the original messages -- are automatically
distributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup. 
There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different
subjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to
newsgroups each day, and those messages were distributed to the
approximately 190,000 computers or computer networks that
participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Messages posted to
newsgroups are not stored on or channelled through any central
computer or location.

<p>56.  <strong>Real time communication.</strong>  In addition to
transmitting messages that can be later read or accessed,
individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog --
in "real time" -- with other individuals on the Internet.  In its
simplest forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and
"Internet Relay Chat" allows two or more individuals to type
messages to each other that almost immediately appear on the
other individuals' computer screens.  In addition, commercial
online services such as America Online, CompuServe, eWorld, the
Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own "chat" systems
allowing their members to converse. 

<p>57.  <strong>Real time remote computer utilization.</strong>  Another
method to utilize information on the Internet is to access and
control remote computers using "telnet."  For example, using
telnet, a researcher at a university would be able to utilize the
computing power of a supercomputer located at a different
university.  A student can use telnet to connect to a remote
library to access the library's online card catalog program.  Or,
individuals can link via telnet to a computer to interact
directly and communicate with other users linked to the same
computer.  Accessing a computer via telnet occurs in "real time,"
and content and communication accessed via telnet is often
created only at the time of the communication.

<p>58.  <strong>Remote information retrieval.</strong>  The final major
category of communication may be the most important and well
known use of the Internet -- the search for and retrieval of
information located on remote computers.  There are numerous
methods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet.  A
simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer protocol) to list the
names of computer files available on a remote computer, and to
transfer one or more of those files to an individual's local
computer.  Another approach uses a program and format named
"gopher" to guide an individual's search through the resources
available on a remote computer.  A third approach, and fast
becoming the most well known on the Internet, is the "World Wide
Web."  The Web utilizes a "hypertext" formatting language called
hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the
Web can display HTML documents containing text, images, and
sound.  Any HTML document can include links to other types of
information or resources, so that while viewing an HTML document
that, for example, describes resources available on the Internet,
an individual can "click" using a computer mouse on the
description of the resource and be immediately connected to the
resource itself.  Such "hyperlinks" allow information to be
accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow
individuals to locate and efficiently view related information
even if the information is stored on numerous computers all
around the world.

<p>59.  With the exception of point-to-point mail, no
information flows through cyberspace to a particular individual
unless the individual requests the information.  Listservs,
newsgroups, chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher and the World Wide
Web all require an affirmative request by the Internet user prior
to the user receiving information over the Internet.  Further-
more, when a user makes such an affirmative request it is usually
clear what type of content will be delivered.  Thus, unlike radio
or television, there is no significant risk that a user will be
"assaulted" with unsolicited and undesired content.

<p>60.  The vast majority of transmissions of content from
specific sites on the Internet are in response to electronic
requests the user could not have anticipated more than a few
seconds or moments before making the request.  Because
information is located on millions of computers around the world,
with no central organization or control, a user cannot possibly
know which computers might have useful information until starting
a search.  Instead, the user could access any of dozens of
different search databases, obtain a list of sites that might be
of interest, and then immediately link to one or more of the
sites.  Indeed, the very theory of "hyperlinks" and the hypertext
markup language (HTML) (the foundation of the World Wide Web) is
that the user can jump from site to site to site without ever
needing to know where physically in the world the next site is
located.  Thus, there is no way for a user to pre-register with
every computer that might contain useful content on a particular
topic.  Moreover, when an individual is researching a topic on
the Internet, he or she might access dozens of newsgroups, telnet
computers, and ftp, gopher, and Web sites around the world in a
matter of minutes.  If a researcher was required to request
access from content providers prior to actually viewing the
information (and prove to the provider that the researcher was
not a minor), the Internet would be transformed from a dynamic
and instantaneous content searching tool into a cumbersome,
multi-step, much slower, and much less useful research tool.  The
vibrancy and immediacy that sparked the Internet's recent
extraordinary expansion and development would be lost.

<p>61.  The inability to predict where on the Internet a
user would want to access information is not limited to research,
and applies equally to any attempt by a user to access
information on the Internet when the individual does not know in
advance the precise location of that information.  There are
millions of computers on the Internet that contain content, and
it would be practically and economically impossible for the tens
of millions of Internet users to pre-register with each of those
millions of content sites, and equally impossible for those
millions of content sites to maintain and instantaneously update
lists of registered users.

<p>62.  For both the speaker and the listener,
communications on the Internet bear virtually no similarity to
communications on television and radio.  With radio and
television, the number of speakers is limited by the available
spectrum, the ability to speak is limited by the high cost of
speaking, and listeners are merely passive recipients of the
communications.  With the Internet, the number of speakers is
boundless, anyone can speak for pennies a day (or for free at his
or her public library), and listeners can respond and engage the
speaker in an interactive and on-going dialogue.  Furthermore,
unlike television and radio, on the Internet viewers and
listeners generally receive only the communications they
affirmatively request, and are not a passive or "captive"
audience.  Moreover, unlike with television and radio, on the
Internet a speaker can reach the entire world (at no additional
cost) yet at the same time can direct his or her speech to
individuals who share an interest in a particular subject.  In
the twenty-first century, the Internet -- if allowed to flourish
unhindered by government censorship -- can revive the now-little-
used public square and convert it into a global medium of
communication and discourse.

<center><h2>Causes of Action</h2></center>

<font size = +1>

<center>COUNT 1</center>
150.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>151.  With respect to constitutionally protected
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms and
practical effect, bans a substantial amount of speech by and to
adults, including speech by and to plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons and customers, in violation of the
First Amendment of the United States Constitution.

<p><center>COUNT 2</center>
152.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>153.  With respect to constitutionally protected
communications which might be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for persons under 18, the Act, in plain terms and
practical effect, unduly burdens and deters a substantial amount
of speech by and to adults, including speech by and to
plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers, patrons, and
customers, in violation of the First Amendment of the United
States Constitution.

<p><center>COUNT 3</center>
154.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>155.  Sections 502(1) and 502(2) of the Act unduly
chill and compel self-censorship of constitutionally protected
speech of plaintiffs, their members, and their subscribers,
patrons, and customers, in violation of the First Amendment of
the United States Constitution.

<p><center>COUNT 4</center>
156.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>157.  Section 502(2) of the Act, 47 U.S.C.  &#167; 223(d), is
fatally overbroad.  In particular, it bans, burdens, and
criminalizes speech that is constitutionally protected for
adults, and for older minors, restricting both adults and 17
year-olds to communications appropriate for 7 year olds.  And it
bans, burdens, and criminalizes a much broader range of
constitutionally protected expression than is constitutionally
permissible.  Accordingly, the provision violates the First
Amendment.

<p><center>COUNT 5</center>
158.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>159.  Any blocking system to be imposed by the content
provider/speaker would require advance identification of those
seeking access to a particular Web site, chat room, discussion
group, or other online forum that might potentially contain
communications that could be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" to persons under 18.  See 47 U.S.C.  &#167; 223(e)(5)(B). 
A requirement of advance identification would make it impossible
for users to engage in constitutionally protected anonymous
speech on matters of public and private importance.  For many
users, such anonymity is critical to their participation in the
speech.
<br>160.  For such users, the Act will require them to
choose between anonymity and losing access to such
communications.  As a result, in many cases, their First
Amendment rights to read and view constitutionally protected text
and images will be infringed.
<br>161.  Section 502(2) accordingly violates the First
Amendment.

<p><center>COUNT 6</center>
162.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>163.  Plaintiffs are unable to determine with
reasonable certainty which constitutionally protected expression
Congress sought to proscribe in  &#167; &#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and (d).  In
particular, the terms "indecent" and "patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards" are entirely
subjective; as a matter of law depend on the context in which the
communications arise; are undefined and undefinable in the
cyberspace context; have entirely different meanings depending
upon the age of the recipient even though the Act treats all
minors of all ages the same; and give no indication as to which
community governs the inquiry.  In these, and other ways, the Act
does not put reasonable persons on notice of what communications
are prohibited.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and
subscribers, patrons, and customers are forced to guess at which
speech on interactive computer services may give rise to criminal
prosecution.
<br>164.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards," and of other provisions of the Act, and the draconian
penalties for a wrong guess, will force plaintiffs, their
members, and their subscribers, patrons, and customers, and
substantial numbers of other providers of content to the
Internet, to self-censor far more speech than would in fact be
prohibited in order to comply with their understanding of the
Act's requirements, or to avoid potential criminal prosecution,
and will thus chill constitutionally protected expression.
<br>165.  The vagueness of the terms "indecent" and
"patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards," and of other provisions of the Act, invites arbitrary
enforcement.
<br>166.  The Act is, accordingly, so vague as to violate
the First and Fifth Amendments.

<p><center>COUNT 7</center>
167.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>168.  Plaintiffs reasonably fear that the defenses
under the Act will not be construed as broadly as Congress
intended, and will therefore subject their dissemination or
facilitation of constitutionally protected speech to criminal
prosecution and conviction in several significant contexts.
<br>169.   The "good faith defense," which is the only
defense even arguably available to non-commercial content-
providers, gives insufficient guidance to content-providers as to
whether their dissemination of constitutionally protected speech
is prohibited.  Plaintiff content-providers have no means of
ascertaining whether a jury will determine that they have taken
"reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the
circumstances" to restrict minors' access to material that is
"indecent" or "patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards."  Act 502(2), to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
 &#167; 223(e)(5)(A).
<br>170.  Similarly, service providers who host Web sites
or other online sites, without controlling content, but on whose
facilities others' communications reside, reasonably fear an
aggressive prosecutor will argue, contrary to plaintiffs'
understanding of Congressional intent, that such actions will
constitute a "display" of such communications under
 &#167; 223(d)(1)(B), and that such services are not protected by the
"access provider" defense, even though the service providers'
role clearly "does not include the creation of the content of the
communication."   &#167; 223(e)(1).
<br>171.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with
reasonable certainty rely on the access provider defense,
 &#167; 223(e)(1), to exempt access providers' operation of USENET news
servers that automatically store content posted by users, which
remains on their servers for a number of days and is available to
subscribers.
<br>172.  For similar reasons, plaintiffs cannot with
reasonable certainty determine whether the defense,  &#167; 223(e)(1),
applies to ISPs who assist content providers in establishing or
operating Web pages or other online sites, and who, although
having no control of content, might be deemed to be a
"conspirator" under  &#167; 223(e)(2) if they knowingly arrange for
access to valuable, constitutionally protected material that may
be deemed "indecent."
<br>173.  As a consequence, plaintiffs, their members, and
their subscribers, patrons, and customers, are forced to guess at
whether their activities may give rise to criminal prosecution.
<br>174.  The uncertainty of how prosecutors or the courts
will construe the defenses, the fact that they are only defenses,
which must be raised and proved after a defendant has already
been subjected to the humiliation, stigma, and expense of a
criminal prosecution, and the draconian penalties for a wrong
guess, will force plaintiffs, their members, and their
subscribers, patrons, and customers, and a substantial number of
other providers of content to the Internet, to self-censor speech
protected by the First Amendment in order to comply with their
understanding of the Act's requirements, or to avoid potential
criminal prosecution, and will thus chill constitutionally
protected expression.
<br>175.  The vagueness of these provisions invites
arbitrary enforcement.
<br>176.  Sections 502(1) and (2), accordingly, are so
vague as to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.

<p><center>COUNT 8</center>
177.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege paragraphs 1-149.
<br>178.  Sections 502(1) and (2) of the Act violate the
First Amendment rights of plaintiffs, their members, and their
subscribers, patrons, and customers, insofar as they single out
for special bans or burdens speakers engaged in one class of
constitutionally protected speech by one specific medium, and do
not similarly ban or burden speakers engaged in other classes of
speech, or in the same speech via other mediums, without
sufficient justification.

<p>WHEREFORE, plaintiffs respectfully pray that this Court:
<br>A.  Declare that Sections 502(1) and (2) of the
Communications Decency Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C.  &#167; &#167; 223(a)(1)(B),
223(a)(2), and 223(d), are unconstitutional; 
<br>B.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin defendants
from enforcing those provisions.
<br>C.  Award plaintiffs such costs and fees as are allowed
by law; and 
<br>D.  Grant plaintiffs such other and further relief as
the Court deems just and proper.

<title>How Individuals Access the Internet</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>How Individuals Access the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>41.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to
access cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular.  In
terms of physical access, there are two common methods to
establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, an individual
can use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and
usually permanently) connected to a computer network that is
itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second,
an individual can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to
connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer
network that is itself directly or indirectly connected to the
Internet.  As detailed below, both direct and modem connections
are made available to individuals by a wide variety of academic,
governmental, or commercial entities.

<p>42.  Students, faculty, researchers, and others
affiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities in
the United States can access the Internet through their
educational institutions.  Such access is often via direct
connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,
or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a
modem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campus
location.  Internet access is considered to be so important to
the modern educational process that many colleges and
universities install "ports" or outlets for direct network
connections in each dormitory room or provide access via
computers located in common areas in dormitories.  Such access
enables students and professors to use information and content
provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
amount of research resources and other information available on
the Internet worldwide.

<p>43.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are
sufficiently important to many corporations and other employers
that those employers link their office computer networks to the
Internet and provide employees with direct or modem access to the
office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access is
especially important, for example, to any corporation involved in
scientific or medical research or manufacturing to enable
corporate employees to exchange information and ideas with
academic researchers in their fields.

<p>44.  Individuals who lack access to the Internet
through their schools or employers still have a variety of ways
they can access the Internet.  Many communities across the
country have established "free-nets" or community networks to
provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to
provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first
such community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer
System, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in
scores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,
Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little
or no cost via modem connection or by using computers available
in community buildings.  Free-nets are often operated by a local
library, educational institution, or non-profit community group.

<p>45.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
many local libraries.  Libraries often offer patrons use of
computers that are linked to the Internet.  In addition, some
libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. 
Increasingly, patrons are using library services and resources
without ever physically entering the library itself.  Such direct
or modem access is typically provided by libraries at no cost to
the individual user.

<p>46.  Individuals can also access the Internet by
patronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffee
shops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- can
use computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.  Such
Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee.

<p>47.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
commercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" that
typically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computer
network linked to the Internet.  Many such providers -- including
the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association
-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a modest
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however,
are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low cost
access to the Internet.  For example, the International Internet
Association offers free modem access to the Internet upon
request.  Also, an increasing number of trade or other non-profit
associations offer Internet access as a service to members.

<p>48.  Another simple and common way that individuals can
access the Internet is through one of the major national
commercial "online services" such as America Online, Apple's
eWorld, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These
online services offer nationwide computer networks (so that
subscribers can dial-in to a local telephone number), and the
services provide extensive and well organized content within
their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing
access to the extensive content available within each online
service, the services also allow subscribers to link to the much
larger resources of the Internet.  Full access to the online
service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained for
modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online
services have almost twelve million individual subscribers across
the United States.

<p>49.  In addition to using the national commercial
online services, individuals can also access the Internet using
some (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computer
services, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs."  With
an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a
telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy
groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer
"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, or
customers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers with only one telephone line into the computer
(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with many
telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneous
users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). 
Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect
links to the Internet.  Some BBS systems charge individuals a
nominal fee for access, while many others are free to the
individual users. 

<p>50.  Although commercial access to the Internet is
growing rapidly, many individual users of the Internet -- such as
college students and staff -- do not individually pay for access
(except to the extent, for example, the cost of computer services
is a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet
users can access the Internet without any requirement that they
provide a credit card or other form of payment.

<p>51.  In part because the Internet is an unregulated
"network of networks" with literally millions of access points
and tens of millions of users, individual Internet users often do
not have their own "username" or identification code that would
indicate to others on the Internet the identity of the user. 
Many users access the Internet anonymously or through a method
that would not allow for clear identification by a remote content
provider.

<title>Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</h2>

<font size = +1>
<p>31.  The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity. 
It is a giant network which interconnects innumerable smaller
groups of linked computer networks:  a network of networks.  This
is best understood if one considers what a linked group of
computers -- referred to here as a "network" -- is, and what it
does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often called
"local area networks").  For example, in many United States
Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purpose
of exchanging files and messages (and to share equipment such as
printers).  These are networks.  In the language of the Act,
these networks would each be termed an "interactive computer
service."

<p>32.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to
other computers or networks (although the Act still directly
applies to such closed local area networks).  Many networks,
however, are connected to other networks, which are in turn
connected to other networks in a manner which permits each
computer in any network to communicate with computers on any
other network in the system.  This global web of linked networks
and computers is the Internet.

<p>33.  This amalgam of computers and computer networks --
some owned by governmental and public institutions, some owned by
non-profit organizations, and some privately owned -- lacks any
central control or supervision.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, unrestricted global medium of communications -- or
"cyberspace" -- that links individuals, institutions,
corporations, and governments around the world.  This
communications medium allows any of the literally tens of
millions of people with access to the Internet to exchange ideas,
research, software, poetry, images, literature, sound, or simple
electronic mail with others on the Internet.  These
communications can occur virtually instantaneously, and can be
directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of
individuals interested in a particular subject, or to the world
as a whole.

<p>34.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an
experimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency
("ARPA").  First called ARPANET, the network linked computers and
computer networks owned by the military, defense contractors, and
university laboratories conducting defense-related research.  The
network later allowed researchers across the country to access
directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at
a few key universities and laboratories.  As it evolved far
beyond its research origins in the United States to encompass
universities, corporations, and individuals around the world, the
ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and finally just
the "Internet."

<p>35.  From its inception, the network was designed to be
a decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant links
between computers and computer networks, capable of rapidly
transmitting communications without direct human involvement or
control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or
otherwise unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant, self-
healing system of linked computers was designed to allow vital
research and communications to continue even if portions of the
network were damaged.

<p>36.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and
ultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged
the creation of multiple links to and from each computer (or
computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located in
Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated
telephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on
the Eastern seaboard.  Each of those computers would in turn be
linked to numerous other computers, which themselves would be
linked to other computers.

<p>37.  A communication sent over this redundant series of
linked computers could travel any of dozens of routes to its
destination.  Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,
D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sent
to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a
computer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt
Lake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the message
could not travel along that path (because of military attack,
simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message would
automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be
re-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then
to Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and
finally to Palo Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing,
would likely occur in a matter of seconds.

<p>38.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it
subsequently ceased to exist), similar decentralized networks
developed to link universities, research facilities, businesses,
and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET. 
Eventually, each of these networks (many of which were
overlapping) were themselves linked together, allowing users of
any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is
this series of linked networks (themselves linking computers and
computer networks) that is commonly known today as the Internet.

<p>39.  No entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or
non-profit -- controls, governs, or runs the Internet.  It exists
and functions solely as a result of the fact that hundreds of
thousands of separate operators of computers and computer
networks independently decided to use a common data transfer
protocol to exchange communications and information with other
computers (which in turn exchange communications and information
with still other computers).  There is no centralized storage
location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would be impossible for any single entity to
regulate the information conveyed on the Internet.

<p>40.  The nature of the Internet is such that it is
impossible to determine its size.  However, it is indisputable
that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in the
past few years.  In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to
the Internet, and by 1989, the number stood at fewer than 90,000
computers.  By 1993, however, over 1,000,000 computers were
linked.  Today, it is estimated that over 9,400,000 host
computers worldwide are linked to the Internet, and this count
does not include the tens of millions of personal computers used
by individuals to access the Internet using modems (as detailed
below).  In all, reasonable estimates are that over 40 million
individuals around the world can and do access the enormously
flexible communication medium of the Internet.  That figure is
expected to grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.

<title>Preliminary Statement</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Preliminary Statement</h2>
<font size = +1>
<p>1.  During much of this century the mass media,
particularly radio and television, have been characterized by a
limited number of speakers transmitting programming and
information to essentially passive audiences.  The communications
medium of the twenty-first century -- the Internet and
"cyberspace" generally -- is changing that, and will allow
hundreds of millions of individuals to engage in interactive
communication, on a national and global scale never before
possible.  The public square of the past -- with pamphleteering,
soap boxes, and vigorous debate -- is being replaced by the
Internet, which enables average citizens to participate in
national discourse, publish a newspaper, distribute an electronic
pamphlet to the world, and generally communicate to and with a
broader audience than ever before possible.  It also enables
average citizens to gain access to a vast and literally world-
wide range of information, while simultaneously protecting their
privacy, because in this new medium individuals receive only the
communications they affirmatively request.

<p>2.  In enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223) (the "Act"), Congress
acknowledged that the Internet represents "an extraordinary
advance in the availability of educational and informational
resources to our citizens," and acknowledged that interactive
computer services "offer users a great degree of control over the
information that they receive."  Congress therefore declared
"[i]t is the policy of the United States . . . to promote the
continued development of the Internet and other interactive
computer services; [and] to preserve the vibrant and competitive
free market that presently exists for the Internet and other
interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or State
regulation."  Act &#167; 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230). 
Unfortunately, as we will show, provisions of the Act that were
intended only to protect minors from communications deemed
inappropriate for them will have the effect, perhaps unintended,
of depriving adults of communications that are appropriate, and
indisputably constitutionally protected, for them.  Because of
the way the Internet works, the Act's prohibition of
communications that may be deemed "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for minors will effectively ban those same
communications between adults, reducing the adult population in
cyberspace to only what is appropriate for minors.  The banned
speech includes valuable works of literature and art, information
about health and medical issues, and examples of popular culture. 
It also includes robust human discourse about politics, current
events, and personal matters that may at times include harsh,
provocative, or even vulgar language, all of which is
constitutionally protected for adults.

<p>3.  Plaintiffs represent a broad range of individuals
and entities from the computer and communications industries and
the general public who are harmed by the Act.  Plaintiffs include
publishers and creators of content on the Internet; "online
services," "Internet service providers," libraries, and others
who provide access or connection to the Internet; and speakers,
listeners, and users on the Internet.  The Act's effective ban of
a broad category of communication that is constitutionally
protected for adults directly harms the First Amendment rights of
plaintiffs, and of the tens of millions of adult speakers and
listeners who are "online" and linked through this new
communications medium.  Plaintiffs also include parents, who seek
to protect the rights of parents to decide what is appropriate
for their children to receive through interactive computer
communications.

<p>4.  The speech at issue in this case does not include
obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech, speech intended
to entice or lure minors into inappropriate activity, or other
speech that lacks First Amendment protection even for adults. 
This complaint does not challenge governmental regulation of
those categories of non-protected speech, and the relief sought
herein will not affect the government's ability to prosecute the
communication of those categories of speech, all of which are
already prohibited by existing law. 

<p>5.  The most sweeping provision of the Act, Section
502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)), prohibits the
"display" of material deemed "patently offensive" "in a manner
available to a person under 18 years of age" (emphasis added). 
That provision is subject to certain defenses, which the sponsor
of the Act and Congress apparently believed would enable speakers
to restrict access by minors while simultaneously permitting
access by adults.  But those defenses, which were merely lifted
from the "dial-a-porn" laws, simply do not work in the quite
different medium of cyberspace.  Because of the manner in which
information is stored, transmitted, and received on the Internet,
this provision has the (perhaps unintended) result of banning
speech between adults that is suitable and constitutionally
protected for adults.

<p>6.  The Act is also unconstitutional because there are
alternative ways of protecting minors from material inappropriate
for them that would not abridge the First Amendment rights of
adults, and would be more effective in protecting minors than the
mechanism Congress imposed.  The speaker-based blocking required
by the Act will not protect minors from access to words and
images posted on the Internet abroad by foreign speakers, who are
not effectively subject to prosecution under the Act, or even by
domestic speakers who intentionally or inadvertently violate the
Act.  But user-based blocking technology enables parents and
other users to block or screen whatever words or images they deem
inappropriate, regardless of where posted, at little or no cost. 
For these reasons, every application of the Act unnecessarily and
unconstitutionally abridges the First Amendment rights of adults,
and does so even though there are less drastic alternatives that
would be more protective of minors.

<h1>Links to Sites Joining the Protest and supporting Free Speech on the Internet</h1>
<p>
<font size = +1>
The following World Wide Web turned their background black (with white text) on February 8, 1996 to protest the enactment of the online 'indecency' provisions of the Telecommunications Reform bill.  The protest, organized by CDT, VTW, and several other on


line activist organizations, was designed to illustrate the far reaching impact these new restrictions will have on all Internet users.
<p>
Over 1500  sites, from Members of Congress, commercial sites, search engines, and individual home pages, joined together to illustrate that on the Internet, every user is a publisher, and that the new content regulations threaten the First Amendment right


s of all Internet users.
<p>
CDT, VTW, and the other ogranizers of the 'black Thursday' protest wish to extend our sincere thanks to all who participated in this protest.  It was by far the larges and most successful Internet based demonstration in history.

<title>The Impact of the Act on the Internet</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>The Impact of the Act on the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>95.  Because of the realities of the Internet, the Act
effects a total ban on certain constitutionally protected speech
to adults.  The Act reduces discourse on major portions of the
Internet to that which is appropriate for a young child.

<p>96.  Virtually all of the tens of millions of users of
the Internet -- except those who at all times stand mute in the
discourse that occurs on the Internet -- are content providers
who are subject to the terms of the Act.  An individual is a
content provider subject to the Act if he sends a single e-mail,
or participates in a listserv discussion, or contributes to a
USENET newsgroup, or responds to a survey on the World Wide Web,
or establishes a personal "home page" on the Web, or converses
with a friend through a real time service, or simply places a
file in a publicly available area of a computer or network.  

<p>97.  In other words, virtually any use of the Internet
makes someone a content provider subject to the criminal
penalties of the Act.  Commercial content providers -- who
typically require a credit card for users' payment -- may be able
to use the credit card defense allowed by the Act.  But for non-
commercial content providers, who are responsible for a major
part of communications on the Internet, there is no practical way
the speaker can control who can access the message.  Thus, for
the vast majority of speech on the Internet, it is impossible for
the speaker to prevent the speech from being "display[ed] in a
manner available" to a person under 18.  Act &#167; 502(2).

<p>98.  Because of this impossibility, Section 502(2) of
the Act effectively requires that almost all discourse on the
Internet be at a level suitable for young children.  This
provision has the effect of a flat ban on an entire category of
constitutionally protected speech between adults.

<p>99.  As used by millions of people daily, the primary
methods to access information on the Internet do not permit
individual or non-commercial content providers to control who on
the Internet can access their content.  From the perspective of
the content provider, information that is publicly available on
the Internet is available to all users of the Internet, even
users who might be minors.  

<p>100.  None of the major methods of accessing
information -- including electronic mail, listservs, newsgroups,
chat lines, telnet, ftp, gopher, and the World Wide Web -- has
the ability to track the millions of individuals who access the
Internet and screen out those who are under eighteen years of
age.  Although password-required access to content is possible
(and is used in some circumstances), a password-access system
would effectively remove from public access an enormous volume of
valuable content on the Internet, and would reduce the
information available to adults on the Internet to only content
deemed suitable for minors.

<p>101.  The vast majority of content providers on the
Internet are individuals who post messages to newsgroups and
listservs, and who create content on the World Wide Web.  Those
individual content providers could not possibly create and
maintain a database of specific Internet users who request access
to the content and who prove they are 18 or older.  Nor could
individuals or other non-commercial content providers practically
administer or economically afford an instantaneous credit card
verification system.  Such a requirement would effectively
preclude any communications by those content providers that could
be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors.

<p>102.  Even larger organizations that provide content on
the Internet cannot practically or economically track the
millions of Internet users to determine whether those users are
minors or adults.  

<p>103.  Moreover, even if pre-registration by content
users were practically or economically possible, the value of the
content would be dramatically diminished because so few content
users would anticipate the need to pre-register for a particular
site.  A huge percentage of Internet traffic is by users engaged
in spontaneous and unpredictable research or searches for
content, and a pre-registration requirement would effectively end
this type of search. 

<p>104.  As described above, the World Wide Web is a
spontaneous and serendipitous communications medium, in which a
user can jump from site to site to site depending on what content
looks most useful or interesting, without any pre-registration or
advance request.  Requiring pre-registration for all sites that
might contain content arguably covered by the Act (if such pre-
registration were practically possible) would drastically reduce
the usefulness of the World Wide Web.

<p>105.  For other methods of providing content on the
Internet, it is flatly impossible for a content provider to
control who can access the content.  With USENET newsgroups, for
example, once a content provider posts a message to a newsgroup,
that message is automatically distributed to over 190,000
computers around the world, and the individual content provider
has no ability whatsoever to control who is permitted to access
the content on those 190,000 computers.  Under the Act, all
content posted to USENET newsgroups must be reduced to a level
appropriate for young children.  Similarly, Internet mailing list
services such as "listserv" also do not allow the speaker to
control who receives the communication, and thus speech via a
mailing list service would also be reduced to the level
appropriate for young children.

<title>The Statutory Language At Issue</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>The Statutory Language At Issue</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>81.  Signed into law on February 8, 1996, the
Communications Decency Act criminalizes the display and
distribution of constitutionally protected expressive material.

<p>82.  The Act contains two primary criminal provisions. 
Violation of either provision is a felony, punishable by as much
as two years in prison and substantial fines.  

<p>83.  Section 502(2) of the Act, to be codified at 47
U.S.C. &#167; 223(d), broadly prohibits knowingly using any
"interactive computer service" to send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age, or to "display," "in a manner
available to" a person under 18, certain "patently offensive"
communications.  Section 502(2) provides, in pertinent part:

<blockquote>(d) Whoever--

   <blockquote>(1) in interstate or foreign communications
   knowingly--

         <blockquote>(A) uses an interactive computer service to
      send to a specific person or persons under 18
      years of age, or

       <p>(B) uses any interactive computer service to
      display in a manner available to a person under
      18 years of age, </blockquote>

   any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,
   or other communication that, in context, depicts or
   describes, in terms patently offensive as measured
   by contemporary community standards, sexual or
   excretory activities or organs, regardless of
   whether the user of such service placed the call or
   initiated the communication; or

   <p>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications
   facility under such person's control to be used for
   an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the
   intent that it be used for such activity,</blockquote>

shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or
imprisoned not more than two years, or both.</blockquote>

Act &#167; 502(2).

<p>84.  "Interactive computer service" is defined as "any
information service, system, or access software provider that
provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a
computer server, including specifically a service or system that
provides access to the Internet and such systems operated or
services offered by libraries or educational institutions."  
<br>Act &#167; 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(h)(2)) referring to
Act &#167; 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(e)(2)).
          
<p>85.  The terms "patently offensive," "contemporary
community standards," and "display" are nowhere defined in the
Act.

<p>86.  Another section of the Act, Section 502(1), to be
codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B), prohibits and criminalizes
the use of a "telecommunications device" knowingly to make or
create and "initiate[] the transmission of, any comment, request,
suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is
. . . indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication
is under 18 years of age."  Another provision of the same section
makes it a crime to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunications
facility under [a person's] control to be used for any activity
prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for
such activity." 
<br>Act &#167; 502(1) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C.
&#167; 223(a)(2)).

<p>87.  "Telecommunications device" is defined to exclude
an "interactive computer service." 
<br>Act &#167; 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(h)(1)(B)).

<p>88.  The term "indecent" is not defined.

<p>89.  The Act establishes several defenses a defendant
may assert in a criminal prosecution under the Act.  First, no
person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d)
solely for providing access or connection to or from a
facility, system, or network not under that person's
control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related
capabilities that are incidental to providing such
access or connection that does not include the creation
of the content of the communication.
<br>Act &#167; 502(2) (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(1)).

<p>90.  The phrase "not under that person's control" is
nowhere defined in the Act.

<p>91.  This defense is not available "to a person who is
a conspirator with an entity actively involved in the creation or
knowing distribution of communications that violate this section,
or who knowingly advertises the availability of such
communications."  Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(2)). 
Nor is this defense available to "a person who provides access or
connection to a facility, system, or network engaged in the
violation . . . that is owned or controlled by such person."  Id.
(to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(3)).  The level or nature
of control is not defined.

<p>92.  In addition, the Act provides a defense to a
criminal prosecution under (a)(1)(B) or (d), or under (a)(2) for
use of a facility for an activity under (a)(1)(B), if the
defendant
<blockquote>(A)   has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective,
and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication
specified in such subsections, which may involve any
appropriate measures to restrict minors from such
communications, including any method which is feasible
under available technology; or

<p>(B)   has restricted access to such communication by
requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account,
adult access code, or adult personal identification
number.</blockquote>

Id. (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(5)).  Congress did not
provide any details as to what might be considered a "good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate action[]."  Congress did
allow the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") to promulgate
nonbinding guidelines as to what might be an "appropriate
action," but it now appears that even those guidelines will not
be issued until sometime in 1997 at the earliest, and compliance
with the guidelines will not insulate speakers from prosecution
or conviction under the Act.

<p>93.  Congress made no findings in connection with
enacting Section 502 of the Act.  Congress made no findings as to
its purpose or interest in criminalizing online communication of
"indecent" or "patently offensive" materials to, or that would be
available to, persons under age 18.  In considering the Act,
Congress made no inquiry into or findings regarding the extent to
which such materials were available to persons under 18. 
Congress made no inquiry into or findings whether the means
Congress chose to address whatever interest it had would
substantially further that interest.  Congress made no inquiry
into or findings whether any less restrictive means would
substantially further its interest.

<p>94.  In another section of the Act, however, Congress
did make the following relevant findings:
<blockquote>(1) The rapidly developing array of Internet and
other interactive computer services available to
individual Americans represent an <strong>extraordinary advance</strong>
in the availability of <strong>educational and informational
resources</strong> to our citizens.
<p>(2) <strong>These services offer users a great degree of
control over the information that they receive</strong>, as well
as the potential for even greater control in the future
as technology develops.
<p>(3) The Internet and other interactive computer
services offer a <strong>forum</strong> for a true diversity of
political discourse, <strong>unique</strong> opportunities for cultural
development, and myriad avenues for intellectual
activity.
<p>(4) The Internet and other interactive computer
services have flourished, to the benefit of all
Americans, with a minimum of government regulation.
<p>(5) Increasingly Americans are relying on
interactive media for a variety of political,
educational, cultural, and entertainment services.</blockquote>
Act &#167; 509 (to be codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(a)) <strong>(emphasis
added)</strong> .

<h2>Ineffectiveness of the Act and Effectiveness of Alternative Means</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>106.  The overwhelming majority of content on the
Internet is non-sexual in nature, and is not even arguably
"indecent" or "patently offensive," even for minors.  However, a
significant amount of the content on the Internet could arguably
be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in some
communities, and the Act bans or burdens all of that content.

<p>107.  Although imposing extreme burdens on the
Internet, the Act will in fact have very little impact on the
availability to persons under 18 of "indecent" or "patently
offensive" images or communications on the Internet.  At least in
part because Congress held no hearings on the Act, did not
collect information about how the Internet works, and only
haphazardly reviewed the content on the Internet, the Act does
not accomplish or even significantly further the ostensible goal
of limiting access by persons under 18 to "indecent" or "patently
offensive" images.  There are at least two reasons why
implementation of the Act will be highly ineffective as a
limitation on such access.

<p>108.  First, a high percentage of sexual content on the
Internet originates outside of the United States, and it is not
possible to prevent that content from being "available" in the
United States.  To the extent the Act imposes any burdens on
domestic commercial providers of such communications, those
providers will have the option of moving their operations
overseas.

<p>109.  Second, the existence of "anonymous remailers"
means that any content -- indecent or otherwise -- can be placed
onto the Internet anonymously, and the government would be unable
to identify the content provider.  Anonymous remailer systems --
which often are located overseas -- will automatically receive a
communication and forward it to a destination after having
removed all trace of the origin of the communication.

<p>110.  At bottom, therefore, the Act does little to
limit the ability of commercial or non-commercial entities to
provide "indecent" or "patently offensive" images on the
Internet.

<p>111.  A critical difference between the Act's attempt
to regulate indecency on the Internet and prior governmental
attempts to regulate indecency (over radio, television, and
telephone sex lines, for example) is that there are tens of
millions of speakers on the Internet, with no bottleneck through
which all of the speech must pass.

<p>112.  There are alternative means that are far more
effective in limiting a minor's access to "indecent" or "patently
offensive" communications.  The only place where it is
practically possible to screen out commercial indecency, non-
commercial indecency, domestic indecency, overseas indecency,
intentional indecency, inadvertent indecency, and anonymous
indecency is in the computer that is attempting to receive the
speech.

<p>113.  The government's legitimate interest in aiding
parental control over the Internet material their children access
may be served by several means that are both less restrictive and
more effective than a blanket ban on "indecent" or "patently
offensive" communications.  Parents have control over their
children's access to communications through interactive computer
services.  For example, parents can deny their child access to
the computer; parents can supervise their child's use of
interactive computer services; parents can decline to subscribe
to interactive computer services until their child is older;
parents can take advantage of the free screening and blocking
options available at no extra charge from commercial online
services; and parents can obtain software (some of it free, and
most of it for a very modest cost) for their home computers to
screen material they find objectionable.

<p>114.  Commercial online services such as America
Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy offer
technologies that allow parents to block their children's access
to certain online forums and areas where children might be
exposed to inappropriate content.  These online services, for
example, include a feature that allows parents to prevent their
children from accessing interactive discussion forums (chat
rooms).  They also offer parents the ability to block access to
all or portions of the Internet, including the World Wide Web and
USENET newsgroups, based on keywords, subject matter, or specific
newsgroups.  These tools can be configured to block access to
groups based on any keyword.

<p>115.  In addition, a variety of software providers have
developed applications to use in conjunction with commercial
online services, over and above the parental control features
provided by commercial services, while others are designed
specifically for direct access.  SurfWatch, for example, allows
parents to block their child's access to USENET newsgroups, World
Wide Web, gopher, and ftp sites with sexually explicit content. 
When activated with a private password held only by a parent,
SurfWatch completely prevents any user from accessing these
areas.  The service automatically updates the list of blocked
sites, without any intervention required from the user.  NET
NANNY, another example, contains a dictionary in which the parent
can enter the names of sites that contain sexually explicit or
other material.  Parents may also enter phrases which if
transmitted or received will automatically disconnect the
network.  Among other things, the program also keeps a log of all
activity that occurs on the computer, allowing parents to monitor
their children's use of the computer.

<p>116.  Products such as the Netscape Proxy Server and
WEBTrack provide schools and businesses the ability to block
specific sites from access by all users on the network, and to
track and monitor use of the Internet.

<p>117.  Because the Internet is a global network with
millions of users, speaker-based content restrictions cannot
effectively control the availability of materials inappropriate
for children.  The only effective way to protect children from
inappropriate material on the Internet is to encourage the
continued development and deployment of user-based tools that
empower parents to control their children's online activities
based on the parents' views of what is appropriate for their
children.  The products described here, and others like them,
provide parents these tools, and can do so without the need for
criminalizing or banning the distribution to adults of
constitutionally protected communications.

<title>Content on the Internet</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Content on the Internet</h2>

<font size = +1>
<p>63.  The diversity of content on the Internet is as
broad as the Internet itself.  Content can be found on millions
of computers worldwide, and ranges from academic research to art
to humor to literature to medical information to music to news to
virtually anything else.  Moreover, at any one time, the Internet
serves as the communication medium for literally tens of
thousands of global conversations, political debates, and social
dialogues.  For example, on the Internet, one can view the full
text of the Bible, all of the works of Shakespeare, and numerous
other classic works of literature.  One can browse through
paintings from museums around the world, or view in close-up
detail the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, or see the latest
photographs transmitted by the Jupiter space probe.  One can even
hear pieces of music or view clips of movies and videos over the
Internet.

<p>64.  There is a significant amount of content on the
Internet that could be considered "indecent" for minors in some
communities in the United States, but which most people would
consider to be extremely valuable and appropriate for adults, and
which, in any event, is constitutionally protected for adults. 
Such content includes, for example, great works of art and
literature (containing depictions and descriptions of nudes and
sexual conduct), examples of modern popular culture (containing
popular music, lyrics, movie images, or literature with sexual
content), medical information (containing depictions and
descriptions relating to child birth, sexually transmitted
diseases, and sexually related medical conditions), and
historical and scientific information (containing, for example,
accounts of historic criminal trials or other historical,
sociological, and anthropological works).  Such content, and
other content typically provided by non-commercial providers, is
effectively banned by the Act.

<p>65.  The fear that some communities in the United
States would conclude that this type of valuable material is
"indecent" for minors is well founded.  Communities across the
country have banned or sought to ban classic works of literature,
such as Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck, As I Lay Dying by
William Faulkner, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark
Twain, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain, Catcher in the
Rye by J.D. Salinger, and I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings by Maya
Angelou, as "indecent" for minors.  Even the American Heritage
Dictionary and parts of the Bible have been attacked as being
"indecent" for minors.  All of these works (some of which are
available in whole or in part on the Internet), and works with
similar content, are effectively banned by the Act.

<p>66.  In addition to the above type of content that is
banned by the Act, a tremendous amount of common human discourse
is banned by the Act.  In the course of conversations,
discussions and debates, many citizens use language and imagery
that in some communities would be viewed as "indecent" for
minors.  Vigorous and heated debate often occurs with harsh or
vulgar words.  Many people, and many speakers on the Internet,
use in common discourse words that describe "sexual or excretory
activities or organs" in terms that might be deemed to be
"patently offensive" for minors.  The use of vulgar words in a
dialog with friends -- which would be perfectly legal over the
telephone or in a letter or on a basketball court -- would be
illegal under the Act if sent over the Internet.

<p>67.  There are many examples on the Internet of
valuable content that can be displayed only subject to the threat
of criminal liability and prosecution.

<p>68.  For example, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
written descriptions of sexual intercourse.

<p>69.  There are available on the Internet important
works of literature that include descriptions of sexual
intercourse.

<p>70.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
images of nude men and/or women.

<p>71.  There are available on the Internet numerous
important works of art -- paintings, drawings and photographs by
great masters and modern artists alike -- that depict nude men
and/or women.  An example of such a work of art is Manet's
Olympia.

<p>72.  Similarly, content providers would reasonably fear
prosecution under the Act for engaging in a vigorous online
debate in which there is repeated use of the "seven dirty words"
at issue in the decision in Federal Communications Commission v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).

<p>73.  There are on the Internet -- on a daily basis --
vigorous political, social, and other dialogues and debates that
include unrestricted use of one or more of the "seven dirty
words."

<p>74.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the display on a World Wide
Web "home page" of vulgar statements of the type at issue in
Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971).

<p>75.  The Supreme Court has specifically held that the
use of the vulgar statement in Cohen is protected expression,
even when displayed in public areas when children are present.

<p>76.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the display of a parody that
makes explicit assertions about the "sexual or excretory
activities or organs" of a well known public figure, as was at
issue in Hustler Magazine v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46 (1988).

<p>77.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Falwell
that a parody that made explicit assertions about the "sexual or
excretory activities or organs" of a well known public figure is
protected expression.

<p>78.  Similarly, a content provider would reasonably
fear prosecution under the Act for the unrestricted display of
detailed information concerning birth control and the
transmission of sexually transmitted diseases.

<p>79.  The Supreme Court specifically held in Bolger v.
Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), that such
communications are protected expression and can be mailed,
unsolicited, into homes.

<p>80.  There is a tremendous amount of valuable content
on the Internet that is constitutionally protected for adults,
but is nevertheless subject to prosecution under the Act.

<title>Speech of the Plaintiffs and the Impact of the Act</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Speech of the Plaintiffs and the Impact of the Act</h2>

<font size = +1>

<p>118.  The plaintiffs (and the plaintiffs' members,
subscribers, patrons, and customers) interact with and use the
Internet, and cyberspace generally, in a wide variety of ways,
and they are burdened by the Act in an equally wide variety of
ways.  Plaintiffs include content providers on the Internet,
access providers to the Internet, and users of the content on the
Internet.  The Act burdens plaintiffs in all of these capacities.

<p>119.  Plaintiffs who are content providers (or whose
members or customers are content providers) are expressly subject
to the Act.  Under the Act, anyone who speaks on the Internet is
a content provider.  These plaintiffs do not understand what
standard for indecency should be used under the Act, how the
standard applies to the plaintiffs' speech, or how numerous other
provisions of the Act are to be understood and applied.  These
plaintiffs provide content that would likely or possibly be found
to be indecent as to a young child in some communities. 
Accordingly, they are subject to prosecution under the Act. 
These plaintiffs will either self-censor their speech or will
continue to speak under the threat of prosecution.

<p>120.  Plaintiffs who are, or whose members are, access
providers (including "Internet service providers" or "ISPs") are
expressly subject to the Act.  As access providers these
plaintiffs enable their customers and users to use plaintiffs'
facilities to link to the Internet.  Although the Act provides
defenses for access providers, access providers reasonably fear
that these defenses will not be construed and applied as broadly
as Congress intended, and they therefore fear they may be
directly subject to prosecution under the Act.  These plaintiffs
will continue to provide access under the threat of prosecution.

<p>121.  All plaintiffs (and their members and customers)
are users of the Internet.  These plaintiffs and other users have
a right to engage in ordinary human discourse free from the
threat of prosecution created by the Act.  In particular, these
plaintiffs and other users have a right to receive content that
is criminalized under the Act.

<p>122.  Plaintiffs AMERICAN LIBRARY ASSOCIATION ("ALA")
and FREEDOM TO READ FOUNDATION ("FTRF") sue on behalf of
themselves, their members, who are libraries and librarians
across the country, and their members' patrons.  These libraries
recognize that the Internet offers their patrons a unique
opportunity to access information, and many libraries provide
their patrons with facilities the patrons can use to access the
Internet.  Many libraries also have their own World Wide Web
sites on the Internet.  Thus, in addition to providing patrons
with access to the Internet, where they can access information
posted by third parties, libraries post their own material on the
Internet.  Many libraries post their card catalogues, post
information about current events, sponsor chat groups, post
textual information or art on the library Web site, or post
licensed online versions of reference and other materials from
their library collections.  Patrons could, for example, access
the Web site of a library anywhere in the country to peruse its
card catalogue, review an encyclopedia reference, or check a
definition in the dictionary.  These libraries and librarians are
injured by the Act.  Because of fear of prosecution, they will be
chilled from posting materials on the Internet that might be
deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent" for minors by some
communities.  Given the global and unrestricted nature of the
Internet, the lack of precision in the definition of "indecency,"
and the past attempts by some persons to ban literature and
reference items from library collections, many of ALA's and
FTRF's members may choose not to post a substantial amount of
expressive material at all -- material that many adults might
consider useful for themselves or their own children -- rather
than risk prosecution for posting material that someone in some
other part of the nation might deem "indecent" or "patently
offensive" for minors.  As a result of the Act, the library
patrons ALA and FTRF members serve will be limited in the
constitutionally protected information that would otherwise be
available to them on the Internet.  These plaintiffs (and their
members) sue in their capacity as content providers, access
providers, and users of the Internet, and on behalf of their
patrons who are content providers and users of interactive
computer services.

<p>123.  Plaintiffs AOL, COMPUSERVE, MSN, and PRODIGY sue
on their own behalf and on behalf of their subscribers.  As
online service providers, these plaintiffs are content providers
and access providers, and their customers are content providers
and users of the Internet.  These plaintiffs create content and
make it available both to their customers and to the entire world
of Internet users.  They also allow their customers to create
content on the Internet (including the creation of personal Web
pages).  As speakers, these plaintiffs and their customers are
chilled by the Act in what they can say on the Internet and on
their own online services.  As access providers, these plaintiffs
fear they may be at risk of prosecution under the Act for what
others say.  And as users, these plaintiffs and their customers
are limited by the Act to the ability to access only content that
is suitable for a young child.

<p>124.  Plaintiff MICROSOFT CORPORATION ("Microsoft")
sues on its own behalf as a content provider, access software
provider, and user of the Internet.  Microsoft provides content
on the Internet through MSN, on its own Web sites, and through
postings, messages, and other contributions to the Internet. 
Microsoft's diverse content includes compilations of musical,
artistic, literary and encyclopedic information, news and current
events, and other content.  Some of this content might be
considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in some community
in the nation, exposing Microsoft to the risk of prosecution
under the Act.  As an access software provider, Microsoft sells
or plans to sell software for accessing and exploring the
Internet, for establishing and maintaining Internet servers and
related services, and for creating Web sites and other Internet
content.  As users, Microsoft and its employees are chilled in
what they can say and the frankness of their discussion in
communications posted to or transmitted over the Internet, and
are exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act.  Microsoft
believes that the defenses provided in Section 502(2) of the Act
are provided only to access providers, not to content providers
and/or users, and that as to access providers, including access
software providers, they are inadequate, incomplete, and expose
Microsoft to potential prosecution under the Act.  In addition,
the chilling effect of the Act on other content providers and
users of the Internet will damage Microsoft by reducing the
market for access software, services software, and content-
creation software.

<p>125.  Plaintiff APPLE COMPUTER, INC. ("Apple") sues on
its own behalf as a content provider, access software provider
and user of the Internet.  Apple provides content on the Internet
through eWorld, on its own Web sites, and through postings,
messages and other contributions to the Internet.  Because of the
vagueness of the Act, Apple is uncertain whether some of this
content might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in
some community in the nation, exposing Apple to the risk of
prosecution under the Act.  As users, Apple and its employees are
chilled in what they can say and the frankness of their
discussion in communications posted to or transmitted over the
Internet, and are exposed to a risk of prosecution under the Act. 
In addition, the chilling effect of the Act on other content
providers and users of the Internet will damage Apple by reducing
the market for Internet software.

<p>126.  Plaintiff COMMERCIAL INTERNET EXCHANGE
ASSOCIATION ("CIX") sues on behalf of its member Internet service
providers ("ISPs") and the customers of their members.  CIX
members typically serve as passive carriers who offer access or
transmission, and related incidental capabilities, for the
Internet transmissions of others; as such they are clearly
covered by the defense of &#167; 223(e)(1).  However, because of
ambiguity in this defense, CIX members who operate news servers
that carry USENET content are uncertain whether they may be held
liable for the content of others that resides temporarily on
members' USENET news servers, and is accessed by users from such
servers.  In addition, many CIX members also assist content
providers in establishing and operating Web sites.  In this
capacity CIX members will often be at risk of prosecution under
the Act for what others say.  Due to fear of prosecution, CIX
members are chilled from assisting providers of valuable content
that may be deemed indecent.  Furthermore, CIX members have a
strong interest in the continued growth of the Internet as a
means of communication, and in their subscribers' rights to free
expression over the Internet.  The Act undermines both interests.

<p>127.  Plaintiff NETCOM ON-LINE COMMUNICATION SERVICES,
INC. ("NETCOM") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its
subscribers.  As a provider of Internet access and services,
NETCOM is both a content provider and an access provider. 
NETCOM's individual subscribers create content on the Internet,
such as through the posting of personal web pages, and make that
content available both to their own customers and to the entire
world of Internet users.  As speakers, NETCOM and its subscribers
are chilled in what they can say on the Internet and on their own
Internet sites.  As an access provider, NETCOM cannot control
what others say, yet faces the risk of prosecution under the Act
for the speech of others made available through its systems.  As
users of the Internet, NETCOM and its subscribers are limited by
the Act to accessing and producing only content that is suitable
for a young child.

<p>128.  Plaintiff OPNET, INC. ("OpNet") sues on its own
behalf and on behalf of its subscribers.  As a provider of
Internet access and services to subscribers, OpNet faces
uncertainty as to the applicability of the Act's defenses.  OpNet
also fears that it will be construed to have liability for
content posted by third parties through its systems.

<p>129.  Plaintiff INTERACTIVE SERVICES ASSOCIATION
("ISA") sues on behalf of its members, who include the major
commercial online services, and other content providers, access
providers, and users of the Internet.  As with the online
services, ISA's members risk prosecution for engaging in, or
serving as a conduit for, constitutionally protected speech that
might be deemed indecent.  Accordingly, the Act will chill ISA
members from exercising their First Amendment rights.

<p>130.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN PUBLISHERS
("AAP") sues on behalf of its members, who are content providers
on, and users of, the Internet.  Although rooted in print
publishing, AAP's members are very actively involved in the
Internet.  AAP's members create electronic products to accompany
and supplement their printed books and journals; create custom
educational material on the Internet, publishing on and to
demand; communicate with authors and others, receiving
manuscripts, and editing, typesetting, and designing books
electronically; transmit finished product to licensed end-user
customers; communicate with bookstores and other wholesale and
retail accounts; and promote authors and titles online.  Many of
AAP's members have Web sites and provide content to the world on
the Internet.  Some of the content provided by AAP's members
might be considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors
in some communities (as most of the efforts to ban books in
communities have been directed at books published by AAP's
members).

<p>131.  Plaintiff AMERICAN SOCIETY OF NEWSPAPER EDITORS
("ASNE") sues on behalf of its members, who are editors of daily
newspapers throughout the United States that, in addition to
publications in print form, are now or soon will be published in
electronic formats available to the public on the Internet or
through online service providers.  Historically, the First
Amendment guarantee of "freedom of the press" has protected
newspapers from government-imposed content restrictions which,
like those in the Act, prohibit and punish the dissemination of
materials considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" with
respect to non-adult readers.  By its terms, however, the Act can
be applied to the press in the same manner that it can be applied
to any other person.  ASNE members, who make the editorial
decisions regarding what content will be published in the daily
editions of their newspapers, are concerned that the Act will
require them to censor the online version of their print editions
according to these vague and overbroad statutory standards,
thereby restricting the content of the "electronic" edition of
the daily newspaper in ways that the First Amendment does not
tolerate with respect to the traditional hard-copy print edition. 
For this reason, ASNE believes the Act imposes an unprecedented
but very real threat of unconstitutional press censorship which
could throttle the Internet's potential to greatly enhance the
diversity, availability, timeliness, quality, and utility of
daily newspapers by creating a powerful disincentive for
publication through the use of interactive media technologies.  

<p>132.  Plaintiff NEWSPAPER ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA
("NAA") files this lawsuit on behalf of its members, a majority
of which are daily newspapers in the United States.  Approxi-
mately 175 daily newspapers in North America are currently
available on the Internet, via commercial online services or
through local bulletin board services.  As content providers,
newspapers have utilized the Internet to provide electronic
versions of their printed product.  In fact, many newspapers
provide archives of their print product online.  As access
providers, newspapers have established electronic forums for
local communities to communicate and to conduct business.  While
the content in newspapers is considered neither indecent nor
patently offensive when published on newsprint, it now may be
when published electronically.  The dual standard imposed by the
Act will force newspapers to edit out content from publications
offered on the Internet -- content that is constitutionally
protected and not subject to challenge in printed form.  In many
cases, newspaper publishers will be forced to edit content
contained in the archived electronic version of the newspaper
already placed on the Internet long before the Act went into
effect.  Thus, the Act will seriously infringe upon the rights of
NAA members to publish constitutionally protected news and
information.

<p>133.  Plaintiff ASSOCIATION OF PUBLISHERS, EDITORS AND
WRITERS ("APEW") sues on behalf of its members, who write and
publish in print and online.  Members of APEW include the San
Francisco Guardian, the largest and oldest independently owned
alternative newsweekly in the United States; the Internet Press
Guild, an unincorporated association of writers, authors and
journalists who publish their works online; the California First
Amendment Coalition, a nonprofit, public interest corporation
whose membership comprises approximately 700 individuals and
organizations, including most of California's daily newspapers,
many weekly and student newspapers, broadcasters, law firms and
others; and individual writers and editors including Jim Warren,
a columnist and advocate for open government, and owner and
editor of the listserv GovAccess; Professor David Farber of the
University of Pennsylvania; John Quarterman, a columnist and
Secretary of Matrix Information and Directory Services, Inc.; T.
Bruce Tober, a freelance writer who researches and writes about
the Internet for a variety of print and online publications;
Stephanie Stefanac, Editor of MacWorld Online, a monthly trade
publication for users of the Macintosh computer manufactured by
Apple Computer Co.; and Rogier van Bakel, a Contributing Editor
to Wired Magazine.  The members of APEW face criminal
prosecutions under the Act for the online publication of works
which some communities might find "indecent" or "patently
offensive."  The vagueness of the Act leaves APEW members
uncertain whether the publication of their works over the
Internet would be a crime.

<p>134.  Plaintiff SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL JOURNALISTS
sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its members.  The
Society's membership produces a tremendous volume of content made
available over the Internet:  news stories, special interest
articles, columns, and opinion pieces, among many others.  Each
year brings a dramatic increase in the importance of electronic
media as a venue for distributing the news and opinion pieces
produced by professional journalists.  The members of the Society
fear that their right and ability, traditionally protected by the
First Amendment, to engage in an unfettered marketplace of ideas
and expression will be severely compromised by the Communications
Decency Act.  In addition, the Society operates a listserve
called "SPJ-L," a forum among more than 1,000 Internet users
(both Society members and non-members) from roughly 25 countries
to discuss and debate primarily journalism-related issues. 
Though, or perhaps because, it typically addresses topics of the
utmost seriousness and importance for journalists, the language
used in messages posted on SPJ-L can be offensive, harsh, and
vulgar.  The Society does not edit these messages for content. 
By continuing to provide this forum for discussion and debate,
the Society risks prosecution under the Act.  Its members, whose
writings and other speech would be protected by the First
Amendment in the context of other media, will be chilled by the
Act from engaging in constitutionally protected speech over the
Internet.

<p>135.  Plaintiff HOTWIRED VENTURES LLC ("HotWired
Ventures") sues on its own behalf and on behalf of its
subscribers.  HotWired Ventures operates an online magazine named
Hotwired.  Some of HotWired's editorial content might be
considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" for minors in some
communities.  HotWired features articles containing facts about
and opinions on popular culture.  These articles sometimes
contain vulgar language and references to, inter alia, sexual
acts and sexual organs.  One area of HotWired's editorial focus
is cyberspace-related issues, including governmental attempts to
censor and regulate the Internet.  These articles sometimes
employ vulgar language in expressing opinions about this topic,
and may contain references to, and discussions of, examples of
material that might be deemed "patently offensive" or "indecent"
under the Act.  In addition, HotWired operates a regular section
called Piazza, an interactive discussion area where members can
communicate with each other both through asynchronous postings
called "threads" and in real time "chat rooms," sharing opinions
and engaging in outspoken discourse which can involve vulgar
language and may involve sexually explicit subject matter.  
Plaintiff WIRED VENTURES, LTD. ("Wired Ventures") sues on its own
behalf and on behalf of its subscribers.  Wired Ventures
publishes Wired Magazine, a print publication.  Like HotWired,
Wired publishes articles and short fiction that sometimes contain
vulgar language and references to sexual acts or sexual organs. 
Many articles published in Wired are also published online by
HotWired.  Thus, some articles that are perfectly legal for
minors or adults in print form are nevertheless banned from the
Internet.  The Act creates the anomalous situation that a
publication that is a leading commentator on issues and events
online may not under the Act be able to publish online articles
about the Internet that can be published in print.  HotWired
Ventures and Wired Ventures believe that the Act would severely
infringe their right to publish constitutionally protected
material and their readers' right to choose to read such
material.

<p>136.  Plaintiff AMERICAN BOOKSELLERS ASSOCIATION
("ABA") sues on behalf of its member bookstores (as content
providers and users) and their patrons (as users of the
Internet).  Although ABA's members are not "adult bookstores,"
many of ABA's members sell materials that deal frankly with the
subject of human sexuality.  Some member bookstores have their
own Web pages that discuss the content of books the stores sell. 
Most member bookstores use the Internet and electronic
communications to obtain information and excerpts of books from
publishers.  ABA members' right to learn about, acquire, and
distribute constitutionally protected materials, and their
patrons' right to purchase such constitutionally protected
materials, will be seriously infringed by the Act.

<p>137.  Plaintiff FAMILIES AGAINST INTERNET CENSORSHIP
("FAIC") is a national organization of parents dedicated to the
proposition that they, not the government, should decide what
their children should be able see or receive.  FAIC sues on
behalf of its members.  As parents, FAIC's members are deprived
of the opportunity to raise their children as they see fit.  As
users of the Internet, the Act violates FAIC's members' rights to
receive material suitable for adults.

<p>138.  Plaintiff CITIZENS INTERNET EMPOWERMENT COALITION
("CIEC") sues on behalf of its members as content providers,
access providers, and users of the Internet.  In particular, CIEC
and its members are injured because the Act deprives parents of
the ability to determine the content their children, including
older teenagers, should have access to on the Internet.

<p>139.  Notwithstanding the defenses set forth in the
Act, and the fact that Congress expressly directed courts to
construe those defenses broadly, plaintiffs reasonably fear
prosecution under 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1)(B), as enacted by Section
502(2), for knowingly permitting their services or computers to
be used to display indecent material in a manner available to
persons under age 18, or to transmit such material to specific
persons under age 18.  Unless and until the defendants or the
Courts make clear that these defenses must be broadly construed,
there is nothing to prevent an aggressive prosecutor, in a
particularly intolerant community, from bringing a prosecution
and urging that the defenses be construed more narrowly than
plaintiffs believe Congress intended.

<p>140.  For these reasons, plaintiffs reasonably fear
that the defense in 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(1) may not protect online
service providers from criminal conviction for indecent
expression by third parties when that expression is located on
the providers' computers (such as when an individual computer
user posts a vulgar message to an online discussion).  Plaintiffs
reasonably fear that the defense may apply only to the extent an
online service acts as a mere conduit to enable its subscribers
to gain access to another network.

<p>141.  The speech at issue in this case is fully
protected by the First Amendment.  "Indecent" speech or "patently
offensive" communications, while considered by some to be
offensive or sexually suggestive, are not obscene.  Such speech
can have serious literary, artistic, political or other merit,
and thus has considerable value to adults and to society as a
whole.

<p>142.  The Internet, and cyberspace generally, carries a
significant amount of communications, images and text that might
be deemed inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" for
younger children (for example, in elementary school), but which
would not, under the same community standards, be deemed
inappropriate, "indecent" or "patently offensive" for older
minors (for example, in high school or early college).  The Act
makes no distinction between these age groups, and would
criminalize a university professor's distribution -- using the
university's interactive computer service -- of "indecent" but
classic works of literature to a 17-year-old freshman.

<p>143.  Dissemination of many of the same communications
whose dissemination via interactive computer services is made
criminal by the Act would not be unlawful if disseminated by
traditional print media (e.g., newspaper or magazine) or by using
the United States mail.  Thus, many of the very same
communications the Act makes it unlawful to make available to
minors through interactive computer services can lawfully be made
available through other media, and are, in fact, so available.

<p>144.  Any government regulation of "indecent" or
"patently offensive" speech may withstand constitutional scrutiny
only if it both serves a "compelling interest" and is "the least
restrictive means" to advance that interest, and only if the
benefit gained from the Act outweighs the loss of
constitutionally protected rights.

<p>145.  The government has no legitimate, much less
"compelling," interest in preventing adults from sending or
receiving "indecent" or "patently offensive" speech.  The
government has no legitimate, much less "compelling," interest in
preventing older children from sending or receiving speech that
would only be deemed "indecent" or "patently offensive" if
communicated to younger children.

<p>146. One legitimate interest the government does have
-- and the only interest articulated in the Act (&#167; 509, to be
codified at 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230) -- is to assist parents in
supervising their children's access to expressive materials.  The
Act does not, however, further that interest.  Indeed, the Act
interferes with that interest because parents who decide their
children, whether 7 or 17, should have access to some materials
that some community might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive"
for those children are prevented from exercising their parental
judgment by the Act's blanket prohibition on all access by all
persons under 18 to all such materials.

<p>147.  Even if the government had a legitimate interest,
more broadly, in preventing interactive computer service access
by all persons under 18 to communications that some community
might deem "indecent" or "patently offensive" to them, the Act
would not materially further that interest.  Among other things,
communications of foreign origin are freely accessible on the
Internet, and the United States government has no means to
prosecute foreign content-providers for violation of the Act, or
to deter such postings.  Furthermore, existing statutes and other
provisions in the Act already prohibit the use of computers to
disseminate obscenity, child pornography, harassing speech,
enticing or luring minors into inappropriate activities, and
other speech that is not protected even for adults.

<p>148.  Even if the Act could be viewed as substantially
furthering a compelling governmental interest in protecting
minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive" communications, it
is not the least restrictive means of achieving that interest. 
The screening and blocking tools described above achieve that
interest far more effectively than does the Act itself, and with
no adverse impact on the constitutional rights of adults. 
Efforts by government to spur the further development of such
tools would further the claimed governmental interest more
directly and materially than does the Act.

<p>149.  Even if the Act could be viewed as the least
restrictive means to further a compelling governmental interest
in protecting minors from "indecent" or "patently offensive"
communications, any benefit gained from the Act would be far
outweighed by the loss of constitutionally protected rights of
adults, because only some applications of the Act will in fact
protect minors, but every application of the Act will punish or
deter speech that is constitutionally protected for adults.

<title>NIST Discussion Paper #1 - Export of Software Key Escrowed Encryption</title>
</head>
<body>
<pre>         
Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper #1


                      Issues -- Export of
                 Software Key Escrowed Encryption


On August 17, 1995, the Administration announced its proposal to
permit the ready export of software encryption provided that the
products use algorithms with key space that does not exceed 64
bits and the key(s) required to decrypt messages/files are
escrowed with approved escrow agents.  Under the proposal,
products will be reviewed to verify that they satisfy the
criteria and, if so, they will be transferred to the Commodity
Control List administered by the Department of Commerce where the
products can be exported under a general license (in much the
same way that 40-bit RC2/RC4 encryption is licensed today).

We are working toward creating broadly stated criteria that are
in the nature of performance specifications.  To meet these
criteria, encryption products will need to implement key escrow
mechanisms that cannot be readily altered or bypassed so as to
defeat the purposes of key escrowing.

The criteria, when finalized and published, will state the
objectives, but not the exact technical method(s), by which those
objectives are satisfied.  This is to provide software publishers
the flexibility to design methods for meeting our stated
objectives in a manner that is compatible with the design of
their products.  There are, therefore, a number of questions we
must work together to answer in order to draft effective
criteria.  These questions are:

*    Avoiding multiple encryption -- How can the product be
     designed so as to prevent doubling (or tripling, etc.) the
     key space of the algorithm?

*    Disabling the key escrow mechanism -- How can products be
     made resistant to alteration that would disable or
     circumvent the key escrow mechanism?  How can the "static
     patch" problem be avoided?  How can this be tested?

*    Access to escrow information -- What mechanisms must be
     designed into encryption products to allow authorized access
     to escrowed keys?  This likely includes the identity of the
     key escrow agent(s) and a serial number for the key escrow
     agent to use to identify the key(s)/component(s) necessary
     to decrypt the message.  What other information will be
     necessary to be provided to the escrow agent to identify the
     necessary key(s)/component(s)?  Are there other comparable
     viable approaches?

*    Non-escrowed use -- How can products be made so that they do
     not function with non-escrowed products (or tampered
     escrowed products)?  How can this be tested?

*    Limiting surveillance -- How can products be designed so
     that information both sent and received by the user can be
     decrypted without release of keys of other users?

*    Practical Key Access -- How can mechanisms be designed so
     that repeated involvement of escrow agents is not required
     for decryption for multiple files/messages during the
     specified access period?

*    Assurance that keys are escrowed -- How can it be assured
     that key escrow products are indeed satisfactorily escrowed?
     For example, products could be required to be escrowed at
     time of manufacture or be made inoperable until properly
     escrowed.

*    Ability to re-escrow keys -- How can products be designed so
     that new keys can be escrowed at the user's discretion with
     a U.S. Government approved escrow agent?

*    Certified escrow agents -- Can products be designed so that
     only escrow agents certified by the U.S. government
     (domestic, or under suitable arrangements, foreign) are
     utilized?  What should be the criteria for an acceptable
     U.S. escrow agent?

                         --------------

With your input, we are hopeful that this effort will lead to
definitive criteria, which will facilitate the development of
exportable products and help minimize the time required to obtain
export licenses.  The Administration seeks to finalize such
criteria and make formal conforming modifications to the export
regulations before the end of 1995.

<title>NIST Discussion Paper #3 -- Draft Administration Crypto Policy 
Statemen</title>
</head>
<body>

<pre>


Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper #3

                       Export Criteria Discussion Draft --
                      64-bit Software Key Escrow Encryption

As discussed at the SPA/AEA meeting on August 17, 1995, the
Administration is willing to allow the export of software
encryption provided that the products use algorithms with key
space that does not exceed 64 bits and the key(s) required to
decrypt messages/files are escrowed with approved escrow agents. 
On the same date, the September 6-7 key escrow issues meeting at
NIST was also announced.  The two principal topics at the meeting
will be:  discussion of issues of exportability of 64-bit
software key escrow encryption and 2) desirable characteristics
for key escrow agents. 

In order to help make most productive use of the limited time
available at the upcoming meeting and to better focus
deliberation, the following criteria are being distributed for
discussion purposes.  Since it is important that final criteria
be clear, straightforward, consistent, and implementable, please
review these draft criteria and be prepared to discuss 
how they may be refined and made more specific.  

                          --- Draft Export Criteria ---

for Software Key Escrow Encryption 

Software key escrow encryption products meeting the following
criteria will be granted special export licensing treatment
similar to that afforded other mass-market software products with
encryption.  

1.    The product will use an unclassified encryption algorithm
      (e.g., DES, RC4) with a key length not to exceed 64 bits.

2.    The product shall be designed to prevent multiple
      encryption (e.g., triple-DES).

3.    The key required to decrypt each message or file shall be
      accessible through a key escrow mechanism in the product,
      and such keys will be escrowed during manufacture in
      accordance with #10.  If such keys are not escrowed during
      manufacture, the product shall be inoperable until the key
      is escrowed in accordance with #10.

4.    The key escrow mechanism shall be designed to include with
      each encrypted message or file, in a format accessible by
      authorized entities, the identity of the key escrow
      agent(s), and information sufficient for the escrow
      agent(s) to identify the key or key components required to
      decrypt that message.

5.    The product shall be resistant to any alteration that would
      disable or circumvent the key escrow mechanism, to include
      being designed so that the key escrow mechanism cannot be
      disabled by a static patch, (i.e., the replacement of a
      block of code by a modified block).

6.    The product shall not decrypt messages or files encrypted
      by non-escrowed products, including products whose key
      escrow mechanisms have been altered or disabled.

7.    The key escrow mechanism allows access to a user's
      encrypted information regardless of whether that user is
      the sender or the intended recipient of the encrypted
      information.

8.    The key escrow mechanism shall not require repeated
      involvement by the escrow agents for the recovery of
      multiple decryption keys during the period of authorized
      access.

9.    In the event any such product is or may be available in the
      United States, each production copy of the software shall
      either have a unique key required for decrypting messages
      or files that is escrowed in accordance with #10, or have
      the capability for its escrow mechanism to be rekeyed and
      any new key to be escrowed in accordance with #10.


10.   The product shall accept escrow of its key(s) only with
      escrow agents certified by the U.S. Government or by
      foreign governments with which the U.S. Government has
      formal agreements consistent with U.S. law enforcement and
      national security requirements.

Note: Software products incorporating additional encryption
methods other than key escrow encryption methods will be
evaluated for export on the basis of each encryption method
included, as is already the case with existing products. 
Accordingly, these criteria apply only to the key escrow
encryption method incorporated by a software product, and not to
other non-escrowed encryption methods it may incorporate.  For
instance, non-escrowed encryption using a key length of 40 bits
or less will continue to be exportable under existing export
regulations.

<title>IWG Report to Senator Leahy: Overview/Executive Summary</title>
<body>
<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Internet and other interactive services are a new medium, and a 
new array of markets, different from any means of communication that has 
come before.  This new medium raises fundamental questions about the 
appropriate balance between the needs of the market, of American families, 
and basic constitutional free speech and privacy guarantees that Americans 
value so deeply.  In order to protect families and children in this open, global 
network, we should first rely on the entrepreneurial spirit of the interactive 
services market to build parental empowerment tools, and encourage the 
industry to work together to ensure that such solutions are widely available.  
The interactive media market must not be regulated like telegraphs, broadcast 
radio and television, and telephones, thereby stifling the development of an 
important new communications medium with burdensome regulations.  
Rather, we should identify policies that enable the interactive media market 
to flourish like the personal computer industry, and provide parents the 
ability to protect their children from inappropriate material that is 
internationally-available.
<p>
In answer to questions posed to the Interactive Working Group by 
Senator Patrick Leahy earlier this year, this report contains an assessment of:
<p><ol>
<li>general policy issues at stake in the regulation of content on the 
National Information Infrastructure;
<p>
<li>software and services available today that enable parents to 
restrict their children from access to inappropriate material 
online;
<p>
<li>the current state of criminal law regarding obscenity, child 
pornography, and harassment online;
<p>
<li>threats to free speech, free press and individual privacy raised by 
proposed regulation of indecency in interactive media.
</ol><p>
We begin with a brief overview of the contents of the report:
<p>
<p>
<h3>A.	A New Regulatory Model for Interactive Media is needed to 
Ensure Free Speech and Continued Innovation in the National 
and International Information Infrastructure</h3>
<p>
The Internet is a global information and communications system 
which is becoming a critical resource for organizations and individuals 
around the world.  Businesses, schools, libraries, researchers, community 
groups, and individuals are all coming to rely on the Internet as a vital 
communications system and information resource.  The Internet and other 
interactive media include electronic mail, the World Wide Web, online 
discussion groups, and other multimedia information resources.  Providers 
of interactive media services range from large and small online services and 
bulletin boards, to those who provide services for their own use such as 
schools, libraries, and large and small businesses.
<p>
To ensure the continued growth of the new interactive media market, 
national policy for the Internet must:
<p><ol>
<li>preserve the vibrant free market in interactive media, free from 
regulation of constitutionally-protected communications and 
information;
<p>
<li>preserve full constitutional free speech and privacy protections 
in new interactive media;
<p>
<li>encourage the industry to work together to develop blocking and 
filtering technologies that empower parents to restrict their 
children's access to offensive material;
<p>
<li>ensure emerging media not be used for criminal activity such as 
stalking, trafficking in obscenity, and the creation of child 
pornography.
</ol>
<p>
<h3>B.	Currently Available Blocking and Filtering Technology, 
combined with public education, can empower parents to protect 
their children from inappropriate material online</h3>
<p>
While the vast majority of content on the Internet is intended for 
legitimate educational, cultural, political, or entertainment value.  Some 
material on the Internet, however, may not be appropriate for children. 
Moreover, much of this material is accessible from the United States but 
transmitted from other countries, beyond the practical reach of U.S. law.  In 
order to protect children we must rely on powerful new blocking and filtering 
technology to empower parents to make choices about the material which 
their children can access.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Entrepreneurial effort has already produced blocking and 
filtering products for families and schools:</b>  The inherent power 
of computer software allows the creation of computer programs 
which enable parents to block material from the reach of their 
children automatically, without the need for constant parental 
supervision.  Such software can be easily installed by parents, 
even those who are not computer experts.
<p>
<li><b>The global and decentralized nature of interactive media 
requires new approaches to child protection: </b> Censorship of 
centralized media such as radio and television may be effective 
at keeping the "seven dirty words" off the airwaves.  However, 
on the Internet, with tens of millions of content creators all over 
the world, US law, no matter how tough, will never be able to 
keep offensive material out of the reach of kids.
<p>
<li><b>Industry-wide initiatives are developing standard label and 
blocking conventions to increase the effectiveness of blocking:</b>  
The flexibility of interactive media allows multiple rating 
systems to co-exist so that individuals and families can chose a 
rating system that best reflects their own values.  No single 
government-mandated system could be as comprehensive or 
flexible as voluntary private sector alternatives.
<p>
<li><b>Individual and parental choice assures full respect for the free 
speech rights in interactive media:</b>  Relying on individuals and 
parents, not the government, to make choices about the content 
that they and their families receive assures maximum respect for 
First Amendment rights of adults to receive and transmit 
constitutionally-protected material, and allows families, not 
federal bureaucrats, to determine what information is most 
consistent with their own moral values.
</ul><p>
Any changes in federal law should seek to remove the Hobson's choice faced 
by all who provide access to the Internet.  In order to protect children, legal 
disincentives facing those who would create 'child safe' areas should be 
removed.
<p><ul>
<li><b>Recent case law discourages online providers from screening 
material that is inappropriate for children:</b>  In the recent Stratton 
Oakmont, Inc. v. Prodigy Services Company, No. 31063/94 (N.Y. 
Sup. Ct. May 24, 1995) case, Prodigy was found to be a "publisher" 
of libelous statements made by a subscriber on one of its online 
bulletin boards.  Such added exposure to legal liability is a 
substantial disincentive to the creation of 'child safe' interactive 
services.
<p>
<li><b>Neither federal nor state law should punish service providers 
for creating child-safe services.</b>  The marketplace should be free 
to create a variety of online forums, some that provide only 
material appropriate for children, and others that are more open 
and designed for a wider audience. 
</ul><p>
<h3>C.	There is No Anarchy in Interactive Media:  Vigorous 
enforcement of current criminal laws will protect all users from 
obscenity, child pornography, and harassment online</h3>
<p>
Law enforcement agencies and some prominent pro-family groups 
agree current laws already enable prosecutions of online obscenity violations.  
More vigorous enforcement of existing criminal laws may, however, be 
necessary.  Following this logic, it is unnecessary to amend federal law to 
prohibit distribution of obscenity by computer, since existing law already 
criminalizes such conduct, as well as threats and harassment by computer.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The Department of Justice and American Family Association 
state that existing laws already criminalize obscenity online.</b>
<p>
<li><b>Tough obscenity, child pornography and harassment laws are 
already in the federal criminal code:</b>  Under existing Federal law 
trafficking in <b>obscenity</b> (18 U.S.C. 1462, 1464, 1466), <b>child 
pornography</b> (18 U.S.C. 2252), <b>harassment</b> (18 U.S.C. 875(c)), 
<b>illegal solicitation or luring of minors </b>(18 U.S.C. 2423(b)), and 
<b>threatening to injure someone</b> (18 U.S.C. 875(c)) have already 
been successfully applied to punish conduct on computer 
networks.
<p>
<li><b>Online obscenity and child pornography crimes are being 
prosecuted around the country:</b>  These laws are being enforced, 
as is evident by numerous prosecutions around the country.
<p>
<li><b>The Senate-passed legislative proposals fail to add any 
protections against online stalking and child solicitation:</b>  
Everyone is concerned about protecting children from threats 
online and off.  Ironically, the Senate-passed Communications 
Decency Amendment only punishes indecency and obscenity, 
not stalking or solicitation.  Neither prosecutors nor police 
receive any additional help in the prevention or prosecution of 
online crimes against children.
</ul><p>
<h3>D.	Bans on indecent communications online are 
unconstitutional</h3>
<p>
The unique nature of interactive media demands that policy makers 
carefully evaluate the application of the First Amendment in a new light.  
Essential to the Court's approval of indecency restrictions in the broadcast 
media was the fact that listeners had insufficient control over programming 
to which they were exposed.  Any effort to impose similar indecency 
restrictions on interactive media, however, will not pass constitutional 
scrutiny given the high degree of user control in this new medium.
<p><ul>
<li><b>To assure the First Amendment free flow of information and 
protect individual privacy rights, liability for online service 
providers must be carefully limited:</b>  If online system and service 
providers are held criminally liable for obscene or indecent 
material created by their users, and not intentionally purveyed 
by the provider, then public service providers and private 
system operators will be forced to become private censors in 
order to limit their own legal risk.  Just as current law limits the 
liability of phone companies, mail services, and other carriers for 
the content of material which the carrier merely transports, 
online service provider liability should be limited in order to 
assure the free flow of information on the National Information 
Infrastructure.  
<p>
<li><b>Ability of users and parents to control the material to which they 
have access places constitutional limits on the degree to which 
the government can censor material based on its content:</b>  The 
First Amendment has been interpreted to allow restrictions on 
indecent speech only if such government restrictions are the 
"least restrictive means" of protecting children or accomplishing 
other important government goals.  Given that parents are able 
to protect their children from unwanted material using 
screening tools, government restrictions are unnecessary and 
therefore unconstitutional.
<p>
<li><b>Online service providers should not be forced to become private 
censors:</b>  If online services or individual system operators are 
held liable for all of their users' communications, the services 
will be forced to impose stringent censorship rules on their users 
in order to limit the corporate liability of the service provider.  
Such rules would create a chilling effect on users of interactive 
media.
<p>
<li><b>There are great constitutional difficulties in defining 
"indecency":</b>  Neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court have 
ever established a single definition for what constitutes 
"indecent" material.  The FCC has offered different definitions 
for indecency depending on the communications medium.  
Embarking on such a process for interactive media would be 
fraught with Constitutional disputes and challenges in court.  
Efforts to ban indecency on dial-a-porn services lead to ten years 
of constitutional litigation, thus delaying the enforcement of 
those regulations considerably.
<p>
<li><b>The Federal Communications Commission should not be given 
power to regulate content in interactive media:</b>  The inherent 
complexity and constitutional difficulties of regulating indecency 
would involve the FCC in lengthy and burdensome rulemaking 
to implement any indecency ban.  Such extension of FCC control 
over new media will create unnecessary bureaucratic intrusions 
that hinder the development of new interactive media and 
private sector screening options.

<title>Senator Leahy's March 15 letter to the IWG</title>

<body>
<p>
<h2>Senator Leahy's March 15, 1995 Letter to IWG Requesting The 
Report</h3>
<p>
<pre>
March 15, 1995 

Mr. Jerry Berman
Interactive Working Group
Center for Democracy and Technology
1001 G St., NW
Suite 700 East
Washington, DC 2000

Dear Mr. Berman:

Interactive communications media are growing at an astonishing rate, 
promising great advances for domestic commerce, international 
competitiveness, and political and cultural life. Nearly ten years
ago, we began work on the Electronic Communications Priva cy Act 
("ECPA"), in recognition of the fact that new computer and communications 
technologies would only flourish in an environment where the privacy 
rights of users, the intellectual property rights of content providers, and the 
obligations of service pr oviders are clear under statute. We continued that 
work last year in the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
("CALEA"). Today, as interactive
communications systems expand in the consumer market, there is a critical 
need to clarify the First Amendment rights and responsibilities of 
information providers, users and carriers. 

As you know, a number of bills have been introduced in the Senate that 
would regulate a wide range of controversial content on interactive 
information services, including the Internet. This legislation is motivated by 
two important goals. First, parents s hould be able to control their children's 
access to controversial material. Second, adult users should be able to exercise 
reasonable control over the information they receive so they may avoid 
material offense to them.

The proposed legislative solutions to achieve these goals raise serious 
concerns about the free flow of information in new communications media, 
and threaten to squelch the development of the Internet and a vital new 
industry along with it. 

I understand that industry and public interest organizations have 
independently come together to form the Interactive Working Group in 
order to address these issues. My hope is that the group will explore public 
policy and technology options for addressin g the problems of children's 
access to obscene content in a manner which promotes parental 
empowerment and First Amendment values. I would appreciate the 
Interactive Working group Consideration of and recommendation on
the following issues: 

1. THE NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE: 

What effect will content regulation have on the development of the national 
and global information infrastructure, including the Internet and other 
interactive services? 

2. CURRENT LAW AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS: 

What is the current lawregulating obscenity and harassment online? What 
gaps, if any, are there in current federal and state laws which hamper 
prosecution of criminal activity, including violations of
the copyright and obscenity laws, in interactive media ? 

3. TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS: 

Does interactive technology enable parents to control their children's access to 
information in online services today? If not, what steps would be required to 
enable such parental control? Can the Working Group provide 
demonstrations of these user control technologies? 

4. CONSTITUTIONAL FREE SPEECH AND PRIVACY ISSUES: 

What are the First Amendment implications of content regulation in 
interactive media? What is the impact of carrier liability for content on ECPA, CALEA and constitutional privacy protections? 

Since the passage of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, and again in 
CALEA, we have always worked to assure a proper balance of constitutional 
liberties, competitiveness and legitimate government interest in the 
regulation of new communications te chnologies. As I receive input from a 
number of sources on these important issues, I look forward to your advice as 
well. My staff is available to meet with members of your group to discuss 
these issues further. 

Sincerely, 

[sig] 

Patrick J. Leahy United States Senator

<title>NIST Discussion Paper #2 Desirable Characteristics for Key Escrow Agents</title>
</head>
<body>

<pre>

Key Escrow Issues Meeting, September 6-7, 1995
Discussion Paper #2


                      Discussion Issues:
         Desirable Characteristics for Key Escrow Agents


In the government's recent announcement of its intent to allow
the export of 64-bit software key escrow encryption products, one
stipulation was that the keys would be escrowed with an approved
key escrow agent.(*1)  Exactly what qualifications/considerations
are appropriate for approval as a key escrow agent have not been
defined.  Some of the issues which need to be discussed and
resolved include the following:

*    What kinds of organizations should be excluded from
     consideration as approved key escrow agents?

*    What sort of legal agreement between the government and the
     key escrow agent is necessary to stipulate the
     responsibilities of the agent?  Should this include the
     terms and conditions under which release of a key is
     required?

*    How will liability for unauthorized release of key be
     handled?

*    Should, for example, intentionally misreleasing or
     destroying a key be criminalized?  Should this include other
     actions?

*    How can the government's needs for confidentiality of key
     release be handled?

*    Should approval of key escrow agents be tied to a public key
     infrastructure (for digital signatures and other purposes)?

*    What procedures need to be developed for the storage and
     safeguarding of keys?

*    What are the acceptable performance criteria (e.g., around-
     the-clock availability, accessibility, reliability, etc.)
     for approved key escrow agents?

*    Under what circumstances will key escrow agents in foreign
     countries be approved?

*    What process will be used to approve escrow agents?
     Costs/who pays?
---------
(*1)  "Approved," for the purposes of this discussion, means that
the government (or its agent) has formally granted permission for
an organization to hold keys for exportable encryption products.

<title>Peter Lewis -- On The Net, Monday September 11, 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
<p>
On The Net Column<br>
Monday, Sept. 11, 1995<br>
Peter H. Lewis<br>
<p>
(Posted With Permission From The Author)
<p>
In terms of its ability to raise the nation's blood pressure, the
debate over data encryption has not yet reached the same levels as gun
control.
<p>        
But last week the Clinton Administration appeared to set the stage
for an equally divisive national debate over the rights of businesses and
individuals to keep secrets when using telephones, computers and other
forms of electronic communications.
<p.        
In two days of public hearings last week in Gaithersburg, Md., home
of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the
Administration in effect unveiled its long-awaited proposals to relax
restrictions on the export of cryptographic software.
<p> 
In effect, the Administration drew a line in the virtual sands of
cyberspace, signaling that it is willing to permit Americans to put
stronger cryptographic locks on their electronic data only if a spare key
to those locks is made available on demand to law enforcement agencies.
<p>       
There looms the conflict. Although the current debate is about
export controls on an esoteric form of software that most Americans do not
use, the "export" issue is ultimately irrelevant in today's era of global
electronic voice and data networks, where passwords, not passports, are
checked at the gates. Simply placing a common privacy program on an
Internet-connected computer in Austin, Tex., is effectively no different
from sending a shrink-wrapped copy of the program to Moscow.
<p>       
The real issue is how much privacy the Government is willing to
allow its own citizens, and the latest word from the Clinton Administration
is that the right to electronic privacy, like the right to bear arms, is
not absolute.
<p>        
<center>***</center>
<p>
Cryptography is the science of secret writing. In this digital era,
secret writing applies not just to notes handed from one spy to another,
but also to telephone calls between individuals, funds transfers between
banks, bank and credit card records, electronic mail, faxes, and an endless
variety of computer files.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been clear and consistent in
outlining its basic position on cryptographic systems. The goal is to allow
American citizens and companies to use the strongest possible cryptographic
technology, while at the same time preserving the ability of law
enforcement agencies to perform court-authorized wiretaps as part of the
effort to catch drug dealers, terrorists, child pornographers and other
miscreants.
<p>        
In other words, it favors strong cryptography, but not too strong.
<p>       
One way to measure the strength of cryptographic software is the
length of the software key necessary to encode and decode a message. The
longer the key, in terms of digital bits, the harder it is for an
unauthorized user to decipher the message.
<p>        
In recent years, the Government has generally permitted Americans
to export cryptographic software with key lengths up to 40 bits. Experts
say that 40-bit keys are secure from casual snooping, but will fall quickly
to a determined codebreaker. The fact that the Government allows 40-bit
encryption systems to be exported is a pretty good indication that the
National Security Agency can break them easily.
<p>        
There are literally hundreds of stronger cryptography programs
readily available outside the United States, and these stronger programs
are attractive to businesses that want to safeguard their data from
Internet bandits and corporate and government spies.
<p>        
Last week, after more than a year of intense analysis of the
software export controls issue, the Government unveiled what it said was
the best possible compromise.
<p>        
Under the new policy, companies can export encryption algorithms
using 64-bit keys, which are much more secure, but only if spare keys are
made available to law enforcement agents under standard legal procedures.
Otherwise, the 40-bit limit continues to apply.
<p>        
The "spare key" technology, officially known as key escrow, is
anathema to many privacy advocates who fear Government abuses. The
Government first proposed a key escrow system with its so-called Clipper
Chip, a technology that failed to win acceptance even as a voluntary
standard.
<p>        
Unlike Clipper, which was based on a classified algorithm called
Skipjack that only a few people outside the Government were allowed to
examine, the new policy allows people to use any algorithm they choose --
as long as it uses a key no larger than 64 bits, and as long as the keys
are entrusted to a domestic third party accessible to the Government, and
as long as the key escrow mechanisms cannot be readily altered or bypassed.
<p>        
Also unlike Clipper, which required a special tamper-proof
microprocessor that would have added cost, complexity and extra power
requirements to communications devices, the new proposals can be
implemented entirely in software.
<p>        
Key escrow systems make a lot of sense for most American companies,
at least for internal use. Having a spare set of keys lessens the risk of a
disgruntled employee or saboteur locking up vital company files.
<p>        
But key escrow is also unpopular with American computer and
software companies, who say it prevents them from competing against foreign
companies that have no similar constraints, and with many multinational
corporations, who say it prevents them from working with foreign companies
that don't especially care for the idea of Uncle Sam holding the keys to
their data banks.
<p>        
"If this was intended to be any sort of compromise, I don't think
it achieved its end," said Whitfield Diffie, a Distinguished Engineer at
Sun Microsystems who attended the meetings. "I didn't see anybody who was
enthusiastic."
<p>
<center>***</center>
<p>
Raymond G. Kammer, deputy director of NIST, suggested that the
hearings last week were intended to elicit public comment, and that the
Administration's final position on cryptographic policy are still under
analysis.
<p>        
However, the emergence of key escrow issues at the NIST proceedings
suggest that key escrow is emerging as a non-negotiable demand by some
factions of the Clinton Administration, especially the Justice Department
and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, led by Louis Freeh. Mr. Freeh
sincerely believes that data encryption is a weapon, and has publicly
called for domestic restrictions on civilian cryptography.
<p>        
"If this fails," said one observer familiar with the Administration's 
thinking on the proposed change in cryptographic policy, "it's going to 
lead to a very devisive debate. And the irony, for libertarians who 
oppose key escrow, is that if it fails, I am convinced that Louis Freeh 
cannot be true to his job without proposing domestic
controls on data encryption."
<p>        
"He's not going to give up without a fight, and neither is the
Justice Department," said the observer, who spoke on the condition he not
be identified.
<p>
Others say they do not think the Clinton Administration has yet
arrived at a concrete position, even after more than a year of study and
debate. "I don't think it's a final offer," said John Gilmore, a member of
the board of directors of Cygnus Support Inc., a computer company in
Mountain View, Calif. "It looks to me like a weak strawman, a first offer,
a proposal to dance."
<p>        
The question is whether American citizens and businesses have the
patience to wait for the music to start. And the issue may be moot, anyway.
<p>        
"The Internet Architecture Board has specifically decided to ignore
export controls in designing the security infrastructure for the next
generation of Internet protocols," Mr. Gilmore said. "The Internet of 1998
will provide automatic, secure, and fully private communication, without
key escrow, internationally. The protocols will be implemented
independently in a dozen different countries."
<p>        
In other words, the international Internet community is already
planning to jump over the new line in the sand drawn last week by the
Clinton Administration. Cryptography that is stronger and better than the
Government's proposed system will become an integral part of the Internet,
and American companies and individuals would be foolish not to use it.
<p> 
At that point, millions of Americans will come in direct conflict
with Government policy, and the popular gun-control bumper sticker may be
replaced by one that says, "If cryptography is outlawed, only outlaws will
have cryptography."

          of Pennsylvania


                           June 11, 1996





        ADJUDICATION ON MOTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION


                                I.
                           INTRODUCTION
                       Procedural Background
          Before us are motions for a preliminary injunction
filed by plaintiffs who challenge on constitutional grounds 
provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA or "the
Act"), which constitutes Title V of the Telecommunications Act of
1996, signed into law by the President on February 8, 1996.[1] 
Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104,  502, 110
Stat. 56, 133-35.  Plaintiffs include various organizations and
individuals who, inter alia, are associated with the computer
and/or communications industries, or who publish or post
materials on the Internet, or belong to various citizen groups. 
See ACLU Complaint ( 7-26), ALA First Amended Complaint ( 3,
12-33).  
          The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, the
Attorney General of the United States, and the United States
Department of Justice.  For convenience, we will refer to these
defendants as the Government.  Plaintiffs contend that the two
challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to
communications over the Internet which might be deemed "indecent"
or "patently offensive" for minors, defined as persons under the
age of eighteen, infringe upon rights protected by the First
Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.
          Plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 96-963, in which the
lead plaintiff is the American Civil Liberties Union (the
ACLU),[2] filed their action in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the day the Act was
signed, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin
enforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15,
1996, following an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L.
Buckwalter, to whom the case had been assigned, granted a limited
temporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum that 47
U.S.C.  223(a)(1)(B) ("the indecency provision" of the CDA) was
unconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief Judge Dolores
K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals
for the Third Circuit, having been requested by the parties and
the district court to convene a three-judge court, pursuant to 
561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a court consisting of, in
addition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of the same
district, and herself, as the circuit judge required by 28 U.S.C.
 2284.
          After a conference with the court, the parties entered
into a stipulation, which the court approved on February 26,
1996, wherein the Attorney General agreed that:
          she will not initiate any investigations or
          prosecutions for violations of 47 U.S.C. 
          223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment
          of this provision until the three-judge court
          hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary
          Injunction . . . and has decided the motion.

The Attorney General's commitment was qualified to the extent 
that:
          her full authority to investigate or
          prosecute any violation of  223(a)(1)(B), as
          amended, and  223(d) as to conduct which
          occurs or occurred during any period of time
          after enactment of these provisions
          (including for the period of time to which
          this stipulation applies) should the Court
          deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is
          granted, should these provisions ultimately
          be upheld.

Stipulation,  4, in C.A. No. 96-963.
          Shortly thereafter, the American Library Association,
Inc. (the ALA) and others[3] filed a similar action at C.A. No.
96-1458.  On February 27, 1996, Chief Judge Sloviter, again
pursuant to  561(a) of the CDA and upon request, convened the
same three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C.  2284.  The actions
were consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), "for all
matters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminary
injunction in these cases, including the hearing on such
motions."
          The parties were afforded expedited discovery in
connection with the motions for preliminary injunction, and they
cooperated with Judge Dalzell, who had been assigned the case
management aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery was
proceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the court
began receiving evidence at the consolidated hearings which were
conducted on March 21 and 22, and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  In
order to expedite the proceedings, the parties worked closely
with Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of the
underlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief before
the court by sworn declarations, so that the hearings were
largely devoted to cross-examination of certain of the witnesses
whose declarations had been filed.  The parties submitted
proposed findings of fact and post-hearing memoranda on April 29,
and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.[4]

                   Statutory Provisions at Issue

          Plaintiffs focus their challenge on two provisions of
section 502 of the CDA which amend 47 U.S.C.  223(a) and
223(d).
          Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any person
in interstate or foreign communications who, "by means of a
telecommunications device,"[5] "knowingly . . . makes, creates, or
solicits" and "initiates the transmission" of "any comment,
request, suggestion, proposal, image or other communication which
is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of the
communication is under 18 years of age," "shall be criminally
fined or imprisoned." (emphasis added).  
          Section 223(d)(1) ("the patently offensive provision"),
makes it a crime to use an "interactive computer service"[6] to
"send" or "display in a manner available" to a person under age
18, "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other
communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs, regardless
of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated
the communication." 
          Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds the
provisions in  223(a)(2) and  223(d)(2), which make it a crime
for anyone to "knowingly permit[] any telecommunications facility
under [his or her] control to be used for any activity
prohibited" in  223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1).  The challenged
provisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two years
imprisonment, or both for each offense.  
          Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with the
statute to the extent that it covers obscenity or child
pornography, which were already proscribed before the CDA's
adoption.  See 18 U.S.C.  1464-65 (criminalizing obscene
material); id.  2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography); see
also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).
          Plaintiffs in the ACLU action also challenge the
provision of the CDA that criminalizes speech over the Internet
that transmits information about abortions or abortifacient drugs
and devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C.  1462(c).  That
section now prohibits the sending and receiving of information
over the Internet by any means regarding "where, how, or of whom,
or by what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing designed,
adapted, or intended for producing abortion] may be obtained or
made".  The Government has stated that it does not contest
plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of the provision of
the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C.  1462(c).[7] 
          As part of its argument that the CDA passes
constitutional muster, the Government cites the CDA's "safe
harbor" defenses in new  223(e) of 47 U.S.C., which provides:
          (e)  Defenses

          In addition to any other defenses available
          by law:

               (1)  No person shall be held to have violated
          subsection (a) or (d) of this section solely for
          providing access or connection to or from a
          facility, system, or network not under that
          person's control, including transmission,
          downloading, intermediate storage, access
          software, or other related capabilities that are
          incidental to providing such access or connection
          that does not include the creation of the content
          of the communication.

               (2)  The defenses provided by paragraph (1)
          of this subsection shall not be applicable to a
          person who is a conspirator with an entity
          actively involved in the creation or knowing
          distribution of communications that violate this
          section, or who knowingly advertises the
          availability of such communications.

               (3)  The defenses provided in paragraph (1)
          of this subsection shall not be applicable to a
          person who provides access or connection to a
          facility, system, or network engaged in the
          violation of this section that is owned or
          controlled by such person.

               (4)  No employer shall be held liable under
          this section for the actions of an employee or
          agent unless the employee's or agent's conduct is
          within the scope of his or her employment or
          agency and the employer (A) having knowledge of
          such conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct,
          or (B) recklessly disregards such conduct.

               (5)  It is a defense to a prosecution under
          subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d) of this section, or
          under subsection (a)(2) of this section with
          respect to the use of a facility for an activity
          under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person --

               (A)  has taken, in good faith, reasonable,
          effective, and appropriate actions under the
          circumstances to restrict or prevent access by
          minors to a communication specified in such
          subsections, which may involve any appropriate
          measures to restrict minors from such
          communications, including any method which is
          feasible under available technology; or

               (B)  has restricted access to such
          communication by requiring use of a verified
          credit card, debit account, adult access code, or
          adult personal identification number.

               (6)  The [Federal Communications] Commission
          may describe measures which are reasonable,
          effective, and appropriate to restrict access to
          prohibited communications under subsection (d) of
          this section.  Nothing in this section authorizes
          the Commission to enforce, or is intended to
          provide the Commission with the authority to
          approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such
          measures.  The Commission shall have no
          enforcement authority over the failure to utilize
          such measures. . . .


                                II.
                         FINDINGS OF FACT
          All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legal
questions at issue in these cases, it is necessary to have a
clear understanding of the exponentially growing, worldwide
medium that is the Internet, which presents unique issues
relating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence and
due process requirements to this new and evolving method of
communication.  For this reason all parties insisted on having
extensive evidentiary hearings before the three-judge court.     
The court's Findings of fact are made pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.
52(a).  The history and basic technology of this medium are not
in dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the following
Findings of fact are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs of
a stipulation[8] the parties filed with the court.[9]
                     The Nature of Cyberspace
  The Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace
          1.   The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity,
but rather a giant network which interconnects innumerable
smaller groups of linked computer networks.  It is thus a network
of networks.  This is best understood if one considers what a
linked group of computers -- referred to here as a "network" --
is, and what it does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are
often called "local area networks").  For example, in many United
States Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the
purpose of exchanging files and messages (and to share equipment
such as printers).  These are networks.  
          2.  Some networks are "closed" networks, not linked to
other computers or networks.  Many networks, however, are
connected to other networks, which are in turn connected to other
networks in a manner which permits each computer in any network
to communicate with computers on any other network in the system. 
This global Web of linked networks and computers is referred to
as the Internet.
          3.  The nature of the Internet is such that it is very
difficult, if not impossible, to determine its size at a given
moment.  It is indisputable, however, that the Internet has
experienced extraordinary growth in recent years.  In 1981, fewer
than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 1989, the
number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over
1,000,000 computers were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host
computers worldwide, of which approximately 60 percent located
within the United States, are estimated to be linked to the
Internet.  This count does not include the personal computers
people use to access the Internet using modems.  In all,
reasonable estimates are that as many as 40 million people around
the world can and do access the enormously flexible communication
Internet medium.  That figure is expected to grow to 200 million
Internet users by the year 1999. 
          4.  Some of the computers and computer networks that
make up the Internet are owned by governmental and public
institutions, some are owned by non-profit organizations, and
some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, global medium of communications -- or "cyberspace"
-- that links people, institutions, corporations, and governments
around the world.  The Internet is an international system.  This
communications medium allows any of the literally tens of
millions of people with access to the Internet to exchange
information.  These communications can occur almost
instantaneously, and can be directed either to specific
individuals, to a broader group of people interested in a
particular subject, or to the world as a whole.
          5.  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an
experimental project of the Advanced Research Project Agency
("ARPA"), and was called ARPANET.  This network linked computers
and computer networks owned by the military, defense contractors,
and university laboratories conducting defense-related research. 
The network later allowed researchers across the country to
access directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers
located at a few key universities and laboratories.  As it
evolved far beyond its research origins in the United States to
encompass universities, corporations, and people around the
world, the ARPANET came to be called the "DARPA Internet," and
finally just the "Internet."
          6.  From its inception, the network was designed to be
a decentralized, self-maintaining series of redundant links
between computers and computer networks, capable of rapidly
transmitting communications without direct human involvement or
control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or
otherwise unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant system
of linked computers was designed to allow vital research and
communications to continue even if portions of the network were
damaged, say, in a war.
          7.  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and
ultimately global) communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged
the creation of multiple links to and from each computer (or
computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer located in
Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated
telephone lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on
the Eastern seaboard.  Each of those computers could in turn be
linked to other computers, which themselves would be linked to
other computers.
          8.  A communication sent over this redundant series of
linked computers could travel any of a number of routes to its
destination.  Thus, a message sent from a computer in Washington,
D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might first be sent
to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a
computer in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt
Lake City, before finally reaching Palo Alto.  If the message
could not travel along that path (because of military attack,
simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message would
automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be
re-routed, perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then
to Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and
finally to Palo Alto.  This type of transmission, and re-routing,
would likely occur in a matter of seconds.
          9.   Messages between computers on the Internet do not
necessarily travel entirely along the same path.  The Internet
uses "packet switching" communication protocols that allow
individual messages to be subdivided into smaller "packets" that
are then sent independently to the destination, and are then
automatically reassembled by the receiving computer.  While all
packets of a given message often travel along the same path to
the destination, if computers along the route become overloaded,
then packets can be re-routed to less loaded computers.
          10.  At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it
subsequently ceased to exist), similar networks developed to link
universities, research facilities, businesses, and individuals
around the world.  These other formal or loose networks included
BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET.  Eventually, each of these
networks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linked
together, allowing users of any computers linked to any one of
the networks to transmit communications to users of computers on
other networks.  It is this series of linked networks (themselves
linking computers and computer networks) that is today commonly
known as the Internet.
          11.  No single entity -- academic, corporate,
governmental, or non-profit -- administers the Internet.  It
exists and functions as a result of the fact that hundreds of
thousands of separate operators of computers and computer
networks independently decided to use common data transfer
protocols to exchange communications and information with other
computers (which in turn exchange communications and information
with still other computers).  There is no centralized storage
location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single
entity to control all of the information conveyed on the
Internet.

                How Individuals Access the Internet
          12.  Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to
access cyberspace in general, and the Internet in particular.  In
terms of physical access, there are two common methods to
establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, one can use a
computer or computer terminal that is directly (and usually
permanently) connected to a computer network that is itself
directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  Second, one
can use a "personal computer" with a "modem" to connect over a
telephone line to a larger computer or computer network that is
itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  As
detailed below, both direct and modem connections are made
available to people by a wide variety of academic, governmental,
or commercial entities.
          13.  Students, faculty, researchers, and others
affiliated with the vast majority of colleges and universities in
the United States can access the Internet through their
educational institutions.  Such access is often via direct
connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices,
or computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a
modem from a student's or professor's campus or off-campus
location.  Some colleges and universities install "ports" or
outlets for direct network connections in each dormitory room or
provide access via computers located in common areas in
dormitories.  Such access enables students and professors to use
information and content provided by the college or university
itself, and to use the vast amount of research resources and
other information available on the Internet worldwide.
          14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are
sufficiently important to many corporations and other employers
that those employers link their office computer networks to the
Internet and provide employees with direct or modem access to the
office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be
used by, for example, a corporation involved in scientific or
medical research or manufacturing to enable corporate employees
to exchange information and ideas with academic researchers in
their fields.
          15.  Those who lack access to the Internet through
their schools or employers still have a variety of ways they can
access the Internet.  Many communities across the country have
established "free-nets" or community networks to provide their
citizens with a local link to the Internet (and to provide local-
oriented content and discussion groups).  The first such
community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer
System, was established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in
scores of communities as diverse as Richmond, Virginia,
Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little
or no cost via modem connection or by using computers available
in community buildings.  Free-nets are often operated by a local
library, educational institution, or non-profit community group.
          16.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
many local libraries.  Libraries often offer patrons use of
computers that are linked to the Internet.  In addition, some
libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet. 
Increasingly, patrons now use library services and resources
without ever physically entering the library itself.  Libraries
typically provide such direct or modem access at no cost to the
individual user.  
          17.  Individuals can also access the Internet by
patronizing an increasing number of storefront "computer coffee
shops," where customers -- while they drink their coffee -- can
use computers provided by the shop to access the Internet.  Such
Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee. 
          18.  Individuals can also access the Internet through
commercial and non-commercial "Internet service providers" that
typically offer modem telephone access to a computer or computer
network linked to the Internet.  Many such providers -- including
the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet Exchange Association
-- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a 
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however,
are non-profit organizations that offer free or very low cost
access to the Internet.  For example, the International Internet
Association offers free modem access to the Internet upon
request.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profit
associations offer Internet access as a service to members. 
          19.  Another common way for individuals to access the
Internet is through one of the major national commercial "online
services" such as America Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft
Network, or Prodigy.  These online services offer nationwide
computer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well
organized content within their own proprietary computer networks. 
In addition to allowing access to the extensive content available
within each online service, the services also allow subscribers
to link to the much larger resources of the Internet.  Full
access to the online service (including access to the Internet)
can be obtained for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major
commercial online services have almost twelve million individual
subscribers across the United States.
          20.  In addition to using the national commercial
online services, individuals can also access the Internet using
some (but not all) of the thousands of local dial-in computer
services, often called "bulletin board systems" or "BBSs."  With
an investment of as little as $2,000.00 and the cost of a
telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations, advocacy
groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer
"bulletin board" service where friends, members, subscribers, or
customers can exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from
single computers with only one telephone line into the computer
(allowing only one user at a time), to single computers with many
telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple simultaneous
users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users). 
Some (but not all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect
links to the Internet.  Some BBS systems charge users a nominal
fee for access, while many others are free to the individual
users. 
          21.  Although commercial access to the Internet is
growing rapidly, many users of the Internet -- such as college
students and staff -- do not individually pay for access (except
to the extent, for example, that the cost of computer services is
a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet users
can access the Internet without paying for such access with a
credit card or other form of payment.

             Methods to Communicate Over the Internet
          22.   Once one has access to the Internet, there are a
wide variety of different methods of communication and
information exchange over the network.  These many methods of
communication and information retrieval are constantly evolving
and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most
common methods of communications on the Internet (as well as
within the major online services) can be roughly grouped into six
categories: 
               (1)  one-to-one messaging (such as "e-mail"), 

               (2)  one-to-many messaging (such as "listserv"),

               (3)  distributed message databases (such as
                    "USENET newsgroups"), 

               (4)  real time communication (such as "Internet
                    Relay Chat"), 

               (5)  real time remote computer utilization (such
                    as "telnet"), and 

               (6)  remote information retrieval (such as "ftp,"
                    "gopher," and the "World Wide Web").  

Most of these methods of communication can be used to transmit
text, data, computer programs, sound, visual images (i.e.,
pictures), and moving video images.
          23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication
on the Internet is via electronic mail, or "e-mail," comparable
in principle to sending a first class letter.  One can address
and transmit a message to one or more other people.  E-mail on
the Internet is not routed through a central control point, and
can take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal
mail, simple e-mail generally is not "sealed" or secure, and can
be accessed or viewed on intermediate computers between the
sender and recipient (unless the message is encrypted).
          24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains
automatic mailing list services (such as "listservs"), [also
referred to by witnesses as "mail exploders"] that allow
communications about particular subjects of interest to a group
of people.  For example, people can subscribe to a "listserv"
mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The
subscriber can submit messages on the topic to the listserv that
are forwarded (via e-mail), either automatically or through a
human moderator overseeing the listserv, to anyone who has
subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message
can reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to
everyone on the mailing list.  This service provides the
capability to keep abreast of developments or events in a
particular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing lists
automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services
on the Internet, collectively with hundreds of thousands of
subscribers.  Users of "open" listservs typically can add or
remove their names from the mailing list automatically, with no
direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be "closed," i.e.,
only allowing for one's acceptance into the listserv by a human
moderator.
          25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in
function to listservs -- but quite different in how
communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as "USENET newsgroups."  User-sponsored newsgroups
are among the most popular and widespread applications of
Internet services, and cover all imaginable topics of interest to
users.  Like listservs, newsgroups are open discussions and
exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need not
subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can
instead access the database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroups
are "moderated" but most are open access.  For the moderated
newsgroups,[10] all messages to the newsgroup are forwarded to one
person who can screen them for relevance to the topics under
discussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc,
peer to peer connections between approximately 200,000 computers
(called USENET "servers") around the world.  For unmoderated
newsgroups, when an individual user with access to a USENET
server posts a message to a newsgroup, the message is
automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers that
furnish access to the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the
servers adjacent to those servers, etc.  The messages are
temporarily stored on each receiving server, where they are
available for review and response by individual users.  The
messages are automatically and periodically purged from each
system after a time to make room for new messages.  Responses to
messages, like the original messages, are automatically
distributed to all other computers receiving the newsgroup or
forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup. 
The dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world
is an automated process that does not require direct human
intervention or review. 
          26.  There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand
different subjects.  In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were
posted to newsgroups each day, and those messages were
distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or computer
networks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Once
the messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers
or computer networks, they are available to individual users of
those computers or computer networks.  Collectively, almost
100,000 new messages (or "articles") are posted to newsgroups
each day.
          27.  Real time communication.  In addition to
transmitting messages that can be later read or accessed,
individuals on the Internet can engage in an immediate dialog, in
"real time", with other people on the Internet.  In its simplest
forms, "talk" allows one-to-one communications and "Internet
Relay Chat" (or IRC) allows two or more to type messages to each
other that almost immediately appear on the others' computer
screens.  IRC is analogous to a telephone party line, using a
computer and keyboard rather than a telephone.  With IRC,
however, at any one time there are thousands of different party
lines available, in which collectively tens of thousands of users
are engaging in conversations on a huge range of subjects. 
Moreover, one can create a new party line to discuss a different
topic at any time.  Some IRC conversations are "moderated" or
include "channel operators."
          28.  In addition, commercial online services such as
America Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy
have their own "chat" systems allowing their members to converse.
          29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another
method to use information on the Internet is to access and
control remote computers in "real time" using "telnet."  For
example, using telnet, a researcher at a university would be able
to use the computing power of a supercomputer located at a
different university.  A student can use telnet to connect to a
remote library to access the library's online card catalog
program.  
          30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major
category of communication may be the most well known use of the
Internet -- the search for and retrieval of information located
on remote computers.  There are three primary methods to locate
and retrieve information on the Internet.  
          31.  A simple method uses "ftp" (or file transfer
protocol) to list the names of computer files available on a
remote computer, and to transfer one or more of those files to an
individual's local computer.  
          32.  Another approach uses a program and format named
"gopher" to guide an individual's search through the resources
available on a remote computer.  

                        The World Wide Web
          33.  A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-
known on the Internet, is the "World Wide Web."  The Web utilizes
a "hypertext" formatting language called hypertext markup
language (HTML), and programs that "browse" the Web can display
HTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation and
moving video.  Any HTML document can include links to other types
of information or resources, so that while viewing an HTML
document that, for example, describes resources available on the
Internet, one can "click" using a computer mouse on the
description of the resource and be immediately connected to the
resource itself.  Such "hyperlinks" allow information to be
accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow people to
locate and efficiently view related information even if the
information is stored on numerous computers all around the world.
          34.  Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created to
serve as the platform for a global, online store of knowledge,
containing information from a diversity of sources and accessible
to Internet users around the world.  Though information on the
Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each of
these computers is connected to the Internet through W3C
protocols allows all of the information to become part of a
single body of knowledge.  It is currently the most advanced
information system developed on the Internet, and embraces within
its data model most information in previous networked information
systems such as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.  
          35.  History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN,
the European Particle Physics Laboratory, and was initially used
to allow information sharing within internationally dispersed
teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed at the High
Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and
attracted much interest in user support, resource recovery, and
many other areas which depend on collaborative and information
sharing.  The Web has extended beyond the scientific and academic
community to include communications by individuals, non-profit
organizations, and businesses.
          36.  Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a series
of documents stored in different computers all over the Internet. 
Documents contain information stored in a variety of formats,
including text, still images, sounds, and video.  An essential
element of the Web is that any document has an address (rather
like a telephone number).  Most Web documents contain "links." 
These are short sections of text or image which refer to another
document.  Typically the linked text is blue or underlined when
displayed, and when selected by the user, the referenced document
is automatically displayed, wherever in the world it actually is
stored.  Links for example are used to lead from overview
documents to more detailed documents, from tables of contents to
particular pages, but also as cross-references, footnotes, and
new forms of information structure.  
          37.  Many organizations now have "home pages" on the
Web.  These are documents which provide a set of links designed
to represent the organization, and through links from the home
page, guide the user directly or indirectly to information about
or relevant to that organization.  
          38.  As an example of the use of links, if these
Findings were to be put on a World Wide Web site, its home page
might contain links such as those:  
*THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE 
*CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE
*HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET
*METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET 
          39.  Each of these links takes the user of the site
from the beginning of the Findings to the appropriate section
within this Adjudication.  Links may also take the user from the
original Web site to another Web site on another computer
connected to the Internet.  These links from one computer to
another, from one document to another across the Internet, are
what unify the Web into a single body of knowledge, and what
makes the Web unique.  The Web was designed with a maximum target
time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.
          40.  Publishing.  The World Wide Web exists
fundamentally as a platform through which people and
organizations can communicate through shared information.  When
information is made available, it is said to be "published" on
the Web.  Publishing on the Web simply requires that the
"publisher" has a computer connected to the Internet and that the
computer is running W3C server software.  The computer can be as
simple as a small personal computer costing less than $1500
dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar mainframe
computer.  Many Web publishers choose instead to lease disk
storage space from someone else who has the necessary computer
facilities, eliminating the need for actually owning any
equipment oneself.  
          41.  The Web, as a universe of network accessible
information, contains a variety of documents prepared with quite
varying degrees of care, from the hastily typed idea, to the
professionally executed corporate profile.  The power of the Web
stems from the ability of a link to point to any document,
regardless of its status or physical location.  
          42.  Information to be published on the Web must also
be formatted according to the rules of the Web standards.  These
standardized formats assure that all Web users who want to read
the material will be able to view it.  Web standards are
sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet
the publishing needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage
houses, newspapers and magazines which now publish "online"
editions of their material, as well as government agencies, and
even courts, which use the Web to disseminate information to the
public.  At the same time, Web publishing is simple enough that
thousands of individual users and small community organizations
are using the Web to publish their own personal "home pages," the
equivalent of individualized newsletters about that person or
organization, which are available to everyone on the Web.  
          43.  Web publishers have a choice to make their Web
sites open to the general pool of all Internet users, or close
them, thus making the information accessible only to those with
advance authorization.  Many publishers choose to keep their
sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to
maintain restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by
assigning specific user names and passwords as a prerequisite to
access to the site.  Or, in the case of Web sites maintained for
internal use of one organization, access will only be allowed
from other computers within that organization's local network.[11]
          44.  Searching the Web.  A variety of systems have
developed that allow users of the Web to search particular
information among all of the public sites that are part of the
Web.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler,
and Lycos are all services known as "search engines" which allow
users to search for Web sites that contain certain categories of
information, or to search for key words.  For example, a Web user
looking for the text of Supreme Court opinions would type the
words "Supreme Court" into a search engine, and then be presented
with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain Supreme Court
information.  This list would actually be a series of links to
those sites.  Having searched out a number of sites that might
contain the desired information, the user would then follow
individual links, browsing through the information on each site,
until the desired material is found.  For many content providers
on the Web, the ability to be found by these search engines is
very important.  
          45.  Common standards.  The Web links together
disparate information on an ever-growing number of Internet-
linked computers by setting common information storage formats
(HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents
(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different
formats, and stored on computers which are not otherwise
compatible, the basic Web standards provide a basic set of
standards which allow communication and exchange of information. 
Despite the fact that many types of computers are used on the
Web, and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise
incompatible, those who "publish" information on the Web are able
to communicate with those who seek to access information with
little difficulty because of these basic technical standards.  
          46.  A distributed system with no centralized control. 
Running on tens of thousands of individual computers on the
Internet, the Web is what is known as a distributed system.  The
Web was designed so that organizations with computers containing
information can become part of the Web simply by attaching their
computers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide Web
software.  No single organization controls any membership in the
Web, nor is there any single centralized point from which
individual Web sites or services can be blocked from the Web. 
From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,
integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized control
point.  
          47.  Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open,
distributed, decentralized nature stands in sharp contrast to
most information systems that have come before it.  Private
information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis, and Dialog,
have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be
accessed from the Internet with the appropriate passwords and
access software.  However, these databases are not linked
together into a single whole, as is the World Wide Web.  
          48.  Success of the Web in research, education, and
political activities.  The World Wide Web has become so popular
because of its open, distributed, and easy-to-use nature.  Rather
than requiring those who seek information to purchase new
software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
new database of information they seek to access, the Web
environment makes it easy for users to jump from one set of
information to another.  By the same token, the open nature of
the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their intended
audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer
each potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be
using.  

        Restricting Access to Unwanted On-Line Material[12]

PICS
          49.  With the rapid growth of the Internet, the
increasing popularity of the Web, and the existence of material
online that some parents may consider inappropriate for their
children, various entities have begun to build systems intended
to enable parents to control the material which comes into their
homes and may be accessible to their children.  The World Wide
Web Consortium launched the PICS ("Platform for Internet Content
Selection") program in order to develop technical standards that
would support parents' ability to filter and screen material that
their children see on the Web.  
          50.  The Consortium intends that PICS will provide the
ability for third parties, as well as individual content
providers, to rate content on the Internet in a variety of ways. 
When fully implemented, PICS-compatible World Wide Web browsers,
Usenet News Group readers, and other Internet applications, will
provide parents the ability to choose from a variety of rating
services, or a combination of services.
          51.  PICS working group [PICS-WG] participants include
many of the major online services providers, commercial internet
access providers, hardware and software companies, major internet
content providers, and consumer organizations.  Among active
participants in the PICS effort are:         

               Adobe Systems, Inc.
               Apple Computer
               America Online
               AT&T
               Center for Democracy and Technology
               CompuServe
               Delphi Internet Services
               Digital Equipment Corporation
               IBM
               First floor
               First Virtual Holdings Incorporated
               France Telecom

               NEC
               Netscape Communications Corporation
               NewView
               O'Reilly and Associates
               Open Market
               Prodigy Services Company
               Progressive Networks
               Providence Systems/Parental Guidance
               Recreational Software Advisory Council
               SafeSurf
               SoftQuad, Inc.
               Songline Studios
               Spyglass
               SurfWatch Software
               Telequip Corp.
               Time Warner Pathfinder
               Viacom Nickelodeon[13]


          52.  Membership in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-
section of companies from the computer, communications, and
content industries, as well as trade associations and public
interest groups.  PICS technical specifications have been agreed
to, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy products
and services based on the PICS-standards.
          53.  Until a majority of sites on the Internet have
been rated by a PICS rating service, PICS will initially function
as a "positive" ratings system in which only those sites that
have been rated will be displayed using PICS compatible software. 
In other words, PICS will initially function as a site inclusion
list rather than a site exclusion list.  The default
configuration for a PICS compatible Internet application will be
to block access to all sites which have not been rated by a PICS
rating service, while allowing access to sites which have a PICS
rating for appropriate content.[14]

Software
          54.  For over a year, various companies have marketed
stand alone software that is intended to enable parents and other
adults to limit the Internet access of children.  Examples of
such software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The Internet
Filter, Net Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape Proxy
Server, and WebTrack.  The market for this type of software is
growing, and there is increasing competition among software
providers to provide products.

Cyber Patrol
          55.  As more people, particularly children, began to
use the Internet, Microsystems Software, Inc. decided to develop
and market Internet software intended to empower parents to
exercise individual choice over what material their children
could access.  Microsystems' stated intent is to develop a
product which would give parents comfort that their children can
reap the benefits of the Internet while shielding them from
objectionable or otherwise inappropriate materials based on the
parents' own particular tastes and values.  Microsystems'
product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.
          56.  Cyber Patrol was first introduced in August 1995,
and is currently available in Windows and Macintosh versions. 
Cyber Patrol works with both direct Internet Access providers
(ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and Commercial Online Service
Providers (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy, Microsoft). 
Cyber Patrol is also compatible with all major World Wide Web
browsers on the market (e.g., Netscape, Navigator, Mosaic,
Prodigy's Legacy and Skimmer browsers, America Online, Netcom's
NetCruiser, etc.).  Cyber Patrol was the first parental
empowerment application to be compatible with the PICS standard. 
In February of 1996, Microsystems put the first PICS ratings
server on the Internet.  
          57.  The CyberNOT list contains approximately 7000
sites in twelve categories.  The software is designed to enable
parents to selectively block access to any or all of the twelve
CyberNOT categories simply by checking boxes in the Cyber Patrol
Headquarters (the Cyber Patrol program manager).  These
categories are:
          Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or
          emotional acts against any animal or person which are
          primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene
          words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses
          George Carlin's seven censored words more often than
          once every fifty messages or pages. 
 
          Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human
          anatomy except when exposing genitalia.
  
          Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.
  
          Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text
          exposing anyone or anything involved in explicit sexual
          acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including
          masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and
          involving nude or partially nude people in
          heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual
          encounters.  Also includes phone sex ads, dating
          services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.
  
          Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or
          descriptive text of anyone or anything which are
          crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or
          showing scatological impropriety.  Includes such
          depictions as maiming, bloody figures, indecent
          depiction of bodily functions.
  
          Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination
          against any race or ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist
          jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one race over
          another.
  
          Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil,
          wickedness.  Sects or groups that potentially coerce
          individuals to grow, and keep, membership.
  
          Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of
          illegal drugs for entertainment.  This would exclude
          current illegal drugs used for medicinal purposes
          (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes
          substances used for other than their primary purpose to
          alter the individual's state of mind such as glue
          sniffing.
  
          Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative
          behaviors, radicalism, advocacy of extreme political
          measures.  Topics include extreme political groups that
          advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.
  
          Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos,
          betting, numbers games, on-line sports or financial
          betting including non-monetary dares.
  
          Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a
          dubious nature which may be illegal in any or all
          jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain
          letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.
  
          Alcohol, Beer & Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale
          or consumption of alcoholic beverages.  Also includes
          sites and information relating to tobacco products.

  
          58.  Microsystems employs people to search the Internet
for sites containing material in these categories.  Since new
sites are constantly coming online, Microsystems updates the
CyberNOT list on a weekly basis.  Once installed on the home PC,
the copy of Cyber Patrol receives automatic updates to the
CyberNOT list over the Internet every seven days.  
          59.  In February of 1996, Microsystems signed a
licensing arrangement with CompuServe, one of the leading
commercial online services with over 4.3 million subscribers. 
CompuServe provides Cyber Patrol free of charge to its
subscribers.  Microsystems the same month signed a licensing
arrangement with Prodigy, another leading commercial online
service with over 1.4 million subscribers.  Prodigy will provide
Cyber Patrol free of charge of its subscribers.  
          60.  Cyber Patrol is also available directly from
Microsystems for $49.95, which includes a six month subscription
to the CyberNOT blocked sites list (updated automatically once
every seven days).  After six months, parents can receive six
months of additional updates for $19.95, or twelve months for
$29.95.  Cyber Patrol Home Edition, a limited version of Cyber
Patrol, is available free of charge on the Internet.  To obtain
either version, parents download a seven day demonstration
version of the full Cyber Patrol product from the Microsystems
Internet World Wide Web Server.  At the end of the seven day
trial period, users are offered the opportunity to purchase the
complete version of Cyber Patrol or provide Microsystems some
basic demographic information in exchange for unlimited use of
the Home Edition.  The demographic information is used for
marketing and research purposes.  Since January of 1996, over
10,000 demonstration copies of Cyber Patrol have been downloaded
from Microsystems' Web site.
          61.  Cyber Patrol is also available from Retail outlets
as NetBlocker Plus.  NetBlocker Plus sells for $19.95, which
includes five weeks of updates to the CyberNOT list.  
          62.  Microsystems also sells Cyber Patrol into a
growing market in schools.  As more classrooms become connected
to the Internet, many teachers want to ensure that their students
can receive the benefit of the Internet without encountering
material they deem educationally inappropriate.  
          63.  Microsystems is working with the Recreational
Software Advisory Council (RSAC), a non-profit corporation which
developed rating systems for video games, to implement the RSAC
rating system for the Internet.  
          64.  The next release of Cyber Patrol, expected in
second quarter of this year, will give parents the ability to use
any PICS rating service, including the RSAC rating service, in
addition to the Microsystems CyberNOT list.  
          65.  In order to speed the implementation of PICS and
encourage the development of PICS-compatible Internet
applications, Microsystems maintains a server on the Internet
which contains its CyberNOT list.  The server provides software
developers with access to a PICS rating service, and allows
software developers to test their products' ability to interpret
standard PICS labels.  Microsystems is also offering its PICS
client test program for Windows free of charge.  The client
program can be used by developers of PICS rating services to test
their services and products.  

SurfWatch
          66.  Another software product, SurfWatch, is also
designed to allow parents and other concerned users to filter
unwanted material on the Internet.  SurfWatch is available for
both Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and Microsoft Windows 95
Operating Systems, and works with direct Internet Access
Providers (e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet, AT&T, and more than 1000
other Internet Service Providers).  
          67.  The suggested retail price of SurfWatch Software
is $49.95, with a street price of between $20.00 and $25.00.  The
product is also available as part of CompuServe/Spry Inc.'s
Internet in a Box for Kids, which includes access to Spry's Kids
only Internet service and a copy of SurfWatch.  Internet in a Box
for Kids retails for approximately $30.00.  The subscription
service, which updates the SurfWatch blocked site list
automatically with new sites each month, is available for $5.95
per month or $60.00 per year.  The subscription is included as
part of the Internet in a Box for Kids program, and is also
provided as a low-cost option from Internet Service Providers.  
          68.  SurfWatch is available at over 12,000 retail
locations, including National stores such as Comp USA, Egghead
Software, Computer City, and several national mail order outlets. 
SurfWatch can also be ordered directly from its own site on the
World Wide Web, and through the Internet Shopping Network.
          69.  Plaintiffs America Online (AOL), Microsoft
Network, and Prodigy all offer parental control options free of
charge to their members.  AOL has established an online area
designed specifically for children.  The "Kids Only" parental
control feature allows parents to establish an AOL account for
their children that accesses only the Kids Only channel on
America Online.[15]     
          70.  AOL plans to incorporate PICS-compatible
capability into its standard Web browser software, and to make
available to subscribers other PICS-compatible Web browsers, such
as the Netscape software.  
          71. Plaintiffs CompuServe and Prodigy give their
subscribers the option of blocking all access to the Internet, or
to particular media within their proprietary online content, such
as bulletin boards and chat rooms. 
          72. Although parental control software currently can
screen for certain suggestive words or for known sexually
explicit sites, it cannot now screen for sexually explicit images
unaccompanied by suggestive text unless those who configure the
software are aware of the particular site.    
          73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-
based software suggests that a reasonably effective method by
which parents can prevent their children from accessing sexually
explicit and other material which parents may believe is
inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.

                      Content on the Internet
          74.  The types of content now on the Internet defy easy
classification.  The entire card catalogue of the Carnegie
Library is on-line, together with journals, journal abstracts,
popular magazines, and titles of compact discs.  The director of
the Carnegie Library, Robert Croneberger, testified that on-line
services are the emerging trend in libraries generally. 
Plaintiff Hotwired Ventures LLC organizes its Web site into
information regarding travel, news and commentary, arts and
entertainment, politics, and types of drinks.  Plaintiff America
Online, Inc., not only creates chat rooms for a broad variety of
topics, but also allows members to create their own chat rooms to
suit their own tastes.  The ACLU uses an America Online chat room
as an unmoderated forum for people to debate civil liberties
issues.  Plaintiffs' expert, Scott Bradner,[16] estimated that
15,000 newsgroups exist today, and he described his own interest
in a newsgroup devoted solely to Formula 1 racing cars.  America
Online makes 15,000 bulletin boards available to its subscribers,
who post between 200,000 and 250,000 messages each day.  Another
plaintiffs' expert, Harold Rheingold, participates in "virtual
communities" that simulate social interaction.  It is no
exaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet is as
diverse as human thought.  
          75.  The Internet is not exclusively, or even
primarily, a means of commercial communication.  Many commercial
entities maintain Web sites to inform potential consumers about
their goods and services, or to solicit purchases, but many other
Web sites exist solely for the dissemination of non-commercial
information.  The other forms of Internet communication -- e-
mail, bulletin boards, newsgroups, and chat rooms -- frequently
have non-commercial goals.  For the economic and technical
reasons set forth in the following paragraphs, the Internet is an
especially attractive means for not-for-profit entities or public
interest groups to reach their desired audiences.  There are
examples in the parties' stipulation of some of the non-
commercial uses that the Internet serves.  Plaintiff Human Rights
Watch, Inc., offers information on its Internet site regarding
reported human rights abuses around the world.  Plaintiff
National Writers Union provides a forum for writers on issues of
concern to them.  Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., posts text,
graphics, and statistics regarding the incidence and prevention
of rape in prisons.  Plaintiff Critical Path AIDS Project, Inc.,
offers information on safer sex, the transmission of HIV, and the
treatment of AIDS.  
          76.  Such diversity of content on the Internet is
possible because the Internet provides an easy and inexpensive
way for a speaker to reach a large audience, potentially of
millions.  The start-up and operating costs entailed by
communication on the Internet are significantly lower than those
associated with use of other forms of mass communication, such as
television, radio, newspapers, and magazines.  This enables
operation of their own Web sites not only by large companies,
such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-
profit groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDS
Project.  The Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,[17] agreed
that creation of a Web site would cost between $1,000 and
$15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on one's goals
and the Web site's traffic.  Commercial online services such as
America Online allow subscribers to create Web pages free of
charge.  Any Internet user can communicate by posting a message
to one of the thousands of newsgroups and bulletin boards or by
engaging in an on-line "chat", and thereby reach an audience
worldwide that shares an interest in a particular topic. 
          77.  The ease of communication through the Internet is
facilitated by the use of hypertext markup language (HTML), which
allows for the creation of "hyperlinks" or "links".  HTML enables
a user to jump from one source to other related sources by
clicking on the link.  A link might take the user from Web site
to Web site, or to other files within a particular Web site. 
Similarly, by typing a request into a search engine, a user can
retrieve many different sources of content related to the search
that the creators of the engine have collected.  
          78.  Because of the technology underlying the Internet,
the statutory term "content provider,"[18] which is equivalent to
the traditional "speaker," may actually be a hybrid of speakers. 
Through the use of HTML, for example, Critical Path and Stop
Prisoner Rape link their Web sites to several related databases,
and a user can immediately jump from the home pages of these
organizations to the related databases simply by clicking on a
link.  America Online creates chat rooms for particular
discussions but also allows subscribers to create their own chat
rooms.  Similarly, a newsgroup gathers postings on a particular
topic and distributes them to the newsgroup's subscribers.  Users
of the Carnegie Library can read on-line versions of Vanity Fair
and Playboy, and America Online's subscribers can peruse the New
York Times, Boating, and other periodicals.  Critical Path, Stop
Prisoner Rape, America Online and the Carnegie Library all make
available content of other speakers over whom they have little or
no editorial control. 
          79.  Because of the different forms of Internet
communication, a user of the Internet may speak or listen
interchangeably, blurring the distinction between "speakers" and
"listeners" on the Internet.  Chat rooms, e-mail, and newsgroups
are interactive forms of communication, providing the user with
the opportunity both to speak and to listen.  
          80.  It follows that unlike traditional media, the
barriers to entry as a speaker on the Internet do not differ
significantly from the barriers to entry as a listener.  Once one
has entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue that
occurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can and
does become the content provider, and vice-versa.
          81.  The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new
medium of worldwide human communication.
            Sexually Explicit Material On the Internet
          82.  The parties agree that sexually explicit material
exists on the Internet.  Such material includes text, pictures,
and chat, and includes bulletin boards, newsgroups, and the other
forms of Internet communication, and extends from the modestly
titillating to the hardest-core.  
          83.  There is no evidence that sexually-oriented
material is the primary type of content on this new medium. 
Purveyors of such material take advantage of the same ease of
access available to all users of the Internet, including
establishment of a Web site. 
          84.  Sexually explicit material is created, named, and
posted in the same manner as material that is not sexually
explicit.  It is possible that a search engine can accidentally
retrieve material of a sexual nature through an imprecise search,
as demonstrated at the hearing.  Imprecise searches may also
retrieve irrelevant material that is not of a sexual nature.  The
accidental retrieval of sexually explicit material is one
manifestation of the larger phenomenon of irrelevant search
results. 
          85.  Once a provider posts content on the Internet, it
is available to all other Internet users worldwide.  Similarly,
once a user posts a message to a newsgroup or bulletin board,
that message becomes available to all subscribers to that
newsgroup or bulletin board.  For example, when the
UCR/California Museum of Photography posts to its Web site nudes
by Edward Weston and Robert Mapplethorpe to announce that its new
exhibit will travel to Baltimore and New York City, those images
are available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, and New York
City, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or Beijing -- wherever
Internet users live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions that
Critical Path posts to its Web site, written in street language
so that the teenage receiver can understand them, are available
not just in Philadelphia, but also in Provo and Prague.  A chat
room organized by the ACLU to discuss the United States Supreme
Court's  decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation would transmit
George Carlin's seven dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messages
posted to a newsgroup dedicated to the Oklahoma City bombing
travel to all subscribers to that newsgroup.  
          86.  Once a provider posts its content on the Internet,
it cannot prevent that content from entering any community. 
Unlike the newspaper, broadcast station, or cable system,
Internet technology necessarily gives a speaker a potential
worldwide audience.  Because the Internet is a network of
networks (as described above in Findings 1 through 4), any
network connected to the Internet has the capacity to send and
receive information to any other network.  Hotwired Ventures, for
example, cannot prevent its materials on mixology from entering
communities that have no interest in that topic.  
          87.  Demonstrations at the preliminary injunction
hearings showed that it takes several steps to enter cyberspace. 
At the most fundamental level, a user must have access to a
computer with the ability to reach the Internet (typically by way
of a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connect
with the access provider, enter a password, and enter the
appropriate commands to find particular data.  On the World Wide
Web, a user must normally use a search engine or enter an
appropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups, bulletin
boards, and chat rooms requires several steps.
          88.  Communications over the Internet do not "invade"
an individual's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden. 
Users seldom encounter content "by accident."   A document's
title or a description of the document will usually appear before
the document itself takes the step needed to view it, and in many
cases the user will receive detailed information about a site's
content before he or she need take the step to access the
document.  Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by
warnings as to the content.  Even the Government's witness, Agent
Howard Schmidt, Director of the Air Force Office of Special
Investigation, testified that the "odds are slim" that a user
would come across a sexually explicit site by accident.  
          89.  Evidence adduced at the hearing showed significant 
differences between Internet communications and communications
received by radio or television.  Although content on the
Internet is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the user,  the
receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of
affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely
turning a dial.  A child requires some sophistication and some
ability to read to retrieve material and thereby to use the
Internet unattended.  

           Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet

          90.  There is no effective way to determine the
identity or the age of a user who is accessing material through
e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or chat rooms.  An e-mail
address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-mail "alias" or an anonymous
remailer.  There is also no universal or reliable listing of e-
mail addresses and corresponding names or telephone numbers, and
any such listing would be or rapidly become incomplete.  For
these reasons, there is no reliable way in many instances for a
sender to know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor. 
The difficulty of e-mail age verification is compounded for mail
exploders such as listservs, which automatically send information
to all e-mail addresses on a sender's list.  Government expert
Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology could give a speaker
assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail
exploder's mailing list.  
          91.  Because of similar technological difficulties,
individuals posting a message to a newsgroup or engaging in chat
room discussions cannot ensure that all readers are adults, and
Dr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are moderated, the
moderator's control is limited to what is posted and the
moderator cannot control who receives the messages.              
          92.  The Government offered no evidence that there is a
reliable way to ensure that recipients and participants in such
fora can be screened for age.  The Government presented no
evidence demonstrating the feasibility of its suggestion that
chat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain material
deemed indecent could be effectively segregated to "adult" or
"moderated" areas of cyberspace.  
          93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to block
minors' access to newsgroups and similar fora, there is no method
by which the creators of newsgroups which contain discussions of
art, politics or any other subject that could potentially elicit
"indecent" contributions could limit the blocking of access by
minors to such "indecent" material and still allow them access to
the remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of that
content was not indecent.
          94.  Likewise, participants in MUDs (Multi-User
Dungeons) and  MUSEs (Multi-User Simulation Environments) do not
know whether the other participants are adults or minors. 
Although MUDs and MUSEs require a password for permanent
participants, they need not give their real name nor verify their
age, and there is no current technology to enable the
administrator of these fantasy worlds to know if the participant
is an adult or a minor.  
          95.  Unlike other forms of communication on the
Internet, there is technology by which an operator of a World
Wide Web server may interrogate a user of a Web site.  An HTML
document can include a fill-in-the-blank "form" to request
information from a visitor to a Web site, and this information
can be transmitted back to the Web server and be processed by a
computer program, usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi)
script.  The Web server could then grant or deny access to the
information sought.  The cgi script is the means by which a Web
site can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors by
requesting a credit card number or adult password.
          96.  Content providers who publish on the World Wide
Web via one of the large commercial online services, such as
America Online or CompuServe, could not use an online age
verification system that requires cgi script because the server
software of these online services available to subscribers cannot
process cgi scripts.  There is no method currently available for
Web page publishers who lack access to cgi scripts to screen
recipients online for age.

           The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses
          Note:  The Government contends the CDA makes available
three potential defenses to all content providers on the
Internet:  credit card verification, adult verification by
password or adult identification number, and "tagging".

                     Credit Card Verification 
          97.  Verification[19] of a credit card number over the
Internet is not now technically possible.  Witnesses testified
that neither Visa nor Mastercard considers the Internet to be
sufficiently secure under the current technology to process
transactions in that manner.  Although users can and do purchase
products over the Internet by transmitting their credit card
number, the seller must then process the transaction with Visa or
Mastercard off-line using phone lines in the traditional way. 
There was testimony by several witnesses that Visa and Mastercard
are in the process of developing means of credit card
verification over the Internet.  
          98.  Verification by credit card, if and when
operational, will remain economically and practically unavailable
for many of the non-commercial plaintiffs in these actions.  The
Government's expert "suspect[ed]" that verification agencies
would decline to process a card unless it accompanied a
commercial transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.  
          99.  There was evidence that the fee charged by
verification agencies to process a card, whether for a purchase
or not, will preclude use of the credit-card verification defense
by many non-profit, non-commercial Web sites, and there was no
evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia Nell
Warren, an author whose free Web site allows users to purchase
gay and lesbian literature, testified that she must pay $1 per
verification to a verification agency.  Her Web site can absorb
this cost because it arises in connection with the sale of books
available there.  
          100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate for
age, and requiring use of a credit card to enter a site, would
impose a significant economic cost on non-commercial entities. 
Critical Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily from
February 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical Path must pay a
fee every time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide
free access to its non-commercial site, it would incur a monthly
cost far beyond its modest resources.  The ACLU's Barry
Steinhardt testified that maintenance of a credit card
verification system for all visitors to the ACLU's Web site would
require it to shut down its Web site because the projected cost
would exceed its budget. 
          101. Credit card verification would significantly delay
the retrieval of information on the Internet.  Dr. Olsen, the
expert testifying for the Government, agreed that even "a minute
is [an] absolutely unreasonable [delay] . . . [P]eople will not
put up with a minute."  Plaintiffs' expert Donna Hoffman
similarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the "flow" on
the Internet and stifles both "hedonistic" and "goal-directed"
browsing. 
          102.  Imposition of a credit card requirement would
completely bar adults who do not have a credit card and lack the
resources to obtain one from accessing any blocked material.  At
this time, credit card verification is effectively unavailable to
a substantial number of Internet content providers as a potential
defense to the CDA.

                  Adult Verification by Password 
          103.  The Government offered very limited evidence
regarding the operation of existing age verification systems, and
the evidence offered was not based on personal knowledge. 
AdultCheck and Verify, existing systems which appear to be used
for accessing commercial pornographic sites, charge users for
their services.  Dr. Olsen admitted that his knowledge of these
services was derived primarily from reading the advertisements on
their Web pages.  He had not interviewed any employees of these
entities, had not personally used these systems, had no idea how
many people are registered with them, and could not testify to
the reliability of their attempt at age verification.  
          104.  At least some, if not almost all, non-commercial
organizations, such as the ACLU, Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical
Path AIDS Project, regard charging listeners to access their
speech as contrary to their goals of making their materials
available to a wide audience free of charge.  
          105.  It would not be feasible for many non-commercial
organizations to design their own adult access code screening
systems because the administrative burden of creating and
maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs involved is
beyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would be
prohibitive even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, the
online version of Wired magazine.  
          106.  There is evidence suggesting that adult users,
particularly casual Web browsers, would be discouraged from
retrieving information that required use of a credit card or
password.  Andrew Anker testified that HotWired has received many
complaints from its members about HotWired's registration system,
which requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail address
and self-created password.  There is concern by commercial
content providers that age verification requirements would
decrease advertising and revenue because advertisers depend on a
demonstration that the sites are widely available and frequently
visited.  
          107.  Even if credit card verification or adult
password verification were implemented, the Government presented
no testimony as to how such systems could ensure that the user of
the password or credit card is in fact over 18.  The burdens
imposed by credit card verification and adult password
verification systems make them effectively unavailable to a
substantial number of Internet content providers.
                The Government's "Tagging" Proposal
          108. The feasibility and effectiveness of "tagging" to
restrict children from accessing "indecent" speech, as proposed
by the Government has not been established.  "Tagging" would
require content providers to label all of their "indecent" or
"patently offensive" material by imbedding a string of
characters, such as "XXX," in either the URL or HTML.  If a user
could install software on his or her computer to recognize the
"XXX" tag, the user could screen out any content with that tag. 
Dr. Olsen proposed a "-L18" tag, an idea he developed for this
hearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony that
certain tagging would not be feasible.
          109. The parties appear to agree that it is
technologically feasible -- "trivial", in the words of
plaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML, and the
technology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS proposal
and the Government's "-L18" proposal.
          110. The Government's tagging proposal would require
all content providers that post arguably "indecent" material to
review all of their online content, a task that would be
extremely burdensome for organizations that provide large amounts
of material online which cannot afford to pay a large staff to
review all of that material.  The Carnegie Library would be
required to hire numerous additional employees to review its on-
line files at an extremely high cost to its limited budget.  The
cost and effort would be substantial for the Library and
frequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiya
testified that it would be impossible for his organization,
Critical Path, to review all of its material because it has only
one full and one part-time employee.  
          111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be done
simply by using software which screens for certain words, as Dr.
Olsen acknowledged, and we find that determinations as to what is
indecent require human judgment.  
          112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, a
content provider could tag its entire site but this would prevent
minors from accessing much material that is not "indecent" under
the CDA.  
          113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18
proposal would require a worldwide consensus among speakers to
use the same tag to label "indecent" material.  There is
currently no such consensus, and no Internet speaker currently
labels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other widely-
recognized label.
          114. Tagging also assumes the existence of software
that recognizes the tags and takes appropriate action when it
notes tagged speech.  Neither commercial Web browsers nor user-
based screening software is currently configured to block a -L18
code.  Until such software exists, all speech on the Internet
will continue to travel to whomever requests it, without
hindrance.  Labelling speech has no effect in itself on the
transmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither plaintiffs nor the
Government suggest that tagging alone would shield minors from
speech or insulate a speaker from criminal liability under the
CDA. It follows that all speech on any topic that is available to
adults will also be available to children using the Internet
(unless it is blocked by screening software running on the
computer the child is using).  
          115. There is no way that a speaker can use current
technology to know if a listener is using screening software.  
          116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivate
themselves depending on the age or location of the receiver. 
Critical Path, which posts on-line safer sex instructions, would
be unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in communities
where it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical Path, for
example, must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speech
in all communities) or not to tag, blocking its speech in none. 
     

           The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching

          117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, of
content on the Internet originates outside the United States.  At
the hearing, a witness demonstrated how an Internet user could
access a Web site of London (which presumably is on a server in
England), and then link to other sites of interest in England.  A
user can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming from
overseas, since InterNIC allows a content provider to imbed a
country code in a domain name.[20]  Foreign content is otherwise
indistinguishable from domestic content (as long as it is in
English), since foreign speech is created, named, and posted in
the same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement that
foreign speech contain a country code in its URL.  It is
undisputed that some foreign speech that travels over the
Internet is sexually explicit.
          118. The use of "caching" makes it difficult to
determine whether the material originated from foreign or
domestic sources.  Because of the high cost of using the trans-
Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables, and because the high demand on
those cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often
"cached", or temporarily stored, on servers in the United States. 
Material from a foreign source in Europe can travel over the
trans-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the United States, and
pass through a domestic caching server which then stores a copy
for subsequent retrieval.  This domestic caching server, rather
than the original foreign server, will send the material from the
cache to the subsequent receivers, without placing a demand on
the trans-oceanic cables.  This shortcut effectively eliminates
most of the distance for both the request and the information
and, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards the
stored information according to its configuration (e.g., after a
certain time or as the demand for the information diminishes). 
Caching therefore advances core Internet values:  the cheap and
speedy retrieval of information.
          119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon. 
Domestic content providers store popular domestic material on
their caching servers to avoid the delay of successive searches
for the same material and to decrease the demand on their
Internet connection.  America Online can cache the home page of
the New York Times on its servers when a subscriber first
requests it, so that subsequent subscribers who make the same
request will receive the same home page, but from America
Online's caching service rather than from the New York Times's
server.[21]  
          120. Put simply, to follow the example in the prior
paragraph, America Online has no control over the content that
the New York Times posts to its Web site, and the New York Times
has no control over America Online's distribution of that content
from a caching server.

                             Anonymity
          121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seek
to access sensitive information, such as users of the Critical
Path AIDS Project's Web site, the users, particularly gay youth,
of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop Prisoner Rape
(SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.  

                 Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA
          122. Many speakers who display arguably indecent
content on the Internet must choose between silence and the risk
of prosecution.  The CDA's defenses -- credit card verification,
adult access codes, and adult personal identification numbers --
are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit
entities.
          123.  The plaintiffs in this action are businesses,
libraries, non-commercial and not-for-profit organizations, and
educational societies and consortia.  Although some of the
material that plaintiffs post online -- such as information
regarding protection from AIDS, birth control or prison rape --
is sexually explicit and may be considered "indecent" or
"patently offensive" in some communities, none of the plaintiffs
is a commercial purveyor of what is commonly termed
"pornography."  
                               III.
                        CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
          Plaintiffs have established a reasonable probability of
eventual success in the litigation by demonstrating that 
223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on
their face to the extent that they reach indecency.  Sections
223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on their
face.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no
party has any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional
law, and therefore the public interest will be served by granting
the preliminary injunction.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74
(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied,
493 U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  The motions for preliminary injunction will
therefore be granted.
          The views of the members of the Court in support of
these conclusions follow.


SLOVITER, Chief Judge, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:

                                A.
                       Statutory Provisions

          As noted in Part I, Introduction, the plaintiffs'
motion for a preliminary injunction is confined to portions of
two provisions of the Communications Decency Act of 1996, 
223(a) and  223(d), which they contend violate their First
Amendment free speech and Fifth Amendment due process rights.  To
facilitate reference, I set forth those provisions in full. 
Section 223(a), the "indecency" provision, subjects to criminal
penalties of imprisonment of no more than two years or a fine or
both anyone who:
          1) in interstate or foreign communications . . . 
          (B) by means of a telecommunications device 
              knowingly --              

               (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and

               (ii) initiates the transmission of, 
               any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image,
               or other communication which is obscene or
               indecent, knowing that the recipient of the
               communication is under 18 years of age, regardless
               of whether the maker of such communication placed
               the call or initiated the communication; . . . 

          (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility
          under his control to be used for any activity
          prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
          used for such activity.

(emphasis added).
          The term "telecommunications device" is specifically
defined not to include "the use of an interactive computer
service," as that is covered by section 223(d)(1).
          Section 223(d), the "patently offensive" provision,
subjects to criminal penalties anyone who:
          (1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--

          (A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a
          specific person or persons under 18 years of age, or
          
          (B) uses any interactive computer service to display in
          a manner available to a person under 18 years of age, 
          any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or
          other communication that, in context, depicts or
          describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
          contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
          activities or organs, regardless of whether the use of
          such service placed the call or initiated the
          communication; or 

          (2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility
          under such person's control to be used for an activity
          prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
          used for such activity.


(emphasis added).
          Two aspects of these provisions stand out.  First, we
are dealing with criminal provisions, subjecting violators to
substantial penalties.  Second, the provisions on indecent and
patently offensive communications are not parallel.
          The government uses the term "indecent" interchangeably
with "patently offensive" and advises that it so construes the
statute in light of the legislative history and the Supreme
Court's analysis of the word "indecent" in FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  However,  the CDA does not
define "indecent."  Notwithstanding Congress' familiarity with
Pacifica, it enacted  223(a), covering "indecent"
communications, without any language confining "indecent" to
descriptions or depictions of "sexual or excretory activities or
organs," language it included in the reference to "patently
offensive" in  223(d)(1)(B).  Nor does  223(a) contain the
phrase "in context," which the government believes is relevant.  
          The failure to define "indecent" in  223(a) is thus
arguably a negative pregnant and subject to "the rule of
construction that an express statutory requirement here,
contrasted with statutory silence there, shows an intent to
confine the requirement to the specified instance."  Field v.
Mans, 116 S.Ct. 437, 442 (1995).  See also Gozlon-Peretz v.
United States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) ("'[W]here Congress
includes particular language in one section of a statute but
omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally
presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the
disparate inclusion or exclusion'") (quoting Russello v. United
States, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)).  
          Plaintiffs note the difference but do not press this as
a basis for distinguishing between the two sections in their
preliminary injunction arguments and therefore I will also use
the words interchangeably for this purpose, leaving open the
issue for consideration at the final judgment stage if it becomes
relevant.
                                B.
                   Preliminary Injunction Standard
          To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must
establish that they are likely to prevail on the merits and that
they will suffer irreparable harm if injunctive relief is not
granted.  We also must consider whether the potential harm to the
defendant from issuance of a temporary restraining order
outweighs possible harm to the plaintiffs if such relief is
denied, and whether the granting of injunctive relief is in the
public interest.  See Campbell Soup Co. v. ConAgra, Inc., 977
F.2d 86, 90-91 (3d Cir. 1992); Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd. of
Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir. 1990).
          In a case in which the injury alleged is a threat to
First Amendment interests, the finding of irreparable injury is
often tied to the likelihood of success on the merits.  In Elrod
v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme Court emphasized that
"the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods
of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury."  Id. at
373 (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713
(1971)).
          Subjecting speakers to criminal penalties for speech
that is constitutionally protected in itself raises the spectre
of irreparable harm.  Even if a court were unwilling to draw that
conclusion from the language of the statute itself, plaintiffs
have introduced ample evidence that the challenged provisions, if
not enjoined, will have a chilling effect on their free
expression.  Thus, this is not a case in which we are dealing
with a mere incidental inhibition on speech, see Hohe v. Casey,
868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989), but
with a regulation that directly penalizes speech.
          Nor could there be any dispute about the public
interest factor which must be taken into account before a court
grants a preliminary injunction.  No long string of citations is
necessary to find that the public interest weighs in favor of
having access to a free flow of constitutionally protected
speech.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114
S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia
Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S. 748, 763-65 (1976).  
          Thus, if plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success
on the merits, they will have shown the irreparable injury needed
to entitle them to a preliminary injunction.

                                C.
                   Applicable Standard of Review
          The CDA is patently a government-imposed content-based
restriction on speech, and the speech at issue, whether
denominated "indecent" or "patently offensive," is entitled to
constitutional protection.  See Sable Communications of
California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  As such, the
regulation is subject to strict scrutiny, and will only be upheld
if it is justified by a compelling government interest and if it
is narrowly tailored to effectuate that interest.  Sable, 492
U.S. at 126; see also Turner Broadcasting, 114 S. Ct. at 2459
(1994).  "[T]he benefit gained [by a content-based restriction]
must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights." 
Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 363.
          The government's position on the applicable standard
has been less than pellucid but, despite some references to a
somewhat lesser burden employed in broadcasting cases, it now
appears to have conceded that it has the burden of proof to show
both a compelling interest and that the statute regulates least
restrictively.  Tr. of Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 121 (May
10, 1996).  In any event, the evidence and our Findings of Fact
based thereon show that Internet communication, while unique, is
more akin to telephone communication, at issue in Sable, than to
broadcasting, at issue in Pacifica, because, as with the
telephone, an Internet user must act affirmatively and
deliberately to retrieve specific information online.  Even if a
broad search will, on occasion, retrieve unwanted materials, the
user virtually always receives some warning of its content,
significantly reducing the element of surprise or "assault"
involved in broadcasting.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that
a very young child will be randomly "surfing" the Web and come
across "indecent" or "patently offensive" material.  
          Judge Dalzell's separate opinion fully explores the
reasons for the differential treatment of radio and television
broadcasting for First Amendment purposes from that accorded
other means of communication.  It follows that to the extent the
Court employed a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in
Pacifica and other broadcasting cases, see, e.g., Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), there is no reason
to employ a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in this
case.
                                D.
              The Nature of the Government's Interest
          The government asserts that shielding minors from
access to indecent materials is the compelling interest
supporting the CDA.  It cites in support the statements of the
Supreme Court that "[i]t is evident beyond the need for
elaboration that a State's interest in `safeguarding the physical
and psychological well-being of a minor' is `compelling,'"  New
York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982)(quoting Globe Newspaper
Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S. 596, 607 (1982)), and "there is a
compelling interest in protecting the physical and psychological
well-being of minors.  This interest extends to shielding minors
from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult
standards."  Sable, 492 U.S at 126.  It also cites the similar
quotation appearing in Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania
Public Utility Comm'n, 896 F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990). 
          Those statements were made in cases where the potential
harm to children from the material was evident.  Ferber involved
the constitutionality of a statute which prohibited persons from
knowingly promoting sexual performances by children under 16 and
distributing material depicting such performances.  Sable and
Fabulous involved the FCC's ban on "dial-a-porn" (dealing by
definition with pornographic telephone messages).  In contrast to
the material at issue in those cases, at least some of the
material subject to coverage under the "indecent" and "patently
offensive" provisions of the CDA may contain valuable literary,
artistic or educational information of value to older minors as
well as adults.  The Supreme Court has held that "minors are
entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection,
and only in relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may
government bar public dissemination of protected materials to
them."  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213
(1975)(citations omitted).  
          In Erznoznik, the Court rejected an argument that an
ordinance prohibiting the display of films containing nudity at
drive-in movie theatres served a compelling interest in
protecting minor passersby from the influence of such films.  The
Court held that the prohibition was unduly broad, and explained
that "[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject
to some other legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely
to protect the young from ideas or images that a legislative body
thinks unsuitable for them."  422 U.S. at 213-14.  As Justice
Scalia noted in Sable, "[t]he more pornographic what is embraced
within the . . .  category of `indecency,' the more reasonable it
becomes to insist upon greater assurance of insulation from
minors."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).  It
follows that where non-pornographic, albeit sexually explicit,
material also falls within the sweep of the statute, the interest
will not be as compelling.  
          In part, our consideration of the government's showing
of a "compelling interest" trenches upon the vagueness issue,
discussed in detail in Judge Buckwalter's opinion but equally
pertinent to First Amendment analysis.  Material routinely
acceptable according to the standards of New York City, such as
the Broadway play Angels in America which concerns homosexuality
and AIDS portrayed in graphic language, may be far less
acceptable in smaller, less cosmopolitan communities of the
United States.  Yet the play garnered two Tony Awards and a
Pulitzer prize for its author, and some uninhibited parents and
teachers might deem it to be material to be read or assigned to
eleventh and twelfth graders.  If available on the Internet
through some libraries, the text of the play would likely be
accessed in that manner by at least some students, and it would
also arguably fall within the scope of the CDA.
          There has been recent public interest in the female
genital mutilation routinely practiced and officially condoned in
some countries.  News articles have been descriptive, and it is
not stretching to assume that this is a subject that occupies
news groups and chat rooms on the Internet.  We have no assurance
that these discussions, of obvious interest and relevance to
older teenage girls, will not be viewed as patently offensive -
even in context - in some communities.
          Other illustrations abound of non-obscene material
likely to be available on the Internet but subject to the CDA's
criminal provisions.  Photographs appearing in National
Geographic or a travel magazine of the sculptures in India of
couples copulating in numerous positions, a written description
of a brutal prison rape, or Francesco Clemente's painting
"Labirinth," see Def. Exh. 125, all might be considered to
"depict or describe, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities
or organs."  47 U.S.C.  223(d)(1).  But the government has made
no showing that it has a compelling interest in preventing a
seventeen-year-old minor from accessing such images.  
          By contrast, plaintiffs presented testimony that
material that could be considered indecent, such as that offered
by Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS project, may be
critically important for certain older minors.  For example,
there was testimony that one quarter of all new HIV infections in
the United States is estimated to occur in young people between
the ages of 13 and 20, an estimate the government made no effort
to rebut.  The witnesses believed that graphic material that
their organizations post on the Internet could help save lives,
but were concerned about the CDA's effect on their right to do
so.
          The government counters that this court should defer to
legislative conclusions about this matter.  However, where First
Amendment rights are at stake, "[d]eference to a legislative
finding cannot limit judicial inquiry." Sable, 492 U.S. at 129
(quoting Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435 U.S. 829,
843 (1978)).  "[W]hatever deference is due legislative findings
would not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing
on an issue of constitutional law."  Id. 
          Moreover, it appears that the legislative "findings"
the government cites concern primarily testimony and statements
by legislators about the prevalence of obscenity, child
pornography, and sexual solicitation of children on the Internet. 
Similarly, at the hearings before us the government introduced
exhibits of sexually explicit material through the testimony of
Agent Howard Schmidt, which consisted primarily of the same type
of hard-core pornographic materials (even if not technically
obscene) which concerned Congress and which fill the shelves of
"adult" book and magazine stores.  Plaintiffs emphasize that they
do not challenge the Act's restrictions on speech not protected
by the First Amendment, such as obscenity, child pornography or
harassment of children.  Their suit is based on their assertion,
fully supported by their evidence and our findings, that the CDA
reaches much farther.
          I am far less confident than the government that its
quotations from earlier cases in the Supreme Court signify that
it has shown a compelling interest in regulating the vast range
of online material covered or potentially covered by the CDA. 
Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there is certainly a compelling
government interest to shield a substantial number of minors from
some of the online material that motivated Congress to enact the
CDA, and do not rest my decision on the inadequacy of the
government's showing in this regard.

                                E.
                     The Reach of the Statute
          Whatever the strength of the interest the government
has demonstrated in preventing minors from accessing "indecent"
and "patently offensive" material online, if the means it has
chosen sweeps more broadly than necessary and thereby chills the
expression of adults, it has overstepped onto rights protected by
the First Amendment.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.  
          The plaintiffs argue that the CDA violates the First
Amendment because it effectively bans a substantial category of
protected speech from most parts of the Internet.  The 
government responds that the Act does not on its face or in
effect ban indecent material that is constitutionally protected
for adults.  Thus one of the factual issues before us was the
likely effect of the CDA on the free availability of
constitutionally protected material.  A wealth of persuasive
evidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of Fact, proved
that it is either technologically impossible or economically
prohibitive for many of the plaintiffs to comply with the CDA
without seriously impeding their posting of online material which
adults have a constitutional right to access.
          With the possible exception of an e-mail to a known
recipient, most content providers cannot determine the identity
and age of every user accessing their material.  Considering
separately content providers that fall roughly into two
categories, we have found that no technology exists which allows
those posting on the category of newsgroups, mail exploders or
chat rooms to screen for age.  Speakers using those forms of
communication cannot control who receives the communication, and
in most instances are not aware of the identity of the
recipients.  If it is not feasible for speakers who communicate
via these forms of communication to conduct age screening, they
would have to reduce the level of communication to that which is
appropriate for children in order to be protected under the
statute.   This would effect a complete ban even for adults of
some expression, albeit "indecent," to which they are
constitutionally entitled, and thus would be unconstitutional
under the holding in Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.
          Even as to content providers in the other broad
category, such as the World Wide Web, where efforts at age
verification are technically feasible through the use of Common
Gateway Interface (cgi) scripts (which enable creation of a
document that can process information provided by a Web visitor),
the Findings of Fact show that as a practical matter, non-
commercial organizations and even many commercial organizations
using the Web would find it prohibitively expensive and
burdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposed
by the government, and that even if they could attempt to age
verify, there is little assurance that they could successfully
filter out minors.
          The government attempts to circumvent this problem by
seeking to limit the scope of the statute to those content
providers who are commercial pornographers, and urges that we do
likewise in our obligation to save a congressional enactment from
facial unconstitutionality wherever possible.  But in light of
its plain language and its legislative history, the CDA cannot
reasonably be read as limited to commercial pornographers.  A
court may not impose a narrowing construction on a statute unless
it is "readily susceptible" to such a construction.  Virginia v.
American Booksellers Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988).  The court
may not "rewrite a . . . law to conform it to constitutional
requirements."  Id.  Although we may prefer an interpretation of
a statute that will preserve the constitutionality of the
statutory scheme, United State v. Clark, 445 U.S. 23, 27 (1980),
we do not have license to rewrite a statute to "create
distinctions where none were intended."  American Tobacco Co. v.
Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 72 n.6 (1982); see also Consumer Party v.
Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 147 (3d Cir. 1985).  The Court has often
stated that "absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to
the contrary, [statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as
conclusive."  Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of
Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772 (1984)(quoting North Dakota v.
United States, 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983)).
          It is clear from the face of the CDA and from its
legislative history that Congress did not intend to limit its
application to commercial purveyors of pornography.  Congress
unquestionably knew how to limit the statute to such entities if
that was its intent, and in fact it did so in provisions relating
to dial-a-porn services.  See 47 U.S.C.  223(b)(2)(A)
(criminalizing making any indecent telephone communication "for
commercial purposes").  It placed no similar limitation in the
CDA.  Moreover, the Conference Report makes clear that Congress
did not intend to limit the application of the statute to content
providers such as those which make available the commercial
material contained in the government's exhibits, and confirms
that Congress intended "content regulation of both commercial and
non-commercial providers."  Conf. Rep. at 191.  See also, 141
Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (Statement of Senator
Exon).         
          The scope of the CDA is not confined to material that
has a prurient interest or appeal, one of the hallmarks of
obscenity, because Congress sought to reach farther.  Nor did
Congress include language that would define "patently offensive"
or "indecent" to exclude material of serious value.  It follows
that to narrow the statute in the manner the government urges
would be an impermissible exercise of our limited judicial
function, which is to review the statute as written for its
compliance with constitutional mandates.    
          I conclude inexorably from the foregoing that the CDA
reaches speech subject to the full protection of the First
Amendment, at least for adults.[1]  In questions of the witnesses
and in colloquy with the government attorneys, it became evident
that even if "indecent" is read as parallel to "patently
offensive," the terms would cover a broad range of material from
contemporary films, plays and books showing or describing sexual
activities (e.g., Leaving Las Vegas) to controversial
contemporary art and photographs showing sexual organs in
positions that the government conceded would be patently
offensive in some communities (e.g., a Robert Mapplethorpe
photograph depicting a man with an erect penis). 
          We have also found that there is no effective way for
many Internet content providers to limit the effective reach of
the CDA to adults because there is no realistic way for many
providers to ascertain the age of those accessing their
materials.  As a consequence, we have found that "[m]any speakers
who display arguably indecent content on the Internet must choose
between silence and the risk of prosecution."  Such a choice,
forced by sections 223(a) and (d) of the CDA, strikes at the
heart of speech of adults as well as minors.                      

                                F.
                 Whether CDA is Narrowly Tailored
          In the face of such a patent intrusion on a substantial
category of protected speech for adults, there is some irony in
considering whether the statute is narrowly tailored or, as
sometimes put, whether Congress has used the least restrictive
means to achieve a compelling government interest.  See Sable,
492 U.S. at 126.  It would appear that the extent of the
abridgement of the protected speech of adults that it has been
shown the CDA would effect is too intrusive to be outweighed by
the government's asserted interest, whatever its strength, in
protecting minors from access to indecent material.  Nonetheless,
the formulation of the inquiry requires that we consider the
government's assertion that the statute is narrowly drafted, and
I proceed to do so.  
          In this case, the government relies on the statutory
defenses for its argument of narrow tailoring.  There are a
number of reasons why I am not persuaded that the statutory
defenses can save the CDA from a conclusion of facial
unconstitutionality.
          First, it is difficult to characterize a criminal
statute that hovers over each content provider, like the
proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow tailoring.  Criminal
prosecution, which carries with it the risk of public obloquy as
well as the expense of court preparation and attorneys' fees,
could itself cause incalculable harm.  No provider, whether an
individual, non-profit corporation, or even large publicly held
corporation, is likely to willingly subject itself to prosecution
for a miscalculation of the prevalent community standards or for
an error in judgment as to what is indecent.  A successful
defense to a criminal prosecution would be small solace indeed.
          Credit card and adult verification services are
explicitly referred to as defenses in  223(e)(5)(B) of the CDA. 
As is set forth fully in the detailed Findings of Fact, these
defenses are not technologically or economically feasible for
most providers.  
          The government then falls back on the affirmative
defense to prosecution provided in  223(e)(5)(A) for a person
who "has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or
prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such
subsections . . . including any method which is feasible under
available technology."  The government emphasizes that
"effective" does not require 100% restriction, and that this
defense is "open-ended" and requires only reasonable efforts
based on current technology.
          But, as the evidence made clear, there is no such
technology at this time.  The government proffered as one option
that would constitute a valid affirmative defense under 
223(e)(5)(A) a "tagging" scheme conceived by Dr. Olsen in
response to this lawsuit whereby a string of characters would be
imbedded in all arguably indecent or patently offensive material. 
Our Findings of Fact set forth fully the reasons why we found
that the feasibility and effectiveness of tagging in the manner
proposed by the government has not been established.  All parties
agree that tagging alone does nothing to prevent children from
accessing potentially indecent material, because it depends upon
the cooperation of third parties to block the material on which
the tags are embedded.  Yet these third parties, over which the
content providers have no control, are not subject to the CDA.  I
do not believe a statute is narrowly tailored when it subjects to
potential criminal penalties those who must depend upon third
parties for the effective operation of a statutory defense.
          Most important, the government's "tagging" proposal is
purely hypothetical and offers no currently operative defense to
Internet content providers.  At this time, there is no agreed-
upon "tag" in existence, and no web browsers or user-based
screening systems are now configured to block tagged material. 
Nor, significantly, has the government stipulated that a content
provider could avoid liability simply by tagging its material.   
          Third, even if the technology catches up, as the
government confidently predicts, there will still be a not
insignificant burden attached to effecting a tagging defense, a
burden one should not have to bear in order to transmit
information protected under the constitution.  For example, to
effect tagging content providers must review all of their
material currently published online, as well as all new material
they post in the future, to determine if it could be considered
"patently offensive" in any community nationwide.  This would be
burdensome for all providers, but for the many not-for-profit
entities which currently post thousands of Web pages, this burden
would be one impossible to sustain.
           Finally, the viability of the defenses is intricately
tied to the clarity of the CDA's scope.  Because, like Judge
Buckwalter, and for many of the reasons he gives, I believe that
"indecent" and "patently offensive" are inherently vague,
particularly in light of the government's inability to identify
the relevant community by whose standards the material will be
judged, I am not persuaded by the government that the statutory
defenses in  223(e) provide effective protection from the
unconstitutional reach of the statute.
          Minors would not be left without any protection from
exposure to patently unsuitable material on the Internet should
the challenged provisions of the CDA be preliminarily enjoined.
Vigorous enforcement of current obscenity and child pornography
laws should suffice to address the problem the government
identified in court and which concerned Congress.  When the CDA
was under consideration by Congress, the Justice Department
itself communicated its view that it was not necessary because it
was prosecuting online obscenity, child pornography and child
solicitation under existing laws, and would continue to do so.[2] 
It follows that the CDA is not narrowly tailored, and the
government's attempt to defend it on that ground must fail.
                                G.
                      Preliminary Injunction
          When Congress decided that material unsuitable for
minors was available on the Internet, it could have chosen to
assist and support the development of technology that would
enable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such material
from their end.  It did not do so, and thus did not follow the
example available in the print media where non-obscene but
indecent and patently offensive books and magazines abound. 
Those responsible for minors undertake the primary obligation to
prevent their exposure to such material.  Instead, in the CDA
Congress chose to place on the speakers the obligation of
screening the material that would possibly offend some
communities. 
          Whether Congress' decision was a wise one is not at
issue here.  It was unquestionably a decision that placed the CDA
in serious conflict with our most cherished protection - the
right to choose the material to which we would have access.  
          The government makes what I view as an extraordinary
argument in its brief.  It argues that blocking technology needed
for effective parental control is not yet widespread but that it
"will imminently be in place." Government's Post-hearing
Memorandum at 66.  It then states that if we uphold the CDA, it
"will likely unleash the 'creative genius' of the Internet
community to find a myriad of possible solutions."  I can imagine
few arguments less likely to persuade a court to uphold a
criminal statute than one that depends on future technology to
cabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds.
          The government makes yet another argument that troubles
me.  It suggests that the concerns expressed by the plaintiffs
and the questions posed by the court reflect an exaggerated
supposition of how it would apply the law, and that we should, in
effect, trust the Department of Justice to limit the CDA's
application in a reasonable fashion that would avoid prosecution
for placing on the Internet works of serious literary or artistic
merit.  That would require a broad trust indeed from a generation
of judges not far removed from the attacks on James Joyce's
Ulysses as obscene.  See United States v. One Book Entitled
Ulysses, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934); see also Book Named "John
Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure" v. Attorney General of
Mass., 383 U.S. 413 (1966).  Even if we were to place confidence
in the reasonable judgment of the representatives of the
Department of Justice who appeared before us, the Department is
not a monolithic structure, and individual U.S. Attorneys in the
various districts of the country have or appear to exercise some
independence, as reflected by the Department's tolerance of
duplicative challenges in this very case.
          But the bottom line is that the First Amendment should
not be interpreted to require us to entrust the protection it
affords to the judgment of prosecutors.  Prosecutors come and go.
Even federal judges are limited to life tenure.  The First
Amendment remains to give protection to future generations as
well.  I have no hesitancy in concluding that it is likely that
plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of their argument that the
challenged provisions of the CDA are facially invalid under both
the First and Fifth Amendments.  



BUCKWALTER, District Judge
                                A.
          I believe that plaintiffs should prevail in this
litigation.  
          My conclusion differs in part from my original
memorandum filed in conjunction with the request for a Temporary
Restraining Order.  As part of the expedited review (per  561 of
the CDA), and in contrast to the limited documentation available
to me at the time of the T.R.O. hearing, we have now gathered
voluminous evidence presented by way of sworn declarations, live
testimony, demonstrative evidence, and other exhibits.[1]  Based
upon our findings of fact derived from careful consideration of
that evidence, I now conclude that this statute is overbroad and
does not meet the strict scrutiny standard in Sable
Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).
          More specifically, I now find that current technology
is inadequate to provide a safe harbor to most speakers on the
Internet.  On this issue, I concur in Chief Judge Sloviter's
opinion.  In addition, I continue to believe that the word
"indecent" is unconstitutionally vague, and I find that the terms
"in context" and "patently offensive" also are so vague as to
violate the First and Fifth Amendments.
          It is, of course, correct that statutes that attempt to
regulate the content of speech presumptively violate the First
Amendment.  See e.g. R.A.V. v. City of Saint Paul, 505 U.S. 377,
381 (1992).  That is as it should be.  The prohibition against
Government's regulation of speech cannot be set forth any clearer
than in the language of the First Amendment itself.  I suspect,
however, that it may come as a surprise to many people who have
not followed the evolution of constitutional law that, by
implication at least, the First Amendment provides that Congress
shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech unless that law
advances a compelling governmental interest.[2]  Our cherished
freedom of speech does not cover as broad a spectrum as one may
have gleaned from a simple reading of the Amendment.[3]  
          First Amendment jurisprudence has developed into a
study of intertwining standards and applications, perhaps as a
necessary response to our ever-evolving culture and modes of
communication.[4]  
          Essentially, my concerns are these:  above all, I
believe that the challenged provisions are so vague as to violate
both the First and Fifth Amendments, and in particular that
Congress' reliance on Pacifica is misplaced.  In addition, I
believe that technology as it currently exists -- and it bears
repeating that we are at the preliminary injunction phase only --
cannot provide a safe harbor for most speakers on the Internet,
thus rendering the statute unconstitutional under a strict
scrutiny analysis.  I refer to Chief Judge Sloviter's more
detailed analysis of this issue. 
          While I believe that our findings of fact clearly show
that as yet no defense is technologically feasible, and while I
also have found the present Act to be unconstitutionally vague, I
believe it is too early in the development of this new medium to
conclude that other attempts to regulate protected speech within
the medium will fail a challenge.  That is to say that I
specifically do not find that any and all statutory regulation of
protected speech on the Internet could not survive constitutional
scrutiny.  Prior cases have established that government
regulation to prevent access by minors to speech protected for
adults, even in media considered the vanguard of our First
Amendment protections, like print, may withstand a constitutional
challenge.  See e.g. Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 635
(1968) ("`Material which is protected for distribution to adults
is not necessarily constitutionally protected from restriction
upon its dissemination to children.'") (quoting Bookcase Inc. v.
Broderick, 18 N.Y.2d 71, 75, 271 N.Y.S.2d 947, 952, 218 N.E.2d
668, 671 (1966), appeal dismissed, sub nom Bookcase, Inc. v.
Leary, 385 U.S. 12 (1966)).  It should be noted that those
restrictions that have been found constitutional were sensitive
to the unique qualities of the medium at which the restriction
was aimed.  

                                B.

          This statute, all parties agree, deals with protected
speech, the preservation of which has been extolled by court
after court in case after case as the keystone, the bulwark, the
very heart of our democracy. What is more, the CDA attempts to
regulate protected speech through criminal sanctions, thus
implicating not only the First but also the Fifth Amendment of
our Constitution.  The concept of due process is every bit as
important to our form of government as is free speech.  If free
speech is at the heart of our democracy, then surely due process
is the very lifeblood of our body politic; for without it,
democracy could not survive.  Distilled to its essence, due
process is, of course, nothing more and nothing less than fair
play.  If our citizens cannot rely on fair play in their
relationship with their government, the stature of our government
as a shining example of democracy would be greatly diminished.  I
believe that an exacting or strict scrutiny of a statute which
attempts to criminalize protected speech requires a word by word
look at that statute to be sure that it clearly sets forth as
precisely as possible what constitutes a violation of the
statute.
          The reason for such an examination is obvious.  If the
Government is going to intrude upon the sacred ground of the
First Amendment and tell its citizens that their exercise of
protected speech could land them in jail, the law imposing such a
penalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only for
the potential offender but also for the potential enforcer. 
Kolender, 461 U.S. 352; Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Smith v.
Goguen, 415 U.S. 566 (1974); Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408
U.S. 104 (1972); Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507 (1948).
          In dealing with issues of vagueness and due process
over the years, the Supreme Court has enunciated many notable
principles.  One concern with vague laws relates to the issue of
notice.  The older cases have used phrases such as "a statute
which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so
vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at
its meaning and differ as to its application violates the first
essential of due process of law,"  Connally v. General Const.
Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (citations omitted); "it will not
do to hold an average man to the peril of indictment for the
unwise exercise of his . . . knowledge involving so many factors
of varying effect that neither the person to decide in advance
nor the jury to try him after the fact can safely and certainly
judge the result," Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., 274 U.S. 445, 465
(1927); and "[n]o one may be required at peril of life, liberty
or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes. 
All are entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or
forbids," Lanzetta v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939). 
Second, the Court has said that laws must provide precise
standards for those who apply them to prevent arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement, because "[w]hen the legislature fails
to provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit
`a standardless sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and
juries to pursue their personal predilections.'"  Kolender, 461
U.S. at 358 (citing Goguen, 415 U.S. at 575).  Finally, when
First Amendment concerns have been implicated, a stricter
standard of examination for vagueness is imperative.  "[T]his
court has intimated that stricter standards of permissible
statutory vagueness may be applied to a statute having a
potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may the less be
required to act at his peril here, because the free dissemination
of ideas may be the loser."  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147,
151 (1959).  See also Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499
("[P]erhaps the most important factor affecting the clarity that
the Constitution demands of a law is whether it threatens to
inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.  If,
for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech . .
. , a more stringent vagueness test should apply.") (citations
omitted).
          A case which sums up vagueness as it relates to due
process as succinctly as any other is Grayned v. City of
Rockford.  Here the court said:
               It is a basic principle of due process
               that an enactment is void for vagueness
               if its prohibitions are not clearly
               defined.  Vague laws offend several
               important values.  First, because we
               assume that man is free to steer between
               lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist
               that laws give the person of ordinary
               intelligence a reasonable opportunity to
               know what is prohibited, so that he may
               act accordingly.  Vague laws may trap
               the innocent by not providing fair
               warning.  Second, if arbitrary and
               discriminatory enforcement is to be
               prevented, laws must provide explicit
               standards for those who apply them.  A
               vague law impermissibly delegates basic
               policy matters to policemen, judges, and
               juries for resolution on an ad hoc and
               subjective basis, with the attendant
               dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory
               application.  Third, but related, where
               a vague statute "abut[s] upon sensitive
               areas of basic First Amendment
               freedoms," it "operates to inhibit the
               exercise of [those] freedoms." 
               Uncertain meanings inevitably lead
               citizens to "'steer far wider of the
               unlawful zone' . . . than if the
               boundaries of the forbidden areas were
               clearly marked."

Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations omitted).  
          At the same time, in considering the vagueness issue,
as the Government correctly points out, "[C]ondemned to the use
of words, we can never expect mathematical certainty from our
language." Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110.  See also Hoffman Estates,
455 U.S. 489; Hynes v. Mayor & Council of Oradell, 425 U.S. 610
(1976); Goguen, 415 U.S. 566.   In addition, it will always be
true that the fertile legal "imagination can conjure hypothetical
cases in which the meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nice
question."  American Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382,
412 (1950).  Thus, as I considered the vagueness issue I have
kept in mind the observation of Justice Holmes, denying a
challenge to vagueness in Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373
(1913).  To Justice Holmes, "the law is full of instances where a
man's fate depends on his estimating rightly, that is, as the
jury subsequently estimates it, some matter of degree.  If his
judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a short
imprisonment . . ., he may incur the penalty of death."  Nash,
229 U.S. at 377.  Even more recently the court has stated that
"due process does not require `impossible standards' of clarity." 
Kolender, 461 U.S. at 361, (quoting United States v. Petrillo,
332 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).  It is with all of these principles in
mind, as they interplay with the unique features of the Internet,
that I have reached my conclusion.
          The fundamental constitutional principle that concerns
me is one of simple fairness, and that is absent in the CDA.  The
Government initially argues that "indecent" in this statute is
the same as "patently offensive."  I do not agree that a facial
reading of this statute supports that conclusion.  The CDA does
not define the term "indecent," and the FCC has not promulgated
regulations defining indecency in the medium of cyberspace.   If
"indecent" and "patently offensive" were intended to have the
same meaning, surely section (a) could have mirrored section
(d)'s language.[5]  Indecent in this statute is an undefined word
which, standing alone, offers no guidelines whatsoever as to its
parameters.  Interestingly, another federal crime gives a
definition to indecent entirely different from that proposed in
the present case.[6]  While not applicable here, this example
shows the indeterminate nature of the word and the need for clear
definition, particularly in a statute which infringes upon
protected speech.  Although the use of different terms in 
223(a) and (d) suggests that Congress intended that the terms
have different meanings, the Conference Report indicates an
intention to treat  223(a) as containing the same language as 
223(d).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89 ("The conferees intend that the
term indecency . . . has the same meaning as established in FCC
v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and [Sable] and "New
section 223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from
[Pacifica] . . . .  The precise contours of the definition of
indecency have varied . . . .  The essence of the phrase --
patently offensive descriptions of sexual and excretory
activities -- has remained constant, however.").  Therefore, I
will acknowledge that the term indecency is "reasonably
susceptible" to the definition offered in the Conference Report
and might therefore adopt such a narrowing construction if it
would thereby preserve the constitutionality of the statute.  See
Virginia v. American Booksellers Association, 484 U.S. 383, 397
(1988);  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975). 
          Accepting these terms as synonymous, however, provides
no greater help to a speaker attempting to comply with the CDA. 
Contrary to the Government's suggestion, Pacifica does not answer
the question of whether the terms pass constitutional muster in
the present case.  In Pacifica, the Court did not consider a
vagueness challenge to the term "indecent," but considered only
whether the Government had the authority to regulate the
particular broadcast at issue -- George Carlin's Monologue
entitled "Filthy Words."  In finding in the affirmative, the
Court emphasized that its narrow holding applied only to
broadcasting, which is "uniquely accessible to children, even
those too young to read."  438 U.S. at 749.  Thus, while the
Court sanctioned the FCC's time restrictions on a radio program
that repeatedly used vulgar language, the Supreme Court did not
hold that use of the term "indecent" in a statute applied to
other media, particularly a criminal statute, would be on safe
constitutional ground.
          The Supreme Court more recently had occasion to
consider a statute banning "indecent" material in the dial-a-porn
context in Sable, 492 U.S. 115, and found that a complete ban on
such programming violated the First Amendment because it was not
narrowly tailored to serve the purpose of limiting children's
access to commercial pornographic telephone messages.  Once
again, the Court did not consider a challenge to the term
"indecent" on vagueness grounds, and indeed has never directly
ruled on this issue.
          Several other courts have, however, upheld the use of
the term in statutes regulating different media.  For example, in
Information Providers' Coalition v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir.
1991), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered whether the
term "indecent" in the 1989 Amendment to the Communications Act
regulating access to telephone dial-a-porn services and the FCC's
implementing regulations was void for vagueness.  The FCC had
defined "indecent" as "the description or depiction of sexual or
excretory activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as
measured by contemporary community standards for the telephone
medium."  928 F.2d at 874.  Although recognizing that the Supreme
Court had never explicitly ruled on a vagueness challenge to the
term, the court read Sable and Pacifica as having implicitly
accepted the use of this definition of "indecent."  The court
further stated that the FCC's definition of "indecent" was no
less imprecise than was the definition of "obscenity" as
announced in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973), and
thus concluded that "indecent" as pertained to dial-a-porn
regulations must survive a vagueness challenge.  See also Dial
Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991),
(upholding the use of "indecent" in the same amendment to the
Communications Act and FCC regulations.); Action for Children's
Television v. FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (rejecting
vagueness challenge to "indecency" provision in broadcast
television regulations).[7]      
          Notably, however, in these telephone and cable
television cases the FCC had defined indecent as patently
offensive by reference to contemporary community standards for
that particular medium.  See, e.g., Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 732
(defining "indecent" by reference to terms "patently offensive as
measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium"); Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1540 (defining
indecency by reference to contemporary community standards for
the telephone medium).  Here, the provision is not so limited. 
In fact, there is no effort to conform the restricting terms to
the medium of cyberspace, as is required under Pacifica and its
progeny.
          The Government attempts to save the "indecency" and
"patently offensive" provisions by claiming that the provisions
would only be used to prosecute pornographic works which, when
considered "in context" as the statute requires, would be
considered "indecent" or "patently offensive" in any community. 
The Government thus contends that plaintiffs' fears of
prosecution for publishing material about matters of health, art,
literature or civil liberties are exaggerated and unjustified. 
The Government's argument raises two issues:  first is the
question of which "community standards" apply in cyberspace,
under the CDA; and second is the proposition that citizens should
simply rely upon prosecutors to apply the statute
constitutionally.
          Are the contemporary community standards to be applied
those of the vast world of cyberspace, in accordance with the
Act's apparent intent to establish a uniform national standard of
content regulation?  The Government offered no evidence of any
such national standard or nationwide consensus as to what would
be considered "patently offensive".  On the contrary, in
supporting the use of the term "indecent" in the CDA, the
Government suggests that, in part, this term was chosen as a
means of insulating children from material not restricted under
current obscenity laws.  This additional term is necessary, the
Government states, because "whether something rises to the level
of obscene is a legal conclusion that, by definition, may vary
from community to community."  Govt. Brief at 31.  In support of
its argument, the Government points to the Second Circuit's
decision in United States v. Various Articles of Obscene
Merchandise, Schedule No. 2102, 709 F.2d 132, 134, 137 (2d Cir.
1983), which upheld the district court's conclusion that
"detailed portrayals of genitalia, sexual intercourse, fellatio,
and masturbation" including the film "Deep Throat" and other
pornographic films and magazines, are not obscene in light of the
community standards prevailing in New York City."  What this
argument indicates is that as interpretations of obscenity ebb
and flow throughout various communities, restrictions on indecent
material are meant to cover a greater or lesser quantity of
material not reached by each community's obscenity standard.  It
follows that to do this, what constitutes indecency must be as
open to fluctuation as the obscenity standard and cannot be
rigidly constructed as a single national standard if it is meant
to function as the Government has suggested.  As Justice Scalia
stated, "[t]he more narrow the understanding of what is
`obscene,' . . . the more pornographic what is embraced within
the residual category of `indecency.'"  Sable, 492 U.S. at 132
(Scalia, J. concurring).  This understanding is consistent with
the case law, in which the Supreme Court has explained that the
relevant community is the one where the information is accessed
and where the local jury sits.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 125;
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87 (1974); Miller, 413 U.S. at
30 ("[O]ur nation is simply too big and too diverse for this
Court to reasonably expect that such standards [of what is
patently offensive] could be articulated for all 50 states in a
single formulation.").  However, the Conference Report with
regard to the CDA states that the Act is "intended to establish a
uniform national standard of content regulation."  Conf. Rep. at
191.  This conflict inevitably leaves the reader of the CDA
unable to discern the relevant "community standard," and will
undoubtedly cause Internet users to "steer far wider of the
unlawful zone" than if the community standard to be applied were
clearly defined.  The chilling effect on the Internet users'
exercise of free speech is obvious.  See Baggett v. Bullitt, 377
U.S. 360, 372 (1964).  This is precisely the vice of vagueness.
          In addition, the Government's argument that the
challenged provisions will be applied only to "pornographic"
materials, and will not be applied to works with serious value is
without support in the CDA itself.  Unlike in the obscenity
context, indecency has not been defined to exclude works of
serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value, and
therefore the Government's suggestion that it will not be used to
prosecute publishers of such material is without foundation in
the law itself.  The Government's claim that the work must be
considered patently offensive "in context" does nothing to
clarify the provision, for it fails to explain which context is
relevant.  "Context" may refer to, among other things, the nature
of the communication as a whole, the time of day it was conveyed,
the medium used, the identity of the speaker, or whether or not
it is accompanied by appropriate warnings.  See e.g., Pacifica,
438 U.S. at 741 n.16, n.17 (referring to "the context of the
whole book," and to the unique interpretation of the First
Amendment "in the broadcasting context").
          The thrust of the Government's argument is that the
court should trust prosecutors to prosecute only a small segment
of those speakers subject to the CDA's restrictions, and whose
works would reasonably be considered "patently offensive" in
every community.  Such unfettered discretion to prosecutors,
however, is precisely what due process does not allow.  "It will
not do to say that a prosecutor's sense of fairness and the
Constitution would prevent a successful . . . prosecution for
some of the activities seemingly embraced within the sweeping
statutory definitions.  The hazard of being prosecuted . . .
nevertheless remains . . . .  Well-intentioned prosecutors and
judicial safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law." 
Baggett, 377 U.S. at 373-74; see also Keyishian v. Board of
Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599 (1967)("[i]t is no answer" to a vague
law for the Government "to say that the statute would not be
applied in such a case.").  And we cannot overlook the vagaries
of politics.  What may be, figuratively speaking, one
administration's pen may be another's sword.
          The evidence and arguments presented by the Government
illustrate the possibility of arbitrary enforcement of the Act. 
For example, one Government expert opined that any of the so-
called "seven dirty words" used in the Carlin monologue would be
subject to the CDA and therefore should be "tagged," as should
paintings of nudes displayed on a museum's web site.  The
Government has suggested in its brief, however, that the Act
should not be so applied.  See Govt. Brief at 37 (suggesting that
"seven dirty words" if used "in the context of serious
discussions" would not be subject to the Act).  Even Government
counsel was unable to define "indecency" with specificity.  The
Justice Department attorney could not respond to numerous
questions from the court regarding whether, for example, artistic
photographs of a nude man with an erect penis, depictions of
Indian statues portraying different methods of copulation, or the
transcript of a scene from a contemporary play about AIDS could
be considered "indecent" under the Act.  
          Plaintiffs also argue that section 223(e)(5)(A) of the
CDA, offering a defense for speakers who take "good faith,
reasonable, effective and appropriate actions under the
circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a
communication" covered by the Act, is unconstitutionally vague
because it fails to specify what would constitute an effective
defense to prosecution.  The plain language of the safe harbor
provision indicates an effort to ensure that the statute limits
speech in the least restrictive means possible by taking into
account emerging technologies in allowing for any and all
"reasonable, effective and appropriate" approaches to restricting
minors' access to the proscribed material.  But, the statute
itself does not contain any description of what, other than
credit card verification and adult identification codes -- which
we have established remain unavailable to most content providers
-- will protect a speaker from prosecution.  Significantly,
although the FCC is authorized to specify measures that might
satisfy this defense, the FCC's views will not be definitive but
will only "be admitted as evidence of good faith efforts" that
the defendant has met the requirements of the defense.  47 U.S.C.
 223(e)(6).  Thus, individuals attempting to comply with the
statute presently have no clear indication of what actions will
ensure that they will be insulated from criminal sanctions under
the CDA.            

                                C.

          The consequences of posting indecent content are
severe.[8]  I recognize that people must make judgments each and
every day, many times in the most intimate of relationships and
that an error in judgment can have serious consequences.  It is
also true that where those consequences involve penal sanctions,
a criminal law or statute has more often than not carefully
defined the proscribed conduct.  It is not so much that the
accused needs these precise definitions, as it has been said he
or she rarely reads the law in advance.  What is more important
is that the enforcer of statutes must be guided by clear and
precise standards.  In statutes that break into relatively new
areas, such as this one, the need for definition of terms is
greater, because even commonly understood terms may have
different connotations or parameters in this new context.[9]
Words cannot define conduct with mathematical certainty, and
lawyers, like the bright and intelligent ones now before us, will
most certainly continue to devise ways by which to challenge
them.  This rationale, however, can neither support a finding of
constitutionality nor relieve legislators from the very difficult
task of carefully drafting legislation tailored to its goal and
sensitive to the unique characteristics of, in this instance,
cyberspace.



DALZELL, District Judge
A. Introduction
          I begin with first principles:  As a general rule, the
Constitution forbids the Government from silencing speakers
because of their particular message.  R.A.V. v. City of Saint
Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992).  "Our political system and
cultural life rest upon this ideal."  Turner Broadcasting Sys. v.
FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  This general rule is subject
only to "narrow and well-understood exceptions".  Id.  A law
that, as here, regulates speech on the basis of its content, is
"presumptively invalid".  R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2542.
          Two of the exceptions to this general rule deal with
obscenity (commonly understood to include so-called hardcore
pornography), Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), and child
pornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982).  The
Government can and does punish with criminal sanction people who
engage in these forms of speech.  18 U.S.C.  1464-65
(criminalizing obscene material); id.  2251-52 (criminalizing
child pornography).  Indeed, the Government could punish these
forms of speech on the Internet even without the CDA.  E.g.,
United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995)
(affirming obscenity convictions for the operation of a computer
bulletin board).  
          The Government could also completely ban obscenity and
child pornography from the Internet.  No Internet speaker has a
right to engage in these forms of speech, and no Internet
listener has a right to receive them.  Child pornography and
obscenity have "no constitutional protection, and the government
may ban [them] outright in certain media, or in all."  Alliance
for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. Cir. 1995)
(citing R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2545), cert. granted sub nom.
Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium, 116 S. Ct. 471
(1996); see also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756.  As R.A.V. notes, "'the
freedom of speech' referred to by the First Amendment does not
include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations." 
R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2543.
          The cases before us, however, are not about obscenity
or child pornography.  Plaintiffs in these actions claim no right
to engage in these forms of speech in the future, nor does the
Government intimate that plaintiffs have engaged in these forms
of speech in the past.
          This case is about "indecency", as that word has come
to be understood since the Supreme Court's decisions in FCC v.
Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1976), and Sable
Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The legal
difficulties in these actions arise because of the special place
that indecency occupies in the Supreme Court's First Amendment
jurisprudence.  While adults have a First Amendment right to
engage in indecent speech, Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; see also
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747-48, the Supreme Court has also held
that the Government may, consistent with the Constitution,
regulate indecency on radio and television, and in the "dial-a-
porn" context, as long as the regulation does not operate as a
complete ban.  Thus, any regulation of indecency in these areas
must give adults access to indecent speech, which is their right.
          The Government may only regulate indecent speech for a
compelling reason, and in the least restrictive manner.  Sable,
492 U.S. at 126.  "It is not enough to show that the Government's
ends are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to
achieve those ends."  Id.  This "most exacting scrutiny", Turner,
114 S. Ct. at 2459, requires the Government to "demonstrate that
the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the
regulation will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and
material way."  United States v. National Treasury Employees
Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1017 (1995) (citing Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
1017).  Thus, although our analysis here must balance ends and
means, the scales tip at the outset in plaintiffs' favor.  This
is so because "[r]egulations which permit the Government to
discriminate on the basis of the content of the message cannot be
tolerated under the First Amendment."  Simon & Schuster, Inc. v.
Members of the New York State Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105,
116 (1991) (citation omitted).  
          The Government argues that this case is really about
pornography on the Internet.  Apart from hardcore and child
pornography, however, the word pornography does not have a fixed
legal meaning.  When I use the word pornography in my analysis
below, I refer to for-profit purveyors of sexually explicit,
"adult" material similar to that at issue in Sable.  See 492 U.S.
at 118.  Pornography is normally either obscene or indecent, as
Justice Scalia noted in his concurrence in Sable.  Id. at 132.  I
would avoid using such an imprecise (and overbroad) word, but I
feel compelled to do so here, since Congress undoubtedly had such
material in mind when it passed the CDA.  See S. Rep. No. 230,
104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-91 (1996), reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 200-05 [hereinafter Senate Report].  Moreover,
the Government has defended the Act before this court by arguing
that the Act could be constitutionally applied to such material.
          Plaintiffs have, as noted, moved for a preliminary
injunction.  The standards for such relief are well-settled. 
Plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctive relief must show (1)
"[a] reasonable probability of eventual success in the
litigation" and (2) "irreparabl[e] injur[y] pendente lite" if
relief is not granted.  Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.2d
645, 653 (3d Cir. 1994).  We must also consider, if appropriate,
(3) "the possibility of harm to other interested persons from the
grant or denial of the injunction", and (4) "the public
interest".  Id.; see also Opticians Ass'n v. Independent
Opticians, 920 F.2d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).
          In a First Amendment challenge, a plaintiff who meets
the first prong of the test for a preliminary injunction will
almost certainly meet the second, since irreparable injury
normally arises out of the deprivation of speech rights, "for
even minimal periods of time".  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347,
373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert.
denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989).  Of course, neither the Government
nor the public generally can claim an interest in the enforcement
of an unconstitutional law.  Thus, I focus my legal analysis
today primarily on whether plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of
success on their claim that the CDA is unconstitutional.  The
issues of irreparable harm to plaintiffs, harm to third parties,
and the public interest all flow from that determination.[1]
          Plaintiffs' challenge here is a "facial" one.  A law
that regulates the content of speech is facially invalid if it
does not pass the "most exacting scrutiny" that we have described
above, or if it would "penalize a substantial amount of speech
that is constitutionally protected".  Forsyth County v.
Nationalist Movement, 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  This is so
even if some applications would be "constitutionally
unobjectionable".  Id.; see also National Treasury Employees
Union v. United States, 990 F.2d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993)
(Randolph, J., concurring), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995). 
Sometimes facial challenges require an inquiry into a party's
"standing" (i.e., whether a party may properly challenge a law as
facially invalid).  See, e.g., Ferber, 458 U.S. at 767-79.  At
other times a facial challenge requires only an inquiry into the
law's reach.  See, e.g., R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2547.[2]  As I
describe it in part C below, I have no question that plaintiffs
here have standing to challenge the validity of the CDA, and,
indeed, the Government has not seriously challenged plaintiffs'
standing to do so.  See, e.g., Virginia v. American Booksellers
Assoc., 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988).  Thus, the focus is squarely on
the merits of plaintiffs' facial challenge.[3]
          I divide my legal analysis below into three parts.  In
Part B, I examine the traditional definition of indecency and
relate it to the provisions of the CDA at issue in this action. 
From this analysis I conclude that  223(a) and  223(d) of the
CDA reach the same kind of speech.  My analysis also convinces me
that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their claim that the
CDA is unconstitutionally vague.  In Part C, I address the
Government's argument that plaintiffs are not the CDA's target,
nor would they likely face prosecution under the Act.  Here, I
conclude that plaintiffs could reasonably fear prosecution under
the Act, even if some of their fears border on the farfetched. 
In Part D, I consider the legal implications of the special
attributes of Internet communication, as well as the effect that
the CDA would have on these attributes.  In this Part I conclude
that the disruptive effect of the CDA on Internet communication,
as well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech, not only
render the Act unconstitutional but also would render
unconstitutional any regulation of protected speech on this new
medium.

B.  Defining Indecency
          Although no court of appeals has ever to my knowledge
upheld a vagueness challenge to the meaning of "indecency",
several recent cases have grappled with the elusive meaning of
that word in the context of cable television and "dial-a-porn". 
Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir.
1995), cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); Dial Information
Serv. Corp. v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert.
denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992); Information Providers Coalition for
Defense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir.
1991).
          In Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 123-25, for
example, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals addressed
prohibitions on indecent programming on certain cable television
channels.  That court noted that the FCC has codified the meaning
of "'indecent' programming" on cable television as "programming
that describes or depicts sexual or excretory activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary
community standards for the cable medium."  Id. at 112 (citing
what is now 47 C.F.R.  76.701(g)).
          The FCC took a similar approach to the definition of
"indecency" in the "dial-a-porn" medium.[4]  In Dial Information
Services, 938 F.2d at 1540, the Second Circuit quoted the FCC's
definition of indecent telephone communications in that context:
               [I]n the dial-a-porn context, we
               believe it is appropriate to define
               indecency as the description or
               depiction of sexual or excretory
               activities or organs in a patently
               offensive manner as measured by
               contemporary community standards
               for the telephone medium.
Id. at 1540 (citation omitted); see also Information Providers'
Coalition for Defense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d
866, 876 (9th Cir. 1991).
          These three cases recognize that the FCC did not define
"indecency" for cable and dial-a-porn in a vacuum.  Rather, it
borrowed from the Supreme Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  In that case (which I describe
in greater detail below), the Supreme Court established the rough
outline from which the FCC fashioned its three-part definition. 
For the first two parts of the test, the Supreme Court emphasized
the "importance of context" in examining arguably indecent
material.  Id. at 747 n.25.  "Context" in the Pacifica opinion
includes consideration of both the particular medium from which
the material originates and the particular community that
receives the material.  Id. at 746 (assuming that the Carlin
monologue "would be protected in other contexts"); id. at 748-51
(discussing the attributes of broadcast); see also Information
Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876 (discussing the
"content/context dichotomy").  Second, the opinion limits its
discussion to "patently offensive sexual and excretory language",
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747, and this type of content has remained
the FCC's touchstone.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media,
56 F.3d at 112.[5]
          We have quoted from the CDA extensively above and I
will only briefly rehearse that discussion here.  Section 223(a)
of the CDA criminalizes "indecent" speech on the Internet.  This
is the "indecency" provision.  Section 223(d) of the CDA
addresses speech that, "in context, depicts or describes, in
terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community
standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs".  This is
the "patently offensive" provision.  The foregoing discussion
leads me to conclude that these two provisions describe the same
kind of speech.  That is, the use of "indecent" in  223(a) is
shorthand for the longer description in  223(d).  Conversely,
the longer description in  223(d) is itself the definition of
"indecent" speech.  I believe Congress could have used the word
"indecent" in both  223(a) and  223(d), or it could have used
the "patently offensive" description of  223(d) in  223(a),
without a change in the meaning of the Act.  I do not believe
that Congress intended that this distinction alone would change
the reach of either section of the CDA.[6]
          The CDA's legislative history confirms this conclusion. 
There, the conference committee explicitly noted that  223(d)
"codifies the definition of indecency from FCC v. Pacifica
Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). . . .  The conferees intend that
the term indecency (and the rendition of the definition of that
term in new section 502) has the same meaning as established in
FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable
Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989)." 
Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02. 
The legislative history makes clear that Congress did not intend
to create a distinction in meaning when it used the generic term
"indecency" in  223(a) and the definition of that term in 
223(d).[7]
          There is no doubt that the CDA requires the most
stringent review for vagueness, since it is a criminal statute
that "threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally
protected rights".  Colautti v. Franklin, 439 U.S 379, 391
(1979); see also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8
(1983); Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.  My analysis here
nevertheless leads ineluctably to the conclusion that the
definition of indecency is not unconstitutionally vague.  The
Miller definition of obscenity has survived such challenges, see,
e.g., Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 118-19 (1974); Fort
Wayne Books, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57 (1989), and the
definition of indecency contains a subset of the elements of
obscenity.  If the Miller test "give[s] the person of ordinary
intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited,
so that he may act accordingly", Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408
U.S. 104, 108 (1972), the omission of parts of that test does not
warrant a contrary conclusion.  See Dial Information Services,
938 F.2d at 1541-42.  Similarly, since the definition of
indecency arose from the Supreme Court itself in Pacifica, we may
fairly imply that the Court did not believe its own
interpretation to invite "arbitrary and discriminatory
enforcement" or "abut upon sensitive areas of basic First
Amendment freedoms".  Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations and
alterations omitted).  Sable, while not explicitly addressing the
issue of vagueness, reinforces this conclusion.  See Information
Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 875-76 (citing Sable, 492 U.S.
at 126-27).  It follows, then, that plaintiffs' vagueness
challenge is not likely to succeed on the merits and does not
support preliminary injunctive relief.
          The possible interpretations of the defenses in 
223(e) do not alter this conclusion.  As a matter of statutory
construction,  223(e)(5)(B) could not be clearer.  This section,
which imports the dial-a-porn defenses into the CDA, creates
"specific and objective" methods to avoid liability.  See Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 629 (1984).  Section
223(e)(5)(A) is more suspect, since it arguably "fail[s] to
describe with sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in
order to satisfy" it.  Kolender 461 U.S. at 361.[8]  Yet even
though the defenses in both sections are unavailable to many
Internet users, their unavailability does not render the
liability provisions vague.  Rather, their unavailability just
transforms  223(a) and  223(d) into a total ban, in violation
of Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), and Sable, 492
U.S. at 127, 131.  I am sensitive to plaintiffs' arguments that
the statute, as written, does not create safe harbors through
which all Internet users may shield themselves from liability. 
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 37-38.  Here again, however, the
absence of safe harbors relates to the (over)breadth of a
statute, and not its vagueness.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.

C.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Prosecution Under the Act
          The Government has consistently argued that the speech
of many of the plaintiffs here is almost certainly not indecent. 
They point, for example, to the educational and political content
of plaintiffs' speech, and they also suggest that the occasional
curse word in a card catalogue will probably not result in
prosecution.  See Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 203 ("Material with serious redeeming value is
quite obviously intended to edify and educate, not to offend."). 
In this section I address that argument.
          I agree with the Government that some of plaintiffs'
claims are somewhat exaggerated, but hyperbolic claims do not in
themselves weigh in the Government's favor.  In recent First
Amendment challenges, the Supreme Court has itself paid close
attention to extreme applications of content-based laws.  
          In Simon & Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York
State Crimes Victim Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), the Court
addressed the constitutionality of a law that required criminals
to turn over to their victims any income derived from books,
movies, or other commercial exploitation of their crimes.  Id. at
504-05.  In its opinion, the Court evaluated the argument of an
amicus curiae that the law's reach could include books such as
The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Civil Disobedience, and
Confessions of Saint Augustine, and authors such as Emma Goldman,
Martin Luther King, Jr., Sir Walter Raleigh, Jesse Jackson, and
Bertrand Russell.  Id. at 121-22.  The Court credited the
argument even while recognizing that it was laced with
"hyperbole":
               The argument that [the] statute . .
               . would prevent publication of all
               of these works is hyperbole -- some
               would have been written without
               compensation -- but the . . . law
               clearly reaches a wide range of
               literature that does not enable a
               criminal to profit from his crime
               while a victim remains
               uncompensated.
Id. at 122.  If a content-based law "can produce such an
outcome", id. at 123 (emphasis added), then Simon & Schuster
allows us to consider those outcomes in our analysis.
          Even more recently, in United States v. National
Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995), the Court
addressed the constitutionality of a law that banned federal
employees from accepting honoraria for publications unrelated to
their work.  Id. at 1008.  The Court noted that the law would
reach "literary giants like Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman
Melville, . . . Walt Whitman, . . . and Bret Harte".  Id. at
1012.  This concern resurfaced later in the opinion, see id. at
1015 ("[W]e cannot ignore the risk that [the ban] might deprive
us of the work of a future Melville or Hawthorne."), even though
a footnote immediately renders this concern at least hyperbolic:
               These authors' familiar masterworks
               would survive the honoraria ban as
               currently administered.  Besides
               exempting all books, the
               [regulations implementing the ban]
               protect fiction and poetry from the
               ban's coverage, although the
               statute's language is not so clear. 
               But some great artists deal in fact
               as well as fiction, and some deal
               in both.
Id. n.16 (citations omitted).
          Here, even though it is perhaps unlikely that the
Carnegie Library will ever stand in the dock for putting its card
catalogue online, or that the Government will hale the ACLU into
court for its online quiz of the seven dirty words, we cannot
ignore that the Act could reach these activities.  The definition
of indecency, like the definition of obscenity, is not a rigid
formula.  Rather, it confers a large degree of autonomy to
individual communities to set the bounds of decency for
themselves.  Cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  This is as it should
be, since this flexibility recognizes that ours is a country with
diverse cultural and historical roots.  See, e.g., Hamling, 418
U.S. at 104 ("A juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of
the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from
which he comes for making the required determination, just as he
is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the propensities of a
'reasonable' person in other areas of the law.").
          Putting aside hyperbolic application, I also have
little doubt that some communities could well consider
plaintiffs' speech indecent, and these plaintiffs could --
perhaps should -- have a legitimate fear of prosecution.  In
Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir.
1995), the District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized three
broadcasts that the FCC found indecent in the late 1980s:
               The offending morning broadcast . .
               . contained "explicit references to
               masturbation, ejaculation, breast
               size, penis size, sexual
               intercourse, nudity, urination,
               oral-genital contact, erections,
               sodomy, bestiality, menstruation
               and testicles."  The remaining two
               were similarly objectionable.
Id. at 657 (citing In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC R.
930, 932 (1987)).  In Infinity Broadcasting, one of the
broadcasts that the FCC found indecent was an excerpt of a play
about AIDS, finding that the excerpts "contained the concentrated
and repeated use of vulgar and shocking language to portray
graphic and lewd depictions of excretion, anal intercourse,
ejaculation, masturbation, and oral-genital sex".  3 FCC R. at
934.[9]  To the FCC, even broadcasts with "public value . . .
addressing the serious problems posed by AIDS" can be indecent if
"that material is presented in a manner that is patently
offensive".  Id. (emphasis in original).[10]  
          Yet, this is precisely the kind of speech that occurs,
for example, on Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, which
includes safer sex instructions written in street language for
easy comprehension.  The Web site also describes the risk of HIV
transmission for particular sexual practices.  The FCC's
implication in In the Matter of King Broadcasting Co., 5 FCC R.
2971 (1990), that a "candid discussion[] of sexual topics" on
television was decent in part because it was "not presented in a
pandering, titillating or vulgar manner" would be unavailing to
Critical Path, other plaintiffs, and some amici.  These
organizations want to pander and titillate on their Web sites, at
least to a degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver their
message in an engaging and coherent way.[11]
          In In re letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC R. 3689
(1990), the FCC found indecent a morning discussion between two
announcers regarding Jim Bakker's alleged rape of Jessica Hahn. 
Id.  Here, too, the FCC recognized that the broadcast had public
value.  Id. (noting that the broadcast concerned "an incident
that was at the time 'in the news'").  Yet, under the FCC's
interpretation of Pacifica, "the merit of a work is 'simply one
of the many variables' that make up a work's context".  Id.
(citation omitted).
          One of the plaintiffs here, Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc.,
has as its core purpose the issue of prison rape.  The
organization creates chat rooms in which members can discuss
their experiences.  Some amici have also organized Web sites
dedicated to survivors of rape, incest, and other sexual abuse. 
These Web sites provide fora for the discussion and contemplation
of shared experiences.  The operators of these sites, and their
participants, could legitimately fear prosecution under the CDA.
          With respect to vulgarity, the Government is in a
similarly weak position.  In Pacifica, the Supreme Court held
that multiple repetition of expletives could be indecent. 
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750.  Although the FCC did not follow this
rationale with respect to a broadcast of "a bona fide news story"
on National Public Radio, Letter to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 FCC R.
610 (1991), aff'd on other grounds sub nom. Branton v. FCC, 993
F.2d 906, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1993), the ACLU, a plaintiff here, could
take little comfort from that administrative decision.  It would
need to discern, for example, whether a chat room that it
organized to discuss the meaning of the word fuck was more like
the Carlin monologue or more like a National Public Radio
broadcast.[12]  Plaintiffs' expert would have found expletives
indecent in a community consisting only of himself,[13] and his
views undoubtedly -- and reasonably -- reflect the view of many
people.  
          In sum, I am less confident than the Government that
societal mores have changed so drastically since Pacifica that an
online equivalent of the Carlin monologue, or the Carlin
monologue itself online, would pass muster under the CDA.  Under
existing precedent, plaintiffs' fear of prosecution under the Act
is legitimate, even though they are not the pornographers
Congress had in mind when it passed the CDA.[14]   Cf. City of
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987).  My discussion of the
effect and reach of the CDA, therefore, applies both to
plaintiffs' hyperbolic concerns and to their very real ones.
D.  A Medium-Specific Analysis
          The Internet is a new medium of mass communication.[15] 
As such, the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence
compels us to consider the special qualities of this new medium
in determining whether the CDA is a constitutional exercise of
governmental power.  Relying on these special qualities, which we
have described at length in our Findings of fact above, I
conclude that the CDA is unconstitutional and that the First
Amendment denies Congress the power to regulate protected speech
on the Internet.  This analysis and conclusions are consistent
with Congress's intent to avoid tortuous and piecemeal review of
the CDA by authorizing expedited, direct review in the Supreme
Court "as a matter of right" of interlocutory, and not merely
final, orders upholding facial challenges to the Act.  See 
561(b) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.[16]

          1.  The Differential Treatment of Mass Communication
Media
          Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Jackson recognized that
"[t]he moving picture screen, the radio, the newspaper, the
handbill, the sound truck and the street corner orator have
differing natures, values, abuses and dangers.  Each . . . is a
law unto itself".  Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 97 (1949)
(Jackson, J., concurring).  The Supreme Court has expressed this
sentiment time and again since that date, and differential
treatment of the mass media has become established First
Amendment doctrine.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v.
FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2456 (1994) ("It is true that our cases
have permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers
than of speakers in other media."); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748
("We have long recognized that each medium of expression presents
special First Amendment problems."); City of Los Angeles v.
Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 496 (1974)
("Different communications media are treated differently for
First Amendment purposes.") (Blackmun, J., concurring);
Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 500-01
(1981) (plurality opinion) ("This Court has often faced the
problem of applying the broad principles of the First Amendment
to unique forums of expression.").  Thus, the Supreme Court has
established different rules for print, Miami Herald Publishing
Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974), broadcast radio and
television, see, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S.
367 (1969), cable television, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57, and
even billboards, Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 501, and drive-in movie
theaters, Erzoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).
          This medium-specific approach to mass communication
examines the underlying technology of the communication to find
the proper fit between First Amendment values and competing
interests.  In print media, for example, the proper fit generally
forbids governmental regulation of content, however minimal. 
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  In other media (billboards, for
example), the proper fit may allow for some regulation of both
content and of the underlying technology (such as it is) of the
communication.  Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 502.
           Radio and television broadcasting present the most
expansive approach to medium-specific regulation of mass
communication.  As a result of the scarcity of band widths on the
electromagnetic spectrum, the Government holds broad authority
both to parcel out the frequencies and to prohibit others from
speaking on the same frequency:
               As a general matter, there are more
               would-be broadcasters than
               frequencies available in the
               electromagnetic spectrum.  And if
               two broadcasters were to attempt to
               transmit over the same frequency in
               the same locale, they would
               interfere with one another's
               signals, so that neither could be
               heard at all.  The scarcity of
               broadcast frequencies thus required
               the establishment of some
               regulatory mechanism to divide the
               electromagnetic spectrum and assign
               specific frequencies to particular
               broadcasters.  
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citing FCC v. League of Women Voters,
468 U.S. 364 (1984)).
          This scarcity also allows the Government to regulate
content even after it assigns a license:
               In addition, the inherent physical
               limitation on the number of
               speakers who may use the broadcast
               medium has been thought to require
               some adjustment in traditional
               First Amendment analysis to permit
               the Government to place limited
               content restraints, and impose
               certain affirmative obligations, on
               broadcast licensees.
Id. at 2457 (citing Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390-95; National
Broadcasting Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943)).  
          The broadcasting cases firmly establish that the
Government may force a licensee to offer content to the public
that the licensee would otherwise not offer, thereby assuring
that radio and television audiences have a diversity of content. 
In broadcasting, "[i]t is the right of the public to receive
suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other
ideas and experiences which is crucial".  Red Lion, 395 U.S. at
390; see also CBS, Inc. v. FCC, 453 U.S. 367, 395 (1981) ("A
licensed broadcaster is 'granted the free and exclusive use of a
limited and valuable part of the public domain; when he accepts
that franchise it is burdened by enforceable public
obligations.'") (citation omitted); Columbia Broadcasting Sys.,
Inc. v. Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 110-11 (1973). 
These content restrictions include punishing licensees who
broadcast inappropriate but protected speech at an impermissible
time.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750-51.
          In this case, the Government relies on the Pacifica
decision in arguing that the CDA is a constitutional exercise of
governmental power.  Since the CDA regulates indecent speech, and
since Pacifica authorizes governmental regulation of indecent
speech (so the Government's argument goes), it must follow that
the CDA is a valid exercise of governmental power.  That
argument, however, ignores Pacifica's roots as a decision
addressing the proper fit between broadcasting and the First
Amendment.  The argument also assumes that what is good for
broadcasting is good for the Internet.

          2.  The Scope of the Pacifica Decision
          In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the
Supreme Court first decided whether the Government had the power
to regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 729.  In Pacifica, a radio
listener complained about the broadcast of George Carlin's
"Filthy Words" monologue at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon. 
Id. at 729-30.  The Carlin monologue was replete with "the words
you couldn't say on the public . . . airwaves . . . , ever", and
the listener had tuned in while driving with his young son in New
York.  Id.  The FCC issued a declaratory order, holding that it
could have subjected the Pacifica Foundation (owner of the radio
station) to an administrative sanction.  Id. at 730.  In its
order the FCC also described the standards that it would use in
the future to regulate indecency in the broadcast medium.  Id. at
731.  The Supreme Court upheld the FCC's decision and confirmed
the power of that agency to regulate indecent speech.  Id. at
750-51.
          The rationale of Pacifica rested on three overlapping
considerations.  First, using as its example the Carlin monologue
before it, the Court weighed the value of indecent speech and
concluded that such speech "lie[s] at the periphery of First
Amendment concerns."  Id. at 743.  Although the Court recognized
that the FCC had threatened to punish Pacifica based on the
content of the Carlin monologue, id. at 742, it found that the
punishment would have been permissible because four-letter words
"offend for the same reasons that obscenity offends."  Id. at 746
(footnote omitted).  The Court then described the place of four-
letter words "in the hierarchy of first amendment values":
               Such utterances are no essential
               part of any exposition of ideas,
               and are of such slight social value
               as a step to truth that any benefit
               that may be derived from them is
               clearly outweighed by the social
               interest in order and morality.
Id. at 746 (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572
(1942)).  
          Second, the Court recognized that "broadcasting . . .
has received the most limited First Amendment protection."  Id.
at 748.  The Government may regulate broadcast consistent with
the Constitution, even though the same regulation would run afoul
of the First Amendment in the print medium.  Id. (comparing Red
Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969) with Miami
Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974)).  This is
so because broadcasting has a "uniquely pervasive presence in the
lives of all Americans" and "is uniquely accessible to children,
even those too young to read."  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.
          Third, the Court found the FCC's sanction -- an
administrative sanction -- to be an appropriate means of
regulating indecent speech.  At the outset of the opinion, the
Court disclaimed that its holding was a "consider[ation of] any
question relating to the possible application of  1464 as a
criminal statute."  Id. at 739 n.13.  Later in the opinion, the
Court "emphasize[d] the narrowness of [its] holding", and
explicitly recognized that it had not held that the Carlin
monologue would justify a criminal prosecution.  Id. at 750. 
Instead, the Court allowed the FCC to regulate indecent speech
with administrative penalties under a "nuisance" rationale --
"like a pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard."  Id. at 750
(citation omitted).
          Time has not been kind to the Pacifica decision.  Later
cases have eroded its reach, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly
instructed against overreading the rationale of its holding.
          First, in Bolger v. Young Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S.
60 (1983), the Supreme Court refused to extend Pacifica to a law
unrelated to broadcasting.  In that case, a federal law
prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive
advertisements.  Id. at 61.  The Government defended the law by
claiming an interest in protecting children from the
advertisements.  The Court rejected this argument as overbroad:
               In [Pacifica], this Court did
               recognize that the Government's
               interest in protecting the young
               justified special treatment of an
               afternoon broadcast heard by adults
               as well as children.  At the same
               time, the majority "emphasize[d]
               the narrowness of our holding",
               explaining that broadcasting is
               "uniquely pervasive" and that it is
               "uniquely accessible to children,
               even those too young to read."  The
               receipt of mail is far less
               intrusive and uncontrollable.  Our
               decisions have recognized that the
               special interest of the Federal
               Government in regulation of the
               broadcast media does not readily
               translate into a justification for
               regulation of other means of
               communication. 
Id. at 74 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in
original) see also id. at 72 ("[T]he 'short, though regular,
journey from mail box to trash can . . . is an acceptable burden,
at least so far as the Constitution is concerned.'") (citation
omitted) (alterations in original).
          Second, in Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989), the Supreme Court again limited Pacifica.  In that case,
the Court considered the validity of a ban on indecent "dial-a-
porn" communications.  Id. at 117-18.[17]  As in Bolger, the
Government argued that Pacifica justified a complete ban of that
form of speech.  The Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead
that Pacifica's "emphatically narrow" holding arose out of the
"unique attributes of broadcasting".  Id. at 127.  The Court held
that the ban was unconstitutional.  Id. at 131.
          Sable narrowed Pacifica in two ways.  First, the Court
implicitly rejected Pacifica's nuisance rationale for dial-a-
porn, holding instead that the Government could only regulate the
medium "by narrowly drawn regulations designed to serve those
interests without unnecessarily interfering with First Amendment
freedoms".  Id. at 126 (citation omitted).  Under this strict
scrutiny, "[i]t is not enough to show that the Government's ends
are compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve
those ends."  Id.; see also Fabulous Assoc. v. Pennsylvania Pub.
Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780, 784-85 (3d Cir. 1990). 
          Second, the Court concluded that the law, like a law it
had struck down in 1957, "denied adults their free speech rights
by allowing them to read only what was acceptable for children". 
Sable, 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380
(1957)).  Thus, any regulation of dial-a-porn would have to give
adults the opportunity to partake of that medium.  Id.  This
conclusion echoes Bolger.  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74 ("The level
of discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that
which would be suitable for a sandbox.").[18]
          Finally, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC,
114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994), the Supreme Court implicitly limited
Pacifica once again when it declined to adopt the broadcast
rationale for the medium of cable television.  The Court
concluded that the rules for broadcast were "inapt" for cable
because of the "fundamental technological differences between
broadcast and cable transmission".  Id. at 2457.
          The legal significance to this case of Turner's refusal
to apply the broadcast rules to cable television cannot be
overstated.  Turner's holding confirms beyond doubt that the
holding in Pacifica arose out of the scarcity rationale unique to
the underlying technology of broadcasting, and not out of the end
product that the viewer watches.  That is, cable television has
no less of a "uniquely pervasive presence" than broadcast
television, nor is cable television more "uniquely accessible to
children" than broadcast.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49. 
From the viewer's perspective, cable and broadcast television are
identical:  moving pictures with sound from a box in the home. 
Whether one receives a signal through an antenna or through a
dedicated wire, the end result is just television in either case. 
In declining to extend broadcast's scarcity rationale for cable,
the Supreme Court also implicitly limited Pacifica, the holding
of which flows directly from that rationale.[19]
          Turner thus confirms that the analysis of a particular
medium of mass communication must focus on the underlying
technology that brings the information to the user.  In
broadcast, courts focus on the limited number of band widths and
the risk of interference with those frequencies.  See, e.g.,
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57.  In cable, courts focus on the
number of channels, the different kinds of cable operators, and
the cost to the consumer.  Id. at 2452. 
          I draw two conclusions from the foregoing analysis. 
First, from the Supreme Court's many decisions regulating
different media differently, I conclude that we cannot simply
assume that the Government has the power to regulate protected
speech over the Internet, devoting our attention solely to the
issue of whether the CDA is a constitutional exercise of that
power.  Rather, we must also decide the validity of the
underlying assumption as well, to wit, whether the Government has
the power to regulate protected speech at all.  That decision
must take into account the underlying technology, and the actual
and potential reach, of that medium.  Second, I conclude that
Pacifica's holding is not persuasive authority here, since
plaintiffs and the Government agree that Internet communication
is an abundant and growing resource.  Nor is Sable persuasive
authority, since the Supreme Court's holding in that case
addressed only one particular type of communication (dial-a-
porn), and reached no conclusions about the proper fit between
the First Amendment and telephone communications generally. 
Again, plaintiffs and the Government here agree that the Internet
provides content as broad as the imagination.

          3.  The Effect of the CDA and the Novel Characteristics
of Internet Communication
          Over the course of five days of hearings and many
hundreds of pages of declarations, deposition transcripts, and
exhibits, we have learned about the special attributes of
Internet communication.  Our Findings of fact -- many of them
undisputed -- express our understanding of the Internet.  These
Findings lead to the conclusion that Congress may not regulate
indecency on the Internet at all.  
          Four related characteristics of Internet communication
have a transcendent importance to our shared holding that the CDA
is unconstitutional on its face.  We explain these
characteristics in our Findings of fact above, and I only
rehearse them briefly here.  First, the Internet presents very
low barriers to entry.  Second, these barriers to entry are
identical for both speakers and listeners.  Third, as a result of
these low barriers, astoundingly diverse content is available on
the Internet.  Fourth, the Internet provides significant access
to all who wish to speak in the medium, and even creates a
relative parity among speakers.
          To understand how disruptive the CDA is to Internet
communication, it must be remembered that the Internet evolved
free of content-based considerations.  Before the CDA, it only
mattered how, and how quickly, a particular packet of data
travelled from one point on the Internet to another.  In its
earliest incarnation as the ARPANET, the Internet was for many
years a private means of access among the military, defense
contractors, and defense-related researchers.  The developers of 
the technology focused on creating a medium designed for the
rapid transmittal of the information through overlapping and
redundant connections, and without direct human involvement.  Out
of these considerations evolved the common transfer protocols,
packet switching, and the other technology in which today's
Internet users flourish.  The content of the data was, before the
CDA, an irrelevant consideration.
          It is fair, then, to conclude that the benefits of the
Internet to private speakers arose out of the serendipitous
development of its underlying technology.  As more networks
joined the "network of networks" that is the Internet, private
speakers have begun to take advantage of the medium.  This should
not be surprising, since participation in the medium requires
only that networks (and the individual users associated with
them) agree to use the common data transfer protocols and other
medium-specific technology.  Participation does not require, and
has never required, approval of a user's or network's content.
          After the CDA, however, the content of a user's speech
will determine the extent of participation in the new medium.  If
a speaker's content is even arguably indecent in some
communities, he must assess, inter alia, the risk of prosecution
and the cost of compliance with the CDA.  Because the creation
and posting of a Web site allows users anywhere in the country to
see that site, many speakers will no doubt censor their speech so
that it is palatable in every community.  Other speakers will
decline to enter the medium at all.  Unlike other media, there is
no technologically feasible way for an Internet speaker to limit
the geographical scope of his speech (even if he wanted to), or
to "implement[] a system for screening the locale of incoming"
requests.  Sable 492 U.S. at 125.
          The CDA will, without doubt, undermine the substantive,
speech-enhancing benefits that have flowed from the Internet.
Barriers to entry to those speakers affected by the Act would
skyrocket, especially for non-commercial and not-for-profit
information providers.  Such costs include those attributable to
age or credit card verification (if possible), tagging (if
tagging is even a defense under the Act[20]), and monitoring or
review of one's content. 
          The diversity of the content will necessarily diminish
as a result.  The economic costs associated with compliance with
the Act will drive from the Internet speakers whose content falls
within the zone of possible prosecution.  Many Web sites,
newsgroups, and chat rooms will shut down, since users cannot
discern the age of other participants.  In this respect, the
Internet would ultimately come to mirror broadcasting and print,
with messages tailored to a mainstream society from speakers who
could be sure that their message was likely decent in every
community in the country.
          The CDA will also skew the relative parity among
speakers that currently exists on the Internet.  Commercial
entities who can afford the costs of verification, or who would
charge a user to enter their sites, or whose content has mass
appeal, will remain unaffected by the Act.  Other users, such as
Critical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape, or even the ACLU, whose Web
sites before the CDA were as equally accessible as the most
popular Web sites, will be profoundly affected by the Act.  This
change would result in an Internet that mirrors broadcasting and
print, where economic power has become relatively coterminous
with influence.
          Perversely, commercial pornographers would remain
relatively unaffected by the Act, since we learned that most of
them already use credit card or adult verification anyway. 
Commercial pornographers normally provide a few free pictures to
entice a user into proceeding further into the Web site.  To
proceed beyond these teasers, users must provide a credit card
number or adult verification number.  The CDA will force these
businesses to remove the teasers (or cover the most salacious
content with cgi scripts), but the core, commercial product of
these businesses will remain in place. 
          The CDA's wholesale disruption on the Internet will
necessarily affect adult participation in the medium.  As some
speakers leave or refuse to enter the medium, and others
bowdlerize their speech or erect the barriers that the Act
envisions, and still others remove bulletin boards, Web sites,
and newsgroups, adults will face a shrinking ability to
participate in the medium.  Since much of the communication on
the Internet is participatory, i.e., is a form of dialogue, a
decrease in the number of speakers, speech fora, and permissible
topics will diminish the worldwide dialogue that is the strength
and signal achievement of the medium.
          It is no answer to say that the defenses and exclusions
of  223(e) mitigate the disruptive forces of the Act.  We have
already found as facts that the defenses either are not available
to plaintiffs here or would impose excessive costs on them. 
These defenses are also unavailable to participants in specific
forms of Internet communication.
          I am equally dubious that the exclusions of  223(e)
would provide significant relief from the Act.  The "common
carrier" exclusion of  223(e)(1), for example, would not
insulate America Online from liability for the content it
provides to its subscribers.  It is also a tricky question
whether an America Online chat room devoted to, say, women's
reproductive health, is or is not speech of the service itself,
since America Online, at least to some extent, "creat[es] the
content of the communication" simply by making the room available
and assigning it a topic.  Even if America Online has no
liability under this example, the service might legitimately
choose not to provide fora that led to the prosecution of its
subscribers.  Similarly, it is unclear whether many caching
servers are devoted "solely" to the task of "intermediate
storage".  The "vicarious liability" exclusion of  223(e)(4)
would not, for example, insulate either a college professor or
her employer from liability for posting an indecent online
reading assignment for her freshman sociology class.
          We must of course give appropriate deference to the
legislative judgments of Congress.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129;
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472-73 (Blackmun, J., concurring).  After
hearing the parties' testimony and reviewing the exhibits,
declarations, and transcripts, we simply cannot in my view defer
to Congress's judgment that the CDA will have only a minimal
impact on the technology of the Internet, or on adult
participation in the medium.  As in Sable, "[d]eference to a
legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry when First
Amendment rights are at stake."  Sable, 492 U.S. at 129 (citation
omitted).  Indeed, the Government has not revealed Congress's
"extensive record" in addressing this issue, Turner, 114 S. Ct.
at 2472 (Blackmun, J., concurring), or otherwise convinced me
that the record here is somehow factually deficient to the record
before Congress when it passed the Act.  

          4.  Diversity and Access on the Internet
          Nearly eighty years ago, Justice Holmes, in dissent,
wrote of the ultimate constitutional importance of the "free
trade in ideas":
               [W]hen men have realized that time
               has upset many fighting faiths,
               they may come to believe even more
               than they believe the very
               foundations of their own conduct
               that the ultimate good desired is
               better reached by free trade in
               ideas -- that the best test of
               truth is the power of the thought
               to get itself accepted in the
               competition of the market . . . .
Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J.,
dissenting).  
          For nearly as long, critics have attacked this much-
maligned "marketplace" theory of First Amendment jurisprudence as
inconsistent with economic and practical reality.  Most
marketplaces of mass speech, they charge, are dominated by a few
wealthy voices.  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418
U.S. 241, 248-50 (1974).  These voices dominate -- and to an
extent, create -- the national debate.  Id.  Individual citizens'
participation is, for the most part, passive.  Id. at 251. 
Because most people lack the money and time to buy a broadcast
station or create a newspaper, they are limited to the role of
listeners, i.e., as watchers of television or subscribers to
newspapers.  Id.
          Economic realities limit the number of speakers even
further.  Newspapers competing with each other and with (free)
broadcast tend toward extinction, as fixed costs drive
competitors either to consolidate or leave the marketplace.  Id.
at 249-50.  As a result, people receive information from
relatively few sources:
               The elimination of competing
               newspapers in most of our large
               cities, and the concentration of
               control of media that results from
               the only newspaper's being owned by
               the same interests which own a
               television station and a radio
               station, are important components
               of this trend toward concentration
               of control of outlets to inform the
               public.
                    The result of these vast
               changes has been to place in a few
               hands the power to inform the
               American people and shape public
               opinion.
Id. at 249.
          The Supreme Court has also recognized that the advent
of cable television has not offered significant relief from this
problem.  Although the number of cable channels is exponentially
greater than broadcast, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2452, cable imposes
relatively high entry costs, id. at 2451-52 (noting that the
creation of a cable system requires "[t]he construction of [a]
physical infrastructure").
          Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has resisted
governmental efforts to alleviate these market dysfunctions.  In
Tornillo, the Supreme Court held that market failure simply could
not justify the regulation of print, 418 U.S. at 258, regardless
of the validity of the criticisms of that medium, id. at 251. 
Tornillo invalidated a state "right-of-reply" statute, which
required a newspaper critical of a political candidate to give
that candidate equal time to reply to the charges.  Id. at 244. 
The Court held that the statute would be invalid even if it
imposed no cost on a newspaper, because of the statute's
intrusion into editorial discretion:
               A newspaper is more than a passive
               receptacle or conduit for news,
               comment, and advertising.  The
               choice of material to go into a
               newspaper, and the decisions made
               as to limitations on the size and
               content of the paper, and treatment
               of public issues and public
               officials -- whether fair or unfair
               -- constitute the exercise of
               editorial control and judgment.
Id. at 258.
          Similarly, in Turner, the Supreme Court rejected the
Government's argument that market dysfunction justified
deferential review of speech regulations for cable television. 
Even recognizing that the cable market "suffers certain
structural impediments", Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, the Court
could not accept the Government's conclusion that this
dysfunction justified broadcast-type standards of review, since
"the mere assertion of dysfunction or failure in a speech market,
without more, is not sufficient to shield a speech regulation
from the First Amendment standards applicable to nonbroadcast
media."  Id. at 2458.  "[L]aws that single out the press, or
certain elements thereof, for special treatment 'pose a
particular danger of abuse by the State,' and so are always
subject to at least some degree of heightened First Amendment
scrutiny."  Id. (citation omitted).[21]  The Court then eloquently
reiterated that government-imposed, content-based speech
regulations are generally inconsistent with "[o]ur political
system and cultural life":
               At the heart of the First Amendment
               lies the principle that each person
               should decide for him or herself
               the ideas and beliefs deserving of
               expression, consideration, and
               adherence.  Our political system
               and cultural life rest upon this
               ideal.  Government action that
               stifles speech on account of its
               message, or that requires the
               utterance of a particular message
               favored by the Government,
               contravenes this essential right. 
               Laws of this sort pose the inherent
               risk that the Government seeks not
               to advance a legitimate regulatory
               goal, but to suppress unpopular
               ideas or information or manipulate
               the public debate through coercion
               rather than persuasion.  These
               restrictions "rais[e] the specter
               that the Government may effectively
               drive certain ideas or viewpoints
               from the marketplace."

Id. (citation omitted).
          Both Tornillo and Turner recognize, in essence, that
the cure for market dysfunction (government-imposed, content-
based speech restrictions) will almost always be worse than the
disease.  Here, however, I am hard-pressed even to identify the
disease.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet has
achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory
marketplace of mass speech that this country -- and indeed the
world -- has yet seen.  The plaintiffs in these actions correctly
describe the "democratizing" effects of Internet communication: 
individual citizens of limited means can speak to a worldwide
audience on issues of concern to them.  Federalists and Anti-
Federalists may debate the structure of their government nightly,
but these debates occur in newsgroups or chat rooms rather than
in pamphlets.  Modern-day Luthers still post their theses, but to
electronic bulletin boards rather than the door of the Wittenberg
Schlosskirche.  More mundane (but from a constitutional
perspective, equally important) dialogue occurs between aspiring
artists, or French cooks, or dog lovers, or fly fishermen.
          Indeed, the Government's asserted "failure" of the
Internet rests on the implicit premise that too much speech
occurs in that medium, and that speech there is too available to
the participants.  This is exactly the benefit of Internet
communication, however.  The Government, therefore, implicitly
asks this court to limit both the amount of speech on the
Internet and the availability of that speech.  This argument is
profoundly repugnant to First Amendment principles.
          My examination of the special characteristics of
Internet communication, and review of the Supreme Court's medium-
specific First Amendment jurisprudence, lead me to conclude that
the Internet deserves the broadest possible protection from
government-imposed, content-based regulation.  If "the First
Amendment erects a virtually insurmountable barrier between
government and the print media", Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 259
(White, J., concurring), even though the print medium fails to
achieve the hoped-for diversity in the marketplace of ideas, then
that "insurmountable barrier" must also exist for a medium that
succeeds in achieving that diversity.  If our Constitution
"prefer[s] 'the power of reason as applied through public
discussion'", id. (citation omitted), "[r]egardless of how
beneficent-sounding the purposes of controlling the press might
be", id., even though "occasionally debate on vital matters will
not be comprehensive and . . . all viewpoints may not be
expressed", id. at 260, a medium that does capture comprehensive
debate and does allow for the expression of all viewpoints should
receive at least the same protection from intrusion.  
          Finally, if the goal of our First Amendment
jurisprudence is the "individual dignity and choice" that arises
from "putting the decision as to what views shall be voiced
largely into the hands of each of us", Leathers v. Medlock, 499
U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991) (citing Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15,
24 (1971)), then we should be especially vigilant in preventing
content-based regulation of a medium that every minute allows
individual citizens actually to make those decisions.  Any
content-based regulation of the Internet, no matter how benign
the purpose, could burn the global village to roast the pig.  Cf.
Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.

          5.  Protection of Children from Pornography
          I accept without reservation that the Government has a
compelling interest in protecting children from pornography.  The
proposition finds one of its clearest expressions in Mill, who
recognized that his exposition regarding liberty itself "is meant
to apply only to human beings in the maturity of their
faculties":
               We are not speaking of children or
               of young persons below the age
               which the law may fix as that of
               manhood or womanhood.  Those who
               are still in a state to require
               being taken care of by others must
               be protected against their own
               actions as well as against external
               injury.
John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 69 (Gertrude Himmelfarb ed., Penguin
Books 1982) (1859), cited in Harry Kalven Jr., A Worthy Tradition
54 (Jamie Kalven ed. 1988).
          This rationale, however, is as dangerous as it is
compelling.  Laws regulating speech for the protection of
children have no limiting principle, and a well-intentioned law
restricting protected speech on the basis of its content is,
nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.  Regulations that
"drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace" for
children's benefit, Simon & Schuster, 502 U.S. at 116, risk
destroying the very "political system and cultural life", Turner,
114 S. Ct. at 2458, that they will inherit when they come of age.
          I therefore have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act,
passed because Congress discovered that young girls had read a
front page article in the New York Times on female genital
mutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional.  Tornillo, 418
U.S. at 258.  Nor would a Novel Decency Act, adopted after
legislators had seen too many pot-boilers in convenience store
book racks, pass constitutional muster.  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383. 
There is no question that a Village Green Decency Act, the fruit
of a Senator's overhearing of a ribald conversation between two
adolescent boys on a park bench, would be unconstitutional. 
Perry Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S.
37, 45 (1983).  A Postal Decency Act, passed because of
constituent complaints about unsolicited lingerie catalogues,
would also be unconstitutional.  Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  In
these forms of communication, regulations on the basis of decency
simply would not survive First Amendment scrutiny.  
          The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than
print, the village green, or the mails.  Because it would
necessarily affect the Internet itself, the CDA would necessarily
reduce the speech available for adults on the medium.  This is a
constitutionally intolerable result.
          Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the
limits of conventional discourse.  Speech on the Internet can be
unfiltered, unpolished, and unconventional, even emotionally
charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a word, "indecent"
in many communities.  But we should expect such speech to occur
in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a
voice.  We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium
confers to ordinary people as well as media magnates.
          Moreover, the CDA will almost certainly fail to
accomplish the Government's interest in shielding children from
pornography on the Internet.  Nearly half of Internet
communications originate outside the United States, and some
percentage of that figure represents pornography.  Pornography
from, say, Amsterdam will be no less appealing to a child on the
Internet than pornography from New York City, and residents of
Amsterdam have little incentive to comply with the CDA.[22]
          My analysis does not deprive the Government of all
means of protecting children from the dangers of Internet
communication.  The Government can continue to protect children
from pornography on the Internet through vigorous enforcement of
existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography.  See
United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995).  As
we learned at the hearing, there is also a compelling need for
public education about the benefits and dangers of this new
medium, and the Government can fill that role as well.  In my
view, our action today should only mean that the Government's
permissible supervision of Internet content stops at the
traditional line of unprotected speech.
          Parents, too, have options available to them.  As we
learned at the hearing, parents can install blocking software on
their home computers, or they can subscribe to commercial online
services that provide parental controls.  It is quite clear that
powerful market forces are at work to expand parental options to
deal with these legitimate concerns.  More fundamentally, parents
can supervise their children's use of the Internet or deny their
children the opportunity to participate in the medium until they
reach an appropriate age.  See Fabulous, 896 F.2d at 788-89
(noting that "our society has traditionally placed" these
decisions "on the shoulders of the parent").

E.  Conclusion

          Cutting through the acronyms and argot that littered
the hearing testimony, the Internet may fairly be regarded as a
never-ending worldwide conversation.  The Government may not,
through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the most
participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet
deserves the highest protection from governmental intrusion.
          True it is that many find some of the speech on the
Internet to be offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace many
hear discordant voices that they regard as indecent.  The absence
of governmental regulation of Internet content has unquestionably
produced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts put
it with such resonance at the hearing:
               What achieved success was the very
               chaos that the Internet is.  The
               strength of the Internet is that
               chaos.[23]  

Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of
our liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the
unfettered speech the First Amendment protects. 
          For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the
CDA is unconstitutional on its face.

as the ALA.
     The eight counts of the amended complaint in this action
focus on the CDA's amendment to 47 U.S.C.  223, and do not
challenge the CDA's amendment of 18 U.S.C.  1462(c).

supporting and opposing plaintiffs' contentions.  Arguing in
favor of our granting the motions for preliminary injunction are
Authors Guild, American Society of Journalists and Authors, Ed
Carp, Coalition for Positive Sexuality, CONNECTnet, Creative
Coalition on AOL, Tri Dang Do, Feminists for Free Expression,
Margarita Lacabe, Maggie LaNoue, LoD Communications, Peter
Ludlow, Palmer Museum of Art, Chuck More, Rod Morgan, PEN
American Center, Philadelphia Magazine, PSINet, Inc., Eric S.
Raymond, Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, Don
Rittner, The Sexuality Information and Education Council of the
United States, Lloyd K. Stires, Peter J. Swanson, Kirsti Thomas,

motion are the Family Life Project of the American Center for Law
and Justice and a group consisting of The National Law Center for
Children and Families, Family Research Council, "Enough Is
Enough!" Campaign, National Coalition for the Protection of
Children and Families, and Morality in Media.
5. The Act does not define "telecommunications device".  By
Order dated February 27, 1996, we asked the parties to address
whether a modem is a "telecommunications device".  Plaintiffs and
the Government answered in the affirmative, and we agree that the
plain meaning of the phrase and the legislative history of the
Act strongly support their conclusion.  "Telecommunications"
under 47 U.S.C.  153(48) means "the transmission, between or
among points specified by the user, of information of the user's
choosing, without change in the form of content of the
information as sent and received."  The plain meaning of "device"
is "something that is formed or formulated by design and
usu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives,
experiment, and testing."  Webster's Third New International
Dictionary, 618 (1986).  Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thought
it would reach individual Internet users, many of whom still
connect through modems.  See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec. S8329-46
(daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen.
Coats).
     The resolution of the tension between the scope of
"telecommunications device" and the scope of "interactive
computer service" as defined in 47 U.S.C.  230(a)(2), see infra
note 6, must await another day.  It is sufficient for us to
conclude that the exclusion of  223(h)(1)(B) is probably a
narrow one (as the Government has argued), insulating an
interactive computer service from criminal liability under the
CDA but not insulating users who traffic in indecent and patently
offensive materials on the Internet through those services.
6. The statute at  509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add  230(e)(2),
which defines such a service as "any information service, system,
or access software provider that provides or enables computer
access by multiple users to a computer server, including
specifically a service or system that provides access to the
Internet and such systems operated or services offered by
libraries or educational institutions."
7. In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for a
temporary restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes "the
Department has a longstanding policy that previous such
provisions are unconstitutional and will not be enforced", and
that both President Clinton and General Reno "have made th[e]
point clear" that no one will be prosecuted under "the abortion-
related provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C.  1462(c)." 
Opposition at 19, n.11 (February 14, 1996).  In view of this
"longstanding policy", the Government contends there is no
realistic fear of prosecution and, so the argument goes, no need
for equitable relief.  Id.  In their post-hearing brief, the ACLU
plaintiffs inform us that in view of the Government's statement,
"they do not seek a preliminary injunction against the
enforcement of  1462(c)."  Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs
at 2 n.2.
8. The court again expresses its appreciation to the parties for
their cooperative attitude in evolving the stipulation.
9. The Government has not by motion challenged the standing of
any plaintiff in either case, and we harbor no doubts of our own
on that point, notwithstanding the Government's suggestion in a
footnote of its post-hearing brief.  See Defendants' Post-Hearing
Memorandum at 37 n.46 ("Plaintiffs' assertions as to the speech
at issue are so off-point as to raise standing concerns."). 
Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature and
content of the speech they contend is or may be affected by the
CDA, are set forth in paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30
through 103 of the parties' stipulation filed in these actions. 
These paragraphs will not be reproduced here, but will be deemed
adopted as Findings of the court.
10. It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroups
are the exception and unmoderated newsgroups are the rule.
11. The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to this
paragraph of the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.
12. Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forces
exist to limit the availability of material on-line that parents
consider inappropriate for their children.  Although the parties
sharply dispute the efficacy of so-called "parental empowerment"
software, there is a sufficiently wide zone of agreement on what
is available to restrict access to unwanted sites that the
parties were able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of
stipulated facts on the subject, which form the basis of
paragraphs 49 through 69 of our Findings of fact.  Because of the
rapidity of developments in this field, some of the technological
facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the time of
publication of these Findings.
13. This membership is constantly growing, according to the
testimony of Albert Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide Web
Consortium.  See also Defendants' Ex. D-167.
14. See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr.
Vezza.

15. From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longer
based upon the parties' stipulation, but upon the record adduced
at the hearings.  
16. Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet Engineering Task
Force, the group primarily responsible for Internet technical
standards, as well as other Internet-related associations
responsible for, among other things, the prevailing Internet
Protocols.  He is also associated with Harvard University.
17. Dr. Olsen chairs the Computer Science Department at Brigham
Young University in Provo, Utah, and is the recently-appointed
Director of the Human Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie-
Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
18. The term "information content provider" is defined in  509
of the CDA, at the new 47 U.S.C.  230(e)(3), as "any person or
entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation
or development of information provided through the Internet or
any other interactive computer service."
19. By "verification", we mean the method by which a user types
in his or her credit card number, and the Web site ensures that
the credit card is valid before it allows the user to enter the
site.
20. InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator of
content.  InterNIC and two other European organizations maintain
a master list of domain names to ensure that no duplication
occurs.  Creators of Web sites must register their domain name
with InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to choose
another name if the new Web site has the name of an already-
existing site.  InterNIC has no control over content on a site
after registration.
21. This paragraph and the preceding paragraph also illustrate
that a content provider might store its own material or someone
else's on a caching server.  The goal -- saving money and time --
is the same in both cases.
1. It also probably covers speech protected by the First
Amendment for some minors a well, because it fails to limit its
reach to that which is harmful for minors, an issue which it is
not necessary to decide in light of the other conclusions
reached.
2. See 141 Cong. Rec. S8342 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (letter
from Kent Markus, Acting Assistant Attorney General, U.S.
Department of Justice, to Senator Leahy).
1. If by virtue of the statute's authorization of expedited
review of its constitutionality, "on its face," 47 U.S.C.
561(a), we were strictly limited to looking at the words of the
statute, I would stand by my T.R.O. opinion.  However, in light
of the procedures which are required by 47 U.S.C.  561(a) and 28
U.S.C.  2284, and were followed by this court in establishing an
extensive record in this case, to ignore the evidence presented
would be to ignore what an action for injunctive relief is all
about.

  Section 561 reads as follows:

           561.  EXPEDITED REVIEW.
     (a) THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT HEARING --
Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any civil
action challenging the constitutionality, on its face,
of this title or any amendment made by this title, or
any provision thereof, shall be heard by a district
court of 3 judges convened pursuant to the provisions
of section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.

  Section 2284 states, in relevant part:

      2284.  Three-judge court; when required;
composition; procedure             
     (b) In any action required to be heard and
determined by a district court of three judges under
subsection (a) of this section, the composition and
procedure of the court shall be as follows:  . . .
   (3) A single judge may conduct all
proceedings except the trial . . . . He may
grant a temporary restraining order on a
specific finding, based on evidence
submitted, that specified irreparable damages
will result if the order is not granted,
which order, unless previously revoked by the
district judge, shall remain in force only
until the hearing and determination by the
district court of three judges of an
application for a preliminary injunction. . .
. 
2. Justice Kennedy argues in his opinion in Simon & Schuster v.
New York Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120 (1991), that "[t]he
regulated content has the full protection of the First Amendment
and this, I submit, is itself a full and sufficient reason for
holding the statute unconstitutional.  In my view it is both
unnecessary and incorrect to ask whether the state can show that
the statute 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interest
and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.'"  In the present
case, there is no disagreement that indecent and patently
offensive speech have the full protection of the First Amendment.
3. Not only has speech been divided up and given values -- with
some types of speech given little or no protection (obscenity,
fighting words, possibly commercial speech) -- but also, by court
decisions over the years, it has been decided that the content of
speech can indeed be regulated provided that the regulation will
directly and materially advance a compelling government interest,
and that it is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest in
the least restrictive manner.  However, any content-based
restriction must survive this most exacting scrutiny.  Sable, 492
U.S. 115; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989).
4. The plaintiffs have made facial challenges to the disputed
provisions of the CDA on grounds of both vagueness and
overbreadth.  The approach taken and language used in evaluating
a statute under each of these doctrines commingles, and
frequently is treated as a single approach.  "We have
traditionally viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically
related and similar doctrines."  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S.
352, 358 n.8 (1983) (citing Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385
U.S. 589, 609, (1967); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433
(1963)).  Even in cases where the court attempts to distinguish
these two doctrines, it acknowledges some interplay between them. 
See e.g. Village of Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,
Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, and n. 6 (1982).
          In addition, when discussing overbreadth, one cannot
avoid reference to the same language used to describe and apply
the strict scrutiny standard to constitutionally protected
activities.  See e.g. Sable, 492 U.S. at 131; Roberts v. Jaycees,
468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).  While there are occasional attempts to
argue for clear distinctions among these doctrines, see e.g.
Kolender, 461 U.S. at 369 (White, J., Rehnquist, J. dissenting),
such bright lines simply have not been, and most likely cannot
be, drawn in this area.
5. Comparing a different portion of each of these two provisions
suggests that different terms are not to be read to mean the same
thing.  As written, section (a) pertains to telecommunications
devices, and section (d) to interactive computer services.  While
we have not entirely resolved the tension between these
definitions at this stage, it has been established that these
terms are not synonymous, but are in fact intended to denote
different technologies.  This, together with the rule of
statutory construction set forth in Chief Judge Sloviter's
opinion, seems to suggest on the face of the statute that
indecent and patently offensive also are not to be read as
synonymous.
6. 18 U.S.C. 1461 states, "The term `indecent' as used in this
section includes matter of a character tending to incite arson,
murder or assassination."
7. Although the Supreme Court may rule on the vagueness question
in the context of cable television regulation in Alliance for
Community Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), currently
pending on certiorari before the Court, we will not defer
adjudication of this issue as the constitutionality of the term
in the cable context may not be determinative of its use in
cyberspace.
8. Each intentional act of posting indecent content for display
shall be considered a separate violation of this subsection and
carries with it a fine, a prison term of up to two years, or
both.  47 U.S.C.  223(a),(d) and Conf. Rep. at 189.
9. As I have noted, the unique nature of the medium cannot be
overemphasized in discussing and determining the vagueness issue. 
This is not to suggest that new technology should drive
constitutional law.  To the contrary, I remain of the belief that
our fundamental constitutional principles can accommodate any
technological achievements, even those which, presently seem to
many to be in the nature of a miracle such as the Internet.
1. By Order dated March 13, 1996, we asked the parties to submit
their views on questions regarding allocation of the burdens of
proof in these cases.  Since I believe that the outcome of these
cases is clear regardless of the allocation of proof between the
parties, none of my conclusions in this opinion requires me to
choose between the arguments that the parties have presented to
us.
2. Although I do not believe the statue is unconstitutionally
vague, I agree with Judge Buckwalter that the Government's
promise not to enforce the plain reach of the law cannot salvage
its overbreadth.  Even accepting the Government's argument that
prosecution of non-obscene pornography would be a "legitimate
application" of the CDA, City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451,
459 (1987), it is clear that the Act would "make unlawful a
substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct", id. 
As in Hill, the Government's circular reasoning -- that the law
is constitutional because prosecutors would only apply it to
those against whom it could constitutionally be applied -- must
fail.  See id. at 464-67.
3. Plaintiffs have argued that we may consider their challenge
under the standards governing both "facial" and "as-applied"
challenges.  That is, they suggest that we may pass judgment on
the decency of the plaintiffs' speech, even if we are unable to
conclude that the act is facially unconstitutional.  Surely this
procedural confusion arises out of the three opinions of the D.C.
Circuit in National Treasury Employees Union v. United States,
990 F.3d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003.
          I doubt that we could undertake an as-applied inquiry,
since we do not know the exact content of plaintiffs' speech. 
Indeed, it is impossible to know the exact content of some
plaintiffs' speech, since plaintiffs themselves cannot know that
content.  America Online, for example, cannot know what its
subscribers will spontaneously say in chat rooms or post to
bulletin boards.  In any event, I need not address this issue, in
the light of our disposition today.
4."Dial-a-porn" is a shorthand description of "sexually
oriented prerecorded telephone messages".  Sable, 492 U.S. at
117-18.
5. In turn, Pacifica's definition of indecency has its roots in
the Supreme Court's obscenity jurisprudence.  Indecency includes
some but not all of the elements of obscenity.  See, e.g.,
Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 113-14 n.4.
6. The reach of the two provisions is not coterminous, however. 
As we explain in the introduction to this Adjudication,  223(a)
reaches the making, creation, transmission, and initiation of
indecent speech.  Section 223(d) arguably reaches more broadly to
the "display" of indecent speech.  I conclude here only that both
sections refer to the identical type of proscribed speech.
7. At oral argument, counsel for the Government candidly
recognized that "there's nothing quite like this statute before",
and that the CDA's novelty raised some "legislative craftsmanship
problem[s]".  Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 81-82.  I believe
that my analysis here makes sense in the light of the legislative
history and the jurisprudence on which Congress relied in
enacting the CDA.  See Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.
8. The counterargument is that  223(e)(5)(A), when read
together with  223(e)(6), merely confers jurisdiction on the FCC
to prescribe the "reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions"
that count as defenses.  Congress employed a similar scheme for
dial-a-porn.  See Dial Information Servs., 938 F.2d at 1539
(citing 47 U.S.C.  223(b)(3)); Information Providers' Coalition,
928 F.2d at 871.
9. The play was "critically acclaimed and long-running in Los
Angeles area theaters".  Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC R. at 932.
10. Analytically, it makes sense that indecent speech has public
value.  After all, indecent speech is nevertheless protected
speech, see, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 126, and it must therefore
have some public value that underlies the need for protection. 
Obscenity, by contrast, has no public value, id. at 124, and thus
has no protection from proscription.
11. Internet technology undercuts the Government's argument that
the "in context" element of  223(a) and 223(d) would insulate
plaintiffs such as Critical Path from liability.  See, e.g.,
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 89-91.  A user who clicks on a
link in the Critical Path database (see Findings 33, 77-78) might
travel to a highly graphic page in a larger HTML document.  The
social value of that page, in context, might be debatable, but
the use of links effectively excerpts that document by
eliminating content unrelated to the link.
12. Moreover, because of the technology of Internet relay chat,
it would need to make this determination before it organized the
chat room, since it could not pre-screen the discussion among the
participants.  Thus, it would need to predict, in advance, what
the participants were likely to say.  The participants would need
to make a similar determination, unaided (I expect) by First
Amendment lawyers.
13. Testimony of April 12, 1996, at 235-36.
14. In this section I do not imply that the FCC has jurisdiction
to process Internet complaints in the same manner as it does for
broadcast.  The extent of the FCC's jurisdiction under the CDA is
a sticky question not relevant here.  See Senate Report at 190-
91, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 204.  Because the
administrative decisions cited above arose out of citizens'
complaints to the FCC, however, they provide a kind of surrogate
insight into the kinds of speech that citizens have charged as
indecent in the past.
15. See Finding of fact 81.  See also Symposium, Emerging Media: 
Technology and the First Amendment, 104 Yale L.J. 1613 (1995).
16. A narrow holding for this new medium also will not eliminate
the chill to plaintiffs, who could well stifle the extent of
their participation in this new medium while awaiting a future
iteration of the CDA.  Such a holding would also lead Congress to
believe that a rewritten CDA (using, for example, a "harmful to
minors" standard, see Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 202) would pass constitutional muster.  In my
view, a holding consistent with the novel qualities of this
medium provides Congress with prompt and clear answers to the
questions that the CDA asks.
17. The history of dial-a-porn regulation both before and after
Sable is tortuous, and involves the intervention of all three
branches of government.  I will not rehearse that history here,
deferring instead to the other courts that have recounted it.
See, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 118-23; Dial Information Serv., 938
F.2d at 1537-40; Information Providers Coalition, 928 F.2d at
870-73.
18. Sable is arguably not a decision about mass communication. 
Unlike Red Lion, Tornillo, or Turner, the Court in Sable reached
no conclusions about the proper fit between the First Amendment
and governmental regulation of the telephone.  The case also
includes no discussion of the technology of the telephone
generally.  The plaintiff in that case, a purveyor of dial-a-
porn, challenged the statute only with respect to that type of
content.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 117-18.  Thus, the Court's opinion
discussed only the "dial-in services".  Id. at 128.  Since every
telephone call at issue was, by definition, dial-a-porn, every
telephone call was, by definition, either obscene or indecent. 
Id. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).
          Here, however, plaintiffs represent forty-seven
different speakers (including educational associations and
consortia) who provide content to the Internet on a broad range
of topics.  The limited reach of the Sable holding renders it
inapt to the Internet communications of the plaintiffs in these
actions.
19. I note here, too, that we have found as a fact that
operation of a computer is not as simple as turning on a
television, and that the assaultive nature of television, see
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49, is quite absent in Internet use. 
See Findings 87-89.  The use of warnings and headings, for
example, will normally shield users from immediate entry into a
sexually explicit Web site or newsgroup message.  See Finding 88. 
The Government may well be right that sexually explicit content
is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the user, but there is
an immense legal significance to those few clicks.
20. In a May 3, 1996 letter to a three-judge court in the
Southern District of New York, John C. Keeney, Acting Assistant
Attorney General in the Criminal Division of the Department of
Justice, has advised that tagging would be "substantial evidence"
in support of a  223(e)(5)(A) defense:

          Under present technology, non-commercial
          content providers can take steps to list
          their site[s] in URL registries of covered
          sites, register their site[s] with the
          marketplace of browsers and blocking software
          (including listing an IP address), place
          their material in a directory blocked by
          screening software, or take other similarly
          effective affirmative steps to make their
          site[s] known to the world to allow the
          site[s] to be blocked.  Under present
          technology, it is the position of the
          Department of Justice that, absent
          extraordinary circumstances, such efforts
          would constitute substantial evidence that a
          content provider had taken good faith,
          reasonable, effective, and appropriate
          actions under the circumstances to restrict
          or prevent access by minors to the covered
          material.  The same would be true for tagging
          by content providers coupled with evidence
          that the tag would be screened by the
          marketplace of browsers and blocking
          software.

Letter of May 3, 1996 from Acting Assistant Attorney General John
C. Keeney to Hons. Denise L. Cote, Leonard B. Sand, and Jose A.
Cabranes, attached to Defendants' Motion for Leave to File
Supplemental Statement.  On May 8, 1996, the Government moved to
file the Kenney letter in this action, and we granted the motion
as unopposed the next day.
          The letter certainly raises more questions than it
answers.  I wonder, for example, whether it is consistent with
the plain language of the Act simply for content providers to
"make their site[s] known to the world" and thereby "to allow
[them] to be blocked", even though this form of notice alone
would not reduce the availability of indecent content.  Cf.
Senate Report at 178, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201 (noting that 
223(d) "applies to content providers who post indecent material
for online display without taking precautions that shield that
material from minors").  It is also an unanswered question
whether the Keeney letter would eliminate any of the CDA's chill,
since the Government acknowledged that the letter would not
prohibit a United States Attorney from taking a contrary position
in a particular prosecution.  See Defendants' May 9, 1996
Response to the May 8, 1996 Order of Court.  The letter also
fails to mention how users who participate in chat rooms,
newsgroups, listservs, and e-mail might take advantage of 
223(e)(5)(A).  Finally, it is undisputed that neither PICS nor
the hypothetical "-L18" tag are available to speakers using the
World Wide Web today, whom the Government has explicitly reserved
its right to prosecute should the CDA ultimately be found
constitutional.  See Stipulation and Order of February 26, 1996,
quoted supra.

21. Turner examined certain "must-carry" provisions under an
intermediate scrutiny, since those laws imposed incidental
burdens on speech but did not directly regulate content.  Turner,
114 S. Ct. at 2469.  The Court remanded the case to the district
