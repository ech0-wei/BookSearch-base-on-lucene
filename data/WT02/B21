<b>Improving the Lives of Children: An SED Primary Prevention Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F40012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will implement and assess interventions enabling schools to
provide
positively oriented instruction, curricula, and support services needed to prevent
students
receiving special education for emotional and behavioral problems from developing
serious
emotional disturbance (SED).<P>

METHOD:  The project will proceed over a 4-year period in three phases.  During
Phase 1
intervention refinement project staff will identify concerns and form working intervention
groups,
and identify and develop instrumentation and specific tracking procedures for target
students.  To
develop tracking procedures, staff will define students at risk for SED and describe a
set of
identifying predictors.  Staff will also collect baseline data for comparison groups. 
Phase 2
intervention implementation will focus on full implementation of various
multienvironment
interventions and on compiled data related to them.  Intervention efforts will include
screening
and identification of target groups including those currently receiving special education
services
(N=100) and students identified as at risk (N=100).  These students will come from
backgrounds
of poverty, live in violent neighborhoods, are likely to drop out of school, or are likely to
develop
high rates of school recorded behavior problems.  Two hours of observation will be
allotted for
each participating student, through four 30-minute periods.  In Phase 3 final follow-up
and
dissemination project staff will complete evaluation, report data relevant to the change
process,
pursue ways to continue some interventions that require financial resources beyond
what schools
can provide, and develop easy-to-read manuals on guidelines and strategies for
implementing
various interventions in other elementary schools to prevent SED among students with
emotional
and social problems. Additional training will be implemented for school personnel,
community
agency personnel, family members, and others to broaden project impact.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in an increase in the number of
least
restrictive environments, and in specific documents usable by policy makers.  This
project will
also improve prevention of SED among youth.<P>

<b>Project EXCELLENCE: Exceptional Children Enrolled  in the Least-Restrictive
Learning
Environments Made Notably Cost-Effective</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237B20025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project addresses the problem of mainstreaming for children and
youth with
emotional or behavioral disorders by: (1) obtaining waivers for the finance structure and
establishing alternative educational programs; and (2) developing, implementing, and
monitoring
individual student transition plans to least restrictive community environments during
the
implementation phase.<P>

METHOD:  A model planning process will be created, including the development of
alternative
funding patterns to encourage least restrictive environment placement, development of
a
transition
planning process, and creation of a transition planning document.  Four separate
record-keeping
documents will be maintained to grant administration, formative process assessment,
summative
objective evaluation, and individual student data.  Staff will design appropriate
interventions,
primarily ecological/behavioral, at the hospital, at participating schools, and in receiving
communities.  Appropriate Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) will be generated for
each
student, and parents and families will be involved in both the planning and
implementation of the
project.<P> 

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Written products documenting project activities and
results will
include a formal evaluation report, a more user-friendly replication guide, and articles by
project
staff to be submitted for publication in professional journals. Findings will also be
presented at
least one state-wide or national conference.<P>

<b>Investigation of the Institution-to-Community Transition Experiences of Adolescents
with
Emotional and Behavioral Disorders</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30049 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a follow-along investigation of the
institution-to-community
transition of adolescents with emotional and behavioral disorders (EBD), who have
been
incarcerated for their extreme antisocial behaviors.<P>

METHOD:  Data on roughly 300 to 400 adolescents with EBD will be gathered on their
release
from institutional facilities in the state of Oregon.  At referral, demographic, SES, level of
service,
and social skill rating forms will be completed on each person.  Between 3 and 9
interviews will
be administered to each individual by telephone at 6-month intervals.  Interview
questions will
pertain to subjects' vocational, educational, social, independent living, and general
community
adjustment.  Similar interviews will be administered to subjects' parent/guardian and
probation/parole officers.  Employment data will also be checked yearly with a
state-wide
database.  Data will then be examined using logistic regression techniques and LISREL
procedures to examine relationships among multiple predictor and outcome
constructs.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will establish baseline data on the adjustment
of
individuals exiting these institutions.  The participation of key state level administrators
is
expected to substantially augment dissemination plans.  By disseminating information
on the
findings and procedures employed in this project, the project hopes to instigate similar
projects in
other regions to improve the adjustment and quality of life among this population.<P>

<b>Life On The Outs - Qualitative Investigation of   Resilience</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50150 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/00<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct an intensive qualitative investigation of the
institution-to-community transition of adolescents with emotional and behavioral
disorders who
have been incarcerated in the two most secure juvenile correctional facilities in
Oregon.<P>

METHOD:  The research will seek to define the variables and events that differentiate
those
persons who leave the facilities and are successful in their transition efforts versus
those who are
not successful.  This process will contribute to the development and refinement of a
grounded
theory on resilience and its meaning in the transition experiences of this population. 
The project
will dovetail with and parallel a quantitative study already in process in which staff are
gathering
extensive data on the demographic characteristics and institutional and transitional
experiences
of
400-500 male and female adolescents from these facilities.  In Phase 1, staff will
investigate
childhood and adolescent experiences which contribute to resiliency by conducting a
life history
study of a sample of successful (employed, in school, no re-arrests) and unsuccessful
participants
from the quantitative project who have been out for 1 to 2 years already.  Throughout
the five
project years staff will continue with longitudinal investigations of their lives in the
community,
describing and contrasting the characteristics, experiences, and supports of those who
do or do
not succeed in transitioning into community life.  Phase 2 will be a focused exploration
of
specific
factors contributing to resilience, based on interviews with selected informants.  In
Phase 3, staff
will conduct systematic member checks to test the validity of theories of resilience with
respondents, interviewees, and knowledgeable others.  In Phase 4, staff will prepare
the study
products for dissemination.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Planned products include: a holistic model of the
construct of
resilience, based on the experiences and perspectives of participants themselves; and
a collection
of case studies illustrating the model and outlining the life histories of participants. 
Extensive
efforts will be made to disseminate results and products to other professionals, sites,
parents, and
consumer groups both regionally and nationally.<P>

<b>Project SERVE: Support for the Emotional,Residential, Vocational, and Educational
Needs
of Adolescents with EBD</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F50023 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will provide vocational services and service management to
adolescents
with emotional and behavioral problems, and will examine the effects of these
interventions on
both in-project and post-project experiences and outcomes among participants.<P>

METHOD:  Participating adolescents will be referred to the project and assigned a
Service
Coordination Specialist, who will work in conjunction with the adolescents and his/her
family to
plan and implement these services.  After exiting the school setting, services will be
arranged to
continue through a support network from different community agencies (including
vocational
rehabilitation, Job Training Partnerships, and Social Security offices).  A comprehensive
data
collection systems will be used to describe empirically the student and his or her
presenting
behaviors and the types and intensity of services that are provided to each participant.
To
examine
post-project impact of the services, participants will be tracked through individual
interviews and
review of extant state-level data sets on criminal and employment activities to profile
their
transition experiences.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities and projects will include
presentations
at
professional conferences, articles for submission to professional journals, and a project
newsletter
for quarterly distribution to education and human services agencies as well as parents,
teachers
and other stakeholders.  Upon the project's completion a monograph describing the
data
collection procedures, results, and service delivery recommendations will be
developed.<P>

<b>Designing Educational Support Teams through Interagency Networks for Youth with
Serious
Emotional Disturbance (DESTINY-SED)</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D30012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will provide training and support for families and professionals
in the
fields of education, social work, and mental health to improve services for children and
youth
with
serious emotional disturbances.<P>

METHOD:  In each of six communities, a research team from the Institute on Emotional
Disabilities will work with the middle schools and the local Child and Adolescent Service
Systems
Program (CASSP) teams to collaboratively identify staff development needs.  Staff
development
objectives will be phrased in terms of knowledge, skills, and strategies that project
participants
will be expected to use in their practice with professionals, students, and families. 
Particular
objectives will focus on the areas of collaboration among project participants and on
ways to
apply knowledge, skills, and strategies.  Student progress will be closely monitored
through data
on school attendance and involvement, social competence, and achievement, as well
by project
staff and teacher rating scales, in-school record reviews, and responses from
community agencies
and parents.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Staff development is expected to motivate and empower
participants to accomplish new goals in the workplace, and renew their commitment to
achieve
desirable outcomes for youth with serious emotional disturbances.  By focusing on
teachers and
students in the middle school years, the project intends to impact on students' social
and
academic
involvement in school and better prepare students for high school completion,
vocational
placements, and entry into productive adult living.<P>

<b>School Outcomes and Community Benefits for Minority Youth With Serious
Emotional
Disturbances: Synthesizing Research and Literature to Devise Practical Strategies for
Families
and Professionals</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will systematically review and synthesize key research findings
and
literature from related fields and communicate to schools and families what works,
rather than to
document past failures of the system, focusing on improvement of practice in the
schools in
relationship to school success and postschool benefits.<P>

METHOD:  The project will systematically synthesize literature and research respective
to needs,
characteristics, treatments and alternatives as they promote or inhibit successful
benefits and
outcomes among youth with serious emotional disturbances or emotional problems. 
These
syntheses will focus on: (1) individuals with emotional disabilities from minority
backgrounds;
(2)
optimal educational outcomes and social benefits; and (3) valid strategies that
professionals may
use to improve benefits and outcomes.  Staff members will identify strategies that
professionals
can use to improve the benefits and community outcomes for youth from minority
backgrounds
with behavioral disorders, and will identify strategies that families of youth with
behavioral
disorders can use to improve school participation and community outcomes for these
children
and
young adults.  Staff will achieve these objectives by pursuing a finite series of relevant
hypotheses
identified by a Constituency Resource Committee.  The literature base included to test
each
hypothesis will be evaluated using a Systematic Integrative Review, applying multiple
approaches
to synthesize and integrate quantitative, qualitative, and expository literature.  The
review will
permit comparison and compression of information drawn from published
research-based,
theory-based, practice-based, and case studies, and from literature available through
"fugitive
sources." Each potential literature source will be examined in terms of problem
formulation, the
quality and reliability of data or evidence collected, it's evaluation of the validity of
evidence
yielded, the replicability of interpretations of findings, the accuracy of interpretation, and
the
quality of presentation of findings.  The synthesized data will form the basis for
conclusions and
recommendations about needs, characteristics, benefits, outcomes, and justification for
recommending the use of potential strategies by professionals and families.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The review will yield a database comprised of a set of
synthesized
data elements relevant to each hypothesis which others may use to replicate both the
procedures
of the research and the viability of conclusions reached from the synthesis.<P>

BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will bring together individuals and organizations to plan,
develop, and
provide case management and professional services to children and youth with serious
emotional
disturbances (SED).<P>

METHOD:  In Phase I, the project will design and assess a comprehensive system of
education
and care.  Activities will include: (1) development of an interagency collaboration model
comprised of representatives from parents and the primary educational, social and
mental health
agencies in the community; (2) agreement on which students will be served, the
principles of
care,
and written joint agreements; (3) the implementation of a comprehensive needs
assessment of
children, family, and service providers and (4) the development of a plan of action to
design a
comprehensive system.  In Phase II, the system will be implemented and evaluated. 
The system
will be based on the principles of individualized care which emphasize unconditional
care,
intensive case management, wrap-around services, family involvement, and cultural
competence. 
The evaluation model will gather information in the areas of child status, family
involvement,
interagency collaboration, community-based services and demographic information.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A series of working papers will be developed which will
include
research reports, position papers, and other descriptions of products or activities carried
out by
staff members.  While these papers will be published eventually, they will initially be
disseminated
to professionals working with students with serious emotional disturbance.  Staff will
present
reports on project activities and findings at appropriate professional meetings.  Reports
of the
implementation and results of each evaluation component will be written and published
in
manual
style at the conclusion of the project.  These manuals will be disseminated to persons
on the
mailing list who request them.<P>

<b>Promoting Attention, Literacy, and Socialization (PALS) among Students with
Emotional/Behavioral Disorders </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will use Adaptive Peer Tutoring to enhance the task
engagement,
reading achievement, prosocial behavior and quality of generalized peer interactions,
social
status,
and degree of inclusion in mainstream settings for students with emotional/behavioral
disorders
(EBD). <P>

METHOD:  During the first year of this 3-year project, PALS staff will implement,
formatively
evaluate, and modify existing Adaptive Peer Tutoring methods to maximize their
feasibility and
efficacy for students with EBD.  In Year 2, staff will develop additional training
procedures
designed to extend participating students' capacity to explain difficult materials to peers
and to
develop prosocial interaction styles.  At this time, staff will also examine the added
value of this
component to existing Adaptive Peer Tutoring methods.  In Year 3, project staff will
develop
Adaptive Peer Tutoring further and explore its efficacy for helping students with EBD
make
successful adjustments to general education reading classes.  Staff members will
contrast typical
reintegration methods to those in which Adaptive Peer Tutoring is implemented in both
special
and regular education settings to facilitate the mainstreaming effort.  During each
project year,
participating teachers (N=20) of students with EBD will implement treatments with all
students
in
their classrooms and will identify study participants (N=120).  Classroom observations
during
Adaptive Peer Tutoring will be conducted to assess the fidelity of treatment.  Direct
observation
methodology will be employed during reading instruction to index task engagement and
prosocial
interactions.  Videotapes of generalization sessions will be coded to evaluate quality of
peer
interactions.  Staff will also use pre/post individual multidimensional assessments, peer
sociometric ratings, and questionnaires to monitor levels of student interaction and
achievement.
<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in modified Adaptive Peer Tutoring
methods that specifically maximize benefits and feasibility for students with EBD,
extended
Adaptive Peer Tutoring procedures designed to help students with EBD make
successful
transitions to general education, and a teacher training manual and video explaining the
implementation of these enhanced Adaptive Peer Tutoring methods with students with
EBD in
both special and mainstream reading instruction classes. <P>

reinforcement procedures for generalization of skill usage; and (2) peer tutoring in
reading and
comprehension skills.  The home-based component will include: (1) parent-child
activities and
monitoring schedules for increasing positive parent-child interaction and supervision;
and (2)
parent-led play/recreation groups for reinforcement of prosocial skills.  The third level
prevention
component will provide systematic functional assessment and analysis of environments
to
determine conditions maintaining resistant behaviors with consequent intervention for
behavioral
improvement, as well as liaison work with community-based agencies to facilitate family
services. 
The investigation will include three elementary school sites in an intensive
quality-controlled
program for 36 to 45 children, with a control group. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Expected outcomes include increased, positive adult and

<b>World of Difference: A Culturally-Competent Demonstration Model to Improve
Services for
Students with Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) and to Develop Prevention
Services for
Students with Emotional and Behavioral Problems </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237G50018 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to develop and demonstrate a collaborative
model of
culturally competent intervention and prevention services designed to address the
current gaps in
service delivery to students at risk and students with serious emotional disturbance
(SED). <P>

METHOD:  The project will establish four model classroom sites of students at risk of
having
SED and students with SED where the most successful collaborations among teachers,
paraprofessionals, mental health providers, students, and family members would be
replicated. 
Two classes will consist of approximately twelve 3rd - 5th grade Hispanic students
classified as
learning disabled and at risk for serious emotional disturbances.  The other two classes
will
consist
of approximately ten predominantly African-American 3rd-5th grade students already
classified
as
SED.  Tutors from San Francisco State University's Special Education Department
Minority
Outreach Program will provide tutoring, encouragement, support and mentoring to
students. 
Teachers, paraprofessionals, and tutor/mentors will receive intensive training and
resource
materials regarding the use of culturally competent instructional strategies and
curricula, as well
as training in use of student-centered instructional strategies designed to capitalize on
students'
diversity and individual strengths.  Family members will be provided with information
and
training
regarding mental health issues, learning disabilities and serious emotional
disturbances,
instructional practices, and ways in which families can provide emotional and academic
support
to
their children.  Onsite service and after-school consultant time will also be increased.  
<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project results will be disseminated to family members at
community meetings, while dissemination to mental health providers will take place in
the form
of
workshops to be coordinated with the professional development personnel of each
department. 
Further dissemination will be filtered through the school district-wide professional
development
system and channeled through collaborating institutions to reach beyond the immediate
target
population.<P>

<b>Qualitative Investigation of Effective Service Coordination for Children and Youth
with
Emotional and Behavioral Disorders </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50053 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  The project will examine parent perspectives on what constitutes effective
service
coordination.  Investigators will explore what happens for individual children and their
families
as
a result of effective service coordination that would not have occurred without such
support. <P>

METHOD:  Phase 1 of the project will include the facilitation of a focus group of 10 to
12
parents who are coordinators of local family support groups located throughout the
state.  Results
of the focus group will be used to develop the next phase of data collection.  Phase 2
will consist
of in-depth semi-structured interviews with 8 to 12 parents who have children with
emotional or
behavioral disorders.  Each parent will nominate the professional they perceive as
being the most
helpful in providing service coordination, after which each of these professionals will be
interviewed by research staff.  The coding of interview transcripts, comparisons of
parent and
professional perceptions, and identification of categorical systems each parent and
child is
involved in will be used to indicate which school and agency documents to review. 
Data
analysis
will proceed concurrently with data collection, and will be used to influence future data
collection. 
Phase 3 will consist of member checks to test the validity of emerging theories of
effective
service
coordination.  Phase 4 will consist of the preparation and dissemination of project
findings. 
Emerging theories of effective service coordination will be documented in this stage.
<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings will be disseminated in the form of presentations
at
conferences and submission of articles to professional journals.  Dissemination will take
place
across the disciplines of education, social services, juvenile justice, and child and
adolescent
mental health. <P>

<b>Project SUCCESS: Preventing the Development of SED Among Children with
Emotional
and Behavioral Problems </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F40022 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to conduct research into the prevention of
the
development of Serious Emotional Disturbance (SED) in elementary school students
with
behavioral and emotional problems through intervention based on multidisciplinary
literature.
<P>
METHOD:  In the first of 4 project years, staff will finalize the case study "best
practices" theory
and scenario, develop the case study protocol and pilot the protocol.  The pilot test will
include
interviews with kindergarten teachers and the review of specific documents for
relevance.  Staff
will then plan and conduct inservice training for participating teachers and other school
personnel. 
During this year, staff will also screen students in each participating school, collect and
analyze
data, evaluate and manage the project, and work to collaborate with other SED
projects.  During
the following 3 project years, staff will conduct assessments of family needs and
strengths of
families of at-risk children, and will conduct functional assessments through interviews. 
Staff
will
ask teachers for their perceptions of the environmental conditions under which at-risk
children in
their classes display desirable or undesirable behaviors.  Interviewed teachers will
begin testing
hypotheses developed on the bases of functional assessment interviews.  Staff will then
develop
Family Service Plans (FSPs), and implement the educational child-centered
components and the
family-focused components.  Once FSPs have been implemented, staff will collect and
analyze
case study data using the case study protocol developed in Year 1, and analyze school
records/accumulative folders for at-risk children in grades 1 and 2.  Staff will also survey
comparison schools about identification of SED in 1st and 2nd grade children, and will
collect
data on personal and social attributes on the Student Self-Concept Scale (SSCS),
Social Skills
Rating System (SSRS), Classroom Behavior Inventory (CBI), and peer ratings and
nominations
(PRN).  Finally, staff will disseminate results, and work further to collaborate with other
Office
of
Special Education (OSEP) projects. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project SUCCESS will result in a validated model for: (1)
identifying students with such serious emotional and behavioral problems that they are
at risk for
SED; (2) conducting functional assessments of at-risk children; (3) developing
classroom
interventions; (4) coordinating multiple services based on family strengths/needs; and
(5)
ensuring
the delivery of culturally competent services to students and their families.<P>

<b>Developing Interagency Collaboration Skills for Transition of SED Students to Less
Restrictive Environments </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D20006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/04/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  1/03/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate the
effects of a
training program to develop knowledge, skills and strategies for collaboration between
education
and social service personnel in the transition of 16 students with serious emotional
disturbance
(SED) students to less restrictive educational settings. <P>

METHOD:  A competency-based training program will be developed and implemented
with 20
regular education, special education, related services, and social services personnel. 
During each
training session, material and concepts will be illustrated with videotaped vignettes,
practice
exercises will be presented for role playing, and participants will view video playbacks
of
examples of their positive performance.  The program will then evaluate the
effectiveness of
these
staff development methods in promoting acquisition of collaboration skills and the
generalization
of those skills during interagency team meetings to coordinate services for the transition
of
students with SED.  In addition, the program will assess outcomes of collaboration on
improved
services and on professionals' motivation and sense of empowerment. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to directly providing services to students with
SED,
the program will contribute to a greater understanding of the knowledge, skills, and
strategies
underlying effective collaboration.  Project findings will be disseminated via reports to
consumer
groups, publication of articles and a multimedia training package, and a conference
sponsored by
the Devereux Foundation.<P>

<b>Collaborative Responsibility Empowering School Teams (CREST) </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D30069 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/10/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will test the value of the CREST model as an effective
school-based
approach to training school and community staff to meet the needs of students with
serious
emotional disturbance (SED) and behavior disorders.<P>

METHOD:  The CREST Project is a comprehensive 3-year program to support the total
school
staff of 21 schools in developing and using knowledge and skills to respond to all
students in a
constant and predictable manner.  The purpose of the project is to enhance and
promote students'
growth and well-being and allow students with serious emotional and behavior
problems to
remain in their community schools.  Major training components support school staff in
using
community and school resources in the following fields of focus: (1) developing and
implementing
school-wide discipline policies and procedures; (2) teaching and maintaining positive
classroom
behavior and social skills; (3) designing, implementing and evaluating interventions for
students
with SED; (4) developing ongoing support systems for the school model to ensure
refinement
and
maintenance as school ecology changes. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will use descriptive methods to document the
development of each school's CREST program as they refine and maintain the model
over time. 
These descriptions will then provide the basis for further research into the factors that
help
schools sustain the ability to meet the needs of students with a wide range of
behavioral and
emotional differences. <P>

<b>Project Community Approach to Improving Child Success (Project CAICS) </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237G50045 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will create a comprehensive program to address the problem
of unequal
distribution of children with behavior problems or serious emotional disturbance (SED)
to
special
education classes through a combination of models based on systems theory. <P>

METHOD:  Project CAICS will work with three groups of students: (1) those students at
any
grade or level who are classified as seriously emotionally disturbed based upon a
thorough Child
Study Team assessment; (2) those students identified by individual schools in grades
K-8 as part
of their ongoing search for improved effectiveness with all children; and (3) those
students
whose
background suggests they are at risk of developing SED as they progress through
school.  The
project will intervene with these students by assisting regular education teachers to
adopt specific
techniques and strategies, assisting building administrators in addressing school
environmental
problems that help to trigger negative behaviors, and training staff in basic techniques
to reduce
cross-cultural misunderstandings.  The project will also work with pre-high school
programs to
institute curricular and instructional approaches to teaching all students the skills
necessary to
succeed in school.  The community will support this approach by coordinating and
expanding
community activities which foster the development of peaceful and cooperative conflict
resolution
skills.  The community and the school will jointly develop the details of project actions
through a
set of advisory panels.  Each participating teacher will receive staff development and
training
over
an eight-month period to reinforce learning of both recommended techniques and their
underlying
philosophy.  This component will directly seek to reform the institutional culture of
participating
schools relative to the population of students whose behavior has been a major
concern for years.
<P> 

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the project's conclusion, staff expect to find fewer
students
classified as SED due to emotional and behavior reasons which are not deeply rooted
in factors
beyond the control of the family.  This will translate to less restrictive learning
environments for
more students, fewer discipline problems in the schools, and a lower operating cost for
special
education programs. <P>

<b>Comparing Experiential Inservice and On-site Consultation to Increase Inclusionary
Practices for Students with SED</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237D30045 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to compare two unique approaches to
increasing the
skills and applications of interventions for effective inclusion of students with serious
emotional
disturbance (SED) in regular education classrooms. <P>

METHOD:  In this 3-year study, personnel from 24 school districts will be trained
through a
combination of experiential inservice training and on-site consultative support provided
by staff
from an approved private school for children with SED.  Participating school districts will
be
required to identify teams of three district personnel including a regular education
teacher,
special
education teacher, and related services personnel.  Districts will be randomly assigned
to one of
three conditions (Experiential Inservice/Immediate Consultation; Experiential
Inservice/Delayed
Consultation; and Wait-List Control Group.)  Outcomes measures repeated at specific
points of
the study will include quantitative and qualitative measures of content and process. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of this project are expected to provide empirical
examinations of training methods that may be possible for increased collaboration
between other
approved private schools and public school districts. Additionally, the project should
provide
careful analysis of the potential impact of such training methods on the knowledge,
skills, and
attitudes of school personnel working within regular education settings.<P>

<b>Children and Youth at Risk of Developing Serious Emotional Disturbance                  
       
(Project Impact) </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H237G50029 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will provide a community-based program focused on
preventing and
treating children with serious emotional disturbance (SED) in a culturally competent
manner,
using families as a key component. <P>

METHOD:  Project Impact will target approximately 50 predominantly African-American
students, some of whom are in special education classes, between the ages of 12 and
15, who are
exhibiting dysfunctional behaviors and are considered to have SED or are at risk for
SED. 
During
the planning phase, needs and strengths will be determined through the use of
community forums
involving students, families, service providers, community educators, leaders, and
businesses,
and
by surveying families and students regarding what they view as their own most
important needs. 
Project staff will identify community resources and individuals that are willing and able
to
provide
services to children with SED and their families.  Teachers and project staff will be
provided
with
training and staff development focusing on cultural sensitivity, and culturally competent
assessment instruments will be developed to help evaluate children showing signs of
SED and
their families.  In order to increase access to and utilization of mental health services,
location of
services, service providers, services provided, service hours, and outreach to the
community by
providers will be closely examined.  Project staff will ensure that during initial meetings
with
children and families, service providers stress the role and importance of the family in
the design
and implementation of the services the child will receive.  Project Impact will train and
utilize
family advocates from the community to help families prepare for these initial meetings. 
Direct
service methods and interventions that are planned include: recognition of and
intervention in
social problems; group therapy; family-focused therapy; in-home services; crisis
intervention and
problem solving services; didactic and educational approaches; community-level
interactions;
and
appreciation and recognition of cultural issues and problems. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  By collaboratively creating and implementing culturally
competent services designed to prevent and treat SED in African-American children,
this project
will prevent future costs by enabling families to care for their children and access
appropriate
services, helping prevent and reduce out-of-home placement costs.  Through the
Easter Seals
network and the Wayne County Regional Educational Service Agency, staff will be able
to
actively disseminate project information using inservice training, newsletters, meetings,
and
other media.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H237F50028 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assist students in developing the interpersonal skills
necessary to
manage their own conflicts through a school-based conflict resolution/peer mediation
program
with community and family linkages. <P>

METHOD:  In the first year of the program, staff will work collaboratively with middle
school
professionals, parents, and community representatives to: (1) develop a curriculum; (2)
train
school professionals and students in the curriculum and its implementation; (3) access,
develop,
and validate data collection instruments; and (4) establish data collection programs. 
The conflict
resolution/peer mediation (CR/PM) program will also be piloted in this year.  During the
second
year, staff will fully implement the CR/PM program in two treatment schools and use
two
matched middle schools as delayed treatment or control, while also seeking
opportunities for
impact through parent and community groups.  In the third year, staff will fully
implement the
CR/PM program in the two delayed treatment schools and monitor the program in the
original
treatment schools as they assume full responsibility for its implementation, while
continuing
involvement in home and community-based settings.  During the fourth year of the
project, staff
will collect data in all four schools as the delayed treatment schools disengage from
project
personnel and continue to collect generalization data on all high school students who
graduated
from the four middle schools. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide a model for future research in the
area
by providing a theoretical base as a model, a validated curriculum and training protocol
for
teachers and student mediators, implementation protocols, validated data collection

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and demonstrate a model to recruit and train
natural
paraprofessional caregivers from the community to support teachers and parents in
creating
school and family environments that foster the psychosocial and intellectual
development of
Native Hawaiian students with or at risk for serious emotional disturbances (SED). <P>

METHOD:  Phase I of the process will involve building and maintaining a team of
stakeholders
with a common vision for a seamless system of culturally competent and
nondiscriminatory
services.  Team members will be recruited based on the criteria that they have strong
connections
to the Native Hawaiian community and have expressed a desire to help it address its'
problems. 
Phase II will employ a five-step framework to guide team members through review and
discrepancy analysis of desired and existing services: (1) team members will explore
and
determine outcomes expected of students following completion of their educational
programs;
(2)
team members will review educational and related services proven successful in
contributing to
these outcomes for minority group students; (3) team members will review current
practices with
a focus on their cultural competency and efficacy for Native Hawaiian students; (4)
team
members
will decide what current practices need to be improved, and how; and (5) team
members will
analyze how identified skills and behaviors can best be imparted to both professionals
and
natural
caregivers.  In Phase III, project staff will launch the implementation of innovations and
recommended improvements in training and services. It is anticipated that the resulting
natural
caregiver training program will last for 11 months with a strong emphasis on field
activities and
practice. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop curricula for natural caregivers
and
professionals; evaluation reports; a replication package; and journal articles and
conference
presentations.  Expected results for Native Hawaiian students with or at risk for SED
include a
decrease in proportions of students identified with SED, improved school attendance
and
performance, lower dropout rates, greater family involvement in service planning and
delivery,
increased satisfaction with services, decreases in inappropriate behaviors, improved
self-concept
and self-esteem, and higher rates of achieving IEP goals. <P>

<b>Multistage Assessment of Aggressive Behavior   </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N30025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will implement and evaluate a multistage, multivariate
assessment
protocol for identifying variables motivating aggressive behavior problems exhibited by
students
with serious emotional disturbances (SED). <P>

METHOD:  Key factors hypothesized as contributing to aggressive behavior will include:
a
social
skills deficit; positively or negatively reinforcing consequences; deficits in the cognitive
processing
of social stimuli; and environmental deficits.  The first project phase will implement the
multistage,
multivariate study involving 150 children with SED, incorporating screening measures
and a
comprehensive assessment of variables associated with aggressive behavior.  In
Phase 2 the
program will develop appropriate interventions based on the assessment information. 
These
interventions should yield information on the validity of assessment procedures and
shed light on
the interaction between key hypotheses of the functional model.  Four intervention
studies using
single-case methodology will be employed. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project methodology and results will be described in
papers for
publication to research-oriented journals.  Inservice workshops and consultation
activities will be
provided to promote dissemination to practitioners, as will a comprehensive report of
project
findings.<P>

<b>Auditory Characteristics of Children with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50076 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine whether hearing sensitivity of children with autism
differs
from that of children who are normally developing.  The investigators will assess whether
children
with autism experience greater hypo- or hypersensitivity to auditory stimuli than children who
are
normally developing.  The project will also establish whether traditional behavioral audiometric
techniques are practical and reliable in the audiologic assessment of this population.<P>

METHOD:  Three basic experiments are planned.  Experiment I examines the hearing sensitivity
of children with autism as compared to a control group of children who are normally developing
matched by race, gender and developmental age with the experimental group.  A test battery of
appropriate behavioral and electrophysiological audiologic measures will be employed. 
Experiment II is designed to determine whether children with autism demonstrate excessive
hypo-
or hypersensitivity as compared to a matched control group.  Observers will view videotapes of
children listening to various auditory stimuli and rate the subjects on a scale of attentiveness. 
Experiment III will examine the practicability and replicability of traditional behavioral
audiometric tests used with children with autism.  For Experiments I and II, researchers will
utilize 20 subjects who have been diagnosed with childhood autism, as well as 20 children who
are normally developing.  In Experiment III, these 40 subjects will be reassessed to determine
test/re-test reliability of the behavioral audiometric procedures.  Analysis of variance and basic
t-tests will be used to evaluate differences between the groups in auditory measures.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from these experiments will be disseminated through
presentations at state and national conferences attended by speech-language pathologists,
audiologists, educators, and special educators.  Results will also be published in refereed journals
and the project staff will provide consultant services for regional and local special education
personnel.<P>

<b>Improving Language Learning Disabilities using Naturalistic Teaching Procedures</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30070 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This study will experimentally test the efficacy of integrating language and speech
intelligibility training using naturalistic procedures for students with severe disabilities in full
inclusion settings.<P>

METHOD:  In the first project year, staff will carefully evaluate efficacy of targeting improved
sound production during naturalistic language teaching and directly compare results to baseline
levels of training implemented using traditional pull-out, analogue procedures with settings held
constant across training procedures.  In years 2 and 3 the naturalistic conversation training will
be
provided as an integral part of the regular language curriculum and comparisons on social
validation assessments of children's language and social gains will be obtained in integrated
school, community, and home settings in order to determine whether naturalistic and analogue
drill-based procedures differ with regard to generalization of targeted structures to various social
contexts and with regard to any differences in impact on social skills and disruptive
behavior.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  These studies will be directly replicated in the Nashville
Metropolitan School District in Tennessee and the Santa Barbara County Schools in California. 
Teaching improved speech intelligibility using naturalistic conversation training is expected to
prove highly effective in training generalized speech production skills; in turn, this will lead to
rapid and generalized improvements in language and social skills as well as reductions in
disruptive behavior among students with severe disabilities.  The naturalistic procedures explored
are also expected to prove significantly more cost-effective than existing pull-out models.<P>

<b>Expanding Behavioral Momentum: Linking High-Probability Requests and Peer Interactions
to
Promote Skill Acquisition and Generalization in Young Children with Severe
Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30089 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will expand previous work in behavioral momentum by embedding the
high-probability request sequence into peer social interactions, then using these sequences to
promote social, motor, communication, and self-help skills.<P>

METHOD:  Participants in the research will be young children with severe disabilities.  Across
the
various studies the children will be identified as: (1) socially withdrawn or isolate; (2)
experiencing substantial motor impairments that limit their abilities to reach, grasp, manipulate
objects, maintain head control or move through space; and (3) lacking in expressive
communication systems, and/or lacking functional and important self help skills.  Observational
research methods combined with a series of multiple baseline designs will be used to examine
and
evaluate the effects of the momentum interventions.  Outcomes measured across the series of
studies will include each participant's performance of high and low probability requests
including:
(1) social interactions; (2) motor actions; (3) communication responses; and (4) self-help
skills.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of individual studies will be used to develop an
empirically-based, socially validated curriculum that can be used by professionals and parents to
teach children with severe disabilities across settings and developmental domains. 
Dissemination
activities planned include manuscripts describing research results for publication in professional
journals, conference presentations, employment of the Educational Resource Information Center
(ERIC), and a training manual to facilitate replication.<P>

<b>Self-Managed Exercise and Stereotypy Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N30001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study both the relationship between exercise and aberrant behavior
and the methods by which persons with severe disabilities can self-manage exercise routines.
<P>

METHOD:  Across three years, approximately 20 students, ranging in age from 10 to 21 years
and receiving services as severely mentally retarded or autistic, will attend exercise sessions, four
to five times weekly as part of their school program.  Modes of exercise will include electronic
treadmills, exercycles, and walking.  Measures will be maintained on amount and types of
exercise, level of independence on various components of exercise routines, heart rate during
exercise, resting heart rate, frequency and duration of aberrant activity, and proportion of time in
behavior states.  Participants will also receive formal cardiovascular assessments and a
field-based
treadmill test twice yearly.  Analyses of daily behavioral measures and pre/post fitness measures
will be compared.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project has the potential to contribute to broad areas of
interest, including: theoretical and applied study of aberrant behavior; implementation of
self-managed fitness routines for persons with severe disabilities; the development of reliable
cardiovascular fitness assessments, and the long-term effects of exercise and increased fitness on
behavior and behavior states.  Project findings, strategies and methodology will be disseminated
via papers for publication, presentations at national conferences, and workshops and other
inservice training opportunities.<P>

<b>Systematic Instruction of Persons with Profound Disabilities (Project SIPP)</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40115 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This collaborative effort between the University of Georgia and Gwinett County
Public Schools will study the effectiveness of instructional strategies for students with profound
cognitive disabilities.  The project will study more-to-least prompts and graduated guidance, and
to develop a manual for service providers on effective instructional strategies for students with
profound cognitive disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will be students with profound cognitive disabilities who presently attend
integrated school programs.  Four to six students will be included in each investigation.  Data
will
be collected by the students' teachers under the supervision of project staff.  A multiple baseline
or
multiple probe design will be used in the investigations.  Data will be collected on acquisition,
fluency, generalization in both instructional and home environments, and maintenance of the
objectives. Data collected will be type and number of prompts given, frequency of correct
independent responses, trials to criterion, errors to criterion, instructional time to criterion,
response latency, response duration, and criterion for mastery.  Staff will select participating
students, sites, and teachers, conduct analyses within activities for selection of basic
developmental skills to be taught, train teachers and implement experimental procedures,
interview parents to ascertain if the child has increased his or her level of partial participation in
family routines, and disseminate results.  Staff will then develop a manual that describes: (1) the
results of investigations; (2) the effectiveness of the strategies; (3) considerations in choosing
prompts and reinforcing contingencies; (4) variables for deciding when to change prompts; and
(5) considerations for the generalization of skills.  The manual will also describe the results of
generalization probes into the students' homes.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in a module summarizing investigation
results for special education teachers that will provide a format for faculty to teach teacher
trainees relevant information about effective instruction for students with profound cognitive
disabilities. Staff will also develop a manual that will help special education teachers teach these
students. <P>

<b>The Influence of Real-Time Frequency Transposition on the Development and Refinement
of
Skills of Articulation in Severely and Profoundly Hearing Impaired Children</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023A50064 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will compare the influence of real-time frequency transposition with
that
of conventional hearing aids in the development and/or refinement of articulation skills among
children with severe to profound hearing loss.<P>

METHOD:  This study will compare the development and refinement of articulation skills
among
two groups of children who possess nearly equivalent degrees of severe to profound hearing loss.
A control group will utilize appropriate conventional amplification to compensate for their
hearing
loss, while the experimental group utilizes real-time frequency transposition.  In addition, both
groups will undergo conventional individual articulation therapy.  Pre-, interim-, and post-
assessments of articulatory competence will be measured by experienced speech-language
pathologists, followed by statistical treatment to assess the relative strengths of association
between changes in articulation versus the type of amplification and four other variables.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be prepared for publication in refereed
journals serving the speech-language pathology and audiology communities.  Presentations will
be
prepared for state and national meetings of speech-language and audiology professional
organizations as well.<P>

<b>Effects of Social Interactive Strategies on Early Social-Communicative Skills of Children
with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50032 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate a training package designed to facilitate the spontaneous
use of early social-communicative skills among children with autism in natural classroom
environments.<P>

METHOD:  This project will utilize a multiple-baseline design across participants with
generalization probes to evaluate the effects of the interactive training package.  Four children
with autism who are identified as displaying absent or poor development of eye contact, joint
attention, and imitation will be selected from children with disabilities enrolled in early
intervention or public school programs.  All dependent and independent variables will be
recorded
using an event recording procedure of the Multiple Option Observation System for Experimental
Studies.  Direct observation data will be analyzed in terms of change in mean, level, trend
direction and stability, latency of behavior change, and percentage of data overlap between
experimental conditions through visual inspection of data which will be plotted in a time-lagged
fashion across participants.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include inservice training,
workshops, and technical assistance to allow the practical application of instructional procedures
among practitioners and families.  In addition, project procedures and findings will be
disseminated widely through publications in relevant journals and presentations at professional
conferences.  The identification of a training package that promotes early social-communicative
skills will be a major contribution to the literature on autism.<P>

<b>A Longitudinal Study of Generalization and Maintenance in Integration Settings for
Students with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30055 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will continue previous investigations of procedures for mainstreaming
and integration of children with autism. <P>

METHOD:  Project objectives include: (1) longitudinal ecobehavioral analysis of existing
integration programs for students with autism including identification of successful components
and/or weaknesses; (2) building upon these findings to carefully plan generalization studies to
increase integration time and success; (3) replication studies for effective generalization
strategies
with follow-up; (4) pilot studies in middle schools including environmental assessments,
integration, and generalization studies.  These goals have been designed to extend current
integration technology, to expand the knowledge base to include generalization procedures, to
investigate self-monitoring and continue documentation of peer-involved activities in integrated
environments, to provide middle school demonstrations, to monitor program effects in the areas
of academic, social and behavioral competence for students with autism and their peers, and to
disseminate findings to improve the quality of life for all students.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  These studies and databases will provide a much needed
evaluation of current and progressively improving integration technology.  Continuation of
current research objectives is required to define a model, determine variables congruent with
successful implementation, provide additional strategies to the knowledge base, address the issue
of generalization of procedures, determine long-term effects and outcomes, and explore

<b>Project Reading ABC: An Alternative Reading Assessment Battery for Children with Severe
Speech and Physical Impairments</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023F50011 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/96 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assemble an interdisciplinary team of experts in assessment,
literacy,
and severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI) to systematically develop alternative reading
assessments, including an alternative reading assessment battery for school-aged children with
SSPI.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will be school-aged children with SSPI as well as nondisabled peers
matched for gender, race, native language, and developmental reading abilities. Children with
SSPI will be sampled from assessment centers and concentrated instructional programs in
Chicago, Illinois (N=15), Denver, Colorado (N=30), Plattsburgh, New York (N=10), Chapel
Hill,
NC (N=30), and Durham, NC (N=40).  Assessment battery development will be initiated with
the
reading comprehension subtest.  In Phase I, the research team will validate the existence and
importance of a construct (i.e., knowledge, strategy, attitude) to be assessed by a particular
subtest, review existing assessments of that construct for typically developing readers, and
consult
with reading and disability assessment authorities.  In Phase II, the team will seek to develop
prototypes of alternative ways to assess the construct for children with SSPI that have acceptable
reliability.  In Phase III, the team will seek to answer questions about the construct and predictive
validity of the alternative assessments by comparing performance of nondisabled children on
alternative and more traditional measures of the construct.  In Phase IV, when the alternative
reading assessment battery has demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity, the team will
strengthen the case for validity of the alternative assessments across children of differing
abilities,
both within and between multiple measures. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  While the assessment battery itself will be the primary product of
this project, plans for disseminating project findings include: research reports to be published
through the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies; peer-reviewed journal publications in
literacy and disability journals; newsletter and bulletin board system articles; conference
presentations; oral presentations in workshops, guest lectures, and courses conducted by staff of
the CLDS; and publication, marketing, and distribution of the test battery itself by
Communication
Skill Builders within the Psychological Corporation.<P>

<b>Rethinking Social Interventions for Young Children with Autism</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40113 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will extend knowledge of environmental and other influences on the
social behavior of students with autism by incorporating information on naturally occurring
behaviors.<P>

METHOD:  A series of conditional probability analyses will be conducted to examine
environmental relationships that correspond to the display of crucial social behaviors in students
with autism.  Findings on normal developmental trends in peer interactions will suggest
additional
educational goals, and comparisons of typical and atypical development will have implications
for
the design of instructional procedures that will better generalize and maintain.  A set of
observational conditions will be specified in a protocol which will permit more efficient
assessment of children's peer-related social behavior.  The assessment format will be validated
via
comparison to an extensive naturalistic database.  The resulting product should prove useful to
early intervention specialists and preschool educators, as well as to researchers.  Functional
analyses will be conducted to determine whether the social interests delineated in the individual
descriptive analyses can be used to control improved social responding.  The experimental
conditions will be educational intervention that make use of children's social interests as
reinforcers, and that incorporate information on environmental influences of successful social
behavior.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be packaged in user-friendly formats, and
advance arrangements will be made for on-request conversion to large print, Braille, or audio
cassette.  The primary dissemination path will highlight hands-on training of developing autism

Generalization of Early Semantic Relational Forms with Children Who Use AAC</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50014 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the acquisition and generalized production of two-term
semantic relationships by children with severe cognitive disabilities and little or no functional
speech.<P>

METHOD:  Five children with severe cognitive disabilities and little or no functional speech
who
use graphic symbols on augmentative communication boards will participate in this
investigation. 
A multiple baseline design across sets of action-object combinations with generalized probes of
untrained combinations will be used to teach generalized production of word combining skills
using a matrix-training strategy concomitantly with mand-model procedures.  Baseline
measurements and intervention procedures will occur during play activities either in a classroom
or in a separate area of the classroom.  Instructors will provide eliciting situations for target
response by asking open-ended questions requiring more than "yes" or "no" answers or
environmental arrangements.  Subjects will be expected to respond by pointing to the action
symbol and object symbol on their symbol boards.  Generalization will be measured by
classroom
teachers keeping anecdotal records of two-term word productions including what symbols were
used and how they were used in settings other than training setup.  Researchers will investigate
the effect of a concomitant use of matrix-training strategy and mand-model procedure and its
effectiveness in acquisition and generalization of the rule-based strategies for two-word
combinations by children with little or no functional speech.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this research will help clinicians and teachers to
teach comprehension and production of generalized word combining skills to children with
severe
cognitive disabilities and poor speech.  Specific planned dissemination activities include both
presentations in professional forums and the preparation of a manuscript for publication in a
professional refereed journal.<P>

ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a longitudinal investigation of processes and outcomes in
regular education classrooms where students with moderate and severe disabilities are enrolled
full time.<P>

METHOD:  The project will begin with an open-ended qualitative study focused on 12 students
with moderate or severe handicaps during the first year; the study intends to clarify and refine
hypotheses regarding key study questions and objectives.  Year 2 will focus on the development
of quantitative measures of classroom processes and student outcomes which are sensitive to
variance in the parameters described through the initial qualitative study, and the number of
participants will expand to 24.  Years 3 and 4 will entail ongoing follow-along of students
participating in the project, as well as intervention research aimed at increasing implementation
of
practices in regular classroom environments which have been identified as contributing to
positive
outcomes.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide data to demonstrate outcomes for
students with disabilities and students without disabilities participating in full inclusion
programs. 
Program and teacher characteristics associated with specific outcomes will be identified. 
Interventions aimed at modifying aspects of classroom environments hypothesized to affect
outcomes will be developed, and a variety of quantitative measurement strategies with high

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a series of studies on the reliability, predictive validity,
generalization, cost-effectiveness, and social validity of three procedures for identifying
reinforcers for functional skill learning by students with developmental disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Two groups of 24 students from three educational agencies whom school personnel
find either moderately difficult or very difficult to motivate have been identified.  After training,
two teachers will independently administer three reinforcement identification methods (RIM) for
each student at two testing periods separated by 2 months.  Alternate forms and test-retest
reliability for each RIM will then be computed. The quality of the information of the RIMs will
then be assessed by teaching the functional skills using the reinforcers identified by each method. 
Probes 3 and 6 months later in new training settings will be used to assess the predictive validity
and generalizability of the RIMs.  Measurement of staff time and a consumer satisfaction rating
will allow comparisons to be made regarding cost-effectiveness and social validity.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine in detail the development of social behaviors of
individuals
with autism, comparing these behaviors to those of control subjects matched for gender, age, and
Intelligence Quotient (IQ).<P>

METHOD:  Eight children with autism, ages 5 through 11, will be selected by IQ and gender
criteria.  Ecological methods of narrative recording in the natural environment will be applied to
study the behavior of individuals in home and school settings. Subjects will be observed for half
a
day in their natural environments, including 2 to 3 hours during structured activities and 2 to 3
hours during free and open activities.  Behavior of children will then be compared during
structured and free times in home and school settings.  After data has been transcribed and
analyzed, it will be analyzed according to ecological methods.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The study of social development in autism will aid researchers
attempting to understand the fundamental nature of the disability, also allowing for participation
by subjects often excluded from previous research.  A greater understanding of social
development will help professionals and families design more appropriate and meaningful
interventions and treatments. Project staff plan on presenting findings at a national conference

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  Through three separate studies, this project will compare the effectiveness of using
American Sign Language (ASL) versus Simultaneous Communication (SC) as the language of
instruction in educational settings for profoundly deaf children in early, middle, and late
childhood. <P>

METHOD:  The first study will compare ASL-exposed groups to groups of deaf children in
programs using SC, in order to compare the effectiveness of ASL and SC as the language of the
classroom upon a child's linguistic, social, and cognitive competence. The second study will
focus
on older students, using a combined case study/experimental approach to examine the
effectiveness of using a Cooperative Language Program that teaches secondary school-aged deaf
students with limited English proficiency to use first language (ASL) metalinguistic skills to
develop second language (English) skills.  The third study will address the issue of how young
deaf children from non-ASL using, hearing, families will learn ASL.  The effectiveness of a
preschool classroom-based ASL Early Intervention program to a home-based ASL Early
Intervention program.  This last study will be experimental, but will also involve some case study
analyses.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H023A50104 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate a number of important knowledge gaps by researching
and disseminating specific natural support strategies for increasing social integration between
employees with and without severe disabilities and supported employment settings.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will develop and evaluate specific natural support intervention procedures for
increasing the social integration of employees with severe disabilities using established
single-subject, clique analysis, and social validation methodologies. Specifically, the two studies
will evaluate: (1) if active and passive social mediating devices increase social integration at the
work site; and (2) if teaching nondisabled coworkers instructional strategies increases the
integration of workers with severe disabilities.  Study 1 will involve five employees with severe
disabilities who have limited interactions with nondisabled coworkers.  These employees will
receive social interaction training during lunch and break periods when coworkers are not
present,
and will be observed exercising these skills in other settings.  Study 2 will teach coworkers how
to
interact with supported employees by having coworkers provide instruction on job tasks as a
form
of natural support.  Five employees with severe disabilities will be paired with five nondisabled
coworkers who have similar job tasks and who are interested in learning how to instruct workers
with disabilities.  Intervention procedures will involve teaching coworkers how to use
instructional tactics of verbal instructions, modeling, practicing steps with corrective feedback,
praise, and quality-control checking.  Length of intervention will depend upon acquisition
rates.<P>

<b>Trends in Teacher Entry, Retention, Turnover, Attrition, and Shortage in Special Education
</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40102 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will comprehensively analyze trends in the entry, retention, turnover,
teaching field transfer, and attrition of special education teachers (SETs) on the national
level.<P>

METHOD:  Project research is based on three iterations of two sets of sample surveys conducted
by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), USDE, which will include the Schools
and Staffing Surveys (SASS), and the Teacher Follow-up Surveys (TFS).  The SASS are
composed of several basic questionnaires administered by mail with extensive telephone
follow-up.  A stratified systematic probability proportionate-to-size selection procedure was used
to draw the SASS sample.  The TFS provides the only database at the national level for the study
of attrition from the teaching profession with a representative sample of teachers.  A major
feature
of the database is the inclusion of follow-up interviews of teachers who: (1) were retained in their
teaching positions; (2) transferred to different teaching positions; and (3) left the teaching
profession entirely.  This project provides the application of a multidimensional model for
tracking
teacher career transitions using three iterations of two national sample surveys.  All statistical
analyses will be based on the national estimates of teachers computed by applying appropriate
weights to the numbers of teachers in their respective samples.  The project will continue for a
42-month period, and the pace of the project has been designed in relation to the amount of
personnel resources budgeted and the availability of the SASS and TFS data bases for
research.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As a result of this project, a large amount of new information
will
be provided about the national status of, and trends in SET entry, retention, turnover, teaching
field transfer, attrition, and shortage.  The project will also result in considerable insight into the
dynamics of the SET teacher force and the teacher shortage problem. <P>

<b>The Role of Paraprofessionals in Quality Inclusive Educational Programs</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50016 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will study the role of the paraprofessional in quality inclusive education
programs, building an empirical base for this role and examining critical job competencies and
components of job descriptions.<P>

METHOD:  This study will examine the roles and responsibilities of eight paraprofessionals
working in grades 2-5.  Participants will be drawn from four elementary schools from four school
districts in New York State that have participated in a larger scale evaluation of their inclusive
programs.  Data collection will include interviews and direct observations of paraprofessionals,
as
well as interviews with the principals of participating schools, the director of special education
for
each district, parents of students with special needs who are being supported by
paraprofessionals,
and the general and special education teachers who work with these paraprofessionals.  In
addition, relevant district documents will be examined.  Study questions will address: (1) how
the
teaching team views the role and responsibilities of the paraprofessional; (2) paraprofessional
involvement in individual program planning; (3) types of job training paraprofessionals receive
to
prepare them to carry out their duties; (4) in what ways teaching assistants might be assigned to
work one-on-one with students with disabilities versus a support role within the class that
includes
work with students with and without disabilities.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research results could serve as a reference for paraprofessional
staff development and contribute to the national discussion of appropriate roles and
responsibilities for paraprofessionals in inclusive education.  Project staff hope to disseminate
findings through a presentation at one national conference.<P>

<b>Teacher Preparation for Diverse Classrooms: Performance-Based Assessment of Beginning
Teachers</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50041 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 10/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will use a performance-based assessment model to examine the effects
of preservice preparation factors on the degree to which beginning teachers use culturally
responsive teaching (CRT).<P>

METHOD:  The primary tool of assessment will be Praxis III, a performance-based assessment
for beginning teachers developed at the Educational Testing Service.  Research staff will
examine
how the following three preservice factors impact the practice of CRT by beginning teachers: (1)
preparation in general vs. special education teacher education programs; (2) levels of preservice
teacher preparation in cultural issues; and (3) preservice university preparation.  Using Praxis III,
investigators will gather records of evidence for 70 beginning teachers from general and special
teacher education programs at four universities in Florida.  Evidence will be gathered from
teacher and classroom profiles, pre- and post-observation interviews, and observations.  These
records will be analyzed with both qualitative (MANOVA) and quantitative methods.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings are expected to enhance the knowledge base of
teacher educators regarding preservice factors that may affect the practice of CRT by beginning
teachers.  Final products of the study will be disseminated through professional journals and
conference presentations to enhance the research base and provide methodological information to
researchers in cultural diversity, teacher education, and teacher assessment.<P>

<b>The Paraprofessional Role in Inclusion </b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023A50092 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a study of the extent to which paraprofessionals are
currently involved in inclusion of children with disabilities and the nature of their roles.  The
project will also construct a framework that guides the range of ways in which paraprofessionals
could be constructively involved in the inclusion of students within the school and in the larger
community.<P>

METHOD:  Research will employ both quantitative and qualitative methods, including a mail
survey of 150 paraprofessionals working in inclusive classrooms at various grade levels and
locations to determine the nature and extent of their involvement in the educational process and
semistructured interviews with a smaller sample of 30 paraprofessionals to follow up on survey
findings in depth.  Follow-up interviews will focus on a purposeful sample of survey respondents
reflecting a range of ethnicity, roles in inclusion, awareness of issues, types of disability, and
geographic location.  Three separate focus groups will also be conducted to gain the unique
perspectives of parents, classroom teachers, and special education teachers.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Expected outcomes include a better understanding of the roles
paraprofessionals currently play and practical ways for school to improve inclusion practices
through the use of paraprofessionals. Findings will be distributed through written products and
conference presentations to families, educators, researchers, and paraprofessionals.<P>

<b>Development and Validation of a Partnership-Consultation-Collaboration-Professional 
Development Model to Bridge the Gap Between Research and Practice</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will articulate, implement, evaluate, and disseminate an existing model
designed to improve the practices of special and regular education teachers and of parents in
inner-city communities.<P>

METHOD:  Participants in the project will include 975 students (195 with disabilities), their
parents, 36 teachers and administrative staff of three school buildings in three school districts,
and
10 researchers.  Two of these schools will be from economically disadvantaged (over 35% in
poverty) urban communities.  Key components of the model to establish and maintain sustained
research-practice relationships between researchers and practitioners will address partnership,
collaboration, consultation, and professional development. Using a multiple baseline design
across
schools and a multi-method (qualitative and quantitative) measurement model, functional
relationships between use of the model and changes in implementation of practices, instructional
processes, and products/outcomes on students with and without disabilities will be examined. 
Additional participants will include the staff and students of a third, out-of-state replication
school
that will serve as an independent replication site for the model prior to national
dissemination.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to direct benefits to participants, the project will
result
in new knowledge in the form of empirical and qualitative findings concerning the model, its
components, processes, products, and outcomes.  This knowledge will be published in the
professional literature and used in preservice teacher training.  This knowledge will also be
represented in a "blueprint" of training, materials, media, and technology for replication in local
schools.<P>

<b>Collaborative Co-Planning Between General and Special Educators</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50063 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  1/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will evaluate the effectiveness of a structured collaborative co-planning
model for general and special educators. <P>

METHOD:  The model to be employed has been designed to: (1) increase the number of
instructional interventions generated and implemented by general and special education teachers
for students with learning disabilities included in the general education classroom; (2) increase
the
on-task classroom behavior of students with learning disabilities; (3) increase the number of
positive interactions between general and special educators and their students with learning
disabilities; (4) increase the number of positive interactions among students with learning
disabilities and their peers; (5) increase the general and special education teachers' perceptions of
positive academic achievement for students with disabilities; and (6) increase self-perceptions of
positive academic achievement among students with learning disabilities.  Forty-eight general
and
special education teachers from four local education agencies will participate in the project
through team or co-teaching arrangements in sixth grade classrooms.  Each teacher "team" will
have a minimum of two students with learning disabilities.  Qualitative and quantitative sources
(e.g., interviews, classroom observations, teacher reflections in journals and logs, and Likert-type
ratings instruments) will be utilized to examine the results of the project and the effectiveness of
the program.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings will have implications for LEA personnel in the
planning
and implementation of inclusive school or collaboration programs in which general and special
educators team or co-teach.  Additionally, results will impact preservice and inservice teacher
trainers as they attempt to replicate the model in developing new collaborative or inclusive
school
programs or refining extant programs.  Project results will be disseminated at the college level to
preservice teachers to provide them with valuable collaborative skills.  Project findings will also
be
disseminated through journal articles, conferences presentations, and inservice workshops.<P>

<b>Project LITERACY-HI: Literacy Improvement viaText Enhancements and Reading
Assistance
for Children and Youth with Hearing Impairments</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G30027 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct research into the benefits of
electronically-enhanced text
for mainstreamed students who are hard-of-hearing.<P>

METHOD:  Participating students (N=77) will be provided with Macintosh PowerBooks
containing electronically-enhanced versions of their classroom textbooks. Short-term
effects of
electronically-enhanced reading materials on the comprehension of content-area
materials and
academic achievement in regular classes will be assessed, as will the long-term effects
on the
literacy skills, academic achievement, and psychosocial development of students who
are
hard-of-hearing.  Additional research will explore the extent to which environmental
factors
effect
and are effected by the use of enhanced reading materials among such students.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  It is anticipated that this technology will greatly enhance
students'
abilities to read and comprehend text from content area materials by supporting their
literacy
needs unobtrusively, thereby maximizing their chances for success in least restrictive
environments.  Technical reports will be written on each phase of the project.  Articles
will be
written for publication in technology-oriented, content-area, language arts, and special
education
publications.  Presentations will also be made at national conferences.<P>

<b>Project CONNECT: Content-Area-Literacy Networked Notetaking for Exceptional
Children
and Teachers</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G40066 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will research the benefits of synchronous notetaking strategies
using
portable laptop computers and a wireless network.<P>

METHOD:  Participating students will be selected from three populations for whom
notetaking
in
regular content area classes is often difficult: students with learning disabilities,
students with
severe hearing impairments, and students with severe upper extremity dysfunction.  All
participating students will be provided with Macintosh PowerBooks for regular class
notetaking
and will be assisted by trained notetakers using the same equipment.  These laptop
computers
will
be linked wirelessly and together they will create notes from class presentations and
discussions
using synchronous writing software.  Data will be gathered to (1) uncover the specific
notetaking
strategies most important for different types of students, (2) determine effective ways
for
students
to manipulate and use the notes for studying outside of class, and (3) explore ways to
increase
students' independence and personal responsibility for the notetaking process.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A technical report will be written at the end of each
project year
describing and summarizing the results of research efforts to date.  Researchers have
arranged for
the provision of the software used at a discounted price to schools along with project
training
materials and a descriptive videotape.  Findings will also be submitted to professional
publications
and presented at conferences on state, regional, and national levels. <P>

ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project plans to increase the English literacy skills of Hispanic
students who are
deaf through the use of Hispanic cultural themes presented via multimedia.<P>

METHOD:  This project will (1) train teachers who teach students who are deaf from
Hispanic
backgrounds to use multimedia technology; (2) train teachers to develop literacy
software
centering around the theme of Hispanic culture at elementary, junior high, and high
school
levels;
(3) implement and evaluate these literacy lessons in classrooms with Hispanic students
who are
deaf; and (4) disseminate a series of prototypical Hispanic-oriented multimedia
CD-ROMs
containing literacy lessons which are designed for users who are deaf.  In addition to
multimedia
adaptations of popular Hispanic childrens' books, the CD-ROM lessons will include
biographical
sketches of successful Hispanic adults who are deaf.  Vocabulary enrichment will be
supported 
through the inclusion of visual demonstrations of key terms as expressed in  and
Spanish sign
language. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  During the three-year project, staff expect to develop five
CD-ROM literacy instruction packages.  Each CD will contain 10-15 literacy lessons
featuring
Hispanic culture.  Topics will include: children's stories, legends, festivals, proverbs,
crafts,
jokes,
folktales, art, poetry, history, recipes, and games.  Narration and text on the CDs will
include
English written text as well as spoken English and Spanish, signed English and

<b>Examination of the Effectiveness of a Functional Approach to the Delivery of
Assistive
Technology Services in Schools</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180U50025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>
PURPOSE:  This project will examine the impact of the use of a
recently-conceptualized
unifying
model of human function to guide the development and delivery of assistive technology
services
in
public schools.<P>

METHOD:  The functional model to be used focuses on identification of demands that
are placed
on an individual from the environment and the functional responses that are required to
respond
to those demands.  Functional responses are made within the context of personal
perceptions, the
available personal resources, and the external supports (including assistive
technologies) that can
be provided.  Research will be conducted to identify commercially-available assistive
technology
assessment instruments and development of specifications for assistive technology
assessment
protocols.  Research will also conduct an initial comparison of assistive technology
information
systems, and procedures will be developed for researching other identified information
systems. 
Procedures will be developed for conducting research on interaction analyses occurring
during
assistive technology IEP meetings, as well as procedures for guiding the evaluation of
assistive
technology effectiveness.  Project staff will develop instrumentation for conducting
critical
incident studies to determine the competencies needed by those who are involved in
delivering
assistive technology services.  Initial training materials, procedures for evaluating their
effectiveness, and guidelines for providing training for those who will be implementing
the
policies
and procedures will be developed.  Baseline information about existing assistive 
technology
policies and procedures will be collected as well.  A variety of qualitative and
quantitative
research methodologies will be employed to answer key research questions, including
survey
research, case studies, single subject research, critical incident studies, interviews,
direct
observation, and evaluation research.  Following comparison of this baseline data with
research
findings based on assessment of outcomes among students receiving these technology
services,
the final summer of the project will be devoted to analysis of project effectiveness and
preparation
of the final report.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be presented at state and national
conferences, and an article reporting on research comparing software packages will be
prepared
for publication in a professional journal.  A document of Guidelines for Providing
Assistive
Technology Services in Schools will be generated, to include a description of what was
learned
as
a result of various project investigations.  A manual will also be developed for each of
the
screening and assessment procedures used in the project.  Screening and assessment
devices will
also be discussed in a series of reports for consumers.<P>

<b>A Computerized Assessment Environment to Promote Literacy in Assessment for 
Individuals
with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G50015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  3/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  2/28/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct the second phase of research to (1) assess the
overall
efficiency and desirability of a computerized testing environment for individuals with
disabilities,
and (2) to systematically investigate the effects of specific modifications on test
performance of
students with disabilities, with the goal of improving the performance on tests and
increased
inclusion of students in district assessment performances.<P>

METHOD:  In Phase I of this research, 53 special education teachers and related
service
personnel were surveyed to determine the most common problems that special
education students
have in taking tests and the most common modifications used.  Data from this phase
will be
incorporated into Phase II analysis, and software developed as a result of this research
will be
used in Phase II experiments.  After Phase I research is used to identify tests and test
items
currently in use that can be used in a computerized testing environment for assessing
students
with disabilities, staff will investigate the effectiveness and suitability of the
computerized
testing
environment for administering tests and delivering test modifications for students with
disabilities. 
The effects of specific computer-delivered modifications on test performance of
students with
specific disabilities will be systematically investigated.  Finally, data will be evaluated in
preparation for dissemination of results, including suggestions for continuing
experimental
comparison of  performance on computerized modified tests with traditional test
administration
procedures, both modified and unmodified.  The computerized assessment
environment will be
field-tested in four diverse special education departments representing different
geographic,
demographic, and administrative characteristics.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of research will be disseminated in two reports
and also
through publication and presentation of research results.  The first report will contain a
description of the project design, a description of prototype software design, and a
project
evaluation section.  The second report will be written for school district management
personnel,
and will outline the costs and benefits of using the model for student assessment and
test
development.<P>

<b>An Interactive MultiMedia Approach to Teacher Training Designed to Reduce the
Gap
Between
Research and Practice</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/14/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate an interactive hypermedia training
program to
train teachers in one complex teaching practice: the Concept Mastery Routine
(CMR).<P>

METHOD:  Once information gathered from a literature review and consultations with
expert
trainers and teachers has been compiled, project staff will develop a refined version of
the
Interactive Hypermedia Program (IHP) that will maximize teachers' choice in learning,
and
hopefully increase  teachers' understanding and ability to implement the CMR in their
classrooms. 
Text and graphic displays will be collected, as will audio segments from teachers
commenting on
their use of the CMR with students. Additional audio will provide a running commentary
and
narration to accompany text and graphic displays.  Video segments will illustrate correct
usage of
CMR with students, and will be designed to clarify, elaborate, and extend the
information
provided in text and graphic displays.  An intervention study (yet to be designed) will
focus on
comparing the effectiveness of the IHP to a traditional teacher training program in terms
of
impact on teacher knowledge and behavior.  Sets of 30 experimental and control
teachers will
complete questionnaires and pre- and post-tests of CMR understanding.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  It is anticipated that development of the Interactive
Hypermedia
Program for training teachers in a complex instructional practice will provide a viable
solution to
bridge research to practice.  Descriptions of the project, position papers, and research
reports will
be written by project staff for publication in regular and special education journals.  The
possibility of presenting findings at national and state education conferences will also
be
pursued.<P>

<b>Assistive Technology in the Cognitive Realm: Tools for Daily Living</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180T40053 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will utilize existing technologies to assist a group of
adolescents and
young adults with cognitive impairments to use technology to "work around" their
cognitive
limitations in terms of remembering and implementing metacognitive routines.<P>

METHOD:  This project will develop and implement a series of software modules to
help users
access relevant information and knowledge to improve the quality of their life in the
community;
develop skills for exercising increased personal autonomy in decision making; manage
day-to-day
living situations and challenges; and promote the development of increasingly
sophisticated
problem-solving strategies.  Students aged 17-21 will be nominated by teachers for
participation
in the project.  Interviews with subjects will examine their interests and needs so
software
packages can be tailored to meet these needs.  Field testing will focus on the
refinement of the
graphic user interface, the user/prompt interaction sequences, and the kind of training
needed to
support users in their initial phases of learning and ongoing interaction with the system. 
Project
evaluation will rely on the use of multiple methods including qualitative and quantitative
techniques for data collection and analysis.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project's creation of innovative tools using varied and
integrated media and materials should enable individuals with disabilities to achieve the
outcomes
expected of all students, such as independence, productivity, and a quality of life that
promotes
equity in opportunity.  The process will also enable the learner across environments by
fostering
the creation of state-of-the-art instructional environments both within and outside school
settings.<P>

<b>Developing Technology, Media and Materials to Enhance Student
Self-Determination
Within Transition Planning</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180A40071 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will enhance the utilization of a transition planning strategy that
incorporates a self-determination process as a foundation through the development of
computer
software, broadcast quality video tapes, and a wide array of materials.<P>

METHOD:  The three basic steps of this project will include the development of
appropriate
technology, materials, and media to support a transition planning strategy that
enhances student
self-determination within the IEP process, training a large sample of stakeholders on
how to use
the strategy, and training potential users and trainers of the strategy on how to use the
transition
planning strategy and its supporting materials.  The achievement of student
self-determination
within the IEP process requires that students must: (1) forecast their long-range goals
and
anticipate how to reach them; (2) be able to learn their own strengths and weaknesses;
and (3)
have a workable strategy for using this information themselves.  This approach should
be
supported by effective materials including technology and effective media supports.  In
order to
meet these conditions, project staff will focus on a strong foundation of work in: (1)
teaching
adolescents with disabilities how to build a sense of self-empowerment; (2) developing
assessment
instruments in areas that pertain to transition; and (3) designing programs and
developing
materials that improve transition services in local communities.  Student self-evaluation
will
include such areas of potential student achievement as academic skills, vocational
skills,
independent living skills, and personal/social skills.  While teaching self-evaluation
practices to
students with disabilities through modifications of the Transition Skills Inventory, staff
will
develop procedures for negotiating differences of opinion, and will review other relevant
standardized tests.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in a series of training materials,
software
for a computerized management information system to support the overall strategy, and
a set of
objectives and tasks for addressing high priority program standards over the course of a
year.<P>

<b>Telecommunications for All</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30025 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop systems for the assistive technology application of
telecommunications for deaf children.<P>

METHOD:  Off-the-shelf and emerging communications technology will be tailored for
improved
access by children in school environments, and staff will develop systems, materials,
and
activities
that enable and encourage telephone use based on the developmental level of the
child.  The
project will begin with a needs assessment conducted at the schools, a survey of
materials and
curricula from other schools, and a review of all candidate products.  A preliminary
design of at
least one system for providing an array of technologies at one site will be developed,
followed by
review by a panel of experts.  The system will be assembled and software written to
integrate the
components, provide a user-friendly interface, and to provide tutorials and other
information. 
The
prototype system will initially be tested at schools closest to the research system, and
then placed
farther away as system reliability is established.  The system will be evaluated for cost,
reliability,
technical support required, ease of use, training requirements, and impact on children's
abilities
to
use visual telecommunications.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The systems and materials generated will result in
greater
program accessibility and appropriateness for deaf children, use of telecommunications
at earlier
ages, and an accelerated program of instruction on visual telecommunications
compared to the
present case.<P>

technology activities, transition services, staff development, family participation,
administration,
community involvement, and policy development.  During the study, ECCTS will focus
on
integrated classrooms, children, staff, families, community schools, and state agencies
with
interests in assistive technology experiences for young children. Thirty-five 3- and
4-year-olds
with moderate to severe disabilities that prevent them from interacting effectively with
objects,
people, and events in their environment will be the primary subjects.  They are spread
across 12
classrooms, each of which has a special education teacher and an early childhood
teacher in
conjunction with support staff.  Tested procedures and materials will be adapted for
model
projects focusing on elements of the ECCTS system. Data to be gathered across the
major
components will include informally gathered pre- and post-test measures, observation,
interviews,
examination of records and materials, analysis of videotapes, content analysis, focus
groups, and
other methods.  Component I data will specifically include records and videotapes of
classroom
activities as well as individual child behaviors, dyads, and small groups functioning
during
curricular activities.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Study results will provide the field with information on the
most
effective strategies in terms of developing comprehensive technology systems that
mesh with
delivery systems.  Awareness information on the project will be disseminated through
news
releases, television and radio, journal publications, electronic bulletin boards, and
presentations
during local, regional, and national presentations.<P>

<b>Science Education for Secondary Students with Severe Orthopedic Impairments
Using
Virtual
Reality</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180T40100 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop and program three-dimensional virtual reality (VR)
scenarios to be implemented in science classrooms containing one or more students
who would
otherwise be prevented from experiencing hands-on science education due to
orthopedic
impairments.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will work closely with science teachers at selected secondary schools
to
identify
specific units within the existing curriculum from which students with severe orthopedic
impairments are excluded due to their physical limitations.  Following development of
appropriate
VR scenarios, half of the regular class (including orthopedically impaired students) will
conduct
experiments or perform activities using the VR system, while the other half of the class
performs
these tasks in the usual way.  Analyses will compare mean scores between the groups
(to
measure
instructional validity) and between orthopedically impaired students and their peers (to
insure
adequate progress within the curriculum).  Project staff will thus identify principles
underlying
the
use of VR to provide modified science activities and materials and to ensure meaningful
student
participation, meanwhile validating that the VR materials ensure adequate student
progress in
inclusive settings.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A technical report will be written at the end of each year
summarizing the results of evaluation efforts to that date.  A manual for implementing
the
strategies found to be effective in this project will be written, with special emphasis on
guidelines
for implementing the program in public schools.  Project staff will write articles for
submission
to
professional publications for both scholarly and practitioner-oriented audiences.  Project
findings
will also be presented at key relevant conferences at state, regional and national
levels.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H180A40006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop techniques for integrating speech recognition
within the
sign language interpreting process, develop a training program and materials for
teaching
interpreters to use these techniques, and set up a nationwide "training-the-trainer"
program to
disseminate these techniques.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will first meet with Montgomery County Public School (MCPS)
administrators
to plan activities, select MCPS interpreters (N=4) and high school students with
deafness (N=4)
to participate, and select topic areas and classes.  Staff will then obtain the
DragonDictate speech
recognition system as well as more advanced models (N=4), consisting of computers,
sound
capture boards, headsets, and a software package.  Staff will also obtain copies of
each of the
high
school textbooks used by MCPS in classes related to the selected topic.  The index and
glossary
words from these textbooks will be checked against the words in the speech recognition
system;
any words not in the system will be added.  Once all equipment has been installed,
participating
MCPS interpreters will train on the systems, and will help analyze classroom
interpreting to
determine strengths and weaknesses.  Once basic techniques have been defined, a
mock
classroom
learning situation will be conducted to allow participating interpreters and students to
practice
interpreting.  Techniques and procedures developed by participants will then be
evaluated for a
total of 20 hours under actual classroom conditions including non-participating students
(N=30)
and a teacher.  Once techniques have been approved, staff will develop materials and
a training
program for teaching interpreters to use speech recognition in class.  Staff will then
develop a
"training the trainer" program to teach people how to use the training program in other
classrooms and in different subjects.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At least two journal articles will be submitted by the
project
staff. 
Staff will develop training materials for teaching classroom interpreters to use speech
recognition. 
As a result of this project, interpreters (N=60) will be trained to use speech recognition,
with
special instruction on teaching others to use it.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H180H20034 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/96 <P>
                                   
ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will demonstrate and evaluate uses of interactive video as a
means of
increasing literacy development and interest among deaf and hard-of-hearing
students.<P>

METHOD:  The project will use Thurston's START model, which indicates that Support,
Time,
Access, Resources and Training are all necessary for the successful implementation of
innovation
in the classroom.  An additional teacher empowerment model will emphasize extensive
teacher
control of the implementation process and extensive teacher involvement in decision
making. 
Four programs - two residential schools and two public school programs - will
participate in the
3-year project. Each program will select a team of teachers and administrators for
participation,
and participants will be involved in all phases of the project, including preparation,
training,
curriculum development, support, implementation, institutionalization, dissemination,
and
evaluation.  Year One will focus on uses of captioned movies available on existing
videodiscs. 
Year Two will expand uses of interactive video to materials developed by teachers and
students
in
project sites.  Year Three will focus on shifting from the external to internal support for
interactive video, on conducting a summative evaluation, and disseminating results at
regional
and
national levels.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Outcomes will include: (1) a data based, empirical
description of
the process by which interactive video was implemented in programs for deaf and
hard-of-hearing
students; (2) descriptions of contextual variables and student characteristics that may
influence
the
success of implementing interactive video in the classroom; (3) a model of successful
implementation based on these descriptions; (4) curricular materials for interactive
video
instruction; and (5) a video record of the implementation process, potentially for future
use in
training others for replication.<P>

<b>Integrating Captioning with College Preparatory Courses for Students with Special
Educational
Needs</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G50022 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the effect of captioned instructional television
for
students in special education and students with limited English proficiency enrolled in
college
preparatory classes.<P>

METHOD:  Using a multiple phase research strategy, the study will address the
following
questions: (1) Does captioning provide cognitive benefits for college age students with
learning
disabilities or students with limited English proficiency? (2) Does captioning provide
affective
benefits for college-age students with learning disabilities or students with limited
English
proficiency? (3) Is there a differential benefit (either cognitive or affective) for captioning
for
students with learning disabilities as compared to students with limited English
proficiency? and
(4) What are the optimal conditions for implementing captioning in a community college
setting?
A minimum of two intact classes (one focusing on students with learning disabilities,
one
focusing
on students with limited English proficiency) will be selected each year for full qualitative
and
quantitative data collection at Miami-Dade Community College.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to the knowledge and understanding gained
from the
data collection and analysis effort, the project will result in several products including
captioned
videos with accompanying guidelines for integrating them into college preparatory
courses and
classroom vignettes of students and instructors as they adapt to captioning
technology.<P>

<b>Development of a Personal Caption Display Prototype to Benefit Students Who Are
Deaf</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30040 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop a prototype personal caption display system that
could be
worn by students who are deaf.<P>

METHOD:  This system would use a set of special eyeglasses to provide a caption
display. The
glasses would be battery operated and would receive captions via a wireless link;
captions
themselves would be viewed in the lens, and the optical design would be such that the
caption
would appear to be projected onto a distant screen or other object.  This imaging would
save
users from having to refocus their vision to read captions.  While the primary application
of this
technology will be to provide captions for lecture portions of a lesson, further
applications for
captioning television, movies and other media are also foreseen.  In addition, by using
several
transmission frequencies, this technology could be used to simultaneously provide
captions in
multiple languages.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Development and testing of this system could be a major
breakthrough in captioning technology, providing a personal-level solution to many
common
captioning problems.  With the development of such a wearable personal caption
system, other
major sources of aural communication would become more equally accessible to deaf
persons.<P>

studies designed to advance the availability, quality, use, and effectiveness of TEMM
based upon
the findings of Phase I and II studies.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will be children with developmental disabilities, ages 3-12, their
families,
and the professionals who address their literacy-learning needs in preschool and school
settings. 
Three typical settings in which preschoolers are educated and three typical settings in
which
elementary school-aged children are educated will serve as principal research sites.  A
socio-communicative model of language and literacy use and a comprehensive model
of the
study
of classroom teaching will serve as the frameworks driving the research. Qualitative and
survey
research methods will be the primary means of conducting Phase I and II research into
the state
of
the art in the use of TEMM to promote literacy.  Experimental designs will be employed
in Phase
III intervention studies.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be shared through multiple means
including: publication in peer-reviewed journals, publication in newsletters and journals
for
families of children with developmental disabilities and the professionals who serve
them; and
conference presentations, particularly the Carolina Literacy Symposium.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H180E30021 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   The project will expand the use of a promising educational technology and
conduct
a comprehensive evaluation of its implementation and its efficacy with students who are
deaf,
students who are hard of hearing, and students with learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  In 1991, WGBH developed a captioning workstation for students.  In the
current
project, applications of that workstation will be furthered explored with more than a
dozen
teachers and their students at six schools.  Students will use video as a stimulus for
facilitating
comprehension of content, generating ideas and language, and supporting short-term
memory;
using a work processor, they will write text that matches or enhances the video; finally,
they will
superimpose their text over the video, resulting in a captioned videotape, which
reinforces
learning.  In collaboration with project staff, each teacher will establish specific
language and
literacy goals for the students and develop appropriate captioning activities to
accomplish those
goals.  Project staff from the National Technical Institute for the Deaf will evaluate the
project
from several perspectives: student performance on a variety of measures; attitudes of
teachers,
students and administrators toward learning and using the technology within the
curriculum; and
implementation issues.  Evaluation results will inform use of the technology during the
project
period and after.  Participating schools will include both special and integrated settings. 
Students
in K- 12 will participate; they will be deaf and hard of hearing, or have a
language-based learning
disability.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   Project findings will be disseminated through traditional
outreach
channels as well as via a comprehensive teachers's manual and demonstration
videotape. 
Captioning software for the PC will also be available.<P>

ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine and demonstrate how individualizing the
closed-caption
prompt rate, manipulated to match each student's reading level and comprehension
reading rate,
can be a successful technological reading approach.<P>

METHOD:  A cluster equivalent materials design comprised of two groups of 4th-grade
students
who are mildly disabled and nondisabled in two classroom environments (inclusive and
noninclusive) will participate in a limited pilot study and a full-scale study for 1 academic
year. 
These groups of students will receive alternate treatments of: (1) digital video
interactive
materials with individualized prompt rate; and (2) closed-captioned videotapes with no
individualization of prompt rate.  A demonstration of this technology in both inclusive
and
noninclusive classrooms will be conducted during Year 3 of the grant.  Appropriate data
analyses
will be applied, results graphed, interpreted, reported, and disseminated.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results from this project will give educators new
directions in
improving reading level, comprehension, and retention skills in elementary students.  In
addition,

of
simulating or modeling the actions of the operating system.  The OLE Graphical User
Interface
Descriptive Environment (OLE GUIDE) will attempt to provide good access to the
Microsoft
Chicago Operating System.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Through this adapted access to the Chicago system,
users with
visual impairments will be given access to line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts, as
well as other
graphic components of computer applications.  The publication of a monthly "OLE
GUIDE
Progress Report" will outline the project's ongoing problems, solutions and findings. 
This report
will be available via Internet and will also be used to maintain lines of communication
with
Microsoft, field staff at the American University, and other interested parties.  Papers on
the
progress of the project will be presented at leading conferences dealing with the
interests of
people with disabilities and will be submitted for publication in relevant professional
journals.<P>

ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will analyze a range of multilevel professional delivery systems
training
teachers of students with disabilities to incorporate multimedia technology into
contextualized
learning environments, and to develop, field-test, and disseminate multimedia training
materials.<P>

METHOD:  During the first of 3 project years, the project will work closely with special
education teachers and principals (N=30) to identify, implement, and analyze the
efficacy of
three
organizational support and professional development activities. The first set of activities
will
entail
utilizing materials developed by Peabody researchers between August and December
to train
special education (N=15) and building administrators (N=15). Second, a series of
studies will be
conducted between January and June to examine the efficacy of models of staff

coupled with different organizational support levels.  Third, training materials based on
research
outcomes will be developed that describe strategies for staff development training
programs.
These activities will be the foundation for materials training teachers to modify
instructional
environments to produce improved teachers and students behavioral outcomes.  During
the
second project year, the project will focus on: (1) formatively and summatively
evaluating
training
packages with groups of local and national special education teachers; and (2)
analyzing the
efficacy of staff development and instructional intervention strategies. In the third
project year,
all
training materials will be summatively evaluated and disseminated nationally.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Staff will develop two sets of multimedia training
materials.  The
first set will be designed to enable teachers to effectively use anchored instruction with
multimedia
technology to instruct students with disabilities.  The second will describe strategies to
organize,
deliver, and evaluate building-based staff development training activities.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a nationwide study of the ways special educators
use
technology, media, and materials to promote literacy among children with
disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This study will seek to answer the following questions: (1) What is the state
of
practice in the use of technology to promote literacy for children with disabilities? (2)
What are
effective and innovative strategies for using technology to promote literacy? and (3)
What kinds
of information do special educators use to determine which technology to use to
promote literacy
and when to use them? A research design using Computer Assisted Telephone
Interview (CATI)
technology and case studies will solicit information from special education teachers,
administrators, and higher education faculty about what technologies they use and how;
which
technologies they feel are effective in promoting literacy; and what sources of
information they
use to learn about such technologies.  The overall CATI survey will reach 2,200
educators
nationwide.  Case studies of seven school districts which use technology to promote
literacy in
special education programs will provide real-world examples to deepen descriptive
statistical
data
gathered through the survey.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of the survey and case studies will be translated
into
three
informational products: a research report, a photo essay, and a computer-based
presentation. 
Products will be distributed to the original survey participants, who will again be
interviewed
through CATI to find out if they read the information, what they thought of it, and how
they
might have used it.<P>

at the
Local Level through Participatory Action Research</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180U50022 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will foster ownership among all stakeholders, and thus create
real
change
at the local level in response to state guidelines on the implementation of the IDEA's
technology-related mandates.<P>

METHOD:  In Phase I, the project will enable stakeholders in school districts to: (1)
understand
the intent of state guidelines for assistive technology planning; (2) assess the impact of
the
existing
assistive technology and training systems upon the provision and integration of
technology for
students with disabilities; and (3) develop an agenda for change.  During Phase II,
project staff
will assist participating school districts in implementing their assistive technology
objectives and
plans.  In Phase III, a variety of descriptive and outcome data will be collected and
analyzed to
allow schools to evaluate their implementation activities and plan for the remaining
project
period. 
Reports will be drafted for each participating district, outlining those factors which inhibit
or
promote: (1) the ordering and purchasing of assistive technology; (2) use of assistive
technology
by students with disabilities, as well as by teachers and administrators; (3) formation of
school-based teams; effective technology training; and (4) the integration of technology
in the
curriculum.  Phase IV will consist of dissemination activities, and will additionally focus
on the
transfer of ownership back to participating districts. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project training curriculum will be formatted into a
manual
for use by school districts as they prepare to implement a technology project in their
school
districts.  Concrete examples of project activities and specific procedures and technical
assistance
developed to enhance project outcomes will also be included.  Materials will be adapted
on
request in accessible formats such as diskettes, large print, Spanish, and Braille.  The
State

<b>The Personal Communicator: Empowering Deaf Learners in Social Interactions</b>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/16/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/15/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will enable deaf students to communicate better with their
peers,
teachers, and other associates, deaf or hearing, using a portable, multimedia
communication
device called the "personal communicator."<P>

METHOD:  A case study approach will be used over a 2-year period to provide an
in-depth
analysis of the application of the personal communicator" on Macintosh PowerBooks
and
next-generation computers referred to as Personal Digital Assistants with deaf children
at
elementary through secondary school levels.  Videotapes of randomly selected
classroom periods
at 2-month intervals will be analyzed to assess the frequency and content of social
interactions
between deaf and hearing students and between deaf students and hearing teachers. 
In addition,
researchers will assess attitudes toward integration of all hearing teachers and hearing
classmates
of deaf subjects, by randomly sampling written dialogue entries between dyad members
to also
assess written language competency.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The "personal communicator" is designed to impact deaf
subjects'
social interactions with hearing classmates and teachers in participating classrooms. 
Social
integration skills learned through the use of the "personal communicator" are likely to
generalize
to situations outside the classroom.  Teacher and student attitudes toward integration
are likely to
improve when deaf students demonstrate positive social interactions.<P>

<b>Development and Evaluation of a Computer-Aided Speech-to-Print Transcription
System</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180J30011 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 12/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 11/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop and evaluate a real-time speech-to-print
transcription
system that can be employed as a support system for deaf students.<P>

METHOD:  The system will use a hearing transcriber and a computer program to
convert speech
into print as the words are being spoken.  The system will provide a real-time text
display that
the
student can read to understand what is being said in a classroom.  In addition, the text
file stored
in the computer can be examined by students, tutors and instructors by reading the
computer
monitor or a hard-copy printout.  The system will use a laptop computer and common
word
processing software, as well as procedures for "compressing" or reducing the text when
speech
becomes rapid.  Following refinement of the basic system, the package will be
evaluated in the
classroom through: (1) evaluation of technical performance, (2) questionnaire of users,
(3)
in-depth interviews, (4) study of operators' use of the system, and (5) study of the
system in
implementation at the secondary level.  Operators and other personnel will be trained in
key
procedures, and operator training procedures will be refined and evaluated.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will produce a field-tested and validated
system to
create computerized text files of classroom speech, which will not only serve the needs
of deaf
and hard-of-hearing students, but also create documentation for many other uses.  The
system
also has potential to facilitate the communication of deaf persons in work settings and
could be
useful for other groups of students, such as students with learning disabilities.<P>

<b>The Efficacy of Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions in Identifying Hearing Loss
in
Children
with Developmental Disabilities</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30039 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to identify hearing loss in children
with
already confirmed disabilities using traditional audiometric screening and assessment
procedures
combined with recently developed technology using Transient Evoked Otoacoustic
Emissions
(TEOAE) testing; and (2) to compare the sensitivity and specificity of traditional
screening
programs with TEOAE testing programs in a group of normal children and a group of
children
identified as having one or more disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Approximately 750 students between the ages of 5 and 7 who are currently
classified
with one or more disabilities will be screened for possible hearing loss using TEOAE
and
traditional audiometric procedures.  The TEOAE testing procedure allows for a quick,
noninvasive test of cochlear function without assistance from the person being
evaluated, and
thus
is expected to allow for early detection among children with developmental disabilities in
particular. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will result in: (1) sensitivity and specificity
measures
of traditional pure tone screenings as compared to TEOAE screenings; (2) a
cost-effectiveness
comparison of TEOAE procedures and traditional audiometric screening techniques; (3)
recommendations for use of TEOAE with various degrees and types of developmental
disabilities
in children; (4) an analysis of demographic variables contributing to delayed
identification of
hearing loss among children confirmed as hearing-impaired; (5) data regarding the
perceived
utility of TEOAE to identify children with hearing loss in school settings; and (6) a
videotape
and
procedural manual.<P>

<b>Teaching Workplace Literacy</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180G40079 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will articulate how interactive instruction can be used to foster
higher
order thinking and how cooperative learning, specifically the group investigation
method, will
promote interpersonal skills development for secondary students with learning
disabilities. <P>

METHOD:  The first study will examine the effects of the interactive instructional model
on
higher order thinking in mathematics.  Relying on a mastery of basic mathematical
concepts,
students will use elementary spreadsheet skills to calculate averages, determine trends
in data,
and
ask "what if" questions.  The second study will build on Study 1 by linking math problem
solving
to expository writing.  Again, the interactive instructional model will be used.  The third
study
will
shift focus from higher order thinking to interpersonal skill development, examining the
integration of mathematical problem solving and expository writing in the context of
cooperative
learning. The final study will be an evaluation of our interactive instruction and
cooperative
learning practices to teaching workplace literacy at Phase 1 of secondary schools.  This
study
will
occur in mainstreamed classroom settings and will closely examine how the systematic
research
conducted earlier in experimental conditions translates into actual practice.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The main product of this project will be the Integrated
Learning
Curriculum, containing exercises for integrating mathematical problem solving,
expository
writing, and strategies for structuring cooperative learning groups for this kind of
instruction. 
This material will be designed explicitly for practitioners and inservice courses. 
Instructional
vignettes will also be recorded on videotape for further dissemination.<P>

<b>Computer-Assisted Cooperative Learning in Mathematics in Integrated Classrooms
for
Students
with and without Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N40027 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will analyze the effects of computer-assisted cooperative
learning in
mathematics instruction within integrated educational settings.<P>

METHOD:  In the first project year, heterogeneous students (including regular
education and
students with mild disabilities) in integrated classrooms will be grouped to learn math
with the
help of computer technology in class.  A commercial computer software package will be
used to
teach math concepts, computation, applications and problem solving.  Effects of
cooperative
learning will be examined by comparing this instructional method with traditional
whole-class
teaching and learning.  Subjects will include 120 5th-grade students, 30 of whom have
disabilities. 
Six math teachers will be randomly assigned either to cooperative learning or
whole-class
instruction.  In the second project year, computer-assisted math learning methods will
be used for
160 5th-grade students, of whom 40 have disabilities, in integrated classrooms.  Effects
of
cooperative learning with computer-assisted instruction compared to an individual
learning
method will be measured.  A pre-post test comparison group design with students
nested within
teachers will be used.  Outcome measures will assess students' math achievement,
attitudes
toward math and computer-assisted curricula, and social relationships among students
in the
integrated classrooms.  In addition, interviews will be conducted with the students with
disabilities
to investigate their attitudes and feelings in the class.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project staff will present study results at a regional
conference
for
regular education and special education teachers and practitioners.  Results will also be
presented
in at least two national conferences for professionals in math education and special
education. 
Furthermore, project findings will be published in journals addressing both research and
practical
applications.  Consultation will also be provided to local regular and special education
teachers
based on the procedures used and the results obtained in the studies.<P>

<b>Pathways for Learning</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H180A40069 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, demonstrate, evaluate, and disseminate effective
organizational support and professional development strategies that promote the
effective use of
technology, media, and materials (TMM) to improve learning outcomes for students with
disabilities in grades 1-8.<P>

METHOD:  Within the project approach, regular and special education teachers across
grade
levels (e.g., grades 1-3, 4-6, or 6-8) will form a Pathway Team. As a team they will
design,
implement, and evaluate curricula that span their grade levels, focus on outcomes that
revolve
around building deep understanding and communication, and integrate a variety of
TMM
applications to meet student needs.  A designated group of students, including those
with
cognitive, physical, sensory, and emotional disabilities will be included in the pathways. 
As a
group, these students will travel from one teacher on a Pathway Team to another
through
successive grades, provided with the technology they need to make all transitions
smooth.  Over
the 3 project years, staff will carry out a formative evaluation to gather evidence about
the
success
of the components, problems that arise, and repertoires of solutions devised.  Staff
members will
collect all data through observations of meetings and classroom instruction, interviews,
and
collection of work samples, as well as videotaping the progress of selected students. 
Intervention
efforts will combine organizational support and professional development, consisting of
three
structures to promote collaborative work among stakeholders: a district-wide
Coordinating
Committee, School Management Groups, and school-based Pathway Teams of
teachers. 
Electronic networks, video conferences, and print materials will support the work of
these three
structures.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As a result of this project, district administrators will
develop an
understanding of cooperation between stakeholders, a cadre of facilitators will be
created that can
promote change throughout school districts, and regular and special education teachers
will more
easily work together in collaborative Pathway Teams.<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antarctic explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard once said, "If you have the desire for knowledge and the power to give it physical expression, go out and explore." Though he said it more than 75 years ago, his words hold true for the seven of us who founded ZEGRAHM EXPEDITIONS. Over the past years, we've been fortunate to do exactly as Cherry-Garrard exhorted. As a team, we're in a position to share more than 80 years of expedition experience with you -- to give you the adventure of a lifetime.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Following our two wonderfully successful Round Britain voyages in 1995 and 1996, we are excited to announce that this outstanding expedition will also be offered in June of 1998 on board the 110 passenger vessel Caledonian Star. This is an action-packed itinerary with no days at sea and offers the very best of England, Scotland and Ireland, both north and south. It is the perfect blend of history, castles, breathtaking botanical gardens, impressive cliff scenery, quaint villages, charming people, a fantasia of birds and it even includes a visit to enigmatic Stonehenge. Our Round Britain voyage will put you in the midst of heathered moorlands, ancient woodlands, Neolithic monuments, stone abbeys and Celtic fortresses. Tarry in villages and islets with intriguing names such as Iona, Staffa, Saltee, St. Kilda, Flannan, the Orkneys and Shetlands. Or sit surrounded by comical puffins on an uninhabited island.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our Round Britain voyage has something for everyone...history, culture, and the most impressive coastal scenery in Europe.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those of you who love the sea, we invite you to join us as we rediscover the romance and magic of Robert Louis Stevenson's South Pacific aboard the world's most elegant sailing vessel, the Wind Song.  Steep yourself in crystalline blue lagoons, snow-white beaches, sheer volcanic ridges, deep gorges and waterfalls, luxuriantly warm tropical waters, wildlife pursuits and archaeological treasures.  The overwhelming beauty of the exotic Marquesas, Tuamotus, Tongan and Fiji Islands, among the many others we will visit, is perfectly complemented by the luxurious accommodations of the 140-passenger Wind Song, the sleek 440-foot motor-sailing schooner.  Additional Zodiacs, the key to successful expedition cruising, will be brought on board for all three voyages, and of course our team of naturalists and historians will be on hand to offer daily recaps and briefings, as well as lectures and informal discussions both aboard and ashore.  Three itineraries have been planned:<P>
<IMG SRC="tiki.gif" ALT="tiki.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=360>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail I</B>--This first expedition sails through the Tuamotus, 76 atoll islands which are coral edifices, rising from the sea just high enough above the waves to be called islands.  Snorkeling and diving opportunities here are superb.  Afterwards, we sail for the Marquesas, considered to be one of the most stunning and least accessible island groups in the Pacific.<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail II</B>--This second voyage sails west from Papeete for the Cook Archipelago, where native birds still abound.  The Wind Song's billowy sails then carry us across the sea to Niue and the Kingdom of Tonga, stopping at islands in the remote, northwest corner of Polynesia, including Walls and Futuna, and concluding our exploration in Fiji to a chorus of "Bula," the traditional Fijian greeting.<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail III</B>--This itinerary retraces the route of Polynesia Under Sail II, beginning its journey in the lush paradise of Fiji and disembarking in Tahiti at the end of May.<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Polynesia Under Sail Update</B>--After learning that the Wind Song would not be returning to the South Pacific in 1998, we are taking another two charters through the Tuamotus and Marquesas, October 10-22, 1997 and October 19-November 2, 1997. Both itineraries will be similar to Polynesia Under Sail I, but we will disembark and embark passengers in the Marquesas (Nuka Hiva).  An Easter Island extension will be offered to both voyages.  For a brochure, contact our office.<P>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is with great excitement that we invite you to join us on an expedition on board the 42-passenger Coral Princess across the top of Australia from the Great Barrier Reef to the Outback.  Over the first few days we will explore the national parks of the Cape York Peninsula and its rich rainforest, numerous rivers and interesting geological formations with the added opportunity to snorkel and dive on the Great Barrier Reef.  After stopping in the Torres Strait Islands and exploring Thursday Island we will set foot on the most northerly point of mainland Australia.  Continuing across the Gulf of Carpenteria we will make landfall in Arnhem Land where we are guest of the Aborigines.<P><IMG SRC="digirido.gif" ALT="digirido.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH=310 HEIGHT=190><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We stop in the Wessel Islands to view traditional rock paintings and our on board experts will lead nature walks in the Cobourg Peninsula.  This voyage offers a singular opportunity to explore a land of mystery and intrigue, with fascinating plants and animals found nowhere else in Australia.  As alluring as Australia is for naturalists, the age-old traditions of the Aboriginal people heighten the country's appeal for the curious traveler.

<IMG SRC="peru.gif" ALT="peru.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=403>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peru is truly a travelers paradise and offers everything from glistening 20,000 foot peaks to such awe-inspiring sites as Machu Picchu, lost city of the Incas, and the pristine Amazon forest, where the wildlife is exuberant, diverse and abundant.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our itinerary begins in Lima, with its wonderful collection of Spanish colonial architecture and museums.  Next we visit Perus largest reserve, Manu National Park, which has the highest biodiversity on earth.  This is the primordial Amazon at its best.  Leaving the forests, we return to Cuzco and the Sacred Valley of the Incas.  With the help of local guides, we will visit the major archaeological sites of the Inca Empire, including Sacsayhuaman, Pisac and Ollantaytambo.  No visit to Peru is complete without visiting Machu Picchu.  Neither words nor photographs could ever fully describe the majesty, mystery, and magic of this hallowed site.  Perched high above the raging Urubamba River, atop a forested mountain crest, Machu Picchu is the perfect union of human artistry and the wildness of the natural environment.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We invite you to join us on this expedition of discovery and adventure that marks the dawn of a new era of explorations into this fascinating country.

<IMG SRC="chile1.gif" ALT="chile1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=140 HEIGHT=230>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Join us in November 1998 as we sail along the Western Coast of South America on a voyage to the Lands of Humboldt & Darwin.  Boarding our expedition vessel in Ecuador, we sail southward along the coasts of Peru and Chile, where stupendous natural beauty is manifest in contrasting climates, vegetation and wildlife.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Peru we photograph the ruins of Chan Chan - largest adobe city in the world - and fly over the famous Nazca Lines.  Our overland excursions in Chile include a visit to Lauca National Park, one of South Americas most spectacular wildlife heritages located high in the Andes mountains.  We also venture into the Atacama Desert, one of the driest and most barren - but also one of the most bewitching - regions of our planet.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We journey the length of the nutrient-rich waters of the Humboldt Current to witness some of our planets greatest concentrations of birds, whales, seals, and dolphins.  Our visit is timed to coincide with the vast number of migrating seabirds as they head south from their Arctic breeding grounds.  A third of the world 321 species of seabirds can be seen, plus beaches crammed with hundreds of sea lions, and seas alive with dolphins and whales.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Delve into a realm of fresh experiences, mysteries and adventures on this comprehensive expedition, and discover the highlights of the West Coast of South America.  The brochure for this expedition will be ready in the spring of 1997.  However, if you are interested in joining us on this unique voyage, call our office to be placed on our Interest List.  This will ensure that you receive an early copy of the brochure, with first choice of available cabins.<BR>

<IMG SRC="egypt1.gif" ALT="egypt1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=306>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We have designed an Egypt expedition which includes not only the well known sites of Giza, Luxor and Abu Simbel, but also locations which are off the beaten path such as Dahshur, Bubastis and Abydos.  Our expedition leader, Emily Teeter, is a Ph.D. in Egyptology and Assistant Curator at the Oriental Institute Museum of the University of Chicago.  Emilys in-depth knowledge of Egypt has determined the pace and timing of our itinerary, so that we avoid crowds at the more popular sites and have extra time where a temple or suq is particularly captivating.  Her connections in this country allow for the inclusion of special receptions at the American Reassert Center in Cairo and the Chicago House in Luxor, as well as private presentations by some of her associates currently working in the country.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both of our 1997 expeditions are currently waitlisted.  However, we encourage anyone who is interested to add their name to our waitlist, as cancellations do occur.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Explore with us the rare and fascinating wonders of India - a place of beauty and drama where you will experience a colorful diversity of natural history and, at the same time, embrace 5,000 years of dramatic cultural history.  Imagine the heart-pumping excitement of searching for one-horned rhino at Kaziranga National Park while sitting atop an elephant; the thrill of watching a herd of bison silhouetted against a jade-green dawn sky at Kanha National Park; or the fascination of watching the antics of a nesting painted stork at Bharatpur National Park.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="india.gif" ALT="india.gif" WIDTH=180 HEIGHT=180></CENTER>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our action-packed, 18 day itinerary begins in Bharatpur National Park, where we encounter vast numbers of waterbirds as we explore the area using bicycle-drawn rickshaws.  At Bandhavgarh National Park, we will use 4X4 vehicles and elephant-backs to search out the diverse and abundant wildlife, including leopards and a variety of deer.  Next is Kanha National Park, probably our best opportunity to locate Indias king of beasts, the tiger.  Our Indian odyssey ends at the hauntingly beautiful Kaziranga National Park, where herds of wild buffaloes and elephants are often seen in the dawn mist.  One-horned rhinoceroses, leopards, and many species of deer are found in the park, which also supports a sizable tiger population.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Join us in late June, 1998 for a voyage along the Kamchatka Peninsula, through the Commander Islands (Bering Island), the Aleutians, Pribilofs, St. Matthew and St. Lawrence Islands to Nome, Alaska.  This action-packed itinerary will follow in the footsteps of Vitus Bering, the Danish explorer who charted the Siberian and Alaskan coasts in the 18th century.  Our route is rich in geology, wildlife and natural history and on-board naturalists enhance our shore experiences with informal discussions and recaps.<BR>
<IMG SRC="kamchat1.gif" ALT="kamchat1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=220 HEIGHT=120>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We have planned this itinerary for early in the summer season, when wildlife is active and wildflowers are in full bloom.  The enormous, active volcanos of the Kamchatka Peninsula, some over 14,000 feet, provide a stunning backdrop for snow sheep, Siberian bighorn, more than 180 species of birds.  We are on the lookout for Stellar sea eagles, and may even see brown bear as we explore this remote region.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Crossing the International Date Line from Russia to the United States, we cruise amongst the Aleutian Islands - the tops of a submerged mountain chain strung along the southern edge of the Bering Sea.  This archipelago is rich in wildlife, and we observe colonies of northern fur seals, Stellars sea lions and sea otters.  Several species of whales, including gray and orca, frequent the cold, northern water, and more than 250 species of birds inhabit the islands - among them horned puffins, whiskered auklets and northern fulmars.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Continuing to the Pribilofs, then on to St. Matthews and St. Lawrence islands, we come upon thousands more nesting seabirds, and learn about the discovery by Vitus Bering of the strait which bears his name, and separates two continents so narrowly that their cultures are freely intermingled.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The brochure for this expedition will be ready in the spring of 1997.  However, if you are interested in joining us on this unique voyage, call our office to be placed on our Interest List.  This will ensure that you receive an early copy of the brochure, with first choice of available cabins.<BR>

With Russian icebreakers now available for commercial use, we will set off from Resolute, the only settlement on Cornwallis Island, aboard the Kapitan Khlebnikov. Discover with us why Baffin Island, which boasts a rich cultural history of over 4,000 years, is considered the jewel in the crown of the Canadian Arctic.  Off of Baffin's coast, we hope to spot beluga whales, the endangered--now protected--bowhead whale and the elusive narwhal.  Botany, archaeology, geology, cultural and natural history--this voyage encompasses it all.<BR>
<IMG SRC="puffins.gif" ALT="puffins.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=280 HEIGHT=150>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Photographers will be delighted as backdrops of snowcapped peaks, majestic glaciers, deep fjords and rolling tundra provide breathtaking scenery and unrivaled photo opportunities.  This unprecedented expedition, which includes visits with the local people and exposure to the traditional Inuit culture, is a wonderful combination of the rich culture, abundant wildlife, and captivating history of early Arctic exploration.

</CENTER>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We created ZEGRAHM EXPEDITIONS in October 1990 for one clear reason: to offer travelers the most intriguing adventure in our world, whether by land or sea. While we believe expedition yachts and small ships to be one of the best methods of environmentally-responsible travel, there are some areas off the beaten -path that can't be reached by ship. We want to share those with our travelers as well, so some of ZEGRAHM's adventures utilize other modes of transportation, always considering the environmental implications and safety first.
Because of our experience in expedition travel, you can rest assured that when we say adventure, we're not talking about the windward side of an island in the Caribbean. We're talking about the unfrequented Northwest and Northeast passages, the great continent of Antarctica, the secret Asmat and in-depth sojourns in the islands of the South Pacific and Indian Oceans.
We keep the number of travelers to each destination small to allow members personal contact with their leaders and naturalist experts, making each trip truly expeditionary in nature. Most expeditions are led by one or more of ZEGRAHM's experienced founders.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So what is the meaning of the word ZEGRAHM? It's not Swiss or Swahili, but represents the confluence of the names of the company's founders. ZE is for Zehnder and Zuckerman. GR is for Grove. AH is backwards for Harrison (he's a bit of a strange bird anyway). M is for Messick and Metz.

<IMG SRC="blubooby.gif" ALT="blubooby.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"WIDTH=160 HEIGHT=207>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To visit the Galapagos is like returning to <IMG SRC="iguana.gif" ALT="iguana.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=366>Eden--where else can you swim with penguins and dolphins, walk among giant tortoises or snorkel with ever-playful sea lions?  Zegrahm and Eco Expeditions have designed the ultimate Galapagos itinerary--a 10-day expedition that travels further and sees more.  As we explore these starkly beautiful islands, famous as the birthplace of Darwin's theories of evolution, we will learn about the evolution of the unique animals, birds and plants as well as the ecosystem and geologic formations that make the islands so magical.  Traveling aboard a luxurious 18-passenger yacht, our groups are small and intimate in size, with an impressive passenger to naturalist ratio.  Nowhere else will you find a 10-day expedition that visits thirteen different islands, renowned for the total fearlessness of their wildlife.  Expect to be stunned by the rare spectrum of species--flightless cormorants, marine iguanas, brown noddies, the Galapagos penguin and greater flamingos.  Our adventure in the Galapagos offers you not simply a routine vacation, but the very best of the Enchanted Islands which are a unique part of humankind's natural heritage.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This voyage aboard the M/V World Discoverer incorporates all of the best elements of an expedition to Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, including stops at several rarely-visited areas. Our voyage will follow in the wake of Sir Ernest Shackleton, from Antarctica to Elephant Island and on to South Georgia. We will spend five days on the Antarctic Peninsula and a day in the South Orkney Islands before continuing to the natural wonderland of South Georgia. This wildlife sanctuary harbors thousands upon thousands of king penguins, the second largest and perhaps the most beautiful of all penguin species. In fact, you will have the opportunity to see and photograph as many as seven different penguin species on this voyage!<BR>
<IMG SRC="albatros.gif" ALT="albatros.gif" ALIGN="MIDDLE" WIDTH=331 HEIGHT=132><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We will also see four species of albatross, including the majestic wandering albatross - the world's largest seabird.<BR>

<IMG SRC="penguin2.gif" ALT="penguin2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=223 HEIGHT=238>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Zegrahm Expeditions is the only tour operator that offers this very unique program to this remote wonderland made famous by the British polar explorer, Sir Ernest Shackleton. Aboard the M/S Explorer, we begin with four exceptional days in the Falkland Islands. Besides boasting the largest albatross colony in the world, there are also thousands of endearing rockhopper, gentoo, and Magellanic penguins. Our eight days at South Georgia, with nearly 18 hours of daylight, will provide magnificent opportunities to visit the colonies of thousands upon thousands of majestic king penguins. Four species of albatross have chosen South Georgia as their breeding residence, including the largest flying bird in the world - the wandering albatross. Whether you are interested in history, wildlife, birds, or photography, this voyage will be an unforgettable experience. Our previous two Circumnavigation of South Georgia & the Falkland Islands expeditions were extremely popular and sold out early. We anticipate the same to be true for our 1996 voyage.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Botswana is the epitome of a romantic, vintage Africa...an Africa that has virtually disappeared from the rest of this <IMG SRC="zebra.gif" ALT="zebra.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=185>once animal-abundant continent.  The diversity of both animals and habitats is truly amazing - large herds of elephants and buffaloes, over 350 species of birds, and all of the major predators--lions, leopards, cheetahs and wild dogs.  We will spend five days exploring the wide, expansive plains around Mombo Camp, just off the northwestern tip of Chief's Island.  At Jedibe Island Camp, activities include daily mokoro excursions, forays in a double-decker house boat, nature walks and some of the best freshwater fishing action.  Game viewing at King's Pool Camp in the Linyanti area is nothing short of spectacular.  This region supports a wide variety of species, but it is most noted for its very large elephant population which can reach enormous densities.  All of the major predators, including lions, leopards, cheetahs, and hyenas, are regularly sighted at King's Pool Camp.  Our Botswana itinerary is based on twenty years' experience in leading expeditions to Africa.  It is not simply a safari but a journey back in time to the Africa of yesteryear.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of our Antarctica expeditions depart from either South America or the Falkland Islands and visit the Antarctic Peninsula region. Our 37-day Far Side expedition, however, will begin in Port Elizabeth, South Africa and journey to the seldom-visited sub-Antarctic islands of Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen and Heard. All of these islands boast incredible scenery and prolific wildlife including king, gentoo, macaroni and rockhopper penguins as well as nesting wandering albatross and colonies of elephant and fur seals.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With our icebreaker, Kapitan Khlebnikov, we continue south through the dense pack ice and spend 10 days exploring the spectacular coastline of East Antarctica where a maze of gigantic tabular icebergs lie frozen in the fast ice. Located in this area are more than 8 dozen large emperor penguin colonies. With our two on-board helicopters and a full 24 hours of daylight we will have ample opportunities to visit and photograph several colonies of these extraordinary penguins. In addition, we plan to visit a number of research stations manned by various countries including Russia, China and Australia. Our adventure ends in Fremantle Australia, just in time to get home for the holidays.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Madagascar, the fourth largest island in the world and a mini-continent in its own right, was christened "the naturalists' promised land" by French naturalist Philibert Commerson.  Madagascar separated from the coast of Africa over 65 million years ago and in its isolation has become a laboratory for evolution, giving birth to wildly strange creatures and plants.  Among the endless surprises we will encounter on this 19-day adventure is the most ancient of all living primates, the exotic lemur.  Madagascar is also home to over half of the world's chameleon species and boasts one of the richest floras in the world.  Two full days of the trip will be devoted entirely to exploring Madagascar's most celebrated reserve, the Berenty Reserve.  Here we can expect to find ring-tailed lemurs, famous for their complete lack of fear and gibbon-like sifakas only an arm's length from the camera lens.  Our Madagascar expedition is ideal for participants who possess a true spirit of adventure akin to that of the early explorers--it is the essence of adventure travel and the destination of a lifetime.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Join us for the ultimate winter expedition: a place of warm sun and blue skies, palm trees and sparkling coral lagoons.  Wildlife galore and endless photographic opportunities await travelers on our forthcoming <IMG SRC="angelfsh.gif" ALT="angelfsh.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=100>Indian Ocean expedition.  We begin in the island paradise of the Seychelles, home to the largest concentrations of seabirds in the Indian Ocean, as well as giant tortoises and some of the rarest land birds in the world, not to mention over 150 species of coral and a <IMG SRC="lemrtree.gif" ALT="lemrtree.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=202>fantasia of fish in every color imaginable--a snorkeler and scuba diver's dream come true!  After the Seychelles we visit Madagascar, a haven for close encounters with wide-eyed lemurs, rainbow-colored chameleons and hundreds of endemic birds.  The expedition doesn't stop there, however.  On board the 110-passenger Caledonian Star we sail to the lush Comoros Islands and finally to Zanzibar, the Spice Island, which has lured travelers to its shores for centuries in search of trade, plunder and adventure.  Passengers with a few extra days may want to consider our Seychelles Island Precruise.  For the perfect escape from winter and an unforgettable introduction to the enchantment of some of the least-visited travel destinations in the world, join us next February as we sail the warm waters of the Indian Ocean.

</CENTER>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the past six years that we have been offering trips to Indonesia, Bali has been primarily a jumping off point at the beginning our itineraries.  However, those of our travelers who chose to spend a few days on their own in Bali invariably came back with glowing reports of the islands serene, emerald green beauty and the peaceful, yet intensely spiritual and colorful Balinese people - and we decided it was high time we created our own special itinerary focusing on this "Land of Waking Dreams."<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This program is a "hands-on" cultural immersion in the daily lives of the Balinese.  We slip into another mode of life - starting the day, as many Balinese do, with yoga.  We wander through markets accompanied by our hosts, who point out and explain the significance and use of myriad colorful wares.  We meander among rice paddies and walk in the beautiful and remote northern highlands in a small group or, if we wish, completely alone - soaking in the ambiance of this lush land.  Not only do we meet master woodcarvers, shadow puppeteers and environmentalists, but we have the opportunity to watch them ply their trade and even to participate in it with them:  as when we try our hand at playing an instrument in a Gamelan orchestra - the heartbeat of Bali; or learn from a talented herbalist who demonstrates the application of traditional medicine.<BR>
<IMG SRC="hanuman.gif" ALT="hanuman.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=300>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unique in primarily Muslim Indonesia, the Balinese are mostly Hindu and a focus of our visit will be the important Hindu concept of <I>Tri Hita Karana</I> - the inter-relationship of the people, the gods and the land.  We are provided with, and encouraged to wear, traditional Balinese dress - sorong, sashes and kebaya - as we will join in the celebration of <I>Galungan</I>, Balis most important festival.  This will be quite a powerful experience, for it is believed that all the gods, including the supreme deity Sanghyang Widi, return to Bali at this time.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This one-of-a-kind itinerary is possible largely because of our close friend Hans Iluk.  Seven years ago, he decided to make his home in Ubud, the arts and cultural center of Bali, and runs the beautiful and hospitable guesthouse <I>Alam Indah</I>.  Set amongst rice-terraced highlands in a tranquil river valley of Ubud, <I>Alam Indah</I> will be our homebase on this program.  Hans has worked closely with his longtime friends, William Ingram and Jean Howe, to create a program that introduces the Balinese view of life in a personal and participatory way.  Jean and William have been organizing cultural tours in Bali since 1990.  They live in Ubud, with the Balinese family Jean first met in 1987.  Presently, they offer only a few small tours a year.  As Jean says, "We could run tours throughout the year, but then wed have no time to be with the Balinese, and the Balinese we work with would have no time for their culture."<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After devoting 11 days to Bali, we end our Indonesian experience in Sulawesis Torajaland, an equally unique and fascinating place.  The Torajans believe that they originally descended from "Pleiades," and have built homes to resemble the skyships which carried their ancestors to earth.  We explore traditional villages and haunting death cliffs where replicas of the dead, called Tau Taus, stare down at us from carved balconies.  This is a perfect ending to our Indonesian <I>Journey of Waking Dreams</I>.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This in-depth look at the fascinating cultures of Bali and Torajaland necessitates a small group of travelers, and therefore we have limited participation to 17.  Those who join us are guaranteed the kind of specialized and intimate visit which one would expect when visiting a personal friend.  If you are interested in immersing yourself in a <B><I>Journey of Waking Dreams</I></B>, give Kristy a call.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The post-extension to our <B><I>Journey of Waking Dreams</I></B> excursion takes us to Camp Leaky and Tanjung Puting Reserve in South Central Borneo.  The reserve is home to orangutans who have been orphaned due to poaching and natural causes.  Here, they are cared for and taught survival skills in preparation for their release into the wild.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From our accommodation at the Rimba Lodge, we discover an ecologically diverse area of wetlands, lowlands, swamp forest and hardwood rain forest.  A journey upriver by Klotok brings us to nearby Camp Leaky, where Dr. Birute Galdikas conducted her orangutan research project for over 20 years.  En route, we search for kingfishers, hornbills, gibbons and proboscis monkeys.  Led by Hans Iluk, our small group will experience the thrill of seeing orangutans in their natural habitat and learn more about the valuable research and conservation programs of this famous camp.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kimberley is notable for being the last great empty section of the Australian continent to <IMG SRC="jabiru.gif" ALT="jabiru.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=426>be explored.  Imagine a region larger than Britain with only two major roads, limited access to the coast and hundreds of islands.  In short, an area ideal for exploration by sea.  As passengers of the Coral Princess, we will enjoy all the comforts of this modern expedition vessel whose maneuverability makes her perfectly suited for navigating the mighty rivers and scenic inlets of the Kimberley.  In <IMG SRC="lizard.gif" ALT="lizard.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=155>addition, we will use a specially designed excursion boat that allows us to explore narrow gorges and shallow tributaries, including a spectacular canyon on the King George River where vertical cliffs and mangroves line its shore and the final destination is the breath-taking King George Falls.  Not confined to travel by sea, we will take to the air for an overflight of the Bungle Bungle in Purnululu National Park and a helicopter flight to the Mitchell Plateau.  From the tidal phenomena at the Montgomery Reef and the horizontal waterfalls near Talbot Bay to the exotic wildlife...the Kimberley has it all.

</CENTER>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not until the beginning of the 19th century did men even dare to explore the unknown and isolated North. Today, however, we are able to offer voyages that men could only dream of just a few years ago. The main reason for this is the fleet of Russian icebreakers which has become available to the Western world. Russia owns an impressive fleet of powerful icebreakers, staffed with some of the most experienced crew and officers, many of whom have lived their lives in the High Arctic. The North Pole awaits us as we head north from Murmansk (Russia) across the Barents Sea to Franz Joseph Land, with its volcanic mountains and glaciers. Our landings include Cape Flora, noted for its abundance of mosses and lichens, and Rubini Rock and other seabird colonies, where we see dovekies, guillemots, kittiwakes and a variety of nesting Arctic birds. From the helicopters we have incredible views of glaciers, icebergs and volcanic plateaus.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We continue through the ice to the North Pole, on board the worlds most powerful icebreaker, the 75,000 horsepower <I>Yamal</I>. We navigate through vast ice floes, pressure ridges and hummocks up to three meters thick. We encounter polar bears, walruses, and ivory gulls. We celebrate our arrival to the North Pole and 90 N with a barbecue on the ice. Heading southward we stop at Novaya Zemlya and Ice Bay, where Wilhelm Barents and his party overwintered. On Vaigach Island we explore the tundra and may visit the Nentsy, a reindeer herding people.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Join Zegrahm co-founder Anna Zuckerman-Vdovenko on this wondrous journey to the North Pole. 1997 will be Zegrahms eighth season in this area and Annas tenth voyage to the Pole - surely this must be a record!

"I cannot imagine a more knowledgeable nor more pleasant staff than that which Zegrahm Expeditions provided.  I anticipate joining you again soon and have already convinced my husband, among other "recruits," that there is simply nothing on this planet that compare to what you have to offer.  Be sure to mail me results of your "recci" trip to Norway as it sounds intriguing."<BR>
C.B. - California<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"My Safari of a Lifetime in Madagascar was an excellent adventure - the fascinating and exotic lemurs, the unusual birds and chameleons, and the friendly people!  The exploration of the island with Pete and Renee was exciting and fantastic...."<BR>
B.G. - California<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"What an amazing (Asmat) adventure we all had, my mind is still flooded with memories of the people and places - single threads interwoven into a rich tapestry.  A kaleidoscope of vivid impressions, textures, colors, sights, sounds, scents, tastes and feelings.  Such an educational and enriching experience, that will be with me for a long while to come."<BR>
L.B. - California<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"The wonder and beauty of this adventure may best be measured as four to seven rolls of film per day, but the care and planning by Zegrahm staff goes beyond all rules of measure.  P.S.  Puffins are reported to eat fish, but they gobble up photo film!"<BR>
B.L.<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"The Ultimate Antarctica trip was that and more because of the very fine service given by your staff and the Russian staff and crew.  Your choice of the ship (and helicopters) was a pleasant surprise.  Zegrahms thoughtfulness from the very beginning was beyond my expectations.  From now on my travels are with Zegrahm."<BR>
B.S. - Montana<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"(Seychelles, Madagascar, Comoros & Zanzibar) was a most excellent voyage!  We had unforgettable experiences!  All, really all of the great staff deserve a "AAA" - Mike and Sonja, Jack Grove, Peter Harrison and Shirley Metz, Pete Oxford and Rene Bish....The crew and the captain were excellent, the ship was very good.  All excursions - on sea (snorkeling!) and on land - were fabulous, and Lynne was most efficient too, when we met her in Dar es Salaam."<BR>
F.B. - Germany<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>
"Having just returned from your Antarctic expedition I have nothing but praise and commendation for the way the entire trip was handled.  The landings and shore trips were expertly and efficiently planned and executed - the staff members were superb and the lectures excellent.  It was a delightful adventure and thank you!"<BR>
D.A. - California<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"Back in New York after an incredible adventure in Indonesia.  The boat, the crew, Sonja, Mike... and of course Tobias enriched the trip tremendously.  Bravo!  Next time.... Antarctica!"<BR>
C.S. - New York<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"Norway, Franz Josef Land and Spitsbergen I will never forget.  An experience far beyond my expectations.  I made it a point to really "take it in" - every phase, every single day.  Nature as I have never seen or experienced before.  The wonderful polar bears, seals, walruses and the multitude of birds.  The sea, the ice, the superb leadership, the lecturers disseminating so much information and knowledge.  Every member of the organization giving her or his best.  Very impressive."<BR>
H.K. - Colorado<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"I have to tell you that my (Galapagos) expedition exceeded all my expectations.  The Galapagos Islands are indeed "enchanted" but our leaders and guides made the trip the marvelous experience it was....Now Im preparing to depart for Round Britain and cant wait to see my dear friends, Peter and Rene, Peter and Shirley, and Mike and Sonja.  What a wonderful world of shared experiences Zegrahm is creating!"<BR>
M.C. - Arizona<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"Jeanne and I feel that Zegrahm has a WINNER in the Kimberley Expedition, and want to thank you for your effort in making our expedition a truly wonderful experience..  The scenery  from the air, sea and the land was truly outstanding.  We continue to marvel at the waterfalls and the rock formations and colors.  It was greater than we had expected and the various wildlife  we viewed (turtle nesting in the daytime) was a big plus.  The adventure of getting to the various places made it even more of a thrill!  We loved the trip and the Zegrahm and Coral Princess crew and staff made it one that we will always remember.  You keep establishing expeditions like this and we will keep coming!!!!"<BR>
D.S. - Illinois<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"Thank you for a wonderful adventure to the Antarctic this past January.  It could not have been any better or more educational.  Your staff was terrific.  Peter and Shirley, Sonja and Mike, Conrad and Carmen, and John Splettstoesser....you have a group of people one can be proud of!  We felt very well cared for not just on the ship but with our air connections and luggage.  In the future we will travel with Zegrahm when we really want to learn and experience.  Thank you much!"<BR>
Z.G. - Washington<BR>
<HR WIDTH=20% ALIGN=CENTER>
"All of you, thank you for making our trips with Zegrahm so easy and painless!  We appreciate your help and TLC!"<BR>
D.P. - Washington<BR>

<TITLE>ANTARCTICA, SOUTH GEORGIA AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS BROCHURE</TITLE>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=6>Antarctica, South Georgia<BR>
&amp; The Falkland Islands</FONT></B><BR>
29 January - 17 February 1998<BR>
20 Tour Days</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Dear Adventurer,</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty million years ago, Antarctica broke away from South America and became the worlds fifth largest continent. As the oceans flowed freely around the isolated land mass and temperate and polar waters mixed, the Antarctic continent cooled and ice sheets blanketed the land. The result - a vast white desert which holds over 90 percent of the worlds fresh water. Antarcticas images are breathtaking. The wildlife, surrounded by a frozen pageantry of icebergs, glistening white glaciers and towering snow-capped peaks, offers unparalleled observation and photographic opportunities.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our voyage to Antarctica, South Georgia, and the Falkland Islands is scheduled during the height of the austral summer, when penguin rookeries are full of busy adults tending their hungry chicks. We will spend many hours watching the comical antics and curious personalities of Antarcticas &quot;ambassadors&quot;.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our vessel was specifically designed for passenger expeditions and her ice-hardened hull allows her to navigate easily in the most rugged natural environments. Critical to our expedition are her fleet of Zodiacs, which quickly and safely transport us to shore, allowing easy access to otherwise remote penguin colonies, seal rookeries and research stations. As the sun does not sink far below the horizon during this time of year, we will maximize our time ashore with landings early in the morning or even after dinner.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zegrahm &amp; Eco Expeditions well deserve the reputation for being the most experienced operator in Antarctica: combined, our leaders have visited the Great White Continent more than 250 times! Based on our experience, we have incorporated all of the best elements of an expedition to Antarctica and the sub-Antarctic islands, including stops at several rarely-visited areas. Our voyage will follow in the wake of Sir Ernest Shackleton, from Antarctica to Elephant Island and on to South Georgia. We will spend six days on the Antarctic Peninsula and a day in the &quot;Inaccessible Islands&quot; - the magnificent South Orkneys - before continuing to the little-known natural wonderland of South Georgia.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wildlife sanctuary harbors thousands upon thousands of rarely-seen king penguins, the second largest and perhaps the most beautiful of all penguin species. The South Georgia Islands are also home to gentoo, chinstrap and macaroni penguins and four types of albatross, including the majestic wandering albatross - the worlds largest seabird with a wing span of up to 13 feet! Many protected bays hold the remains of abandoned whaling stations, mute testimony to this lucrative and risky enterprise in the South Atlantic during the early 20th century. During our three days here, as we walk beaches crammed with elephant and fur seals, we will observe the largest concentration of wildlife anywhere in the world. Finally, we reach the starkly beautiful Falkland Islands, with extensive populations of rockhopper, gentoo and Magellenic penguins as well as the regal black-browed albatross.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Antarctica, South Georgia and Falkland Islands expedition offers the experience of treading where no one may have been before as we land our Zodiacs on barren shores to observe masses of raucous penguins or colonies of albatross. For Antarcticans, history buffs, birders, photographers and lovers of wilderness areas this voyage should be one of lifes mandatory experiences. We hope you can join us!</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Itinerary</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>29 January</FONT><BR>
Miami</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gather this evening at the Miami International Airport for our flight to Santiago.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>30 January</FONT><BR>
Santiago, Chile</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrive Santiago early this morning and check-in to our hotel. Spend the rest of the day relaxing or sightseeing in Chiles cosmopolitan capital city.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>31 January</FONT><BR>
Santiago / Port Stanley, Falkland Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fly to Port Stanley and explore the charming town before embarking the World Discoverer. We set sail this evening for Antarctica.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>01 - 02 February</FONT><BR>
Drake Passage</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Named for the 16th century English seaman, Drake Passage is a deep waterway spanning 600 miles from the southern tip of South America to the South Shetland Islands. As we cruise this historic passage, our lecturers present fascinating discussions on birds and marine life. Strolling the decks, we have opportunities to see and photograph the wandering and black-browed albatrosses that wheel over the white-capped seas in company with sooty shearwaters and white-chinned petrels. We keep a lookout for the whales that are often seen in these waters.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>03 - 06 February</FONT><BR>
Antarctic Peninsula</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We cruise the waters of the Antarctic Peninsula and its adjacent islands, making several landings each day. We plan to visit research stations and witness the scientific activities conducted by the multi-national community of scientists working there. Weather and ice conditions will determine our daily schedules. Though the expeditionary nature of our voyage precludes guaranteeing specific stops, the World Discoverer plans to visit the following places:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Deception Island</B> - As we approach Deception through Neptunes Bellows, a channel just wide enough for our ship to navigate, the majestic albatross leave us and are replaced by flocks of southern fulmars and pintado petrels. Our anchorage is inside a volcano, whose collapsed cone was filled by rushing seawater. Brave souls may dip into the warm thermal waters near Pendulum Cove to experience swimming in the Antarctic! Weather permitting, we make a landing on the outside of the caldera at a colony of more than 100,000 nesting chinstrap penguins.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Torgersen and Anvers Islands</B> - Thousands of Ad&eacute;lie penguins, named for the wife of an early Antarctic explorer, greet us as we land on Torgersen Island. Just opposite Torgersen is Anvers Island, home of the U.S. Palmer Research Station. We go ashore to observe wildlife, returning to the ship as sunset glows from mountain peaks.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Lemaire Channel and Petermann Island </B>- Cruising the beautiful Lemaire Channel, we keep watch for the humpback and minke whales often spotted here. This narrow channel is one of the most spectacularly scenic areas of the Antarctic Peninsula. Steep mountain peaks jut up out of the sea on both sides and the waters surrounding our vessel are often choked with icebergs and frequented by crabeater seals. At the south end of the Channel, we stop at Petermann Island, where vistas of high mountains and glaciers provide a dramatic backdrop for colonies of blue-eyed shags, Gentoo and Ad&eacute;lie penguins.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Port Lockroy, Neumeyer Channel </B>- Large bleached whale bones attest to this anchorages whaling history. On a low-lying island in the bay, we can photograph gentoo penguins and blue-eyed shags, or enjoy the dramatic 360-degree panorama of alpine peaks. Crabeater and leopard seals dot the ice floes alongside our vessel.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Paradise Bay</B> - In our Zodiacs, we weave our way amongst fantastic icebergs, sculpted by wind and water, and approach the immense glaciers which rim this beautiful bay. Blue-eyed shags mingle with other seabirds as we go ashore and set foot on the Antarctic Continent. We can observe nesting gentoo penguins, or catch sight of a blubbery Weddell seal on shore.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Paulet Island / Antarctic Sound</B> - In an area of often heavy ice concentrations, Paulet Island sits at the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula and on the border of the Weddell Sea. Huge numbers of Ad&eacute;lie penguins as well as significant numbers of other breeding birds are found here. Remnants of the hut built during the Nordenskjold expedition is located nearby. The spectacular Antarctic Sound separates several offshore islands from the tip of the mainland. Numerous large tabular icebergs from the neighboring ice shelves provide fabulous scenery.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>07 February</FONT><BR>
Elephant Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrive this morning at Elephant Island, made famous by the survival saga of the Shackleton Expedition. Awesome glaciers, speckled with pink algae, create a dramatic backdrop. Weather permitting, we plan to make an expedition stop on the island.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>08 February</FONT><BR>
South Orkney Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These mountainous islands were once known as &quot;The Inaccessible Islands.&quot; In winter, this group is actually joined to the Antarctic Peninsula, some 450 miles away, by a solid sheet of fast ice. Arriving on Laurie Island, we make our way up to the plateau of the island where a scene of unparalleled beauty awaits us. Once on the plateau, for as far as we can see, penguins everywhere!<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>09 February</FONT><BR>
South Scotia Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lecture series continues with presentations and informal discussions with our naturalists. They will recap our visits to Elephant Island and the South Orkneys, and introduce us to the South Georgia Islands.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>10 - 12 February</FONT><BR>
South Georgia Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexibility in this area is a must. All of our expedition leaders have been to South Georgia numerous times and, if the weather is in our favor, we may want to have a landing before breakfast or even after dinner. Well call at some of the many islands, bays and coves where outstanding birdlife and fur seals can be seen close at hand - a photographers paradise. The following is a list of places we plan to visit on South Georgia. Some of them are pending final government approval.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Elsehul Bay</B> - This beautiful bay on the north end is home to thousands of fur seals. Listen for the high-pitched trumpeting of the king penguins amid the magnificent sounds of marine mammals that echo throughout this bay.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <B>Right Whale Bay or Royal Bay</B> - Southern fur seals, elephant seals and king penguins, plus dozens of other bird species inhabit both these locations.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Salisbury Plain </B>- Thousands upon thousands of king penguins greet us, in every conceivable plumage. Lush and dense tussock grass provides habitat for the birds. Above the penguin rookery are two glaciers and rugged snow-capped ridges.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Albatross Island or Prion Island</B> - Located across the Bay of Isles from Salisbury, these islands have breath-taking scenery. Were likely to find skuas and giant petrels nesting or wheeling overhead in great numbers. Fur seals abound. Wandering albatrosses nest atop the grassy hillsides, and a good hike up the ridge takes us closer to view these magnificent birds, whose enormous wingspan permits effortless soaring.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Stromness Bay</B> - Site of Shackletons arrival after a harrowing crossing of the islands glaciers on foot, Stromness offers views of cliffs and a glacier, from which the adventurer and his companions descended. Well explore this historic bay by Zodiac, accompanied by the occasional blue petrel or light-mantled sooty albatross overhead.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Grytviken</B> - Our ship docks alongside an old whaling pier. Explore on foot, discovering old ruins of this once-active whaling station, now home to a small British military garrison. The cemetery holds a special fascination as it is here that Shackleton is buried - at the scene of his greatest triumph - on this island he loved. Seabirds, penguins and marine mammals can be seen while walking along the coast.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>13 - 14 February</FONT><BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lecturers recap our experiences at South Georgia Island. Join our marine biologist and ornithologist on deck in search of marine mammals and seabirds which flourish in these nutrient-rich waters.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>15 February</FONT><BR>
Sea Lion Island / Bleaker Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today we will make stops on two islands off the south coast of East Falkland Island. Offshore Sea Lion Island provides a highlight of our Falklands visit - here well visit a rockhopper penguin and king cormorant colony, in addition to gentoo and Magellanic penguins, plus communities of elephant seals and sea lions. With our naturalists, walk along the coast of Bleaker Island to a gentoo penguin colony and a large freshwater pond, where there is an excellent variety of Falklands waterfowl.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>16 February</FONT><BR>
Port Stanley, Falkland Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disembark the ship in the charming town of Port Stanley. Time to explore Stanley before we transfer to the airport for our flight to Santiago, connecting with our flight to Miami.<BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><B>17 February</FONT><BR>
Miami</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early morning arrival in Miami and connect to homeward flights.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>What to Expect<BR>
</FONT></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For most activities a relatively low level of exertion is required. You will need to climb into and out of Zodiacs for excursions ashore; (there will be staff and crew members at hand to assist.) Ashore, you must be able to walk moderate distances over rough terrain (rocky, uneven beaches in the sub-Antarctic islands, and occasional ice and snow on the Antarctic Peninsula).<BR>

He has visited more than 140 countries since. For the past eight years, Mike has been leading expeditions (many of them first-ever destinations), to Antarctica the Falkland Islands, South Georgia, the Arctic, Central and South America, the Amazon and Orinoco River, Madagascar, Japan, Indonesia, the South Pacific and Australia. A true sea-lover, Mike holds a U.S. Coast Guard Captains License, and has both Instructor and Divemaster certification from the National Association of Underwater Instructors (NAUI). Mike is also a member of the prestigious Explorers Club. If you have not had the pleasure of traveling with Mike before, you will soon find out why he is considered by passengers and staff alike to be one of the best in the business.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Peter Harrison, MBE,</B> - A professional birder, artist, author, and screenwriter, Peter is widely considered the worlds foremost authority on seabirds. Often credited with having seen more seabirds than anyone, past or present, Peter has written and illustrated over a dozen books of which Seabirds: An Identification Guide is considered the bible of seabird identification. Whether on a ship at sea or strolling the beaches and forests onshore, Peter is not unlike the Pied Piper as passengers follow him, listening to his colorful dissertations on wildlife. Peter has led expeditions the world over and is noted for his quick-thinking and darings-do in tight situations. An active conservationist, Peter was recently invited by the Queen to Buckingham Palace to receive the prestigious award &quot;Member of the British Empire&quot; for Services to Natural History.

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>TORRES DEL PAINE NATIONAL PARK</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4><I>Optional Pre-Cruise Extension</I></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=4>January 23 - 31, 1998</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torres del Paine National Park, considered to be one of the most beautiful on the planet, was established in 1959 and exemplifies the indescribable scenery of Patagonia. It is over 615,000 acres in size and has justifiably been declared a World Bioshpere Reserve by UNESCO. Peaks of twisted granite in unusual shapes, dusted with snow, rise from the flat Patagonia plains. The three Towers of Paine dominate the scene with waterfalls, emerald lakes and verdant valleys.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over 150 native animal species, which include over 100 species of birds, reside in the steppe and forested areas of the park. Flamingos move like pastel brush strokes against a canvas of sapphire, lapis lazuli and emerald colored lakes. Black-necked swans with necks that look like question marks glide gracefully by, while ebony-faced guanacos and their &quot;chulengo&quot; calves romp on the slopes beneath the Towers. Darwin rheas, the New Worlds largest bird, race off in a high-stepping rumba and high, high above, South Americas aerial champion, the Andean condor, traces curves upon the wind.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Led by Zegrahm &amp; Eco Expedition leaders, we will have ample opportunity to observe the unique flora and fauna of this fascinating region. Together with the help of selected local guides they we will offer a wide range of activities. We will divide into smaller &quot;special interest&quot; groups of hikers, photographers, birders or those with a general interest in natural history. Depending on the weather, some excursions will be arranged by mini van to various locations within the park, or you can ride horseback, explore on foot, in a launch or on a mountain bike - always with the help of our expert leaders.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spectacular Hotel Exploradores de la Patagonia is a study in refined elegance and the perfect counterpart to this primeval wilderness. Perched on the shores of Lake Pehoe, the view is spectacular with ample windows offering the imposing serenity of the Patagonian scenery. All of the furniture is hand made with a variety of the finest local woods. The Restaurant offers a blend of Mediterranean and traditional Chilean cuisine, and the Hotel also arranges picnic lunches and a superb Magellanic barbecue.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For outside recreation, there are open air jacuzzis, saunas, a swimming pool and a series of nature trails which provide hours of interesting exploration.</P>

16 November - 22 December 1997<BR>
On board the Kapitan Khlebnikov<BR>
37 tour days</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Dear Adventurer,</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mysteries concerning the Antarctic Continent are innumerable. What is this compelling lure which beckons us to return to a frozen wonderland? Is it the many indelible memories we retain of ever-changing icescapes, majestic snow-capped mountains, and brilliant blue icebergs, those immense galleons of ice which sail the Southern Ocean? Or is it the wildlife, an incomparable celebration of all creatures great and small, from comical, waddling penguins to the largest creatures the Earth has ever fostered, the great whales? Perhaps it is just the sight of a squadron of albatrosses following in the ship's wake. Whatever the attraction is, whatever the yearning that pulls each of us southwards, it is real, yet intangible, and has beckoned other polar explorers before us.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite having been to Antarctica so many times over the last 15 years of expedition travel, we seldom have an opportunity to travel to a completely new part of the great white continent. With this in mind, we have designed aunique Antarctic program - Antarctica - The Far Side, which does just that. This will be an opportunity to explore an entirely new region of the last wilderness on Planet Earth. It will be an Antarctic expedition like no other.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pilgrimage begins in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and heads south through the Indian Ocean, making stops at Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Heard Islands. Only a few hundred mortals have reached these distant sub-Antarctic outposts. Each island is different in character, yet each is a bastion of wildlife, literally overflowing with penguins, albatrosses, and seals.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next comes the ice...lots of it. During the following 11 days of this incredible expedition to Antarctica, we plan to visit as many emperor penguin rookeries as possible. Each of these rookeries possesses a distinctively unique setting, each with their own spectacular backdrops of icebergs, sea ice, and glaciers. Photographic and viewing opportunities will be limited only by our own individual stamina. Expect sensory overload as the early morning sun transforms everything black and white to luminous shades of ebony, gold, and ivory. To stand within an emperor penguin rookery surrounded by a maze of immense tabular icebergs beset in mile after mile of endless ice is simply without equal.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our journey of Antarctic exploration will take us beyond emperor penguin rookeries as we plan to visit Australia's Mawson Base and Davis Base, as well as Russia's Mirny Base. Also on our wish list are the Scullin and Murray Monoliths.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until recently, an expedition of this nature would have been impossible. However, with the recent availability of powerful, state-of-the-art Russian icebreakers, a journey of this magnitude is no longer merely a dream. In addition to a fleet of go-anywhere Zodiac landing craft, our icebreaker, the Kapitan Khlebnikov, is equipped with two helicopters. These will be used not only for ice reconnaissance and flight-seeing excursions, but also to transfer us quickly ashore to areas which would otherwise be inaccessible.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 37-day voyage of pure Antarctic adventure and exploration will end at Fremantle, Western Australia. If you desire to be among the few privileged travelers to undertake an historic journey of discovery, we invite you to sail with us as we explore Antarctica - The Far Side.</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Itinerary</FONT><BR>
16 November 1997<BR>
New York</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We gather this evening at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York for our flight to Johannesburg, South Africa.<BR>
<B>17 November<BR>
Johannesburg / Port Elizabeth</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arrive in Johannesburg this afternoon and connect with our flight to Port Elizabeth. Upon arrival, we transfer to our hotel for dinner and overnight accommodation.<BR>
<B>18 November<BR>
Port Elizabeth</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning is at leisure to explore this bustling coastal city or relax by the pool. After lunch at the hotel, we have a sightseeing tour of the city and the surrounding area. Port Elizabeth offers visitors a rich history and a temperate climate. Much of the city's initial develop-ment as a harbor came from the export of wool and mohair from the drier interior where the settlers cross bred flat-tailed Cape sheep with imported German merinos for a superior quality of wool. The wool market is still centered in the city, but the development of more modern industries have now become the focal point of the local economy. We return to the hotel in time for dinner and overnight.<BR>
<B>19 November<BR>
Port Elizabeth / Sail for Antarctica</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After breakfast at our hotel, we transfer to the Kapitan Khlebnikov for embarkation. We begin to settle in to our temporary homes for the next 34 days. After lunch on board, we sail out of Port Elizabeth Harbor like so many of the early Antarctic expeditions of discovery. We will retrace the footsteps of legendary explorers and plan to make new discoveries of our own. Spend the afternoon strolling the spacious decks of our powerful icebreaker, keeping our eyes peeled for seabirds and marine life. <BR>
<B>20-21 November<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we cruise these historic waters, our lecturers introduce the various species of birds and marine life which we will encounter on our voyage. Our historian will begin to recount the many tales of heroic Antarctic history relevant to these waters. As we make our way south towards the continent of Antarctica, expect to see wandering, royal, shy, yellow-nosed, and black-browed albatrosses; jackass penguins; Salvin's prions; little, manx, and Cory's shearwaters; soft plumaged, Kerguelen, and great-winged petrels as they glide in our ship's wake. <BR>
<B>22 November<BR>
Marion Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The possibility of a landing or a Zodiac excursion here is pending final permission from the South African authorities governing the island.<BR>
<B>23 November<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue to sail south, we enter the cooler waters of the Southern Indian Ocean. Our naturalists will be on deck to help spot and identify the seabirds and marine mammals that are indigenous to these waters. We have a chance to photograph the magnificent wandering albatross, prions, cape pigeons and petrels, including northern giant petrels.<BR>
<B>24 - 25 November<BR>
Crozet Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These islands, which are a French protectorate, offer truly extraordinary scenery, as well as abundant and varied wildlife. Our shore landings allow us ample time to explore and experience the beauty of these islands and take in the prolific wildlife found on these sub-Antarctic islands. We visit a large colony of majestic king penguins, whose young chicks are still fledging their brown fluffy down. Other penguins we encounter include macaronis, gentoos and rockhoppers. Of special interest to the birders will be lesser or black-faced sheathbills and the endemic resident shags. We meander among wandering and light mantled sooty albatrosses, the latter on their nests. Molting elephant seals add their unique sounds and smells to the amazing wildlife display.<BR>
<B>26 - 27 November<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our lecture series continues as we proceed south toward the Kerguelen Islands. Join our naturalists on deck to help identify the new species of seabirds following in our wake including; Salvin's and gray-headed albatrosses, southern giant petrels, pintado, grey, white-chinned, diving, and black-bellied storm petrels. As always, we keep our eyes peeled for whales and other sea mammals.<BR>
<B>28 - 29 November<BR>
Kerguelen Islands</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our exact landing sights will be determined by prevailing sea and weather conditions at the time of our arrival. The diversity of penguin species on these islands is astounding. Penguin rookeries include gentoo, king, macaroni, and rockhopper, and perhaps even a few royal penguins, many with newly hatched chicks, others still incubating their eggs. We observe - from a safe distance - the Kerguelen fur seals - the aggressive sparring males, the subdued females and the adorable newly-born pups playfully bounding through the tussock grass - never straying too far from their mothers. Seabirds are also found here in abundance including; albatrosses, giant petrels, skuas, sheathbills, kelp gulls, the Kerguelen tern and endemic shag. We plan to visit the French Base, Port-aux-Francais, a station manned year round by 100 researchers and scientists.<BR>
<B>30 November - 01 December<BR>
Heard Island</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another wildlife rich sub-Antarctic island. Heard boasts spectacular mountainous scenery - the skyline of which is dominated by Big Ben, a 9,005 foot glacier and snow capped volcanic mountain, active as recently as 1993. The unique rock formations, molded by lava flows, provide our on board geologist with wonderful demonstrative examples of the effects of volcanic activity. For the more agile among us, and if weather conditions allow, we may attempt a &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; hike on the volcano to achieve a spectacular panoramic view from above. The island boasts nesting albatrosses, petrels, the Kerguelen blue-eyed shag and rockhopper penguins nesting along the sheer cliff face. King, Macaroni and gentoo penguins add to this wildlife spectacle. Bellowing elephant seals and aggressive fur seals can be found along the island's shorelines. Perhaps we can spot leopard seals patrolling off shore in search of their next meal.<BR>
<B>02 - 04 December<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we continue further south, we begin to scan the horizon for the first icebergs of our voyage - the best indicator that we are approaching the icy realm of Antarctica. We cross the Antarctic convergence - the official scientific boundary of the Antarctic - into the cooler waters of the Southern Ocean. The outside temperatures will also be dropping as we proceed south. Antarctic and snow petrels wheel in the ship's wake. We arrive at the edge of the pack ice and are greeted by a vast, serene white expanse of sea ice. Be on the lookout for the rare Ross' seal and our first emperor penguins catching a ride on the ice floes. Our powerful vessel will show her true mettle as she crushes through the pack ice. If the weather is in our favor, we take to the skies for helicopter sight-seeing flights to view our icebreaker at work. Large icebergs, recently calved off of the Antarctic ice shelves, will become more frequent.<BR>
<B>05 - 15 December<BR>
Antarctic Continent</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following eleven days will be spent exploring the Antarctic Coastline. Because of the nature of this polar expedition, flexibility with regard to the daily schedule of activities is a must. If the weather is in our favor, we may schedule landings at any hour of the day or night. Our main objective will be to locate wildlife which is found here in abundance during the short summer season. Weather, ice and sea conditions will determine our exact itinerary. The following are possible landing sites listed in order from West to East:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Kloa Point Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> Located near the Australian Mawson Base, set against a beautiful backdrop of rock and grounded icebergs. Walk amongst the curious penguins and observe the ritual of parent / chick identification and feeding after the adults have returned from sea. We marvel at the &quot;Emperor Superhighway&quot; created by the penguins as they toboggan on their bellies across the frozen sea ice to the open ocean. There may even be a few Adelie penguins interspersed with the emperors. An unearthly sound can be heard below the ice and then a Weddell seal unexpectedly pops his delightful round face through the sea ice in an attempt to keep his breathing hole open.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mawson Base</B> Mawson is the oldest of the Australian bases and is manned year round by some 20 researchers and scien-tists. Mawson is the earliest continuously operating station on the Antarctic Conti-nent, established in 1954. Pending final permission, we are treated to a tour of the station and learn more about the research carried out here. The islands nearby provide summer breeding grounds for Adelie penguins - the southernmost dwelling penguin in the world. An Adelie rookery is a bustling hectic contrast to an emperor rookery, but an outstanding experience all the same.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Auster Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> This rookery is also located near Mawson Base, and boasts another stunning setting encircled by magnificent grounded icebergs in colors from pure white to an iridescent blue. Silently we sit and watch as these regal birds feed their chicks, preen their shining coats, stroll to and from the rookery or just quietly stand watching us watch them. This spectacle is a photographers dream, although equally awe-inspiring for those who just wish to immerse themselves in the beautiful serenity of the Antarctic - another world.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Scullin Monolith</B> A large prominent rock outcrop along the ice-bound coast, it is a site of prolific wildlife and outstanding scenery. Scullin boasts one of the largest seabird colonies in Antarctica; including the largest colony of Antarctic petrels in the world, with over 150,000 breeding pairs. Also present are a variety of other seabirds including fulmars, cape pigeons, skuas and snow petrels, nesting in the crevices of the cliff. The spectacle of thousands of birds seen wheeling overhead is simply staggering. Large numbers of Adelie penguins occupy the lower levels of the monolith and Weddell seals gather along the coast. If weather allows, we make helicopter landings on the monolith itself. From our landing site, we climb up as high as the summit and are rewarded by our efforts with breathtaking views from the top.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Murray Monolith</B> Four miles to the east of Scullin, Murray is another large rock jutting out of the icesheet. There is a large Adelie penguin rookery dotting the high ice-free slopes. The penguins have created a vertical freeway to and from the ocean. Once in the sea, they shoot out of the water onto the nearby ice floes before lining up like soldiers before they re-enter the icy deep. Courting snow petrels; calling and flapping their wings - demonstrate their rituals - a very romantic display. A nearby glacier cascading down toward the frozen ocean provides a scenic backdrop to the entire scene.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Amery Ice Shelf</B> This area is known for the spectacular icebergs which have recently calved off of the nearby ice shelf. Massive tabular bergs intermingle with various smaller, intricately carved icebergs, a result of the constant erosion caused by the relentless Antarctic elements. The Amery Ice Shelf is a huge expanse of floating ice with ice cliffs over 100 feet high. The shelf is the seaboard drainage of the world's largest glacier, the Lambert Glacier. More than 8.4 cubic miles of ice are discharged each year through this vast glacier system. If weather conditions allow, we take to the skies for a bird's eye view of this fantastic bay of icebergs from the comfortable perch of our on-board helicopters.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Flutter Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> This rookery is located further into the pack ice with grounded icebergs providing the penguins with shelter from the wind. A landing here is dependent on how close our powerful ice breaker can bring us to the colony. As this rookery is situated further from the ice edge, the chicks here will likely be smaller than at the previous rookeries we have visited. Although the chicks are adorable, their small size this late in the season is an indicator that many may not molt in time to go to sea with the adults and more developed chicks.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Larsemann Hills</B> There are several research stations located in the vicinity of Larsemann Hills including: Zhong Chan Base, the Chinese station; the recently closed Russian Bases, Progress I and II; as well as the Australian summer Law Base. Grounded tabular icebergs are strewn about the sea. Weddell seals peek through the ice and haul their enormous weight out onto the ice for a bit of sun bathing. We walk amongst their breathing holes and admire the various shapes and colors of the sculpted icebergs.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Amanda Bay - Emperor Penguin Rookery</B> This is another breathtaking setting, as the emperors breed at the foot of gigantic grounded icebergs, in the lee of the wind. We again marvel at the &quot;Feeding Freeway&quot; caused by the trail of the tobogganing penguins as they trek to and from the open sea to feed. We may also find Adelie penguins, distant relatives of the emperors, in this area.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Davis Station</B> Another Australian base where, time permitting, we are treated to tours by personnel who occupy the base year round. We are shown their scientific laboratories and discover more about the research done at this base. We also find out what it is like to spend a dark and cold winter in the Antarctic.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nearby <B>Vestfold Hills</B> is a remarkable expanse of rounded rock coastal hills, jutting from the frozen continent 200 square miles. The hills are heavily indented by fjords (some of them covered with fast ice) and many lakes. Large Weddell seal populations gather in the long fjords. We listen for their unearthly underwater call and search for their tell tale breathing holes.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in the vicinity, we find Adelie penguin rookeries on <B>Lucas Island</B> and <B>Rookery Island</B>. We watch the Adelies as they steal each other's nesting stones. The stones are a very hot commodity in an Adelie rookery and if they are not guarded carefully, they will soon disappear. Curious and active, with quick and unpredictable movements - the Adelies are a complete contrast to the graceful and elegant emperors, but very entertaining to watch. Leopard seals can be spotted cruising the ice edge, laying in wait for a careless Adelie.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Gaussberg</B> Discovered by German geographer Erich von Drygalski in 1902, during an overwintering expedition, this extinct volcanic cone, located at the coastal end of the huge West Ice Shelf, juts 270 meters into the air. This is an area of interesting scenic delights and weather permitting, we plan to make landings here on the continent.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Mirny Base</B> is one of Russia's large Antarctic bases. This was the first Russian base in Antarctica, established in 1955 and currently manned year round. A tour will show us the research carried out here and we note the contrasts to the other stations we have visited. We can look forward to a very gracious welcome as we are traveling aboard a vessel sailing under the Russian flag. The nearby islands are inhabited by breeding Adelie penguins and Weddell seals sunning themselves on the fast ice.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Bowman Island </B>This island marks the furthest east point of our voyage before we head north toward Australia. A high ice-covered island about 24 miles long and from 2 to 6 miles wide, it is shaped like a figure eight.<BR>
<B>16 - 21 December<BR>
At Sea</B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we make our way north, our naturalists and lecturers recap the amazing sights and sounds we have experienced over the past few weeks. Are there words to describe this wondrous spectacle? From the decks of our sturdy vessel, we watch the seabirds trailing in our wake - white-chinned petrels, wandering albatrosses, prions, soft plumaged petrels, black-browed albatrosses, light-mantled sooty albatrosses, and gray-headed albatrosses all may be seen.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of all the oceans in the world, the Pacific is without a doubt the most fascinating and intriguing body of water.  From Cape Horn to Alaska and from Tasmania to the Kuril Islands, numerous islands dot the azure blue waters of the Pacific.  The variety of these island groups is a diversified as the underwater spectacle of the Pacific.  Scattered in the North Pacific between Hawaii and the Philippines lie the 2,100 islands of Micronesia.  Although these islands cover an ocean area larger than the continental United States, the actual land mass is smaller than Rhode Island.  Within the island group of Micronesia lie two of the most fascinating islands - <B>Yap and Palau</B>.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Yap</B>, the land of giant stone money - is perhaps Micronesias most traditional island.  Here we have an opportunity to walk along ancient stone pathways and observe traditional Yapese village life.  We learn how early navigators set out to quarry huge disks of limestone from Palaus Rock Islands, and ferried them back in their canoes to Yap.  During the winter months large numbers of Manta Rays congregate, and we hope to snorkel at close range with these wonderful leviathans.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The waters of <B>Palau</B> are considered by divers and snorkelers alike to be one of the worlds best snorkel and diving sites.  Teeming with fish (more than 1,400 species) and colorful reefs the waters are nearly as warm as the air.  Five days will be spent on board our chartered luxury yacht, the <I>Sun Dancer II</I>.  During these days we will have ample time to explore some of the most renowned snorkeling sites such as Blue Hole, Turtle Cove, The Wall, Blue Corner and Ngmelis.  We have put together an equally exciting program ashore with excursions to the picturesque Rock Islands and world-famous Jellyfish Lake; a special presentation at the Belau National Museum; and visits to historic World War II sites.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our expeditions will be led by the experienced team of Jack Grove and Dick Dewey.  Both Jack and Dick have been to the Pacific numerous times.  They will accompany us ashore and in the water each day to point out and interpret the myriad wildlife we see and augment our experiences with discussions and informal illustrated lectures.<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the fabled Rock Islands, to the magnificent coral reefs with their diversity of marine life, to the traditional villages and the ancient history of the giant stone money, this voyage to Palau and Yap offers the perfect combination of ship and land based activities.</P>
<P><B><FONT SIZE=5>Dear Adventurer,</FONT></B><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the oceans in the world, the Pacific is without a doubt the most fascinating and intriguing body of water. From Cape Horn to Alaska and from Tasmania to the Kuril Islands, numerous islands dot the azure blue waters of the Pacific. The variety of these island groups is a diversified as the underwater spectacle of the Pacific. Scattered in the North Pacific between Hawaii and the Philippines lie the 2,100 islands of Micronesia. Although these islands cover an ocean area larger than the continental United States, the actual land mass is smaller than Rhode Island. Within the island group of Micronesia lie two of the most fascinating islands - Yap and Palau.Yap, the land of giant stone money - is perhaps Micronesias most traditional island. Here we have an opportunity to walk along ancient stone pathways and observe traditional Yapese village life. We learn how early navigators set out to quarry huge disks of limestone from Palaus Rock Islands, and ferried them back in their canoes to Yap. During the winter months large numbers of manta rays congregate, and we hope to snorkel at close range with these wonderful leviathans.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The waters of Palau are considered by divers and snorkelers alike to be one of the world's best snorkel and diving sites. Teeming with fish (more than 1,400 species) and colorful reefs the waters are nearly as warm as the air. Five days will be spent on board our chartered luxury yacht, the Sun Dancer II. During these days we will have ample time to explore some of the most renowned snorkeling sites such as Blue Hole, Turtle Cove, The Wall, Blue Corner and Ngemelis. We have put together an equally exciting program ashore with excursions to the picturesque Rock Islands and world-famous Jellyfish Lake; a special presentation at the Belau National Museum; and visits to historic World War II sites.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our expedition will be led by the experienced team of Jack Grove and Dick Dewey. Both Jack and Dick have been to the Pacific numerous times. They will accompany us ashore and in the water each day to point out and interpret the myriad wildlife we see and augment our experiences with discussions and informal illustrated lectures.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to leave winter behind and experience the splendor of these islands with their turquoise lagoons, pristine beaches and friendly people, this voyage is for you. As space is limited to 18 participants, we expect these voyages to fill rapidly. We encourage you to call in your reservation to Tony Berg at 800-628-8747 today. I hope you can join us!</P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD><FONT SIZE=5><B>DEAR ADVENTURER,</B></FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR CLEAR=RIGHT>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With each new edition of our newsletter, we often receive calls from clients questioning the appearance or disappearance of the notation "<I>waitlisted</I>" next to certain programs on our Travel Calendar. It is true that some of our programs seem to fill almost as soon as they are announced, only to be available for booking once again several months later. I hope that the following explanation will help.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because we announce our departures so far in advance (twelve to eighteen months in most cases) we often get swamped with bookings from enthusiastic clients before we even have a chance to mail a brochure! Then, as the months pass, reunions, births, weddings and other obligations create scheduling conflicts, and some who book a year or more in advance end up having to cancel their reservation. Furthermore, some space originally set aside for special interest groups may become available four to six months prior to a departure.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is our policy not to oversell our programs, so once every space is spoken for, we start a waitlist, which is monitored very carefully by our Program Managers. Unfortunately, many people feel that being put on a waitlist means there is only a very slim possibility that they will have the opportunity to participate in the program. They therefore proceed with making other plans.<RB>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More often than not, every person on a waitlist is eventually called and offered space on the departure. Our 1997 spring Polynesia expeditions are a good example: After our initial announcement of these departures, all 135 berths aboard the <I>Wind Song</I> filled immediately, and a long waitlist formed. Then, after half a year, we had some space open up and began to call those on the waitlist. What we found was that, even though we were still more than five months away from departure, many people had assumed that space would not become available and had already made other arrangements. The result is that currently we have three or four cabins available on each voyage.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, every departure is different, and there is a greater chance that space will become available on a 135-passenger chartered vessel than on a smaller land or sea program. In all cases, we can give a definite answer about space availability at least three to four months prior to departure, so if you are placed on a waitlist for a program, <B><I>don't you dare book alternative arrangements!</I></B> Hang in there, call our Program Managers as often as you wish for an update, and chances are we will welcome you along on the program of your choice!<BR>
<P>
We hope you enjoy this edition of Zegrahm News.<BR>

A Reconnaissance Trip to Micronesia<BR>
<I>by Jack Grove</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>Originally we had plans to publish the full report of Jack's reconnaissance trip of last November to the islands of Yap and Palau. Not surprising, his report was much too long to include it in full in this edition of Zegrahm News. Following are Jack's encounters in Palau, while excerpts from Yap Island will follow in one of the next newsletters.</I><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My arrival in Palau was unexpectedly delayed, compliments of typhoon Dale which pounded Guam (515 miles to the northeast) canceling flights to Palau. Although these storms <IMG SRC="mantara.gif" ALT="mantara.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=1 WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133> rarely hit either Yap or Palau, while I cooled my heels I reflected gratefully that our expeditions were scheduled well after the typhoon season.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the seven underwater wonders of the world, Palau is situated some 450 miles east of the Philippines in the western Caroline Islands. Officially declared an independent nation in October of 1994, the archipelago is home to 15,000 people, 700 different kinds of corals and more than 1,400 species of fishes (compare that figure to "just" 444 species of fish known from the Galapagos). Often referred to as the most beautiful of Micronesian destinations, only nine of Palau's 343 islands are inhabited, and the area is renowned by scuba divers and snorkelers worldwide. I had to remind myself a couple of times that, as this was a reconnaissance trip, I could not spend all of my time fish-watching! Organizing itinerary details, meeting with tour operators and hotel managers, and familiarizing myself with all aspects of the natural history kept me above sea level for part of every day. I was especially anxious to continue my congenial rivalry with "birdman," Peter Harrison, by compiling and sending him a list of the endemic birds I had seen.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Palau is to snorkelers and divers what the Serengeti is to safari enthusiasts. The typhoon delay, and the lengthy hours in various planes, were quickly forgotten as the luxury dive boat <I>Sun Dancer</I>, <IMG SRC="fish1.gif" ALT="fish1.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=114>with me aboard, motored across Molokai Harbor to our first dive site. Although I had made several dives here on an expedition a decade ago, this was my first live-aboard dive adventure in Palau, and the ensuing days were full of highlights. The western portion of Palau's barrier reef was once above sea level. Centuries of storm waves, combined with the erosive forces of ocean currents, have created a maze of caverns and channels in the limestone shore. Subsequently, the coastline sank into the depths, creating a wonderland of vertical chimneys - or Blue Holes - connecting these caverns to the surface. One such cavern has become a fabled site where divers enter the open face of the cavern along the vertical submarine wall. Ethereal light penetrates into the huge chamber through the chimneys. As we descended in a three knot current, the drift carried us along the vertical wall. A 300 pound Napoleon wrasse - named Al by local guides - approached to within a few feet and peered into my mask. Grey reef sharks moved effortlessly into the current as I drifted by. Entering the submarine labyrinth at one hundred feet, beams of sunlight penetrated the crystal clear waters to the sand floor, illuminating myriad soft corals. The scene was breathtaking, I could make a hundred dives at this site and never grow tired of it.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where the Philippine Sea meets the tip of Palau's western barrier reef, a coral encrusted, limestone wall penetrates the blue waters. The nutrient rich waters which sweep around the <B>Blue Corner</B> nourish an astounding array of marine life: a school of blackfin barracuda that encircled me was so dense it blocked the sun. Knowing that the tender from the diveboat would follow our drift, my dive buddy and I moved through this underwater wonderland in awe, carried along by the steady current. Two huge tuna sped past me like bullets, and schools of snapper, basselets and unicornfish added color to the aquatic panorama. Even if there had been no fish, the profusion of invertebrates and coral would make this a one of the world's finest dive sites.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="fish2.gif" ALT="fish2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133>The island of Ngercheuis is legendary in Palauan history because of the hawksbill turtles which once came ashore to nest on its pristine beaches. Today these turtles are rare, even in Palau. But the legends - and a dive site called <B>Turtle Cove</B> - live on. Only a few hundred yards off the secluded beaches of Ngercheuis lies one of the most luxuriant coral reefs anywhere. It will dazzle even the most jaded of snorkelers and divers. Purple soft corals and brilliant red-whip corals adorn the reef and appear even more brilliant to the snorkeler in shallow water. Golden lace-like sea fans spread out along the wall in colonies, many six feet or more in height. Sponges and reef-building corals provide protection for schools of bigeyes and squirrelfish. I could hardly imagine what this place would look like on a night dive with the coral polyps wide open and the nocturnal fishes out of their hiding places to feed. When the opportunity arose, it surpassed my expectations.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly 40 Japanese ships were sunk at Palau during the American airstrike in March, 1944, and most lie in the protected waters of the inner lagoon. I had an opportunity to dive several of these ship wrecks, and each is a story unto itself. Unlike outside the lagoon where visibility is 100 - 150 feet, here the visibility was only about 30 feet and the top of the rigging of the <I>Iro Maru</I> - Japanese oil tanker and munitions carrier - could barely be seen from the surface. The juxtaposition of a sunken warship and living marine habitat is for most divers the most striking aspect of a wreck dive. The Iro was no exception. A beautiful barrel anemone had made its home atop the center kingpost of the ship, and in it were a dozen skunk clownfish. Making my descent onto the main deck, the spectacles of schooling fishes and whip corals were everywhere. On the foredeck, beneath a 5.5 inch gun with a massive barrel extending well beyond the prow, was an encrusted sake bottle inhabited by a banded shrimp.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="moorish.gif" ALT="moorish.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=169>My scouting almost complete, I took the opportunity for a sightseeing flight with a helicopter. Moments after the aircraft took off from Koror airport, a surreal seascape unfolded below me unlike anything I had ever seen. Limestone islets sculpted into conical forms by the ages, each carpeted with lush vegetation spread out across the turquoise seas. Many of the islands are skirted with shallow water and white sands, others are bordered by a drop-off, where the sea turns abruptly to deep blue. The flight afforded the most awesome aerial spectacle I had ever encountered in any type of aircraft, anywhere in the world.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My Micronesia experience was a series of breathtaking images - from beneath the waves, the shores of hospitable islands and from the air. While time, for me, tends to speed by too quickly, I am already anxious for the days and months to pass so that I can return to this paradise in early 1998!<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>We will offer two snorkeling and culture expeditions to Yap and Palau. Jack will also lead a dive trip for "hard core" divers. A brochure for these January and February 1998 Micronesia expeditions will be ready in the spring. In the meantime, a lengthy interest list is forming. If you would like to be on it, call Tony.</I>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="tiger1.gif" ALT="tiger1.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=154>As is typical of international arrivals into Delhi, my flight touched down in the late evening. After clearing immigration, I quickly set eyes on a friendly and familiar face peering through the sea of name placards and anxious friends and family waiting to welcome arriving loved ones. In minutes, Pradeep expertly whisked me through the crowd and out to his car, where he formally greeted me with a fragrant lei of fresh marigolds.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The managing director of Indian Nature Expeditions in New Delhi, Pradeep Sankhala has been our main contact in organizing our <B>India: Realm of the Tiger</B> safaris, scheduled to depart in January and February. Pradeep's extensive experience planning wildlife safaris in his homeland leaves no question as to how he has earned a widespread reputation of excellence in the travel industry. I immediately felt confident that I was in good hands.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pradeep, intent on maximizing my time in India, planned an early morning departure by train to Ranthambore National Park in Rajasthan. The train ride south gave me a first-hand look at the countryside, as well as an opportunity to talk with some of the local Indian people. I quickly learned that the Indians are some of the warmest and friendliest people you could ever hope to meet.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Upon arriving in Sawai Madhopur, Rajasthan, I was met by a private driver and transferred to the Castle Jhoomar Baori. Built approximately 100 years ago as a hunting lodge, the maharajah's palace is maintained in its original splendor, with beautifully carved antique furnishings, and now serves as a lovely hotel. I was given the "Tiger Suite" and truly felt like a princess in my lavish surroundings.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ranthambore National Park was just a small taste of what the next two weeks would hold. My next destination was Bharatpur National Park - north of Ranthambore - the first national park on the itinerary for our scheduled safaris. Bharatpur is primarily a bird sanctuary, hosting over 350 different species including a variety of storks, cormorants, and egrets. I must admit, a birder I am not, but I couldn't help but be impressed. The methods of transportation used throughout the park are bicycle rickshaws or boats, which help maintain the peace and tranquillity of this paradise.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Before continuing to my next destination, Bandhavgarh National Park, I spent one night in Agra. Along the way to Agra, one has the opportunity to visit Fatephur Sikri, an ancient city built by the Mughals over 400 years ago. Of course, while in Agra I also went to see the spectacular Taj Mahal and the Red Fort, and even squeezed in time for shopping.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From here, I journeyed to Band-havgarh through a combination of air and ground transport, taking in the beautiful, diverse Indian countryside along the way. An added bonus was that this also happened to be the first day of Diwali, <I>the celebration of light</I>. Imagine a combination of Christmas and Independence Day and you will have an idea of the festivities and excitement coursing through the villages enroute to Bandhavgarh. Although this was a spectacular sight for me to ponder from the luxury of my passenger seat, I imagine my driver, if given a choice, would rather not have been challenged by the additional road traffic the Diwali celebrations created. Nonetheless, he uttered no complaints and continued to careen along, artfully dodging the obstacles which lay ahead. As darkness fell, we made our way through many villages, illuminated by the brilliant sky full of brightly lit stars. Nestled deep within the forest, we finally arrived at the remote Bandhavgarh National Park.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bandhavgarh Jungle Lodge is truly a delightful place. Designed with nature in mind, the park creates a peaceful serenity perfect for exploration. This "serenity" came in handy, as I had my first experience riding an elephant in the forest of Bandhavgarh, as well as my first encounter with the recluse Indian tiger. I had opted to ride "elephant-back" early the first morning, and just as I was really beginning to relax and enjoy the sights and sounds of the forest from this unique viewpoint, the solitude was abruptly broken as another mahout (elephant master) on elephant-back caught up with us and excitedly began to relay that a tiger had been spotted. Skillfully guiding us deep into the forest, the mahouts urged the elephants along in hot pursuit. <IMG SRC="tiger2.gif" ALT="tiger2.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=3 WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=198>All of a sudden, in a thicket of elephant grass and bamboo, we came upon the tigress. At first, all that was visible was a swatch of her orange striped side, but after a few moments, she lifted her head and peered out of the thick vegetation to get a better look, allowing us a few short minutes to gaze eye to eye. Soon after, she let out a little growl, and the mahouts quickly heeded her warning, backing away and giving her space. I knew we were fortunate to have seen the tiger and couldn't wait to tell the others at camp of our sighting.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Kanha Jungle Lodge was my next destination. Again, the scenery along the way was spectacular and the farther south we drove, the more lush and fertile the landscape became, filled with bright yellow patches of mustard fields in bloom, rolling rice fields and teak forests. At Kanha, I was impressed by the many forms of wildlife, including the gaur, which is an enormous muscle bound bison, as well as blackbucks, spotted and barking deer, and the black-faced langur monkeys.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;My last wildlife destination was Kaziranga National Park in the State of Assam. Located much farther east, near Bhutan and Bangladesh, I first flew to Gawahati where I was met and driven the remainder of the way. Traveling through steep mountain canyons and winding through acres of manicured tea gardens, this region is refreshingly semi-humid and very lush with vegetation. Game rides at Kaziranga are like stepping back in time. We rode elephants in the early morning mist, cutting our way through the tall grass, only to suddenly break into a swampy clearing where we stumbled across the magnificent rhino. Majestically shrouded in what you might imagine as a coat of armor, the one-horned rhino is truly a stunning creature to admire.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now back home in Seattle, I find myself reflecting on India's impressive wildlife, diverse scenery, kind people and warm hospitality - all integral elements which made my trip an outstanding wildlife and cultural experience. I can hardly wait for the day when I can return to explore this fascinating country further.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We have just a few spaces left on our upcoming <B>India: Realm of the Tiger</B> safaris! If you would like to join us on one of these fascinating adventures, please call Wendy Prohl or myself to reserve your space today.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="emperor.gif" ALT="emperor.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" BORDER=2 WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=265>Emperor Penguins are the largest of the world's 17 species of penguins - they stand nearly four feet tall and, in pre-breeding condition, can weigh between 70-90 pounds. There are only 42 known colonies with a world population estimated at just under 200,000 breeding pairs.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>January/March: </B> Emperor penguins are at sea during the late austral summer, fattening up on a diet of 95% fish, 3% squid and 2% krill.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>March/April: </B> From late March through late April, they begin to walk "inland" across the frozen sea. It can take them over a week to walk the 60-100 miles to the traditional colony site. Average distance per day is about 15 miles, most of which is done by tobogganing. Due to the narrow window of opportunity, pair fidelity is generally lower than in other penguin species. Low pair fidelity may also be linked to the unequal sex ratio with females often outnumbering the males by a ratio of 60% to 40%. In some colonies, pair fidelity may be as high as 15%, but can be as low as 5%.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>May/June: </B> It will take 5-8 weeks to walk across the ice, select a mate, and for the female to lay the single, one-pound egg. The female usually incubates the egg for several hours before transferring the egg to her partner. Twelve hours later, the female begins her journey of about 60-100 miles over the ice to the open sea. By this time, the female will have lost 20-25% of her weight.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Late May/August: </B> The male emperor incubates the egg in temperatures as low as -70&#176F. On average, he loses seven ounces of fat a day during the 64-day incubation period. In July and August, the first chicks appear. Despite the fact that the male has not eaten for up to four months, he is able to feed the chick with a crop secretion. The females normally return within a few days of the chicks hatching.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>August/September: </B> The male returns to the sea and replenishes his fat reserves while the female guards and feeds the chick for some 3-4 weeks. After a month, the male returns and takes over chick-duty from the female.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>October/November: </B> The chicks remain on the feet of the adults for nearly six weeks. After that, they are left unguarded. To ward off freezing temperatures, the chicks form creches by huddling together. Meanwhile, the two adults spend their time going back and forth from the sea to the colony.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>August/late December: </B> The emperor chick takes about five months, from the time of hatching, to fledge. During this period, it is fed on average every 16 days and will receive about 30% of its own body weight with each meal. During its 20-22 week feeding period, it thus receives only about 14-15 meals. Using satellites, some adults have been tracked on their feeding journeys which can take them distances of over 900 miles. When feeding they are able to hold their breath for up to 18 minutes at a time and can reach depths of 2,070 feet. Emperor penguins are thus the world's deepest diving birds.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>December/January: </B> The chicks are deserted by the adults at about five months of age. They are about 45% of the adult's summertime weight and weigh just 22-33 pounds. The ice now carries them out to sea and they will not return to breed for five years. Meanwhile, the adults fatten up at sea and return to the ice to molt, a process that takes 3-4 weeks.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>February/March: </B> They now have just 3-4 weeks to fatten up before starting their long trek across the ice and once again beginning their remarkable breeding program.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the whole that is Antarctica comprises a tenth of our world, it is unbelievably difficult to describe Antarctica to <TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=40% ALIGN=RIGHT><TR><TD>Glittering white, shining blue, raven black, in the light of the sun, the land looks like a fairy tale. Pinnacle after pinnacle, peak after peak  -- crevassed, wild as any land on our globe, it lies, unseenand untrodden. <BR>-- <I>Roald Amundsen</I></TD></TR></TABLE>anyone who hasn't been there. Even more so, it becomes virtually impossible to explain why you're going South for a second time...or third or fourth or more.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I consider myself extremely fortunate to have made more than thirty journeys to the great white continent. My husband, Peter Harrison, has been there ninety-something times, but then again, he doesn't list all the bird species he's seen in his lifetime either. (He tells me that it's over 6000.)<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If I counted the "quality," and not the quantity, of Antarctic expeditions which we've undertaken, I would have to rate skiing to the South Pole as tops in adventures. Camping with Emperor Penguins for a month was definitely the most incredible wildlife experience we could ever have imagined possible. However, when I think of polar exploration, nothing can compare to the sheer thrill and exhilaration of propelling through ice at 10-15 knots aboard an icebreaker, or supermanning your way on the whirring wings of a helicopter amongst a citadel of beset icebergs to reach the proximity of an Emperor Penguin rookery. These are ultimate Antarctic experiences that combine adventure and exploration which very few Antarctic visitors have an opportunity to realize.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="smallhu.gif" ALT="smallhu.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=85><BR>Deep penetration of the South Polar seas by ship had not been possible for most civilians before late 1992 when the collapse of the Soviet empire triggered a demand for hard currency on the part of the Russians. This created an opportunity to take our explorer-minded clients to the extreme polar areas which had been off-limits to even double A-class ice-hardened vessels.  Now, with a Russian icebreaker churning out the energy of 24,000 horses, not only could we access elusive Antarctic regions, but we couldfinally grasp our "Sword in the Stone," the most difficult bird in the world to see, the Emperor Penguin.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the continent of Antarctica is difficult to describe, imagine an attempt to elucidate on its boldest inhabitant, the Emperor Penguin. A bird by definition, but a conqueror exceeding the successes of even the Great Khan himself, the Emperor does what no other life form on the planet can do -- it breeds in the darkness of Antarctica's frigid winter temperatures. The male will incubate its charge on its feet until the onset of spring when, relieved to see his mate return, he transfers the newly-hatched chick to her feet and scoots for the sea. So begins the feeding cycle --  back to the sea, back to the colony, back to the sea, back to the colony...<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And this is where we mere mortals enter the scene. For those fortunate enough to witness this most amazing spectacle on Earth, the temperatures have warmed considerably. The never-ending light cast by the summer sun continually transforms the all-encompassing view like a kaleidoscope --golden iridescent glows beam from the Emperors' breast feathers; ensnared by a frozen sea, looming icebergs glisten like mirrored skyscrapers; and zillions of ice crystals sparkle everywhere, looking like so many fall encelestial stars.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since that first record-breaking Ultimate Antarctica Expedition in 1992, we have led two or more icebreaker expeditions each year beyond both Polar Circles. With a combined number of Southern Ocean voyages totaling over 400, we were the most experienced Antarctic expedition team ever gathered. Keeping this in mind, when the founders of our company gathered around the chart table to plan our 1997/98 Antarctica season, we asked ourselves the question, "Just where would we like to take an icebreaker now?"<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What could we expect to show Zegrahm travelers <TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=40% ALIGN=RIGHT><TR><TD>To anyone who goes to the Antarctic, there is a tremendous appeal, an unparalleled combination of grandeur, beauty, vastness, loneliness, and malevolence--all of which sounds terribly melodramatic--but which truthfully convey the actual feeling of Antarctica.  <BR>-- <I>Captain T.L.M.Sunter</I></TD></TR></TABLE>if we began our exploration from, say, South Africa, cruise the polar seas of the Indian Ocean, and exit at Australia?<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Werner, who already had done some advance planning, cautiously advised that the trip would need to be of the longest duration of any that we had ever organized. He calculated that it would take 32 days to travel from Port Elizabeth to Fremantle, taking in all of the sub-Antarctic and Antarctic sights and sounds along the way. "Let's add two more days just for goodmeasure," Werner advised, and we all agreed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After his own overwhelmingly positive response, Mike realized that in "The Far Side" expedition we had the advantage of eleven days in which to explore the Antarctic coastline.  He could imagine offering unparalleled opportunities for visits to not just several, but many emperor penguin rookeries, day or night. "We've got to make as many landings as possible," Mike vowed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter, however excited by the fact that the itinerary called for new Emperor Penguin colonies, had begun counting off the sub-Antarctic islands which an itinerary of this nature could offer. "My gosh! Marion, Crozet, Kerguelen, and Heard Islands," he announced. "I haven't been there since I was researcher for the Fitzpatrick Institute of South Africa." With youthful exuberance - despite his being a bit older since his research days - Peter continued, "These islands are mini-South Georgia's with extraordinary wildlife experiences for everyone -- Kerguelen fur seals, five species of albatross, endemic Kerguelen blue-eyed shags and terns, rockhoppers, kings, macaronis, gentoos, bellowing elephant seals... I know several friends, cumclients, who have been waiting for a trip such as this, a journey like no other!"<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<TABLE BORDER=1 BGCOLOR=FFFFFF CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 WIDTH=40% ALIGN=LEFT><TR><TD><I>Ice is the beginning of Antarctica and ice is its end. As one moves from perimeter to interior, the proportion of ice relentlessly increases. Ice creates more ice, and ice defines ice. </I><BR>-- Stephen Pyne,<BR><FONT SIZE=1><I>The Ice: A Journey to Antarctica</I> </FONT></TD></TR></TABLE><BR>From my own perspective, I looked forward to being once again within the ice. I suppose I feel at home there, not that I can ever ascertain why, having grown up in Hawaii. The obvious beauty of Antarctica to the explorer is a humbling and powerful entrancement. I always feel very lonely when I gaze upon the seemingly infinite icescape of the least-inhabited continent on Earth. And yet, I seem to be able to put life in perspective - what is important and what is frivolous. Each Antarctic journey changes my life a little more because, I suppose, it is here that nature is at her mightiest.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I leaned back in my chair, folded my arms, and watched the absorbed expressions on my partners' faces as they unfolded the enormous Antarctic map onto the table and carefully, yet deliberately, smoothed its creases. Simulating the path our icebreaker would take, their fingers outlined our course with the discussion becoming quite animated as to all the possible landing sites. I could visualize a similar scene from another time and era past, polar explorers at the dawn of this century doing just the same as we -poring over a page in an atlas which was, for the most part, only white....<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These men most likely had difficulty explaining to their families and friends why they wanted to go to the ends of the Earth, to unknown discoveries. I guess some things never change.<BR>

<IMG SRC="puffin.gif" ALT="puffin.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=100 HEIGHT=210>It looked like just another casualty of life, a hapless corpse, partially decomposed, lying face down on the summit of the magical Flannan Isles. Most of us walked past, hardly aware of the fallen figure, so mesmerized were we by the countless thousands of puffins and others, a mere arm's length from our camera lenses.<BR>
The fallen figure did not, however, escape the attention of Karen Barraclough, one of our spellbound adventurers on last June's <B>`Round Britain</B> voyage. Karen had noticed that the dead puffin was tagged with a small aluminum band bearing the serial number EB31213. This was duly sent off to the appropriate authorities; the results became a piece of ornithological history and added another piece of mosaic in the private life of the puffin.<BR>
The puffin had been banded by Mike Harris, a personal friend of Peter Harrison, in June of 1975. This made the puffin 21 years and 1 month old - the second oldest puffin ever recorded (the oldest known puffin was 21 years and 3 months old). If you would like to conduct your own puffin hunt, be sure to sign up early for our 1998 <B>`Round Britain</B> adventure.<BR>

<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thank you to all at Zegrahm for a truly memorable trip <B>`Round Britain</B> in June. When I came to live in this country ten years ago, I planned to see as much of it as I could. Now I believe I have been truly privileged and been able to see more in ten days than most people see their entire lives. Your organization was absolutely excellent in every way, and I was thrilled to receive a copy of the logbook, a reminder of an outstanding trip. Again, many, many thanks, I very much hope to be able to join you again on one of your trips in the future.<BR>
<I>- Karen, England</I><BR>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Needless to say, the trip around northwestern Australia with all its many highlights was a memorable one - unique in a myriad of ways.  <B>The Kimberley</B> now means more to me than just a remote, virtually untamed areas of the seventh continent! The rich natural beauty of the area, together with your unending knowledge and enthusiasm, to say nothing of your boundless energy, created an experience not soon to be forgotten. I look forward to traveling with you soon again and wish you every success in your endeavors.<BR>
<I>- Kathleen, New York</I><BR>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <B>Across the Top of Australia</B> expedition certainly adds another extraordinary jewel to Zegrahm's crown. Neither Ruth nor I can see any room for improvement. We found the <I>Coral Princess</I> very comfortable - the crew most attentive and friendly. Max was a superior chef. From the time we arrived in Darwin to our departure in Cairns everything was well planned and executed.  The Mike and Sonja combination is superior. They are friendly, helpful, interested, patient and gentle when answering passenger questions or helping solve any problems.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;April and Polynesia seem so far away. We are counting the days!<BR>
<I>- Ruth & Hank, Pennsylvania</I><BR>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <B>Galapagos</B> defy description - other-worldly, spectacular, fascinating, strange.... Having been a wilderness trip leader some years back - in a little organization where everybody did everything - I am particularly mindful of the extensive behind-the-scenes detail work that makes all the difference between a smooth trip and a chaotic one. Thanks to each of you for the logistics and the clear information you assembled on our behalf.  You all are a class act.<BR>
<I>- Jean, Washington</I><BR>

<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fall is a very busy time of year for us in the office, as we make the final arrangements for our Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Africa and Antarctica season.  It is also a hectic time for the founders, who are not only busy leading the last expeditions of 1996, but must also make time to research and scout new programs which often wont depart for a year or two.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the harbingers of this season is our late summer Founders Meeting. This is the time when we make decisions about future expeditions.  With charts, maps and books, we sit around the table and have a terrific time proposing and enthusiastically discussing new destinations. It is after we adjourn, however, that the challenging and exciting work of research and planning begins.  While the founders once again scatter to the four corners of the globe to lead expeditions to Indonesia (Jack), Papua New Guinea (Mike and Sonja), and Botswana (Peter and Shirley), our office is busy setting up the ground work for their scouting trips.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because we have an especially large number of new destinations proposed for 1997/8, several of our other staff have joined in the scouting efforts.  As I write this, Lisa King is investigating possible stops on the Kamchatka Peninsula, and Karen Gruber is just back from her research trip to Kenya and Uganda.  Jack will travel to Micronesia early in November to research our diving and snorkel expeditions for January 98.  Every scouting trip results in a detailed report, and these accounts make fascinating and compelling reading for those of us who, in these cases, must take the position of armchair travelers. With this in mind, we will print excerpts from Jack Groves Palau scouting report in one of our next newsletters.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You wont be surprised, after reading this letter, to find an especially long On the Drawing Board section in this edition.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We hope you enjoy this edition of <I>Zegrahm News.</I><BR>

<I><B>An Introduction to the Marquesas</B><BR>
by Edmundo Edwards</I></CENTER><BR>
<HR>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Named by their Polynesian discoverers Te Henua Enata or the "Land of Men," the Marquesas islands are located about 700 miles northeast of Tahiti.  This archipelago was the first of the Polynesian Islands to be discovered by the western world, when Alvaro de Mendafia stumbled upon them in 1595 in his quest to rediscover the Solomon Islands.  The Spanish Admiral named them "Islas de Marquesas" in honor of the wife of his patron Don Garcia Hurtado de Mendoza, the Viceroy of Spain in Peru.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Spaniards were well received by the natives <IMG SRC="windsong.gif" ALT="windsong.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=350 HEIGHT=230  BORDER=2>but their signs of welcome were misunderstood.  When a group of some forty men and children boarded the vessels and, carried away by their natural curiosity, started touching the pale skin and feeling the clothes of the explorers the Spaniards became annoyed.  Soon the islanders, probably with the desire to bring proof ashore of this extraordinary encounter, started stealing handker-chiefs, hats and other personal objects.  In response, the Spaniards ordered the cannon to be shot.  In following days more than two hundred people were killed due to further misunderstandings.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the next one hundred and eighty years the islands were forgotten by the Europeans.  Their second visitor was Captain James Cook in 1775.  In 1791, Captain Joseph Ingraham arrived on board a Boston based whaling ship and named the group the Washington Islands.  In the following years the island was visited by numerous whalers and Herman Melville, after deserting from one of them, spent one month in the Taipivai valley and later wrote his book Typee.  Jacques Brel and Paul Gaugin were also drawn to, and inspired by, these enchanted islands<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of volcanic origin, the ridges of the Marquesas tower up to 4000 feet above sea level.  Each island is divided longitudinally by a backbone of jagged volcanic peaks, and many ridges lead as ribs from this mountainous backbone directly to the sea.  The valleys are deep and narrow, with steep ridges and spurs that fall sharply into the rough ocean.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are a large number of endemic plants and birds, such as the white capped fruit dove, ultramarine lorikeet, lphis monarch, the Marquesas reed warbler and swiflet, and literally hundreds of thousands of nesting sooty terns.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cultural and linguistic materials indicate that the first settlers of the Marquesas, whether by accident or intent, originated in Western Polynesia.  They may have arrived as early as the 2nd century BC and, probably over a period of many voyages, succeeded in introducing to the Marquesas all of their plants of economic value - bananas, sugar cane and yams.  Breadfruit and taro were main staples, and fermented breadfruit paste was preserved in enormous underground silos.  Taro was planted on irrigated terraces covering most of a valleys floor.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is speculated that the Marquesas Islands were the first to be settled in Eastern Polynesia, and that it was from here that the Polynesians inhabited Easter Island, Hawaii, and the northern Tuamotus groups.  It is probable that their cultural sphere could have included the Society Islands and extended as far south as Pitcairn and Mangareva.  Oral traditions, linguistics and common cultural traits are evidence of a long history of contact between these islands.  Rock art, specially petroglyphs, were very common and both Easter Island and Hawaii share an important set of Marquesas motifs.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the ages as the population grew every valley became inhabited by various tribes, and in the larger valleys there were sometimes several unrelated settlements occupying land between the rivers.  Every tribe had its chief, who lived in a large tribal center where all festivals and other social activities took place.  These centers, named "Taha Koina", consisted always of a rectangular, paved dancing ground surrounded by stone platforms on which temporary houses would be erected.  The recently restored Taha Koina of the valley of Taa'oa on Hiva Oa could hold close to ten thousand people during these festivals.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On one end of the dancing platform, or in its close proximity, <IMG SRC="tiki.gif" ALT="tiki.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=120 HEIGHT=200>there was a sacrificial platform (Me'ae) and the high priest's house.  These high priests sometimes acquired enormous power and fame during their life time and their spirits would become tutelary deities of the tribe.  The priests were good ventriloquists and made the people believe that the wooden and stone statues (Tikis) that represented deified tribal ancestors spoke to them.  They would be in charge of consecrating new objects and other tribal belongings, and would live with their assistants, who were in charge of handling, killing and disposing of the sacrificial victims that came from enemy or neighboring tribes.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Following in social order were the warriors - the tribe's pride - who lived in special houses and guarded fortresses that were built upon the ridges separating the valleys.  Profes-sional craftsmen also were con-sidered important.  They specialized in the building of houses, boats, fishhooks, stone adzes, fly whisks, tattooing, etc.  Fish were abundant in the surrounding waters, and an important part of the diet.  However, fishermen were considered the lowest class, sleeping in coastal shrines when fishing.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Marquesans created a very complex culture with highly developed art and sophisticated decorative designs.  Every object was elaborately carved - a tradition which still survives today.  The art of tattooing attained artistic perfection and the islanders became known for their full body tattoos.  In recent years there has been a revival of this tradition.  Many of the younger people now carry beautiful tattoos with great pride.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Todays Marquesans feel very proud of their history and traditions.  They have enhanced their cultural identity through an organization called Motu Haka, and by engaging in festivals which strengthen all traditional aspects of their culture - dance, weaving, wood carving, chants and traditional story telling.  The Marquesas are among those few alluring islands which remain to be explored.  To discover their colorful history is an opportunity that should not be missed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Edmundo Edwards has worked on numerous archeological projects in the Marquesas islands over the last two decades.  He currently resides on Easter Island, and is an expert on the cultural history, as well as current affairs, of eastern Polynesia.  In addition to traveling aboard the Wind Song, he will lead several of our Easter Island extensions.<BR>

<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many expedition travelers to Indonesia feel they must journey as far off the beaten path as possible, away from centers of "mass tourism" to places such as the Asmat or Muluku Sea regions.  Sometimes, in the rush to the more remote parts of Indonesia, Bali becomes a mere transit point.  Tourists who only visit the posh resorts or loud beach towns remark on how Bali is "spoiled" and overrun with discos, vendors, and hotels.  Unfortunately, most travelers never see the "other Bali," the Bali I call home.  This Bali is one of daily offerings, rituals and ceremonies, of smiles that touch the heart, of stunning man made and natural landscapes, of people who remind one how to be gentle again.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I first visited Ubud 10 years ago when there was only one telephone, hardly any electricity or cars.  I  came for two weeks and stayed two months.  During this time, I became very close to a cheerful lady named Wayan - first born in Balinese.  Wayan operated a small "warung" or food stall on the dirt path that is now Monkey Forest Road.  She sold coffee to rice farmers and made black rice pudding for the small number of tourists who visited.  Her husband Ketut - fourth born in Balinese, operated a small art studio.  Wayan and Ketut looked after me so well, I returned to live with their family and never left.  Wayans food stall has become Cafe Wayan, receiving write-ups in Bon Appetite Magazine.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few years ago, on secluded family land overlooking rice fields and a river valley, Ketut created a guesthouse called Alam Indah, meaning beautiful nature.  I now run Alam Indah, and operate cultural tours throughout Indonesia.  I feel blessed to have my own perfect niche in Bali, where, with the help of my Balinese family and friends, I share with special individuals a side of Bali most visitors never see.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through running several small cultural programs in Bali, I came to know Jean and William Ingram.  The Ingrams have lived in Bali for over 10 years and have a wonderfully close relationship with the Balinese family whose home they share.  They too, have a deep love for Bali and feel feel that environmentally and culturally sensitive tourism can reinforce pride in the traditional way of life while sharing its wisdom with the rest of  the world.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="bali.gif" ALT="bali.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=250 BORDER=2>I have long been associated with Zegrahm Expeditions Indonesia voyages, and have traveled with many of their clients.  Therefore, I was delighted when I was asked to design an itinerary which would show off "my" Bali.  Our adventure will be centered in Ubud, the arts and cultural center of the island.  Here, at our home Alam Indah,  we slip into another mode of life, more in tune with geckos and the sounds of frogs than the hectic life of a crowded beach.  We will have the exclusive use of Alam Indah - 10 comfortable, Balinese style rooms set amidst lush gardens, with a beautiful swimming pool overlooking the river valley and the sacred land of the Monkey Forest Temple.  We start the day with yoga, slowing down our western pace of life as we learn varied aspects of Balinese culture.  Our experience will be one of peaceful learning, as we meet gamelan players, master wood carvers and herbalists.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Our visit will coincide with the Galungan festival, the most important festival of the year.  During Galungan all of Bali makes beautiful bamboo poles called penjor which are placed in front of family compounds for the Gods of Mount Agung to see.  We observe and take part in learning the cycle of worshipping the Gods and ancestors through our Bali guides and their Balinese families.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This Zegrahm program differs somewhat from their Indonesia voyages.  I think I would call it more of a cultural immersion than an expedition, for through the insights of Jean and William and their family, we have a unique opportunity to experience daily life in Bali with a small personalized group.  We will come to understand more of how the Balinese look at life and, through this, we will come to understand why they are able to maintain their culture in the mist of such change.  Balinese Hinduism recognizes the forces of positive and negative as equal.  The Balinese are devoted to maintaining a harmony between the two.  This is the reason Balinese culture remains strong through all development and change.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I hope I may be your host in Indonesia.  As William says, "Now that I know what is possible in life, I cannot settle for anything else...."..Come and see some of the last treasures on earth.<BR>
<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>Our trip Beyond Bali departs 12 September 1997.  It will include eight days in Ubud, three days in Munduk and four days in Sulawesis Toraja Land.  We will also offer an optional extension to Borneo to photograph the orangutan.  Call Kristy to receive a "hot off the press" brochure.</I><BR>

<TITLE>CARI BARRON - A PROFILE, ZEGRAHM NEWS VOL. 6, NO. 4</TITLE>

<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cari showed an early penchant for expedition travel when, in her mid-twenties, she left her home in eastern Washington for the Shumagin Islands in Alaska.  There, she lived in an Aleut community of 500 people and worked for the fishing industry for five years.  Caris adventurous spirit thrived on her experience in the wilderness.  Also, as winters are typically the industrys off season, she was able to devote several weeks each year to globetrotting - exploring in Jamaica, Australia, New Zealand, Tahiti, Fiji and Costa Rica.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<IMG SRC="cbcanoe.gif" ALT="cbcanoe.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=270 HEIGHT=170 BORDER=2>Caris job responsibilities required that she spend several months a year in Seattle, so when she decided to move from fishing to real estate she had already put down some significant roots in this city.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it turned out, Cari and Zegrahm have a mutual friend.  While this friend said to Cari: "You should really give Zegrahm a call, they are right up your alley!"; she said to us: "If you ever need a hard working team player with a lot of spirit and a great sense of humor, talk to Cari Barron."  We met Cari just at the time we were trying to decide on a Program Manager for our new 1995 South Pacific voyages.  We were immediately impressed with her attitude and poise and, when we learned of her experience in the South Pacific, decided that she would be a great addition to our team.  Cari joined us enthusiastically, and even signed up for a scuba diving course in preparation for her familiarization trip to Polynesia.  However, a staff change in the fall of 1994 required that we quickly find a replacement Program Manager for our upcoming Botswana expeditions.  It did not take long to convince Cari to join a Botswana expedition instead.  Her resulting love for southern Africa, and devotion to these programs, and her has made her quite an African expert.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to her African responsibilities, Cari assists with our Galapagos expeditions, and combined a trip to the "enchanted islands" in 1995 with a vacation/research trip to Peru, where her experience and research has come in handy in the planning of our 1997 Peru expeditions.  In 1997, Cari will add another Program Manager hat to her collection, when she operates our India: Realm of the Tiger expeditions.  In preparation, she departs in a few weeks for a familiarization trip to that country.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like so many of us at Zegrahm, Cari is an outdoors enthusiast, and enjoys hiking, camping and fishing.  She has a new interest in cross country skiing, which she credits to Zegrahms annual winter ski retreat.  Another hobby is collecting antiques.  A few months ago, Cari turned this interest into a small business when she and two friends decided to start a small retail shop.  As Cari says, "it was a way that I could continue to peruse estate sales and poke into small antique shops without having to buy a bigger apartment for my purchases !"<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As you can imagine, this all keeps Cari rather busy.  While her scuba lessons are still on hold, there is no doubt in Caris mind that one of these days she will return to the South Pacific.<BR>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Snorkel and Dive Alert - </I></B></FONT><BR>
Dont make other plans for January, 1998!  We are planning both a snorkel and a dive expedition in the new Micronesian nation of Palau.  Just recently autonomous from the US Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, Palau is often refered to as the most beautiful of Micronesian destinations.  Only nine of the 343 islands are inhabited, and the area is renowned by scuba divers and snorkelers worldwide.  Five full days of our snorkel expedition will be spent on a live-aboard yacht, to allow us to move easily amongst the islands and concentrate on the fantastic marine life.  Another five days will be devoted to cultural exploration of Palau, with continuing daily opportunities to snorkel as well.<BR>
In addition to our snorkeling expedition, we will offer a separate diving trip for "hard core" divers to the seldom-visited islands southwest of Palau.  Eleven days will be spent on our chartered yacht exploring the waters surrounding Tobi, Helen, Metur and Sonsorol islands.<BR>
Both trips will include three days on the traditional, hospitable islands of Yap, where a highlight will be swimming with manta rays.<BR>
Zegrahm co-founder Jack Grove will be the expedition leader for our Micronesia expeditions.  Look for his scouting report in a future edition of Zegrahm News, but in the meantime, give Tony a call if you want to be added to our interest list - Each expedition is limited to just 17 participants.<BR>

Arctic explorer John Dunn tells the story of his 1994 traverse of Baffin Island - by ski, kayak and hiking boots - in the October 1996 issue of National Geographic.  The article is accompanied by Johns stunning photographs taken during the expedition.  John will be a part of the expedition-leading team on our first-ever Circumnavigation of Baffin Island expedition in August 1997.  For those booked on this voyage, and/or those who are interested in Arctic adventure, his article and photographs should not be missed!<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>1997 Last Chance for Wind Song in Polynesia!</FONT></I></B><BR>
Our Polynesia Under Sail voyages have been extremely popular and presently two of our three spring expeditions in 1997 are waitlisted, with very limited space available on our third departure.  Furthermore, we have been advised that the Wind Song will leave the waters of the South Pacific by the end of 1997.  This is therefore truly a Last Chance notice:  We have chartered the Wind Song for two more voyages through the Tuamotus & Marquesas archipelagos in October of 1997.  Brochures for these voyages are ready to go but, judging from the response to our spring programs, space will soon be in short supply.  If you are interested, give Wendy or Nadia a call.<BR>

<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Birders Corner</FONT></I></B><BR>
The Seychelles:  Cast adrift in mid-ocean, a millennia of isolation has created here a feathered fantasia of some of the rarest birds on the planet.  Of special interest is the endemic Seychelles bare-legged scops owl.  Only a handful remain and to date no eggs or nest have ever been found.<BR>
Even rarer, at one time at least, was the Seychelles warbler.  In 1959 there were just 26 left on earth.  Careful management has now brought this bird back from the brink of extinction and there are now over 400 individuals.  Less fortunate is the fate of the Seychelles magpie robin, which today numbers just 42 birds.<BR>
These are just a few of the birds that can be seen on our Indian Ocean expeditions in 1997.  If you would like to see the "rarest of the rare" give Lynne a call.<BR>

<HR>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Round Britain:</B>  We will again charter the Caledonian Star for a voyage from Dartmouth to Edinburgh 29 May - 12 June 1998.  This will be the same itinerary as our successful 95 and 96 voyages.  Itinerary highlights:  Alderney, Sark, Isles of Scilly, Waterford, Saltee Islands, Isle of Man, Giants Causeway, Rathlin Island, Isles of Iona, Staffa, St. Kilda, Flannan Islands, Orkney Islands, Shetland Islands and the Isle of May.
<BR>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Lands of Humboldt & Darwin:</B>  In November 1998 we will again sail along the Western Coast of South America on a voyage to the Lands of Humboldt & Darwin.  We sail southward along the coasts of Peru and Chile, where natural beauty is manifest in contrasting climates, vegetation and wildlife.  Photograph the ruins of Chan Chan - largest adobe city in the world - and fly over the famous Nazca Lines.  Visit to Lauca National Park, one of South Americas most spectacular wildlife heritages located high in the Andes mountains.  We journey the length of the nutrient-rich waters of the Humboldt Current to witness some of our planets greatest concentrations of birds, whales, seals, and dolphins.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<B>Kamchatka Peninsula:</B>  We have planned this itinerary for late June, 1998, when wildlife is active and wildflowers are in full bloom.  The enormous, active volcanos of the Kamchatka Peninsula, some over 14,000 feet, provide a stunning backdrop for snow sheep, Siberian bighorn, more than 180 species of birds.  We will journey along the Kamchatka Peninsula, through the Commander Islands (Bering Island), the Aleutians, Pribilofs, St. Matthew and St. Lawrence Islands to Nome, Alaska, a route rich in geology, wildlife and natural history.

<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Ive got one!"  I hear the triumphant cry as I float near Mayotte, one of the Comoros Islands off the East African coast.  Some of us traveling on the M/V Caledonian Star during a March expedition from Zanzibar to the Seychelles have snorkeled across grassy shallows in hope of swimming among green turtles.<IMG SRC="turtle.gif" ALT="turtle.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=218 HEIGHT=200 ><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When we reach a thriving coral reef, a group clusters around marine biologist Jack Grove as he dives and identifies myriad exotic fish.  I hover nearby over the vertical drop-off.  When I hear the exultant shout, I swim diagonally out from the reef as a huge turtle streaks up from the depths and levels off a dozen feet beneath me.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Away from the flurry of human activity, she glides calmly through the sapphire waters and I swim quietly above, trying to match the rhythm of her flippers with my own.  After long moments she pauses, turns her head, and gazes toward me with one wise eye.  I pause too, and hover until she decides I pose no threat and resumes her journey.  Life has wrinkled both of our skins; algae encrust her carapace and my hair is gray.  So, as two seasoned females separated by eons of evolution, we swim in a rhythmic communion.  With fresh clarity, I understand the difference between watching a creature of a different species and truly being with one.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Through a timeless interlude we swim in harmony until it occurs to me that her destination might be Africa - and my passport is on the ship!  Reluctantly, I wish her well and turn away.  As I swim back to shore, memories of the late Sir Peter Scott drift across my mind.  I dived and snorkeled with that ardent conservationist and president of the World Wildlife Fund during an Indian Ocean journey in 1986 (as it happens, the divemaster on that trip was Mike Messick.)<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How privileged we are," Sir Peter said as we clambered out of the sea after swimming with one of his favorites - the cobalt, black and yellow palette surgeonfish.  "How privileged that these beautiful creatures allow us to share their realm".<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I feel that privilege today.<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What makes a great expedition itinerary?  This is a question which we are constantly asking ourselves as we prepare our future Travel Calendar.  When we introduce a new expedition in our newsletter, we wait eagerly to get the first response from clients.  If the phones are ringing and available space on the departure is rapidly shrinking we know that we have a winner.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was certainly the case with our 1996 Across the Top of Australia and Australias Kimberley expeditions.  While we have always been fascinated with this area - about which so little is known - we knew our hunch was right when Australian travel agents began to call us in order to book their clients on this expedition!<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another indication that our Australia expeditions were truly compelling was the reaction of the crew and officers of the Coral Princess.  This 42-passenger vessel normally travels along the Great Barrier Reef, and I think the crew were almost as excited as the passengers to have the opportunity to see this little-visited part of their country.  The captain and officers even used their seniority status to be assigned to our charters!  The owner of the vessel was aboard for one voyage and, upon disembarking, thanked expedition leaders Mike and Sonja for showing him his own country!<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While we thrive on the encouraging enthusiasm of both ship staff and clients, there is also a lot of behind-the-scenes preparation that goes into developing a new expedition destination.  As a result of our research and scouting, we decided to build a specially designed excursion boat, the ZOE Explorer, whose shallow draft and powerful engines allow safe exploration along the shoreline and up the shallow rivers of northwestern Australias convoluted coast.  In addition, we developed plans to charter helicopters for flightseeing excursions in order to give passengers an idea of the interior of the country, as well as to ferry them to scenic Mitchell Falls and other areas of interest not accessible from the shore.  We hired a jet boat for a day to allow an excursion up the mighty Ord River, and chartered small planes to fly over Lake Argyle and the Bungle Bungles, two extraordinary regions not to be missed.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now that our first Australian season is over, we can report that it was a great success!  Lots of happy people disembarked at the end of each voyage, and we have heard many enthusiastic comments from both staff and clients.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the interest of "spreading the word" about Australias northwestern coast, we have allotted a generous amount of space in this newsletter to the topic.  You can find below several interesting items of Aussie "Trivia," and inside is Lisa Kings article about her experiences in the land of "Aus". Finally, turn to the back of the Response Card in this issue to read some of what passengers had to say! <BR>
<P>
I hope that you enjoy this edition of Zegrahm News.<BR>

<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As I arrived at breakfast one morning aboard the Coral Princess, sometime in the middle of the first Zegrahm Kimberley trip, Mike handed me a fax from the office with a note from Werner:  "While aboard, would you mind writing an article about your experiences in the Kimberley for the next newsletter?" With good intentions, I responded in the next fax that I would be happy to do so.  However, I soon realized that accomplishing this seemingly simple task was certainly not going to happen as long as I was exploring the Kimberley coast.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Soon after we sailed from Wyndham in early May, I realized this was not going to be a trip like any other.  There were no restful days at sea to enable us to "catch up."  In fact, there were no afternoons or mornings at sea - free time was as rare as clouds on the <IMG SRC="zoeexpl.gif" ALT="zoeexpl.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=300 HEIGHT=200 BORDER=2>horizon.  I kept telling myself I would find the time tomorrow.  Needless to say, it never happened - not until after I disembarked in Broome.  So, as I sit here on a plane bound for home, after what has truly been a fantastic expedition, I have finally found the quiet time to write about a most incredible voyage.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like many people, a year ago I had never heard of the Kimberley.  A place called Broome?  I thought that is what you swept the kitchen with.  Darwin?  I thought he was a the man who came up with the theory of evolution, not a charming little town in Northern Australia.  As for crocodiles - I can honestly say that I was not in any hurry to come face to face with them.  Little did I know...<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first, one may think Australia is not a remote enough destination for someone interested in an "expedition.  However, the northwestern corner, known as the Kimberley, is one of the most remote, isolated and little known places in the world.  Very few people live here - less than 25,000 inhabitants in an area the size of Great Britain.  The majority of the residents are aboriginals, whose estimated 40,000 year history on this continent is depicted on countless rock overhangs and isolated cave walls which we seemed to stumble upon in the middle of nowhere.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a doubt, the most ominous and well known resident of this region has four legs, not two and is reminiscent of another age in our history.  The saltwater crocodile - a truly prehistoric looking creature - I found to be simply terrifying yet mysteriously captivating.  It is virtually impossible to believe that these reptiles grow as large as 8 meters in length, but as you see them slither silently through the water, their yellow eyes and scaled head barely breaking the surface, you immediately understand why the locals do not dare to swim in the murky waters close to shore.  At night as we patrolled aboard ZOE Explorer - our specially equipped 48 passenger excursion boat, built especially for these trips to cruise the shallow waters of otherwise inaccessible rivers - we were stopped cold by the "salties" eyes, which glow red as they rest motionlessly on the muddy river banks.<BR>
<A NAME="map"></A>
<A HREF="map.html"><IMG SRC="map_sm.gif" ALT="map_sm.gif" WIDTH=64 HEIGHT=64>The Kimberley Map</a><BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, not all residents of the Kimberley are this intimidating.  On one occasion, we marveled as a female green turtle slowly made her way across more than 100 meters of beautiful white sandy beach from the waters edge to the safety of higher ground, where she proceeded to dig a deep hole and lay her eggs with great determination.  Then, her task completed, she returned to the sea.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The sea is the focal point of life in the Kimberley.  The enormous tides vary as much as 10 meters - the third largest in the world.  In the Kimberley, everything revolves around the ebbing and flowing tides.  At low tide, entire river beds dry up, mangroves are exposed to their tangled roots and mud flats come alive with mud skippers, crabs, and crocodiles.  When the water rises, the environment changes, as all forms of life who do not want to be submerged retreat to higher ground.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of my favorite stories from this voyage was the day we decided to have a barbecue on remote Albert Island.  The Captain agreed that this was a great idea, but cautioned that we had to be careful to return to the ship early because of the tides, which were particularly large in this area at this time of the month.  Not long after we were ashore, having set up all of our cooking gear, we began noticing that the tide was dropping much more quickly than we expected.  As a matter of fact, based on our well placed log/water markers, the tide was dropping about a meter every 15-20 minutes!  Soon the waters edge was more than half a mile from our original landing site.  As darkness fell, it was closer to a mile!  Mike and I walked endlessly across the newly exposed beach, flashlight in hand, trying to discern exactly where the waters edge was.  At one point a small turtle crossed our path, and Mike debated carrying it back up the beach to where we had built a campfire, to show the passengers.  It was still a long walk however, and the turtle was anxious to move on without us.  When we finally reached the waters edge, the Coral Princess was only about 1 mile away, and we briefly considered wading back to the ship.  But passengers had settled in comfortably on the beach, singing songs by the fire and enjoying the balmy Australian evening, so we decided it was best to wait until the tide turned.  Fortunately, the tide returned as quickly as it had receded and by 2300 we were all back on board (the BBQ equipment, too!) after a truly amazing day.<BR>
<IMG SRC="digirido.gif" ALT="digirido.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH=230 HEIGHT=150 HEIGHT=150>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are so many things that make Australias Kimberley a unique destination.  Perhaps the unofficial national motto - "No Worries" - sums it all up.  This catchall phrase describes life in the land of "Aus."  The people are friendly, accommodating and amenable and fortunately this warm, laid back feeling is immediately contagious.  Before I knew it, I was calling everyone I met "mate" and by the end, I did finally realize which side of the car to get in to as a passenger (they kept wondering why I was trying to drive their cars!)<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rarely explored Kimberley region is a land of untold hidden secrets.  The rich history and spectacular scenery make it an excellent destination of discovery.  It would take years to explore it all - but what a pleasure just to scratch the surface!
<P>
<I> Werners note:  As many of you know, Lisa has for years been the undisputed Polar Queen, preferring the cooler weather of these regions to our more equatorial destinations.  Although she was looking forward to accompanying two of our 1996 Australian expeditions, she was a bit hesitant about the very warm temperatures, which are in the 80s during the time of our voyages.  However, I was not surprised when she came back full of enthusiasm, wanting to return next year!</I>

<HR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will Steger, a native Minnesotan and second of nine children, began very young to dream about exploration.  When 12 years old he participated in the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year project by volunteering to help chart the northern lights.  At 15, he and a brother built a small boat and traveled together down the Mississippi River.  He completed an expedition by kayak from southern Alberta to northern Alaska - a trip of 3,000 miles - at the age of 20.  As a young adult, he continued to seek <IMG SRC="steger.gif" ALT="steger.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=320 HEIGHT=381 BORDER=2>adventure and challenge himself personally through exploration - making three first ascents of peaks higher than 18,900 feet in the Peruvian Andes, and kayaking 4,000 miles on the Mackenzie, Peace and Yukon Rivers.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a bachelors degree in geology and a masters in education, Will taught junior high school science in St. Paul for three years.  However, he found the classroom confining, and searched for a way to combine his love of teaching with his passion for nature and the outdoors.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1970, Will bought the first pieces of land which would grow over the years into the "Homestead" - a 300 acre complex outside of Ely, northern Minnesota, in the midst of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area.  He built himself a small cabin and began organizing outdoor winter camping skills trips for students, primarily juvenile delinquents from the Twin Cities area of Minnesota.  This endeavor grew into the Lynx Track Winter School and gave Will the opportunity to teach science, as well as geology and conservation, in a classroom without four walls.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will also continued his own exploration of the Arctic by dog sled and cross country skis.  These "personal" expeditions - either solo or with one or two others - deepened not only his affinity for the Arctic, but also his appreciation of the importance of polar regions to the rest of the planet and the need to bring the worlds attention to this fact.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wills first major, planned expedition was to the North Pole using dog sleds in the spring of 1986.  His goal was to successfully reach the Pole without any outside aid in either navigation or supplies, making his the first successful dogsled expedition without resupply since Robert E. Pearys 1909 expedition.  En route to the Pole, on the 8th of April, the path of Stegers expedition miraculously crossed that of Jean-Louis tienne - a Frenchman attempting the first solo ski to 90 North.  tienne and Steger sat together that evening in Stegers tent, drinking tea and talking, and discovered that they shared the goal of crossing Antarctica by dogsled.  Phone numbers were exchanged, and the next day the two expeditions went their separate ways, both to successfully reach their goal of the North Pole (tienne on the 11th of May, 10 days after Stegers team).  However, soon after returning to their respective homes, Steger and tienne began to coordinate the 1989/90 International Trans-Antarctica Expedition.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to the individual challenge of crossing Antarctica by dog sled along its longest axis - a distance of 3,741 miles - the International Trans-Antarctica Expedition meant to demonstrate the possibility of international cooperation in achieving a common goal.  The team was comprised of six men, from six different countries and very different backgrounds.  They started from Seal Nunataks at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, on July 27, 1989, reached the South Pole on December 11, and arrived at their final goal - the Mirnyy Base of the former Soviet Union on the far side of the continent - on March 3rd, 1990.  Returning from their adventure, all six team members traveled to each country represented on the expedition.  There, they met with political leaders and scientists to discuss the importance of international cooperation in protecting the Antarctic continent.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stegers third major expedition took place just over a year ago.  The 1995 International Arctic Project crossed the frozen ocean by dog sled from Severnaya Zemlya to the North Pole, then continued south to Ward Hunt, on the northern coast of Ellesmere Island, accomplishing the final leg of their route using specially-designed canoes with sled-like runners for portaging over the ice.  Once again the team of six - four men and two women - was international, and the focus was on the education of the public about the Arctic as well as on personal achievement.  On this expedition, however, Will focused his attention on the education of children - the leaders of tomorrow.  The International Arctic Project carried a laptop computer - complete with its own sleeping bag to keep it warm during the freezing nights - on the trek.  Team members transmitted daily reports directly to classrooms around the world via the internet.  Perhaps most importantly, they were also able to receive messages from the school children, who asked them about the everyday aspects of the expedition.  In this way, countless children participated in the adventure, learning about geography, geology, history, conservation and exploration in an exciting, hands-on manner.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the successful completion of the International Arctic Project, Will has declared that his days of planning major, international expeditions are over.<IMG SRC="chinstp2.gif" ALT="chinstp2.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=150 HEIGHT=149> As fulfilling as his three major expeditions have been, especially to his goal of focusing the worlds attention on the Arctic regions, Will is eager to return to the simpler explorations possible with only one or two people.  He plans on continuing his own exploration, and is working on a solo ski to the North Pole for the summer of 1997.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has not given up his efforts to focus global attention on the Arctic and Antarctica however, and is readying the Homestead for use as a conference center where educators, scientists and international leaders can meet to discuss and develop strategies for heightening global awareness of the importance of our polar regions.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In December of 1995, National Geographic Society presented Will with the John Oliver La Gorce Medal for accomplishment in geographic exploration, the sciences and for public service to advance international understanding.  Will is just the 19th recipient of this honor since the medals inception in 1909.  Other honorees to be so decorated are Robert E. Peary, Amelia Earhart and Jacques Cousteau.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The National Geographic Society has been a part of Will Stegers life since he was a boy.  As a ten-year-old, he traded his hockey skates for a sledload of old National Geographic magazines!  Will credits the Society for fueling his interest in the polar regions - especially Antarctica - with their provocative photographs and articles of early polar explorers.  The National Geographic Society has been a contributor to each of Stegers three major expeditions, and published his articles and photographs from his journeys.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all of the support he has received from the National Geographic Society over the years, Will is now giving his time in assisting National Geographic with their educational efforts in the polar regions.  He will be a part of Zegrahms expedition-leading team, and will host members of National Geographics Grosvenor Council, on our <B>Antarctica, South Georgia & Falkland Islands</B> voyage, departing 15 January 1997.

Take a look at the June issue of <I>National Geographic</I> to get a fascinating picture of aboriginal life on the Cape York Peninsula, as well as spectacular photos of the "Saltie" - Australias saltwater crocodile!<BR>
<I><B><FONT SIZE=5>Modern Gypsies Buy Land!!!</FONT></B><BR>
(the following was printed in a Harare, Zimbabwe newspaper)</I><BR>
....Mike & Sonja Messick, better known as "Modern day Gypsies", bought land in Zimbabwe.  On the northeast outskirts of the capital, Harare, in the area known as Umwinsidale.  heir 10 acre plot overlooks the Shamva Valley and is situated on a side of Turtle Hill known by locals as Kamba Hill.  The land borders the couples parents estate of 85 acres.  It is rumored that they will build a small, up-scale market lodge.<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>From the Where Are They Now file:</FONT></I></B><BR>
As some of you may remember, Taylor Ricketts left our shipboard staff a year ago in order to pursue his long-held graduate school plans.  After a year of applying to programs and working at World Wildlife Fund, he reports that he will be heading to Stanford University in September to begin a Ph.D. program in Conservation Biology.  He will be working with Paul Ehrlich, whom he met on a Stanford Alumni Association/ Zegrahm Expeditions excursion to Antarctica in 1993!  The National Science Foundation seems to be as impressed as we are, because they have awarded him a very prestigious and coveted Graduate Fellowship to fund his research.  Good luck Taylor!<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Still have travel time in September?</FONT></I></B><BR>
Our expedition to the <I><B>Canyon Country of the American Southwest</B></I> has just a few spaces available.  No visa is required, and a domestic airline ticket is all you need to experience one of the richest natural and cultural history areas in this country during the best time of the year!  This is a <I>Last Chance</I> expedition, so call Tony today for further information and to reserve one of the remaining spaces.<BR>
<B><I><FONT SIZE=5>Congratulations Shirley!</FONT></I></B><BR>
In May of this year, Zegrahm co-founder Shirley Metz was elected to membership in the prestigious <I>Society of Woman Geographers.</I>  This international organization is comprised of widely traveled women interested in exploration, who have carried out research and field activities in their particular disciplines.  As the first woman to travel overland to the South Pole in 1988-89, Shirley has continued working on environmental issues for Antarctica and spends several weeks a year co-leading expeditions for our exploration of the icy continent.<BR>
One of SWGs founding members was Amelia Earhart.  Other members, past and present, are Dorothy Schweitzer, Virginia B. Ball, Edith "Jackie" Ronne, Mary Livingston Ripley, Mary Leakey and Sylvia Earle.<BR>

There are few places in the "underwater" world which can compete with the reefs surroun-ding most of Indonesia's 13,565 islands.  Not only is the diversity of fish mind boggling, but multi-colored corals, large sponges and sea fans - not to mention many vertical wall drop offs - combine to make these waters one of my favorite snorkeling and diving destinations.<BR>
<IMG SRC="threadfn.gif" ALT="threadfn.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH=175 HEIGHT=141>
On our Ikats, Reefs and Dragons expedition next September, we will have lots of opportunities to snorkel and dive in the crystal clear waters of the Flores and Banda Seas.  We plan to explore the islands of Lombok, Sumbawa, Komodo, Flores, Lomblem, Alor, Wetar, Lucipara and Banda in the "cool and fresh" hours of the morning, afternoons are usually set aside for snorkeling and diving.  The nutrient rich waters attract a variety of cetaceans and during our last few voyages we encountered spinner dolphins (lot's), pilot, sperm, and Cuvier's beaked whales. On one trip even the rare blue whale made an appearance!<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those of you that yearn for an extravagance of southern seabirds - take heart, the summer solstice has passed. Soon the swallows of Capistrano will be heading south and so too will we.  But we will go further south than the swallows....<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On 30 November 1996, we begin a voyage to a land where beaches are crammed with parades of majestic king penguins.  A place where you can watch displays of the wandering albatross, our planet's largest flying bird. This is South Georgia; magical, bewitching, a place rarely visited, and regarded by those lucky enough to have reached its pristine shores as the jewel of the Southern Oceans.<BR>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="albatros.gif" ALT="albatros.gif"  WIDTH=331 HEIGHT=132></CENTER>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;South Georgia boasts several million penguins and normally hard-to-see petrels. The species list includes king, chinstrap, gentoo and macaroni penguins;  grey-headed, wandering, black-browed and light-mantled sooty albatrosses; blue, white-chinned, Kerguelen, Atlantic, grey and soft-plumaged petrels and numerous species of prion and shearwaters. There are even two endemic land birds, The South Georgia pintail and pipit.	Our Circumnavigation of South Georgia will also include several days exploring the Falkland Islands. A highlight will be our visit to Steeple Jason, home to the largest albatross colony in the world, plus rockhopper penguins, striated caracaras and a host of others.<BR>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a complete bird list of this unique and peerless wonder spot call Lynne at our office, but hurry, space is filling fast!<BR>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Antarctic explorer Apsley Cherry-Garrard once said, "If you have the desire for knowledge and the power to give it physical expression, go out and explore." Though he said it more than 75 years ago, his words hold true for the seven of us who founded ZEGRAHM EXPEDITIONS. Over the past years, we've been fortunate to do exactly as Cherry-Garrard exhorted. As a team, we're in a position to share more than 80 years of expedition experience with you -- to give you the adventure of a lifetime.

<H1>Science Technology & Education Program of the Alaska SAR Facility in the Geophysical Institute</H1>
<H2>Introduction</H2>
The <STRONG>Science Technology & Education Program</STRONG> (STEP) is part
of the Alaska SAR Facility (<A HREF="http://www.asf.alaska.edu">ASF</A>)
located in the Geophysical Institute (<A
HREF="http://www.gi.alaska.edu">GI</A>) on the Fairbanks campus of the
University of Alaska (<A HREF ="http://zorba.uafadm.alaska.edu">UAF</A>).
ASF is a satellite-tracking ground station for the acquisition,
processing, archiving and distribution of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery and derived products for the science community in cooperation with
international <A HREF="FAs.html">flight agencies.</A>
<P>
The ASF <B>Science Technology and Education Program (STEP)</B> was
conceived by the Polar Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) Advisory
Group (PoDAG) in the fall of 1994. The name STEP was officially recognized
and authorized by NASA soon after the PoDAG meeting. The STEP lab contains
the system formerly referred to as the Interactive Image Analysis System
(IIAS).  One of the tasks assigned by the last PoDAG to the STEP was to
develop <A HREF="software.html">software tools</A> contributed by
principal investigators. A user survey was conducted to prioritize the
development of these <A HREF="software.html">software tools</A>. 
<P>
The vision of the ASF/STEP program is to advance polar research and
the earth sciences by supporting scientific applications of remote sensing
data to better understand the earth as a system. The mission of the
ASF/STEP is to contribute to education at the university, primary,
secondary, and community levels through student involvement, lectures,
curriculum development, electronic information exchange, and tours. 
<P>
The STEP lab (formerly the Interactive Image Analysis System lab) locally
processes SAR satellite data into useful products. In the STEP lab, the
SAR data is enhanced, refined, and combined with other data sets by local
ASF staff or visiting researchers through the use of an assortment of
hardware, and <A HREF="software.html">software tools</A>.

		<TITLE> International Flight Agencies </TITLE>

In the cooperative agreement between NASA, the international flight agencies and ASF, the flight agencies are responsible for building, launching and maintaining the SAR satellites. The flight agencies communicate with the ASF Mission Planning Specialist to provide ASF with satellite ephemeris data to make tracking the satellites possible and coordinate the exact area to be studied and the precise times the SAR sensor will be activated each day. With this information ASF can track the satellites and downlink the SAR data to tape for shipment to the flight agency and for archive.<P>

<DD> In July of 1991 the European Space Agency (<A HREF="http://www.esrin.esa.it">ESA</A>) launched their first SAR satellite, ESA Remote-Sensing SAR Satellite - 1 or <A HREF="http://services.esrin.esa.it/current.htm">ERS-1</A>. Between the launch of ERS-1 through September 1994, (excluding the initial shakedown and testing phase), ASF has successfully tracked 8,590 ERS-1 passes for a total of 116,097.66 minutes and recorded over 44,227.28 minutes of SAR data. At a downlink rate of 104 Mbit/sec that's 275,978,227,200,000 bits or 34,497,278,400,000 bytes!
<P>
The second ESA SAR satellite, <A HREF="http://services.esrin.esa.it/specers2.htm">ERS-2</A>, was launched in April of 1995. It is very similar to ERS-1 with the addition of at least one new sensor - the Global Ozone Measuring Equipment (GOME).

<H1>Information Headquarters for ASF/STEP Software and Tools</H1>
One of the goals of the ASF/STEP program is to create software and 
software tools to help manipulate and explore SAR data. Software, as used 
by the ASF/STEP devlopment team, is defined as an individual program that 
preforms one specific task. However, when working with SAR data, a user 
will need to preform many tasks to achieve the desired result. For 
example, if a user wants to combine multiple SAR images, the user will 
have to preform radiometric calibration, geocoding, and maybe even a 
resampling of the images to obtain what he or she wants.
<P>
To help in this process, STEP has created software tools. A tool helps 
the user by preforming all the specific tasks to accompils what the user 
wants. Using the mosaicking example from the last paragraph, a user could 
use a software tool to preform all the specific tasks automatically.
<P>
Why do we offer both tools and software? We offer the user both because
the user has better idea of what he or she wants to do with their data. 
The software programs by themselves can be used in other ways besides our
tools. We offer the software programs (including the source code) so that
each user can use the programs to his or her best advantage.

<H1>ASF/STEP Software & Tools Release Updates</H1>
The purpose of this page is to inform any users of new releases and
updates to our tools. Individual programs are updated as the need arises
(in case of bug report or a user requested feature). The whole ASF/STEP
tool package is updated about once a month to every two months. An entire
tool update is to make sure that all of our tools can be installed either
individually or as a group without complications. If you have any
questions, contact <A HREF="mailto:mshindle@iias.images.alaska.edu">Mike
Shindle</A > or any other tools developer. 
<P>
Last Entire Tool Release: <B>May 31, 1996</B>
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - May 31, 1996</H2>
All the tools were rearchived and placed in the FTP directories. CEOS
metadata reading is now handled by one program, <A
HREF="swdesc.html#metadata">metadata</A>. The programs,
<B>get_facdr_data</B> and <B>get_mpdrec_data</B> have been discontinued.
<P>
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - March 11, 1996</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#geom1p">Geom1p</A> was altered to prevent a grid
check. By forcing the calculated grid, regardless of mapping checks,
southern ASF station mask images can now be geocoded. Version 7.1 is only
required if an error was experienced trying to geocode images. 
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - January 15, 1996</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#orb_pred">Orb_pred</A> is still in the process of
being repaired. However, the orb_pred program produces errors for
locations outside of Alaska for phases A-E. Testing is occurring for the
other phases. This semi-new version is available by FTP, however orb_pred
is still retaining the previous version number. A new number will be added
when all ERS-1 phase data has been updataed and testing completed. 
<HR>
<H2>Release Update - November 15, 1995</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#orb_pred">Orb_pred</A> is in the process of being
repaired. The orb_pred program produces errors for locations outside of
Alaska. We are waiting for the appropriate orbital information to fix this
bug. 
<P>
<H2>Release Update - October 3, 1995</H2>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#sarin">Sarin</A> has been updated to handle data
files of more than one type. Sarin can now handle WORD (16-bit integer),
LONG (32-bit integer), and REAL (32-bit float) as well as BYTE (8-bit
integer). A new command lien option was added to specify which file to be
used. Also an unformatted man page was added. 
<P>
<A HREF="swdesc.html#resample">Resample</A> has been modified to handle
the changes made to the library function create_ddr(). Create_ddr() now
accepts file data type as an argument. 
<P>
<H2>Release Update - September 20, 1995</H2>
All our tools have been updated to include either a preformatted or
man-coded help or man pages. To access these file by typing <B>man</B>
<I>tool</I> at the command line, add the following to your <B>MANPATH</B>
environment variable: <B>(<I>installation_point</I>)/asf_tools/man</B>.

RADIOMETRIC CALIBRATION: HISTOGRAMS
</H1>
<I>
This document was created in response to the number of questions 
concerning radiometric calibration. This document was prepared by <A 
HREF="mailto:tlogan@images.alaska.edu">Tom Logan</A> to help answer some 
of these questions. To help explain radiometric calibration, this 
document follows the same procedures as our software program 
<B>calibrate</B>. If you have any questions, feel free to contact Tom.

<H2>Introduction</H2>

Before any image to image comparisons can be performed with ASF SAR
images, the data values must be converted to backscatter (s0).  This
process, known as radiometric calibration, converts image data values into
scene independent backscatter values.  This facilitates mosaicking and
animation of SAR images by removing inter- and intra-scene differences
related to the radar transfer characteristics, leaving images that are
self-consistent and consistent with others of the same area. 

<P>

With each calibrated ASF SAR image product, a radiometric data record is
included in the CEOS metadata structures.  This record contains the
calibration coefficients and a table of Noise versus Range values.  These
<A HREF="cal_fig1.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig1.gif" ALIGN=LEFT ALT="[Figure
1]"></A> are utilized by the STEP software tool calibrate which applies
the look up table and calibration cofficients, performs log to linear
conversion, and creates a byte valued output image.  Given an input
image's histogram, we will track what changes calibrate makes to the
histogram in creating the output image.  We take our example image to be
that of Fairbanks, image ID 17972. The data range of <A
HREF="cal_fig1.gif">figure 1</A> is from 37 to 255. 

<P>

Conversion of a data number to backscatter value requires applying noise
scaling, linear conversion, and value offsets.  These coefficients
(a1,a2,a3) are calculated at image creation and can be found at the
beginning of the radiometric calibration recor d.  The conversion of data
value, d, to backscatter in units of dB uses the equation,

<CENTER>
s0 = 10*log10[a2 * ( d * d - a1 * n(r) ) + a3]
</CENTER>

where n(r) is the noise versus range function.  s0 values are then scaled
to byte values within a specified range.

<H2>Calibration Coefficients</H2>

In applying the calibration coefficients, we change the data histogram. 
In particular, the squaring operation stretches out the set of possible
values, so that evenly spaced histogram bins collect different numbers of
squared values.  Here is a simple e xample.  Suppose the original data
take on the values 0,1,2,...,10, with uniform distribution.  Then the
squares can have values 0,1,4,9,16,...,100.  If we make a histogram with a
bin size of 10, then the relative number of values in each bin will be:
4,1 ,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1 (e.g. there are no perfect squares in the interval
from 50 to 60).  So we get positive spikes at the low end of the histogram
and negative spikes at the high end, as observed in the calibrated SAR
data.  Graphically, here is the same example but with values from 1 to
255, uniformly distributed. (See <A HREF="cal_fig2.gif">Figure 2</A> and 
<A HREF="cal_fig3.gif">Figure 3</A>). 

<P>

<A HREF="cal_fig2.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig2.gif" ALT="[Figure 2]"></A>

<H2>Noise Versus Range Look Up Table</H2>

<CENTER>
<I>
&quot;The noise in the image varies with range due to the internal
radiometric compensation for antenna pattern, range to target, and
incidence angle.  Accurate conversion to backscatter requires subtraction
of the noise...&quot;

<A HREF="cal_fig4.gif">
<IMG SRC="tcal_fig4.gif" ALT="[Figure 4]" ALIGN=RIGHT>
</A>

For each ASF image, a look up table (LUT) of noise vs. range values is
created.  The full resolution ASF ERS-1 image has 8192 range samples per
line, but only 256 values are included in the table.  The same table is
used for the low resolution images as for the full resolution.  Thus,
interpolation from one data point to another in the table is required. 
Suppose we have ns range samples in our data set.  Then given a LUT of 256
values (rdr.noise[0-255]), each LUT value must be used for ns / 256 data
sam ples.  For a given sample number, <I>r</I>, we set

<P>

<PRE>
 	ispace = ns / 256	
	base   = r / ispace
	delta  = r mod ispace
</PRE>

then,

<PRE>
	 		        (rdr.noise[base+1]-rdr.noise[base])
     n(r) = rdr.noise[base] +  -------------------------------------  * delta
		                  	       ispace
</PRE>

interpolates the look up table values for this sample number.

<P>

After application of the calibration coefficients and the noise vs. range
LUT, the data histogram is that shown in the Intermediate 1 figure (see 
<A HREF="#fig5">figure 5</A>). 
<P>

<A NAME="fig5"></A>

Data Range: 0.005620 to 0.388644
</B>
</CENTER>

<H2>Logarithm To Linear Conversion</H2>
	
Performing the log10 operation also modifies the appearance of the data
histogram.  An example of this change is graphically illustrated below. 
Given an even distribution of 1 occurrence of the numbers from 0.0015 to
0.3825 (stepping by 0.0015), we get the histogram on the left. (See <A
HREF="cal_fig6.gif">Figure 6</A>.) Taking the log10 of these numbers, we
end up with the histogram on the right. <A HREF="cal_fig7.gif">Figure
7</A>.)

<P>
<A HREF="cal_fig6.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig6.gif" ALT="[Figure 6]"></A>
<A HREF="cal_fig7.gif"><IMG SRC="tcal_fig7.gif" ALT="[Figure 7]"></A>
<P>

Obviously, this operation compacts the data, so that evenly spaced bins
collect different numbers of data occurences.  We end up with large holes
where no bins were hit and a ramping at the positive end of the data.  In
effect, this nearly reverses the appearance of the histogram, as we can
see by comparing the intermediate 1 histogram above with the intermediate
2 histogram below. (See <A HREF="cal_fig8.gif">Figure 8.</A>)

</B>
</CENTER>

<H2>Scaling Values To Byte Quantities</H2>

After the calibration coefficients have been applied, the data is next
scaled to byte quantities within the minimum and maximum s0 range.  By
default this range is Dmin = -25.5 to Dmax = 0.0 This final quantization
takes place as folows: 

<PRE>
	   /
	       | Dmax					if s0 > Dmax
     o  =      | Dmin					if s0 < Dmin
	       | (s0 - Dmin)/(Dmax-Dmin)*255+0.5	Otherwise
	   \

</CENTER>

<P>

In conclusion, if you've noticed that your SAR data histograms are
changing when you perform radiometric calibration using the ASF STEP tool
calibrate, don't panic.  In performing the non-linear operations of
squaring, applying the noise vs. range f unction, and taking the log10 of
the data, the histogram is supposed to be changed...

At present I am working in the Geophysical Institue for the <A
HREF="http://sparc1k.images.alaska.edu/">Alaska SAR Facility/STEP</A>
program. What do all these fancy initials and technical talk mean? Click
on the link and find out for yourself because I am tired of explaining it
all. 
<P>
My current duties include maintaining the <A
HREF="../../software.html">ASF/STEP tools</A> and creating new ones as
the need arises. I am also in the process of creating an educational tool
that incorporates SAR data. In addition, I maintain the WWW pages for part
of the ASF Science division. If you have questions about the tools or WWW
pages, please don't hesitate to email <A
HREF="mailto:mshindle@sparc1k.images.alaska.edu">me</A>. 
<P>
Fairbanks weather is constantly changing. So, mom is constantly calling and
wondering what the temperature is and what the weather outside is like. So,
this <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Weather/cgi-bin/tech_weather.pl?FAI">
link</A> is for her. This will let her and anyone else know the current
weather conditions of where I live.
<P>
At present I am experimenting with some 3D modeling of SAR, AVHRR, and USGS
data. I hope to incorporate this with interferometric results from SAR data
to create a more realistic model with more information. If you would like to
see some of the results, check out <a

<DT><H2>Introduction</H2> 
<DD> 
One of the software projects we have been working on at STEP is
interferometry. For those new to this term, interferometry is the study of
interference patterns caused by either two signals received at the same
source or one signal being recived at two sources. 
<P> 
How do we get interference patterns from one signal receiving at one
satellite? 
<P> 
The ERS-1, and now ERS-2, satellite orbits the Earth in a repeat pattern. 
This means that it will fly over the same patch of ground once every
orbital period. However, the satellite does not fly <EM>EXACTLY</EM> over
the same spot. With this separation and using the assumption that the
second signal is the same as the first, we have one signal being received
at two sources. Hence, an interference pattern can be generated.

When taken in the context of the histroy of science, interferometry using earth remote sensing satellites is brand new. However, there is plenty of information out that discusses interferometry, especially interferometry using ERS-1 SAR data. Check out our <A HREF="http://www.asf.alaska.edu/step/b_interferom.html">bibliography</A> for more information.
<P>
A step-by-step description of each tool and an example run of each program is also available. These programs are listed in the same order that they would be used when running an interferometry process.

ASF/STEP Software & Tools Release Information
</H1>
Below is a list of data sets for which ASF has created software tools.
Each set is linked to a table that state which tools are available and
their version numbers. Also in the tables is information on which
platforms are supported. If a table element is listed N/A, the
corresponding program is still in development and is unavail able for
release. If a table element is listed NR, then no release is scheduled of
that program on that platform. For example, their is no plan to release
the terrain correction software on the SunOS platform. Any questions about
release dates should be directed to <a href="users/rguritz/home.html">Rick

Ken's current research interests focus on monitoring and analysis of environmental hazards using remote sensing data. His ongoing studies include monitoring of volcanic eruptions and associated hazards, and development of an eruption cloud tracking model. Investigations include pollution in the Arctic, surficial geology, quaternary geology, hydrology, and coastal oceanography. Past projects include the eruption of Redoubt Volcano, the influence of river discharge on the distribution of sea ice, potential effects of global warming, and the Exxon Valdez oil spill. He was president, Arctic Division, Am. Assoc. for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), 1993, and was Chairman of the 3rd Circumpolar Symposium on Remote Sensing of Arctic Environments, 1994.

Hello!  I'm a graduate student in Geophysics at the 
<a href="http://zorba.uafadm.alaska.edu">University of Alaska Fairbanks</a>.  
In fact I'm located at the Geophysical Institute and am affiliated
with the Alaska SAR Facility (ASF) 
<a href="http://www.images.alaska.edu">STEP</a> 
program.  I'm <i>also</i>
<! note the use of `i' gives italics; `b' would give bold.>
<! If I want to make the link string in italics I just nest the conventions... >
affiliated with the Arctic Research Supercomputer Center 
(<a href="http://www.arsc.edu">ARSC</a>) 
as they are nice enough to let me use their CRAY.  
I hope to graduate in late 1997; whither then I can not say.  
<P>
My research focus is on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) as a tool for 
studying glaciers, specifically deriving glacier surface topography and 
velocity using spaceborne radar interferometry (SRI).  
This particular methodology was invented at JPL, with a great deal of
the credit due to Dick Goldstein.  
<P>
The image below is an example of an interferogram produced from two 
SAR images taken three days apart in 1994.  The colors on some of the 
rocks (dark areas, wide parallel color bands) indicate topography.  
The colors on the ice indicate mostly surface motion; if you count in 
from the edge of the glacier towards the center, each color cycle (e.g. 
from one band of red to the next) is an increase in speed of about 10 
meters per year.  Thus the center of the glacier is moving faster than 
the edges, and fastest of all through the narrow bottleneck.  Further 
off to the east (right) there is an ice divide where the direction 
of flow of the ice reverses from right-to-left to left-to-right.  
<P>
Warning:  Don't stare at this interferogram for too long!  You'll start 
seeing fringes when you close your eyes at night!

The ERS-1 system offered limited possibilities to perform interferometric
analyses within the ASF station mask. Software to support interferometric
analysis was developed, however, and applied to investigations of sea ice
deformation and the Bering Glacie r's surge. This image illustrates an
application of the interferometric technique; the image was used to
analyze the fast ice motion near Point Barrow (the Beaufort Sea's
coastline). The changes which occurred during the three-day interval
between ERS-1 d ata-takes indicate that there has been subsidence and
cracking of the fast-moving ice, likely related to winter tides and pack
ice motion. <!-- The glacier studies in particular offer interesting
information when combined with multi-temporal scenes of the
 ice motion. -->

<DD>
<P>
Before starting interferometry with the ASF/STEP tools, check to make sure that
your two images are short integer complex, 2bytes real data and 2 bytes
imaginary data.  The complex data product produced by ASF is in this format.
The data product produced using ASF/STEP's Alaska SAR Processor program is in float
complex (4 bytes real, 4 bytes imaginary) format.  At this time resolve will not
handle float complex data, and therefore, the data will need to be converted.
<P>
Once you have your two data images, you will need to make sure you have enough
disk space.  The entire interferometry process will use close to a gigabyte of
disk space <b>if you keep all intermediary products</b>.  You can get rid of
certain intermediary products while you process your interferogram, however I
would suggest that you do not delete everything.  You will reuse certain files,
and by keeping them you will significantly reduce your processing time.
<P>
Once you have enough disk space and selected your two images, you can begin
running the software.  For the purpose of this tutorial/example, I have two
images named <b>asc1</b> and <b>asc2</b>.  This data was processed at ASF before
the July 1996 upgrade.  Therefore the data files are <b>asc1.dat</b> and
<b>asc2.dat</b>.  There are also corresponding metadata files that have the same
basename but different extensions.  The extensions for this example are
<b>ldr</b> and <b>trl</b>.
<P>
<I>
Note: The ASF interferometry software also works on the ERS-1/2 Tandem mission
processed after the upgrade.  At STEP we refer to these two versions of ASF
products as PRE-RADARSAT and POST-RADARSAT.  The main difference between the two
data sets are an increased metadata header on the data file.  Also, the metadata
file have been combined.  There is only a leader file with POST-RADARSAT data.
If you have the newer data set, the data file has an extension of <b>D</b> and
the metadata file has the extension <b>L</b>.
</I>

Resolve calculates an intial offset between the two images from information located in the metadata. Using this inital estimate, <b>resolve</b> then cross-correlates the two images. By default, resolve starts its cross-correltion at the center of the image. However, if a better estimate can be obtained by cross-correlating at different location, the user can specify these new seed values on the command line.
<P>
Resolve creates two files: a baseline file and a control file. The baseline file is an initial estimate at the separation of the satellites between images 1 and 2. This estimate is produced off of information in the metadata. The format of the baseline file is:
<P>
<center><pre>
Perpendicular   Delta_Perp    Parallel     Delta_Para
</pre></center>
<P>
Each of these values are in meters. The baseline file created above, base.0, looks like:
<center><pre>
172.401230  4.276320  -52.428333  -2.442077
</pre></center>
The baseline file will be used when we run <a href="deramp.html">deramp</a> on the interferogram phase file. This initial estimate, while a good initial estimate, is not good enough for interferometry and will need to be revised.
<P>
The control file is another simple ASCII file that is used by <a href="ifmshift.html">ifmshift</a> and the <a href="subpixel.html">subpixel registartion</a> routines. The control file controls how these other programs should preform image registration. The control file has the following syntax:
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>xoff</b> - column offset. 
<li><b>yoff</b> - row offset.
<li><b>chip size</b> - size of each chip in sub-pixel registration
<li><b>oversample</b> - oversampling factor
<li><b>xMEP</b> - Allowed maximum error pixel in column direction
<li><b>yMEP</b> - Allowed maximum error pixel in row direction
</ol>
<P>
The first two numbers are the most important. These numbers determine how far an image must be shifted in order for the pixels to line up. Xoff and yoff relate to image1 and image2 by the following equations:
<pre>
image2 = image1 + xoff
image2 = image1 + yoff
</pre>
The control file, ctrl, created by the above example is
<P>
<pre>
-6
22
16
4
1.300000
1.300000
</pre>
<P>
Resolve sets the last 4 parameters automatically. If you wish to change them, you will need to do so using any text editor such as emacs or vi.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>

The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="ifmshift.html">ifmshift</a>. Subpixel registration could also be performed at this point, however I would suggest waiting until after you analyze the results from pixel registration.

Ifmshift
</H1>
<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Once the offsets have been calculated between image 1 and image 2, the images
need to be registered to within pixel accuracy.  Ifmshift performs this
registration by moving the second image to line up with the first image. 
Ifmshift will also convert the short int complex data to float complex data. The 
floating point complex data is the format that the rest of the interferometry 
programs require. It will also remove any metadata attached to the data file.
Also by default, ifmshift will split the complex data into its specific 
components: amplitude and phase. 
<P>
At STEP, when the data is split into its component parts, we will sometimes call 
that polar format as opposed to complex format. Ifmshift can produce complex 
format data, but the majority of our programs require polar format instead.
<P>
If ifmshift runs in default mode, you will have four output files upon 
completion. You will have float-valued amplitude and phase files corresponding 
to each of your input images. These output files can be interfered with the <a 
href="igram.html">igram</a> program.

<DT><H2>Example</H2></DT>
<DD>
For details on the command line syntax, please see the <a 
href="http://www.images.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/man-request.pl?asftool=ifmshift&amp;s
ection=1">man page</a>.
<P>
A sample run looks like the following:
<P><pre>
sparc1k [51]: ifmshift asc1 asc2 asc1 asc2 ctrl
  Wid = 2048  Len = 12800
  Col. header = 12 bytes
  Header rows = 1
  Xoff = -6
  Yoff = 22
Processing Line 12800
Total wall clock time = 362 seconds.
</pre><P>
The line <I>Processing Line...</I> changes as each set of lines is processed.

<DT><H2>Description</H2></DT>
<DD>
The first two parameters to ifmshift are the ASF data files. The source image, 
asc1.dat, goes first. (<I>Note: We define the source image as the image that was 
taken by the satellite first.</I>) The next two parameters are the output names 
of the converted and modified source and target images. In our example, asc1.dat 
creates two output files asc1.amp and asc1.phase. Asc1.amp and asc1.phase have 
the same data dimensions as asc1.dat (2048 cols x 12800 rows). Asc1.amp is the 
amplitude of asc1.dat with 4-byte float values per pixel. Asc1.phase is the 
phase of asc1.dat also with 4-byte float values per pixel. 
<P>
The same data conversion also occurs for asc2.dat. In addition, asc2.dat is 
shifted by 6 cols and 22 rows. Any rows or columns of invalid data on the target 
image are set to zero.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="igram.html">igram</a>. 
Unless you plan on re-registering the data, you can take the original data files 
offline. However, you will need the metadata file(s) of your source image later 
during processing. In this example, you will need to keep asc1.ldr and asc1.trl 
online.

Igram
</H1>
<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Igram is the program that actually interferes the two images. As is the case 
with most things, igram is the simplest of them all. Igram requires for input a 
source amp and phase image and a target amp and phase image. Igram will 
interfere and combine the two images into one output amp and phase image. On the 
command line, you specify the basename of the source and target image. Igram 
will append the necessary extensions. (<I>Note: Your source and target images 
must have the correct extensions. In this case, your amplitude image must have 
the extension .amp while your phase image must have the extension .phase.</I>)
<P>
The equations igram uses to interfere the two images are
<p>
<pre>
        output_amp = sqrt(source_amp * target_amp);    
        output_phase = source_phase - target_phase;
</pre>
<p>
The amplitude is square root of the product of the two input amplitudes. The 
phase is the difference of the two input phases. One of the reasons we use polar 
format is because interference is easier to calculate.

<DT><H2>Example</H2></DT>
<DD>
For details on the command line syntax, please see the <a 
href="http://www.images.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/man-request.pl?asftool=igram&amp;sect

<P>
A sample run looks like the following:
<P>
<pre>
sparc1k [51]: igram asc1 asc2 asc12
igram:
        read count = 132, total bytes read = 104857600
	starting igram
igram:  Ends successfully
Total wall clock time = 173 seconds.
</pre>
<P>
Note that the line <I>read count...</I> will update as each line is read.
<img src="asc12amp.jpg" alt="[Interferogram Amplitude Image]" Width=128 
Height=800 align=right></img>

<DT><H2>Description</H2></DT>
<DD>
We pass asc1.amp and asc1.phase as our source image and asc2.amp and asc2.phase 
as our target image. Igram interferes these images and creates two output files, 
asc12.amp and asc12.phase. These files have the same dimensions as the input 
files (2048 columns x 12800 rows) and the same data size, 4 byte float.
<P>
You can see by looking at the image on the right that the amplitude image looks 
stretched vertically. This stretching is caused by the fact that the SAR CCSD 
data does not have the same resolution horizontally as it does vertically. In 
fact the vertical resolution is about 20m while the horizontal resolution is 5m. 
(<I>These values are only approximate. For more information and specifics about 
ASF data, see the <a href="http://www.asf.alaska.edu/">ASF WWW site</a>.</I>) We 
will correct this problem using a technique called multilooking when we run the 
program <a href="ml.html">ml</a>. This image is displayed so that the user can 
cross-check their results with ours. To obtain the exact same image, you will 
need to follow these examples using our test data. Contact <a 
href="mailto:rguritz@images.alaska.edu">Rick Guritz</a> for more information 
about obtaining the test data.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="deramp.html">deramp</a>. 
Before multilooking, we need to correct for the flat-earth model. The <a 
href="deramp.html">deramp</a> program performs these corrections on the phase 
file (e.g. asc12.phase). The amplitude file can be put aside until we begin 
multilooking. At this time asc1.amp, asc2.amp, asc1.phase, and asc2.phase can be 
taken offline. You will not need to rerun the igram program unless you 
reregister the input data.

Deramp
</H1>

<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Deramp removes the phase signal generated by the curvature of the Earth.  At
ASF, we call this correcting for the flat Earth model.  Imagine hovering in a
helicopter and dropping a string to the ground.  The length of the string will
be <b>X</b>.  Now pretend a child on a bicycle picks up the end of the string
and starts to ride with it.  The further the child rides, the longer the string
becomes.  If we call the new length <b>Y</b>, then <b>Y &gt; X</b>.  This
increase in string length is equal to the increase in the path a SAR signal
travels as it scans an area.  Now, you must also factor the curvature of the
Earth.  The farther out the child or signal goes, the increase in effect caused
by the Earth curving away from the satellite.  deramp corrects for this effect.
<P>
In order to perform these calculations, deramp needs a baseline file.  You can
either use the baseline file created by <a href="resolve.html">resolve</a>,
create your own, or use published values (i.e.  ESA publishes baseline values
for the ERS-1 and ERS-2 satellites).
<P>
Deramp also needs to access the metadata file for the source image.  The source
image is usually the first image in the interferometric pair.  If you are unsure
which image is the source image, the image which was passed as the first
argument to <a href="resolve.html">resolve</a> is the source image.  (<I>Note:
The source image is usually the image acquired first.  You can check the
facility data record to find this information.</I>)
<P>
The phase file required by deramp is the phase file created by <a
href="igram.html">igram</a>.  If you have been following the examples, you have
all the necessary files.  You are ready to run deramp.
</DD>

Done with deramp

Total wall clock time = 86 seconds.
</PRE><P>
Note that the line <I>Done with line...</I> will update as each line is 
finished.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Description</H2></DT>
<DD>
Using the interferometric phase file, which was created by <a 
href="igram.html">igram</a> from the asc1 and asc2 phase files, deramp attempts 
to correct for the flat Earth model. Deramp reads the necessary baseline 
information from the file <b>base.0</b> which was created by <a 
href="resolve.html">resolve</a>.
<P>
The necessary information for calculating the curvature of the Earth comes from
the metadata of the source image, <b>asc1</b>.  You must use the metadata from
the source image because the the target image has been shifted to overlay on top
of the source image.  If you use the metadata for the target image, the
calculations for the Earth curvature will be misaligned with the interferogram.
<P>
The output phase, <b>asc12d.phase</b> should be used for the rest of the 
programs in these examples. The only time you need to revert back to the 
original interferometric phase file is when deramp is run again.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="ml.html">ml</a>. Ml will 
multilook our phase and amplitude file. It will also combine them to produce a 
colorized interferogram which uses the amplitude to determine brightness.

Ml or multilooking has two main functions. 
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Square the pixels. ASF SLC (Single Look Complex) images have a resolution of 
approximately of 20m by 4 meters. The most noticeable effect of this pixel 
resolution is the stretching of the image as seen in the example of the program 
<a href="igram.html">igram</a>. Multilooking will <I>square</I> the pixels to 
create a pixel resolution about 20 meters by 20 meters.</LI>
<P>
<LI>Perform a minor filter of the interferogram. As ml steps through the image 
squaring the pixels, ml averages the pixels in its step area which is by default 
1 column by 5 rows. We can increase the area from which ml averages its pixels 
by increasing the look line and look sample attributes. Increasing the look area 
does not change how ml steps through the image nor does it change the output 
image size. However, it does change the pixel resolution. (<I>Note: When 
processing, if you change the look area, make sure the dimensions are maintain 
the same ratio. by default the look area is 1 column by 5 rows. If you want to 
double the look area, you should increase the look area to 2 columns and 10 rows 
and not 10 columns and 2 rows.</I>)</LI>

<DD>
We pass asc12.amp as our amplitude file and asc12d.phase as our phase file. Ml 
transforms the float-valued amplitude file into the byte range 0 - 255. In order 
to do this, ml calculates the average value of the amplitude file and converts 
this value to 128. Ml then creates a ratio where
<P><PRE>

                   -----------      =      ----------
                     average                  128
</PRE><P>
<I>Pixel value</I> is the value of the current pixel and <I>byte value</I> is 
the corresponding value between 0 and 255.
<P>
This amplitude determines brightness whereas the phase determines color. <img 
src="wheel.gif" width=128 height=128 alt="[Color Wheel]" Align=right></img>The 
phase which has a value between 0 and 2 pi is divided into 6 colors. 0 radians 
starts on the right hand side and increases counter clockwise. See image to 
right.
<P>
In this example we have increased the number of look lines from 5 to 10 and the 
number of look samples from 1 to 2. From previous experience I know that the 
CCSD data is a tad noisy and I want to perform a filter in order to increase 
coherence. This will also decrease the number of singularities and increase 
integration when I perform unwrapping with <a href="escher.html">escher</a>.
<P>
I could have also increased the number of step lines and samples to 10 and 2 
respectively. However, I wanted to keep my pixel spacing at 20 meters by 20 
meters. Do not confuse pixel spacing and resolution. Resolution determines how 
far apart 2 objects on the ground have to be in order for the satellite to 
distinguish them as 2 discrete objects. Pixel spacing refers to the amount of 
ground each pixel covers. Whenever you filter an image, you decrease your 
resolution. However, filtering does not always destroy your pixel spacing. Also, 
pixel spacing cannot be greater than your resolution.
<P>
The two images above are the outputs from ml. If you are using the test data set 
and following the same naming convention, you will find them as ml12.img and 
ml12.amp. Ml also creates two more files ml12.ddr and ml12.phase. Ml12.phase is 
your phase file which you will need for unwrapping, and ml12.ddr is a data 
display record used with the <b>Xid</b> imaging program. The greyscale image was 
converted into a byte file, then into a PGM file using <b>rawtopgm</b>, and 
finally displayed with <b>xv</b>. While brightness and contrast may differ, you 
should get the same general image regardless of which imaging tool you use.
<P>
The colorized interferogram shows a lot of banding across the image. (<I>The 
resampled version here may be hard to see. Either download the full size gif 
version or look at your own image if you are using the test data set.</I>) These 
bands are the result of incorrect baseline parameters. We will need to refine 
our baseline parameters using a program called <a 
href="refine.html">refine_base</a>. (To view a correctly deramped interferogram, 
see the page <a href="iter.html">Iterations</a>. However, if you are new to 
interferometry, I would suggest you not skip ahead.) Once we correct our 
baseline and deramp again, our interferogram should show us some "pretty" phase 
bands. 
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
The next step in interferometry processing is <a href="escher.html">escher</a>. 
Escher will unwrap your phase file, ml12.phase, and get us ready for refining 
our baseline parameters. Escher is also run if you wish to determine an 
elevation from our interferogram. DEM generation from interferograms require the 
use of an unwrapped phase file.

Escher
</H1>

<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Escher, named after the Dutch artist M.C. Escher, unwraps a phase file using the 
Goldstein branch-cut method. To understand how the branch-cut method works, it 
is important to understand that all the phase values in an image are not 
absolute values. The phase values listed in all of the phase files up to this 
point have been modulo 2 pi. To understand this point, think of a spoke on a 
bicycle wheel. When you ride your bicycle, a spoke on your front spins around 
<b>y</b> times.  When you stop your bike, you can measure the angle of the spoke 
with respect to the center of the wheel. However, you cannot determine how many 
times the wheel went around unless you measure the distance traveled and the 
radius of the wheel. 
<P>
The same holds true for a satellite in space. When the signal returns to the 
satellite, the satellite can measure the current "angle" or more precisely the 
<em>phase</em> of the signal, but it cannot measure the total number of phase 
cycles (or complete turns of the bicycle wheel) that the signal has gone 
through. So, the satellite records the current phase of the signal at a 
particular pixel and continues on scanning the Earth.
<P>
Before you despair and think that these phase values are useless, there is one 
more property of the phase values in your data. The phase value have meaning 
relative to each other. If the phase changes from one pixel to the next, then 
the change must be caused by either a change in the land structure or a change 
in motion. (<I>Note: I am simplifying for the purpose of explanation. Please see 
any of the numerous articles of interferometry for a more thorough explanation. 
This explanation is for those new to interferometry.</I>)
<P>
If our image scene is over farmland or mountains, we can reasonably assume that 
the change in phase is due to elevation. If our scene is over a glacier or ice, 
the change can be both elevation and motion. In either case, we need to 
determine the phase cycle differences from one pixel to the next. Since none of 
the phase values are absolute values, we can choose one at random. After we 
choose our reference pixel, we can calculate the phase difference of every other 
pixel.
<P>
What happens when a phase jumps from 2 pi at one pixel to 0 at the next? Or from 
pi to -pi? When this occurs, we say that the phase has cycled and mark it. For 
example, if a string of pixels has phase values that increase in the following 
manner: 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, 0, pi/2. We can reason that the jump from 3pi/2 to 0 
is not a jump backwards, but a jump forwards to 2pi which is the same as 0. 
Hence, we increase that 0 by 2pi and all the followimg pixels. Therefore, our 
new sequence would look like: 0, pi/2, pi, 3pi/2, 2pi, 5pi/2, etc.
<P>
However, one drawback to the branch-cut method is if we cannot reason out that a 
jump should be from one level to the next. If this occurs, we create what is 
called a singularity. If a singularity is found, escher searches for another 
singularity. When it finds one, escher draws a line from one singularity to the 
next. It then sets a flag stating that integration (or unwrapping of the image) 
cannot occur across that line. The program will have to integrate around this 
cut. These cuts can result in a loss of data not only in the data lost to the 
cut, but also if cuts enclose an area of the file and prevent it from being 
integrated. Escher creates an unwrapping mask to show areas of cuts, 
integration, and zeroes (areas of non-integration).

<DD>
Escher begins by loading the wrapped phase file, ml12.phase, into memory. The 
outer edge is grounded because an edge pixel is missing a set of neighbors to 
compare to. A ground works like a singularity with one major exception, 
grounding points do not need to pair up. If two singularities, one positive and 
one negative, meet up, they are considered neutral. A third singularity cannot 
connect with a neutral pair of singularities since it would make the pair 
non-neutral. However a ground, since it connects to the edge, is always 
considered neutral regardless of the amount of singularities that connect with 
it.
<P>
Escher then proceeds to make a mask of the image and determine where 
singularities lie. It informs, in both pixels and percentages, the amount of 
data in the file that is of a certain type. Zeroes are non-integrated data; 
residues are singularities; cuts are the lines between singularities; and 
grounds are cuts that connect to the edge. The important values for us are 
zeroes, residues, and integrated. We want to maximize the number of integrated 
pixels.
<P>
After making the mask and determining residues, escher connects or inserts cuts 
between the residues. After cutting, escher then integrates the entire image 
based upon a reference value determined from the seed location. If the default 
seed location is trapped by cuts, you should enter new seed values.
<P>
After integration, the data is saved to file and a mask is created. As you can 
see in the above mask image, our data set integrated <b>extremely</b> well. 
<B>Do not always expect this kind of integration. Data in mountainous areas is 
notoriously difficult to integrate and can result in percentages around 50% or 
lower.</B>
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
After integrating our file, we need to refine our base line using the <a 
href="refine.html">refine_base</a> program. Refining our baseline decreases the 
effect of the Earth's curvature on our image and allows us a more accurate 
assessment of topography.

Refine_base
</H1>

<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Refine_base corrects a given baseline using tie-point locations and an unwrapped 
phase file. A tie-point file is an ASCII file containing elevations at specified 
pixel locations. As of now, this file is generated by hand using the multilooked 
amplitude image and an elevation map. A minimum of 4 tie points are required, 
but 8 to 15 tie points are recommended. An example tie point file follows.

<P>
Refine_base uses these elevations and the corresponding unwrapped phase values 
to create a matrix A and a vector B which are related by the equation Ax=b. 
Refine_base then solves the equation for x which are our new baseline values.   
<P>
As a final step, refine_base will compare the vector b with the result of A 
times x. If life and our baselines are perfect the difference between these 
vectors would be zero. However, since we are trying to fit a baseline which we 
calculate to be a best fit among our tie points, there will be a difference 
between them. As a general rule, you want to minimize the difference between the 
two vectors. (<I>Caveat: Experience will show that the best calculated baseline 
will not always have a minimum difference between the vector b and the vector 
calculated by A times x.</I>)

<DT><H2>Description</H2></DT>
<DD>
Refine_base uses the tie-point file hand.tie and the unwrapped phase file, 
uwp12.phase, to generate new baseline parameters. The new baseline is put in the 
file called base.1. For these examples, I need to specify the seed phase that 
was used for unwrapping. The refine_base program will not accept a tie-point 
with the same phase as the seed-phase. Since refine_base will default to a seed 
phase of 0.0, I need to specify the seed phase used by <a 
href="escher.html">escher</a>. If you let escher use the phase at the seed 
location, do not despair. Escher will display the value of the seed-phase in its 
output.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
Once a new baseline has been generated, you will need to perform another 
iteration of <a href="deramp.html">deramp</a>, <a 
href="ml.html">multilooking</a>, and <a href="escher.html">unwrapping</a>. If 
the new baseline is not correct, you will even need to refine the baseline 
again. Please see the page <a href="iter.html">Iterations</a> for more 
information.

<DL>
<DT><H2>Further Interferometry Processing</H2></DT>
<DD>
After refining the baseline, processing the interferogram is not yet complete. 
Once you have a new baseline, you must incorporate it back into the
interferogram created by <a href="igram.html">igram</a>. With an improved 
baseline, <a href="deramp.html">deramp</a> can correct for the flat Earth model 
with better precision. The example on the left is the test data after running 
<a href="iterfs.gif"><img src="iter.gif" width=256 height=320 align=left
alt="[Reiterated Inteferogram]"></img></a>
deramp and ml on our new baseline. You can see how the horizontal stripes were 
removed and the underlying interferogram revealed.
<P>
<a href="deramp.html">Deramp</a> performs one other function that has received 
little notice so far. When the satellite passes over an image area, the two 
satellite paths are not parallel. In fact the paths are either converging or 
diverging. <a href="deramp.html">Deramp</a> removes the phase effect caused by 
this separation.
<P>
Regardless of the reason for baseline refinement and the number of iterations 
you perform, you will eventually have an accurate baseline. By accurate I mean 
an effective baseline. An accurate baseline to do interferometry is not 
necessarily the same as the distance between satellites. Check the 
<a href="http://www.asf.alaska.edu/step/b_interferom.html">bibliography</a> for 
a more technical and thorough discussion. 
<P>
With an accurate baseline, your interferogram and unwrapped phase file can be 
used to generate digital elevation models, detect surface change, or measure 
motion of an object. As part of the ASF/STEP tool package, there is a program 
that will generate elevations using a baseline file, an unwrapped phase file, 
and a seed location. <A href="elev.html">Elev</a> generates an elevation for 
each integrated pixel.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Conclusion</H2></DT>
<DD>
This concludes the tutorial on the basics of interferometry processing. You can 
continue and generate an elevation mapping of the test data or your own data. If 
you wish to obtain the test data set, please contact <a 
href="mailto:rguritz@images.alaska.edu">Rick Guritz</a> who can help you with 
your request.

Elev (DEM generation)
</h1>

<DL>
<DT><H2>Introduction</H2></DT>
<DD>
Elev calculates an elevation from an unwrapped phase file. The elevation file
will have the same geolocation and geometry information as the unwrapped
phase file.
<P>
To use th elev program, you will also need a baseline file (see <a
href="resolve.html">resolve</a> or <a href="refine.html">refine_base</a>), the
CEOS metadata files, and a masking file that indicates how the phase was
unwrapped.  If you are using the ASF/STEP interferometry software, <a
href="escher.html"> escher</a> creates, along with the unwrapped phase, a
masking file.  If you do not have a masking file, you can create one.  (See <a
href="#create">below</a>.)  Elev only generates height values for those pixels
that have been unwrapped.  All other values are set to -1.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Example</H2></DT>
<DD>
For details on the command line syntax, please see the <a 
href="http://www.images.alaska.edu/cgi-bin/man-request.pl?asftool=elev&amp;section=1">man page</a>.

</DD>

<DT><A NAME="create"><H2>Creating a Mask File</H2></DT>
<DD>
A mask file is a two dimensional array of unsigned char bytes with the same
dimensions as the unwrapped phase file..  During the unwrapping process bits are
continually set and unset.  For each phase pixel, elev checks to see if the
corresponding mask pixel is set as an unwrapped pixel.  If you do not have a
mask file, you can just create one in which every pixel has the correct bit set.
<P>
The value you need to set each pixel is 0x10 hex (16 decimal).  If you do this,
every pixel will get a height value calculated including the non-integrated
points. Bad data will not be set to -1 for elev will believe all the data is
good data.
</DD>

<DT><H2>Next Step</H2></DT>
<DD>
As far as the ASF/STEP interferometry software is concerned, creating an
elevation file is the last step.  However, as a researcher and investigator, you
will probably want to continue processing your new elevation file.  For
instance, if you are using ASF data, all your images are in slant range.  They
need to be corrected to ground range and eventually placed in a map projection.
While the members of STEP are looking into this process, we do not have software
available yet to help you.  However, do not let this discourage you.
Interferometry can be exciting as well as infuriating.  And if you do design
software or have a suggestion, please let us know.  We would like to incorporate
whatever ideas or code you have into the interferometry software.

Yes, it was just a matter of time before we hit upon this controversial subject.  What experience have you had with sex on the net?  What are you into?  And what do you think should be done regarding censorship and offensive material?
This poll has it all - action, adventure, graphics, controversy - don't visit if you're a prude!

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Want a more active role in SURVEY.NET?</H2>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><I>WE CAN USE A FEW GOOD PEOPLE!</I></H3>

As a new service of SURVEY.NET, we're introducing an EDITORIAL section where we feature
monthly columns from selected writers.

<P>

Along with each Survey, there will be at least one featured Columnist who can comment on
the issues relating to the survey topic or current results.  In some cases, we may have 
several columnists associated with a particular Survey topic (for example, in the Political
Poll, we will probably have several columnists covering different political fields of thought).

<P>

We're looking for the best, brightest and responsible people who would like to write a
regular (at least monthly) column online.  At present, we cannot pay any money, but if
you do a good job, you will get a lot of recognition, and possibly other perks.  Columnists
will (ideally) be recognized as leaders in their field and have some writing or byline
experience.

<P>

Interested people should send <A HREF="mailto:wisdom@icorp.net">E-Mail</A> to us and
include the following information:
<UL>
<LI>Your name, location, and the Survey topic you're interested in having a byline under.
<LI>Some background information on yourself, including any references relevant to the
Survey topic or writing experience.
<LI>If possible, some examples of your writing.
<LI>A brief overview of how you might approach writing a column
</UL>

<P>
We're currently negotiating with some very prominent people in various fields who will
host columns online - in addition, we welcome other writers and "everyday people" in order
to have a well-rounded editorial section.  You will be in great company!

<P>

If you're selected as a columnist, you'll be expected to regularly update your column - it
probably won't involve any significant amount of time - perhaps once a month (or sooner if
you're inclined).  We will provide you with a unique ID and Password that will allow you
to automatically update your web page any time through your browser while online!  You won't
even have to know HTML or web page layout - simply fill out a basic form (or cut-and-paste
from a word processor) and hit "submit" and your new column is online instantly - and 
at any time you'll be able to go back and edit it.

<P>

Now is YOUR chance to add more than your two cents to SURVEY.NET.  If you think you 
have a unique angle on events or social issues, contact us and we'll consider you
as a columnist.  We will also actively promote your presence associated with our site
if you desire.

SURVEY.NET is a public service system on the Internet.  It's based around a powerful
survey engine developed by Mike Perry, who also administers the site.
There is NO direct commercial
influence; there is no PAC or political influence whatsoever.  There are a lot of sites
on the net which claim to be "unbiased", however SURVEY.NET endeavors to be the
standard by which all other sites are judged in the area of objectivity.
<P>
ICorp (Inter Commerce Corporation) is an Internet Service Provider and publishing company
located in New Orleans, LA which hosts SURVEY.NET.  This is essentially the only direct
affiliation SURVEY.NET has with any commercial entity, and the purpose for this is pretty
obvious - so I have a place to put my site on the Internet.  In return, it seems only fair
to do a little subtle PR for ICorp - and of course, if anyone wants to become a "sponsor",
I'll entertain offers, but in no way will the scope or content of SURVEY.NET be modified 
to appease any commercial or political entity.  This is the SURVEY.NET policy.
<P>
Rather than blabber on about something you might not be interested in, I've broken down
relevant information into several categories:
<P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/sv-faq.htm">The SURVEY.NET FAQ</A> - A wealth of commonly-asked
questions and answers - probably more than you want to know, but hopefully enlightening ans
possibly entertaining.

<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/license.htm">Info on Republishing Survey Data</A> - In general
I <I>strongly</I> encourage people to disseminate and publish the results generated online; all I
ask is that SURVEY.NET or myself receive credit.  More details can be found on this page.

<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/policy.htm">Official SURVEY.NET Policies</A> - This outlines
the few rules I have here regarding participation in the surveys, and what happens when the
rules are not followed.  

<P>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.survey.net/compat.htm">Compatibility Issues With Browsers, Etc.</A> - Since
SURVEY.NET was introduced, we've had occasional reports of problems related to particular browsers
and systems in submitting surveys.  Some services such as AOL have proprietary browser software
which isn't very good at handling standard web forms - look here for more specific information.

<BR>What do we need to do about it and why?</I></H2>
<H4>
<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_ISSUE -->
<LI>I feel our most important issue today is the well being and education of our children.
<LI>good parenting-all high school juniors should be taught how to be better parents, and how to teach morality to their children.
<LI>The Newt Gingrich controversy.  I don't think a man should be in power if he has admitted to violating the laws of the Ethics committee.
<LI>Reform of the political system with regard to less influence from those with more money to contribute.

<LI>Shutdown the IRS and go to consumption tax
<LI>Regain credibility in our government at all levels.
<LI>Overpopulation.  We cannot sustain our current rate of population
growth comfortably or for long.  Education and empowerment (the ways AND means) of effective birth control is a must.
<LI>i think every issue is important to somebody. every opinion 
counts!
<LI>There should be numerous job opportunities available to college graduates (like me with my English degree). 
<LI>The most important is drug abuse.  what we should do about it, 
to eliminate all of the drug dealers, not just the big guys but all
of them.  Not jail, but they should be put to death!!  Slowly and 
Painfully!!!
<LI>Predjudice towards black people DOES NOT EXIST anymore. The only predjudice that I see is the racial intolerance for white people. White people have become the evil of the world.
<LI>The absurd proliferation of political correctness.  Any thing remotely relating to PC should be abolished.
<LI>aids, find a cure, due to loss of may innocent people 
<LI>The tax system. We need a simpler, fairer, flatter tax rate to spur economic growth.
<LI>The breakdown of American societal mores.
<LI>Red Mercury.
Developements associated with this compound seem to have run
rife ever since Dr. Sleight synthesised it in 1968. Currently
it is used to amplify the power of Pure Fusion bombs.
The public should be informed of all aspects of the substance
in order to exert control over its trade and use.
<LI>EXECUTION:Those sentenced to die should have no more than one 
appeal. Upon the conclusion of this appeal, if the sentence is 
upheld, sentence should be carried out, PUBLICLY within a two
week period.
<LI>Ethics among politicians. If 70-80% of eligible citizens voted 
and there was a third party for more choice, the best person 
could be elected, instead of somebody with a questionable past 
or lack of consideration for those they represent.
<LI>Crime. When someone is sentanced to 5 Years theyn should serve 
5 Years. Not this 8 months crap.
<LI>I think the immigration is a major problem right now.  I don't mind them immigrating here, that is the freedom of this country but I feel that we shouldn't have to learn a new language just to accomodate them.
<LI>Homelessness is at an all time high, now.  We need to 
start helping our own country for once.
<LI>The most important issue in the United States today is the peoples'
relation with their government.  We seem to be moving further away from
the philosophy, "of the people, by the people, and for the people."
<LI>Justice system needs to be evaluated.  People given a sentence rarely serve enough time.  Deals in capital murder offenses should be eliminated.
<LI>A closer investigation of the Clintons
<LI>The government...Cut out the waste so we can take care of 
are own peolpe.
<LI>The Enviornment and Zero Population Growth.  If we continue to annihilate the planet we're on, none of the rest of this stuff will matter.  Think about it - long term.
<LI>Limit political contributions to $100 per candedate per U.S. citizen, only.
<LI>cool..!!??:-):-)  :-)  :-)  :-(  :-(  :-(



<LI>Governments must be drastically downsized and the principle of self-responsibility  must be reinfused in society.
<LI>Drugs and crime. Put and end to it all by applying more strict
punishment, like the death penelty for anyone selling and distributing
drugs.
<LI>Use technology to rid hunger and disease
<LI>Eliminating the entire socialist mixed-economy welfare state and moving to a capitalist society in which all people are allowed to freely trade the products of their minds without force or fraud.
<LI>The erosion of responsible liberty.  The Founding Fathers of this nation knew that freedom could not be maintained if people were unwilling to live an upright life.  We have lost much of our liberty because people have decided that they are the only arbiters of what is "right", regardless of the consequences to others.
<LI>The vast and expanding beurocracy (that is the US government) which claims to help all, but, in reality, only breeds dependency, lack of personal responsibility, and lack of the individual's initiative to take control of one's own life.
<LI>Illegal immigrants are taking our tax dollars illegally and we are not putting a stop to it.  We are responsible first to the citizens of this country, and we are lacking.
<LI>The need to return to an emphasis on healing of the American family.
<LI>We are sneding too much money over to foreign countries to feed and clothe their hungry people.  We have hungry and homeless people here in the USA that need to be taken care of first!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I don't think there is only one issue that is more important than any other, I think what is important is to open communication more so we can deal with all the issues.
<LI>Goverment waste-high taxes
<LI>The growing totalitarianism disguised as "Democracy" and/or the belief by individuals
that their attempts at improving the situation are useless.  This is a combined problem
such that each feeds on the other.  The more people that feel they "must" vote and act
a certain way to match a perceived majority accelerates the loss of freedoms and
effectiveness by everyone.
<LI>The crumbling of morals in the most important issue.  We need to 
strengthen the family and teach parents to teach responsibility
to their children.
<LI>I think that all drugs should be legalized, and mandated by the governments.  The Dutch have been doing this for how long and have been successful in their efforts.

<LI>i think our most important problem is themove the country is always making toward socialism. it's like we defeated it in russia. now we have it here. we should get the fedral government out of  everything. let local governments take care of themselves & make there own laws
<LI>world peace, if something donsent happen soon thare will not be
a world.
<LI>JOBS
<LI>High school juniors should be taught about being good parents. this is more important than how to wear a condom.
<LI>Prop.209 was voted in by majority on Nov 6th and its 
being attacked with the potentiality to be overturned!
Those of us who voted it in
<LI>Free education (not schooling) for all regardless of age.
<LI>US GOVT. national debt and deficit spending. Limit military and entitlement spending
until the national debt is reduced to zero.  Then deficit spending should be limited to
as needed (emergancy) only. (2/3 Congress majority/President veto)
<LI>The US is becoming a society of the "haves" and the "have not" and this is creating a stress on the working class who supports both ends. I really don't know what to do about it, but if something doesn't change I believe a form of revolution is in our near future.
<LI>Our nation needs to get back to the principles it was founded
upon.
<LI>The most important current issue in America is the corruption that involves the government and  our elected representatives.
<LI>The most important issue is our youth! They are the leaders 
of tomorrow! There is a major problem with drug/alcohol 
abuse in this country & parents shrug their shoulders &
blame it on society. They are the parents! They(& the 
schools)need to start taking more responsibility & pay
more attention to how they are raising, influencing & 
teaching these kids! Why do you think so many young people
are in gangs? They don't get any attention and/or love
and/or understanding!!!
<LI>Health Care Costs.

We should immediately move to a single-payer system of health care, with
regulated prices.  The increasing numbers of elderly will crush our
society otherwise.
<LI>Literacy. Our children are being passed through school when they can barely read.  We need to take part in our children's education.  After all, they are the future. 
<LI>Peace is the answer to many of the world's problems
<LI>By far the most important is the US trade relations with China.  If nothing is done, our standard of life will drop considerably over the next 10-15 years.
<LI>I think people without common sense ought to be studied to see
how in the world they are able to survive.
<LI>Decay of family.  Encourage young people to become more morally responsible adults.
<LI>Taxes!
<LI>The AIDS epidemic. 
<LI>Crime.
<LI>Robberies:there should be security systems
<LI>Ending world hunger.
<LI>We need to create more opportunities -- educational, career, habitats -- for Americans
<LI>Sexual web pages should be free. It's up to the parents to regulate there childerns computer activity.
<LI>welfare abuse
<LI>We are reducing standards of education and at the same time removing the stigma of poor moral and intelectual performance. ALL aplicable laws should promote acheivment and penalize failure and complaciency. No strength or power can come without earlier expending strength and power.
<LI>I think that the answer to alot of the problems in this society 
is religion.  Christian religion has a way of helping people work
out their problems and be happy.

<LI>moral relativism which is dragging this country into the abyss.
if gov't officials were able to take a moral stand on what is morally right and wrong, 
wouldn't have the drug, teen-pregnancies, ebonics, etc. problems 
that are evitdent today.  All that gov't needs to do is embrace
the notion that religion is good for humanity, whether it be
Judiasm, Christianty, Islam, or otherwise.  They all teach good moral
values.  Personally, ethical monotheism is the best option!
<LI>Distribution of wealth and resources.  Share the wealth and the resources with those who do not have them.
<LI>Make ENGLISH the official language, i.e, no Spanish on voting, no Ebonics, etc.)
<LI>most important issue:  equal treatment for all, in all ways.  this must include marriage.
<LI>I believe that the most important issues will be educating our children to be economically independent knowledge workers.
<LI>AIDS research - more money for same.
<LI>The Lack of Respect that people have for me
<LI>Affirmitive Action. We need to get rid of it before it tears the social fabric apart.
<LI>Overpopulation of the earth.  Birth control, birth control 
birth control...educate and make it easy to get!  If we don't 
take care of our population problem, mother nature will, and it 
will be UGLY.
<LI>THE BURNING OF FOSSIL FUELS/MOVE AWAY FROM THEM TO CLEANER SOYRCES OF ENERGY
<LI>The notion of ethnocentrism and cultural imperialiam - each culture should be celebrated and learnt about in order to promote greater understanding and a united yet diverse society.
<LI>the most important issue is the killing of innocent lives, including those not born, the elderly, those w/ different religous views.
<LI>Peace in the Middle East must precede Peace on Earth
<LI>We need to get crime under control in this country. We can send
men to the moon, but we can't control the criminals. I really
don't understand this. We are supposed to be the greatest and
most powerful country on earth, but we let the hoodlums and
thugs control our lives. We need to completely change our legal
system for starters. There was a time a few years ago when
people didn't even have to lock their doors or cars!!!!!
<LI>Education has to be dealt with now, we, the people in high school and college, will be inheriting this nation and the world and we must be properly educated in order to keep up with the rest of the world.  The education programs in the United States are so far behind other countries that it is not even funny.  If we as a country can't get it together then I fear we will see an end to United States reign as the the "main superpower" in today's and tomorrows world.
<LI>The threat of china.  Beef of pacific defense and make the chineese back down.
<LI>I believe that we sould impose legal bans of all abortion, expept
to save the life of the woman.  Doing so would reverse our trend of 
of Social Darwinism on all fronts.
<LI>We need to Re-Learn Responsibility and teach it to our children.
We need to become a better society by learning to be a society 
that has good moral values.

<LI>Why is President Clinton the only US President in history to need a legal defence fund? 
<LI>We should start to exterminate any form of religion.
We should start thinking about population growth (we should decrease it)

<LI>Overpopulation.   Education is the key to solving
this and all problems in our global village.
<LI>I think that the most important issue time being that 
has always existed is violence.Can't we just get along.
<LI>Abortion- It must be abolished because it is the murder of innocent human beings, healthy or not.
<LI>The environment. We need to expand, cultivate, and prohibit human activity in wild lands.
<LI>Erosion of our soceity's civility and morality.
This is like etiquite, it needs to be taught by parents, 
in schools, on TV and from our government. 
We must tolerate each other to continue to exist on this planet.
<LI>The debt and employment are equally the main problems

<LI>Libertarians should rule the World.
<LI>Drugs and greed will bring us down.
<LI>I BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF WE 
WITHDRAW ALL MILITARY AND MONETARY PARTICIPATION FROM 
ALL OTHER COUNTRYS.  WE SHOULD FOCUS ON HELPING 
OURSELVES.
<LI>Affirmative action is out of control.  It is so obvious that it is reverse discrimination!  We have to get rid of it and trust people to hire people based on merit, not color.
<LI>We need to stop the "war on drug" - we have lost this war and are 
making criminals our of too many Americans - Stop putting productive
American people in jail - thus limiting their future.
<LI>I think that world peace is the most important issues.
Until all nations are united many of our problems will not be conquerable.
<LI>Give more protection to endangered species.
<LI>The break down of the family unit and the idea that people are not responsible for their own actions.  IE. The public or a piece thereof making excuses for certain behaviors be they criminal or otherwise because 'they were abused as a child' or 'they came from a poor family' etc.  Not to say we don't need to address poverty etc but, it can't be an excuse for not living by the laws of society.  We need to find a way to strengthen families and impress upon people that they are responsible for themselves.
 You can't legislate morality it has to come for the person's upbringing and the government can't provide that.  Sorry I got a bit carried away and did a 'little' more than 2 sentences...  
<LI>Our current 'cultural diversity' policies are deadly.  Bosnia is the diversity end-game we're heading towards.
<LI>I feel we need to Get the Debt taken care of... NO MATTER what the 
consequenses are: either We starve a little now or OUR children will strave
their whole life.
<LI>Loss of the principles of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution. Repeal the 16th amendment, abolish the IRS and the Federal Reserve Board and return the nation to the gold standard.
<LI>Serious crime (i.e. murders) in the U.S. and around the world. Not sure what we need to do, but innocent people, children are murdered for no reason, caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Some people are just "sick".
<LI>The decay of values. People get away with too much. When there is a law on the books it should be enforced.
<LI>CONTRACTURAL AGREEMENTS:  The heterosexual community has historically proven that such "marriage" contracts -- the right: to sleep together; pollute the school system with kids; avoid responsibility -- is there recognized DOMAIN (generally).  The homosexual community seeks contractural "recognition" of their level of RESPONSIBILITY (do not call it a MARRIAGE, please.)  The advent of "test tube babies" effectively forces -- the concept of MARRIAGE, to be archaic.  There WILL ALWAYS be differences in the
HUMAN CONDITION to establish:  the pursuit of happiness.  (Yes, I am homosexual.  Had a partner for 30+ years.  Remain HIV-negative and DO NOT subscribe to the so called MAIN STREAM defination of "gay". There's NOT enough room here to elaborate.  You'd be pleased to be my neighbor; I yours -- probably :)
<LI>The spending level of the federal government. They need to start 
living within thier means without taxing us into the poorhouse.
<LI>We must vastly reduce entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare.
<LI>Bob Dole Rules!  Clinton willl be inpeached!
<LI>ETHICS IN POLITICS.  WE NEED TO START WITH THE WHITE HOUSE ON DOWN AND CLEAN HOUSE OF ALL THE SCREWBALLS WE CURRENTLY HAVE RUNNING THIS COUNTRY.
<LI>The war on drugs and the drastic erosion of civil liberties in America
as the United States becomes the leading jailing nation in the world. 
<LI>Federal debt, federal regulation, and the size of the federal
government.  Solution; abolish the IRS.
<LI>To reduce big government. Taxation has become the means to support
the promises made by politicians, not to run an effective government.
<LI>Welfare for able-bodied humans should be eliminated! Education should be mandatory -- advancement and graduation must be based on competency rather than age. If you can't read, write and speak proper English, and if you can't do math or locate the US on the globe, you FLUNK! (If you're 30 years old and still in high school, too damn bad!)
<LI>Accessible and affordable health care for everyone and more emphasis on elementary and secondary education
<LI>I think making a college education affordable to all is very important...education, in my opinion, is the key to a better society and world.

<LI>clinton-throw him out!
<LI>The government is too intrusive and wastes far too much of our money.  Taxes should be lowered and the IRS abolished.  Steve Forbes was right;
<LI>Social Security - come up with an entirely new plan and start adding to the fund today so that when it runs out maybe people under 30 today will have something. I would pay extra now to have something when I retire. I am 25/Male.
<LI>In 2012 Social Security expenditures will exceed revenues.  The system is in drastic need of reform.  Privitzation is the only logical answer.
<LI>Crime, especially murder.  We need to teach people that killing is not right.  We need for people to unite together to fight the war against crime.
<LI>Many issues contain the element of acceptance - accepting those who are different from us, whether they are of a different race, religion or sexual orientation.  Many, many problems could begin to be solved if people accepted others and cared about the problems that they face, rather than only worrying about one's own self & immediate family.
<LI>Drugs -- too many kids see it as glamorous because the Say No campaign of the 1980s lied. It really is glamorous -- until you're hooked.
<LI>dsdsdsdfsdf
<LI>Quality and Cost of Education
<LI>We need kids to learn the basicin school at early age. 
Reading,writing,and math
<LI>prevention, intervention, and education
<LI>Diseases such as Aids and Cancer and societal problems such as gangs and drugs and violence.
<LI>Political shift to the right.  It needs to be corrected so that "Liberal" is again elevated to be a thing to be looked up at not looked down upon.
<LI>Violence.  I'm not sure what to do to change it, but it seems to be getting worse.  

<LI>education
<LI>Too damn much government at all levels. We need to somehow
develop enough respect for each other to allow others to make
their own mistakes and enjoy their own successes.
<LI>The fundamental problem is the continual political exploitation of race and ethnicity, all over the world, which has led to any number of wars, international and civil.
Another basic problem is that in the last ten to twenty years, the gap between rich and poor (people and countries) has increased within and between nations; and no one is stopping the inevitable conflict.
<LI>The aging of America
<LI>Gun control. We must stop these comunist bastards from taking
away our second amendment rights.
<LI>the most important issue is integrity in public office
there should be zero-tolerance for crooked politians
<LI>National debt.  If we do not do something to reduce the national debt, I believe that we will see a global economic collapse far worse than any depression that the United States has ever seen.  We are borrowing from our future with every second that passes and therefore inhibiting the future of our young people.
<LI>Education is the most important issue.  The children are our future.  They need to be informed of what our society is all about.

<LI>Health care and the environment
<LI>We need to halt the slide into total immorality that our society is on. How?  By returning to the fundamental moral and religious values our country was founded on instead of trying to rewrite history to omit that fact.  Why?  Let me quote George Washington in his 1789 Inaugural Address: "The propitious smiles of Heaven can never be expected on a nation that disregards the eternal rules of order and right which Heaven itself has ordained."
<LI>I like to suck massive johnson!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its good!!!!!!
<LI>The guy outside my window with a chainsaw...
<LI>ssssssssssssssssssssssspppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppoooooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
<LI>I don't want the fish poisoned.
<LI>responsibility -- -- especially govt.  
<LI>The most important issue is education.  The masses of American children need a better education than they are getting in todays schools.  Even if it means cyber-schools. Americans can not compete in a global market ecomony without...stricter, better and more efficient schools.
<LI>same sex marriage and gay rights...give equal rights under the law to all
<LI>Probably the most important problem in our country is health care costs and a common sense, but viable solution for some form of universal coverage for Americans. 
<LI>The war on drugs, although established with the best of intensions, erodes our civil liberties by expansion of police powers.  I believe the money wasted on jails and law enforcement resulting from the war on drugs would ultimately benefit society the most if spent on schools and education instead.
<LI>The most important issue facing individuals is the lack of personal responsibility- we must beginn taking responsibility for our actions.  The most important issue facing the world is the need for sustainable development.
<LI>Americans should become involved in governing themselves. If you don't vote you don't have a right to bitch when something agree with your principles!
<LI>analysis of current policies for hinderance to the growth of GDP. The world is catching up; if we can use our capital to finance their growth, we shall prosper in the end!!
<LI>The politics of equality. While I greatly respect the Islamic and Christian faiths, I
fear that they spread a consistent attitude toward disowing over half of the population. 
Women are the majority, not an afterthought.
<LI>I think education and prevention are the key to most of our social issues.  If people were more open about issues and talked with each other and our children about them we could abolish many problems.  We need to solve the economic problems we face in the US before we can solve many of our social ills.
<LI>Bring respect back to the presidency, by impeaching the current clown.
<LI>moral decay
<LI>homosexuallity--- I firmly believe a couple should be able to marry on another,regardless of sexual preference.
<LI>The most important issue facing us today is poverty and the decline in family values. These two issues are very closley related and affect every part of our lives, from drug abuse to child abuse to homelessness and crime. Poverty causes hopelessness which leads to many other problems.
<LI>The AIDS crisis. Thousands of people are dieing daily and we need to find a cure.
<LI>The most important issue today is cleanup officials in Washington. We need to get
the old ones out who has been robbering us for years. The rich gets richer and the 
poor gets poorer. "Vote"..!!
<LI>We must stop imprisoning people for victimless crimes. Drug addiction is not a crime. LEGALIZE DRUGS.
<LI>The moral decay that has taken over. I feel that if preachers were
preaching the Gospel as the Bible teaches, this would not be an issue.
<LI>Less constriction of individual rights/privacy.  (Less "big
brother")
<LI>Nuclear proliferation. We need to stabilize the former Soviet Union.
<LI>Proactive reduction of American people to 
an undereducated, dependent group of stupid sheep.  
<LI>The government is too big, the national debt is too big, the U.S.
Constitution is not followed, the federal courts have gone nuts.
<LI>Immigrants should not be allowed to come into the United States.
They are taking away valuable jobs that us Americans need to survive.
They can afford to take jobs at a lower payscale than Americans
because they can live in public houseing programs, and use food stamps.
They deplete the taxes of programs that the American workers paid 
the tax to support in the first place.  
I am an honest hardworking American, my skin is white, I am not
elgible for public housing breaks, food stamps, or educational
grants.  To survive both my Wife and I work a full time job. 
I am attending school in hopes that I can someday get a position
that pays a wage high enough so we may purchase a house, my Wife
will be able to stay at home and raise our children as a traditionl
nuclear family.  I also wanted to add, many of the immigrants at 
my school have there classes paid for in full by the United States
Government.  I have to take out loans to pay for my classes.  Also
I have an Associates Degree, and am unable to find a position that
pays a wage to support a family, or even myself.
<LI>We, as a country, need to guard OUR coasts and bother only the countries that pose a threat to our country.

<LI>Developping contries
<LI>Public apathy has allowed the U.S. government to become an oligarchy.  We need more citizen involvement to regain control of our own government. 
<LI>It's important to support the President, and not be distracted by 
accusations. The pres should lead, not be on a witness stand.
<LI>Using the talents of everyone - eliminating discrimination based on race, sex, religion.  Encourage inclusion as government priority and social priority.  Make discrimination morally, socially, and politically unacceptable
<LI>Total disarmament of US army. Spend the money on those who need it.
<LI>Now the election is over I'm glad Bob Dole won
<LI>Government (over)involvement is a problem. They want to "help" us out in many 
ways, but in doing this, it also takes away our rights a little 
each time. We are moving to a socialist nation.
<LI>What America needs is a good 5 cent blow-job.
<LI>I THINK THE CONTINUED PERSECUTION OF OJ SIMPSON IS THE MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUE FACING AMERICA.  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!
<LI>Get rid of Clinton. I wanted Bob Dole to win!

<LI>Downsizing government and reducing government regulations.  Returning power to the states and the individual.
<LI>Impeach the President and Vice President
<LI>The right of individuals to choose, their life partners, reproductive decisions, health and aging issues.
<LI>National morals in britain need to be addressed. Too many people just dont care about anything.

<LI>The balanced budget, higher minimum wage, tax cut for middle class and tax the rich more
<LI>I think the world is moving to fast.  People are becoming more and more introverted it seems.

<LI>Raising the educational standards in the US.  We are not as proficient 
as other industrial countries and we do not equal opportunity to a
good education.
<LI>I feel that we should provide humanitarian and military aid if we are not in danger of losing many lives.

<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>It's a disgrace to the justice system
<LI>People forget a man is on trial sometimes
<LI>The trial is idiotic, he should be in jail allready.
<LI>The whole circus is disgusting and the guilty creep might even get off!
<LI>The Limo Driver & dog walker are key witnesses
<LI>Cochran is an imbarrassment to the HUMAN race!
<LI>Cochrane has set race relations back 75 years in this country.
<LI>I'm glad it's almost hopefully, hopefully there won't be a second trial.
<LI>if oj is guilty, I hope LA has fire insurance
<LI>Media should have been kept on a leash....
<LI>The conduct of this trial removes any dought about the integrity of lawyers.
<LI>Great job Judge! Die O.J. Die! We love you Kato!!!
<LI>American Blacks should be ashamed of the race card being used to get a murderer off
<LI>If O.J. didn't do it, who did? He must've done it.
<LI>Ito let this trial get away from him - too lenghthy
<LI>According to the evidence presented, I wouldn't find OJ guilty, but then again I don't know whether to believe he is innocent.  This trial was definitely not a fair one for him.
<LI>trial of the century--my ass.  The murder of 6 million is more horrific than the murder of 2.  The Nuremburg War Crimes Trials is the trial of the century.
<LI>GUILTY AS SIN, HE'LL WALK IGIN
<LI>What a circus!
<LI>OJ is a murderer.  I hope the justice will be done somehow, either convicted or acquitted.
<LI>He's definitely guilty. Race nothing to do with it.
<LI>This is a MURDER TRIAL..NOT BLACK RACISUM!!!!!!
<LI>OJ is quilty.  JC is an insult to people's intelligence.
<LI>one thing to say, DNA cannot lie
<LI>Make changes to the jury system.
<LI>The DA should have waited until a more thorugh investigation had been conducted before arresting anyone.
<LI>I THINK THE TRIAL WAS A LOT OF FUN.  I THINK O.J. IS GUILTY BUT THE FACT'S ARE ON THE DEFENCE'S SIDE.
<LI>This garbage shouldn't be on TV
<LI>The innocent shall die, the guilty shall live.
<LI>very educational, prosection proved their case. 
<LI>Crochrane is a Bible thumping, Bullshitting, Bastard.
<LI>Johnny Cochran is a racist.
<LI>OJ is the Killer...and Johny C. is 2 million richer!
<LI>So money can buy your way out of anything...that's the real crime.
<LI>money and fame should NOT be a factor in the trial.
<LI>It's the best entertainment that money can buy.
<LI>Johnny Cochran made this a racist issue from the very beginning.
<LI>Glad it is nearing the end.  Hope we don't have to do it again!
<LI>Johnny Cochran made this a racist issue from the very beginning.
<LI>It is the biggest circus I have ever seen.  The definition of capital punishment...if you have the capital you don't do the punishment!
<LI>Nordberg!  What have you done?  (Get it? Naked Gun.)
<LI>Fiasco
<LI>Christopher Darden was brilliant, thank you Marcia. 
<LI>The trial is a sad affair for America
<LI>I don't want him to be guility but,,,,,
<LI>Too long a trial
<LI>RON GOLDMAN'S DAD'S THE MOST HONEST ONE THERE!!!!
<LI>on question 16 most all that are on that list as answere are gaining no way to tell without records. thanks
<LI>What a travesty...
<LI>Hes innocent!!!!
<LI>OJ has been treated more fair than he should have
<LI>Using the race issue is a disgrace
<LI>If OJ gets off, our justice system should be abolished.
<LI>OJ & Mister Johnny should spend the next 50 years sharing a cozy jail cell. Would OJ make Johnny his punk? Or would it be the other way around? Hmmm...
<LI>Get ready for race riots in LA
<LI>Best entertainment since Matlock
<LI>grotesque picture,reputed mobsters testify, FBI Agents take 5th is Congress
<LI>grotesque picture,reputed mobsters, FBI Agents take 5th 
<LI>Most TV commentators are either current or ex defense lawyers & as such are biased towards the defense.
<LI>It ia a very big and interesting show!
<LI>disgraceful tactics by defense
<LI>These final comments of Marcia's are not convincing enough to get a conviction, very unprofessional
<LI>For the families of the victims, justice must be served by finding O.J guilty of two counts of first degree murder and lifge in prison without a possibility of paroll.
<LI>travesty
<LI>Sleazy diversion from other news
<LI>It's too bad it's about 'whitey keeping the black man down' instead of about two murders.  Racism is disgusting and outdated but not the bulk of the evidence or case.
<LI>It's a shame, we are in the year of 1995 and "race" still divides this country to the point were people focus on the color of a person's skin instead of the evidents which should lead to an obvious conclusion......O.J. is as guilty as sin.  One day he will have to stand before a holy God (without his lawyers) and answer for the terrible crime he committed.
<LI>This thing is a total circus!
<LI>OJ is GUILTY- and a terrible actor
<LI>He may be dumb but he's no killer!! Maybe they were there for Goldman and Nicole was the bystander
<LI>What the Hell is this trial Shit?!
<LI>The issue of racism is a bunch of bull-sh*t.  This is a trial of murder.  The defence is whining just to find any lame-brain, farfetched idea so they are the winners.
<LI>This is one big game of leaching lawyers seing who can make the "audience" laugh the loudest.
<LI>Don't let Ito get away he's the one who did it!!!!
<LI>Duuuuuuude I think he should quit!!!!
<LI>OJ is fucking guilty....convict the bastard!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>IN EVERY ASPECT, IT'S A JOKE!!!
<LI>Defense knows OJ's guilty, that's why they shifted focus on Furhman.
<LI>It is an exageration of an inept judicial system!
<LI>The case is a mess.  Can't see the forest for the trees.
<LI>Ba Ba Bouie done pulled the switch... smell that burning afro hair.
<LI>harriet thinks he is innocent
<LI>I is the largest crock of crap ever televised
<LI>I'll be glad when it's over
<LI>overheard a juror say... " Mr.Johnny (ooooh he a fine man) I would like to ax you someting... How bouts meetin me for some orange belly wash????
<LI>fuck this trial
<LI>Guilty, but not proven in court
<LI>The #1 rule in law school - if the law is on your side argue the law - if the facts are on your side argue the facts - if neither is on your side muddy the water - does this remind anyone of JC?
<LI>I AM EMBARRASSED TO BE AN AFRICAN AMERICAN TODAY, JOHNNY COCHRAN HAS SET RACE RELATIONS BACK 30 YEARS. AFRICAN AMERICANS CANNOT BE JUDGED BY THE PETTY WEEPING OF A FEW WHO CRY RACE AT EVERY CORNER. POLLS HAVE SHOWN THAT MOST AFRICAN AMERICANS HAVE NO RACIAL BITTERNESS.
<LI>Cochran is the biggest sleaze on the planet
<LI>they should just stick to the facts, o.j. did it!!
<LI>I will be glad when it is all over with and everybody SHUTS UP about OJ.
<LI>This trial is a farce. If I were on trial against the same evidence, I'd be hung by now...
<LI>Using Race as an excuse for everything
<LI>I am saddened that race has to rear its ugly head, once more, in the American justice system. Hopefully, someday we will be past all of that.
<LI>racist cops do matter no matter what the da's say.
<LI>I wouldn't put it pass Furhman to plant evidence
<LI>I HATE THIS FUCKING FRED GOLDMAN ASSHOLE.  WHAT A WHINING, WIMPERING LITTLE JEW BASTARD HE IS. SO HIS KID GOT KILLED, BIG DEAL.  THAT HAPPENS TO HUNDREDS OF KIDS IN THE 'HOOD EVERY DAY.  BUT THEY CAN'T GET ON TV.  THE JEW BASTARDS THAT RUN THE MEDIA JUST LOVE TO LET ANOTHER JEW BASTARD HAVE SOME AIRTIME TO PISS AND MOAN. NO WONDER JOHNNI COCHRANE NEEDS MINISTER FARRAKHANS PROTECTORS.  THE JEW BASTARDS PROBABLY HAVE A CONTRACT OUT ON HIM.
<LI>If this is THE example of justice in our courtrooms, we as a country must reevaluate and demand change in our justice system.
<LI>Get Mr. Goldman out of here!!!
<LI> kill The Fucker
<LI>

<LI>"Let's send a message" to all sleazy defense lawyers--YOU GUYS ARE ALL ACCESSORIES TO MURDER! AND GETTING PAID FOR IT, AT THAT!
<LI>Mr. Johnny is a bad person
<LI>They suck, Ito is a complete loser!  I hate them all...
<LI>If acquitted he gets away with murder!!!!
<LI>lying cops, unreliable evidence, closed empty minds
<LI>JOHNNY COCKREN  IS A BIGOT
<LI>SAME OLD DEFENSE.....GOT NO ALIBI, BLAME THE COPS!!
<LI>Christopher Darden summed it up when he said it was a big circus
<LI>survey never mentions victims; kinda like the trial
<LI>OJ's is both the Trial of the 20th Century and the Biggest Crash in History of One Infamous Person/Household Word...to Misfortune and Shame, Next to "None" or i.e. "Mark Fuhrman"
<LI>Johnnie C should rot in hell!
<LI>If upset by the results of the verdict who would be more likely to create a civil disturbance, the black community or anyone else?
<LI>As a federal judge once stated, "you cannot use the constitution as a defense"
<LI>it has been informative,and finally someone is telling the truth about the L.A.P.D.and took them on more people should do that most of them are poor excuse for law enforcement officers i've worked with them I KNOW what they do. I was one of them.
<LI>sucks
<LI>Racism is rampid and bi-partizen between races in this country! WATCH OUT!!    
<LI>He's guilty but sadly, he's gonna go free.
<LI>i am wearing shorts
<LI>This is a travesty.
<LI>To Long, Not Focused, Judge Ito should have taken tighter control.
<LI>Furman planted evidence
<LI>travesty of justice
<LI>The defense team never proved that Vanader or Furman actually had the opportunity to plant the evidence.  In addition, the defense can play the race card and distract the jury, but they cannot refute the existence of the blood trail from Bundy to Rockingham.  It many be reasonable to have Nicole's blood in his Bronco, and Rockingham home, but how do you explain the presents of Ronald Goldman's blood in the bronco.  I didn't think Ronald Goldman ever had the opportunity to ride in the Bronco.  In additi
n, How would the police be able to mix both Nicole's and Ronald's blood and then go to Rockingham and deposit it everywhere.  Any reasonable person must conclude that the LAPD would not have allowed this type of misconduct.  
<LI>It's not the Furhman trial!!!!!!
<LI>Reasonable Doubt shown - doesn't mean innocent
<LI>Johnnie Cochrane's summation----BRILLIANT
<LI>Cochrane is nothing but a lier and a thef
<LI>I don't think he stalked her I know from my own experinces.He had other interest going on. you don't stop and start stalking it is always there. I think their relationship was violent because of the both of them..that's just they way they were towards each other.
<LI>I think it's making a fool of the American judicial system
<LI>Someday, OJ is going to kill me, and get away with it because he is OJ.  - Nicole's diary
<LI>Went on way too long.  I think there is reasonable doubt and there will be a hung-jury.
<LI>Based on this case, our judicial system should be over-hauled 
<LI>It's the American "Justice" system at its worst!
<LI>What a joke.  The analysts on the television are giving many uneducated people a distorted view of what is going on.
<LI>If he gets off I sure don't want to live next-door to him!
<LI>Television ruined the trial/ trial process
<LI>I think JOHNNY COCHRAN did a fantastic job.
<LI>It is sad to think that this man may be acquitted and he is a guilty as anyone ever has been.  The defense did a poor job of giving a definite alibi.  It is because he has none.  If OJ was not guilty there would be at least some evidence that SOMEONE ELSE killed these people.
<LI>It's a travesty on Justice.  Media should not be allowed to report AT ALL until the verdict was given! (As is the case in many European countries)
<LI>After listening to Cochren, I want to shower!
<LI>it is auorizing the weakness and slopiness of the prosecution
<LI>ENOUGH! Naw, TOO MUCH ALREADY!!!
<LI>get it over with
<LI>if it don't fit you must aquit
<LI>It is a travesty that OJ is not really being judged by his peers (ie those among the same socio-economic strata in Brentwood) instead he is judged by 9 members of his race, that is way race will and is playing such a part in this trail. It is not about ra
<LI>I wished that nothing else was ever said about OJ and company.
<LI>It doesn't add up.
<LI>COCKRANES A LIEING USED CAR SALESMAN, BARRY SCHEF IS WHAT GIVES LAWYERS A BAD NAME, SIMPSONS A MARKED MAN, CONVICTED OR NOT, HE WON'T SEE THE YEAR 2000 !
<LI>MONEY BUYS JUSTICE
<LI>Johnny Cochrane's best closing agruments ever I've seen w/closed captioned
<LI>BARRY SCHECK IS THE BEST LAWYER IN THE COURTROOM.  IT'S JUST A SHAME THAT LA IS FULL OF ANTI-SEMITES.
<LI>O.J Simpson is an innocent MAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>If marcia clark say's one more tome that't not fair i'll pull my hair out
<LI>They are setting him up!!!!!! It just doesn't fit.
<LI>"Holy Mackell, dat OJ be inacent. When he get off I gonna invite him over for chitlins and wateremelon."  --- One of the jurors.
<LI>Jury sequestration should be banned-too much info not given to them
<LI>Why don't the media actually investigate instead of repeating press releases?
<LI>MORE LEARNING OF LAW & CONSTITUTION
<LI>The defense's ethics are lamentable, to say the least
<LI>Remember the victims. Please stop using hurtful comments, especially name calling and making fun of the tragedy that has befallen the Browns and the Goldmans.  They should be in our prayers!!
<LI>The Goldman family is damn annoying. Shut them up!
<LI>JUSTICE FOR SALE
<LI>motive + opportunity + BLOOD EV. = GUILT!!!
<LI>give him the chair then decide
<LI>I can't possibly conceive how, given the evidence, anyone could think he is innocent!
<LI>a new method is needed to disperse news from a trial so's not to influence jurors
<LI>shame everyone involved
<LI>Give OJ the chair.
<LI>Dat OJ, he be gilty!
<LI>I don't believe anything the defense says, Simpson is guilty, his lawyers are scum.  Electrocute or gas them all!
<LI>Are we done YET!
<LI>Enough is enough.
<LI>The trial kicks ass!  I think it is very entertaining
<LI>I don't think OJ did it, but he knows something about it but afraid to talk. I believe strongly in Mob\drug involvement and police cover-up
<LI>If it cost this much to get a fair trial what chance do we have?
<LI>They should just turn it all off and go away
<LI>Overall, this is again an indictment on the LAPD
<LI>He is guilty-the search was illegal though!
<LI>Brian Kelberg is the best attorney in the case
<LI>IT NEEDS TO END
<LI>enough is enough, shut the coverage down
<LI>I feel this case will never really be solved, because their has been allowed to many other opinions.
<LI>most of us would have already been convicted
<LI>Was Simpson, given a choice in the matter of Courtroom TV?  I think defendant's should be given the choice.  Although I believe Simpson to be guilty, the defendant by law is innocent until proven guilty.  Televising trials can be embarrassing to the "innocent".
<LI>This trial is more about econ status than race
<LI>OJs on trial not the LAPD & everyone else!
<LI>He is guilty as hell......hang him high!!!!
<LI>oj's lawyers no he's guiltier then sin, thats just to bad oj will walk away a free man
<LI>I could never have been a juror
<LI>The time element in the so called planting of the glove proves it couldn't be planted
<LI>its a mockery of our judicial system
<LI>The trial mirrors some of the problems in America.
<LI>Proof positive that wealth & fame influence justice.
<LI>As Nicole said " He's going to kill and get away with it"
<LI>This is RIDICULOUS. OJ did it, but that's not the issue - the issue is the immense media coverage. HE IS ONE HUMAN BEING. We as a nation and a species have more important things to worry about (although this does point to just how insane our justice system has become.)
<LI>Disgusting . . .
<LI>Very Boring.
<LI>o.j. did it. Figure it out!!!
<LI>Who does OJ think he's kidding!!
<LI>I can't believe anyone thinks he's innocent
<LI>The truth is straight forward and simple to state while to convince a jury of a lie will require a million words. The trial, therefore, may not come to an end in this century.
<LI>Ito Goofed -He picked the wrong event to flex his muscle - The TV Camera was NOT in violation of the Client/Lawyers Privaleges.
<LI>O.J'S GUILTY!!!!!
<LI>just killed own wife, when is dream team free?
<LI>This trial SUCKS! It Sucks, I tell you!
<LI>Well never know the truth, damn shame
<LI>A poor use of time and money
<LI>what a joke
<LI>what's on tv after this?
<LI>Henry VI, PartII, Act IV, Scene ii, Line 75
<LI>If he gets off it will be based on race not evidence or lack there of.
<LI>No logical reasonable person could ever believe OJ did not do this brutal inhumane crime!
<LI>Regardless of the verdict, OJ is guilty as hell.
<LI>Wonderful insight into American justice system.
<LI>one big joke!!
<LI>I hope THIS TRIAL LASTS FOREVER.  I can't wait to talk to my grandchildren about it, when the Juice is being re-tried for the 4th time.  ALL NIGGERS MUST DIE!
<LI>it's not justice, it's the law
<LI>it;s obvious...he's GUILTY....
<LI>HE'S GUILTY!!  COCHRANE IS A DISGRACE!!
<LI>It sucks get it off the tv i'm sick and tired of hearing about oj
<LI>Another pitiful example of making the accussed the victim!
<LI>Disgusting waste of time - NO RECORDABLE MEDIA SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN THE COURTROOM!!!!
<LI>I think it's been going on way too long!!!
<LI>none
<LI>disgraceful
<LI>Poetic justic will prevail in the end.
<LI>money and prejudice by black jurors will free o.j.
<LI>What a pathetic waste of time.  Warm up the fry-daddy.
<LI>If you have money, you can buy your way just about out of anything!!!
<LI>Although this trial may be disturbing, many of the comments on this survey are equally disturbing.  How can people talk about how crazy the trial and it's characters are when they write such vulgar and disgusting comments to be read by people from all over the world.  It makes me ashamed to be American knowing people in my country can display such ignorance.  The trial is no comparison to the sickening attitude many in our society presently have.  How hypocritical!  
<LI>If there is a second trial, don't put it on TV!
<LI>JUDGE ITO WOULDN'T RECOGNIZE THE US CONSTITUTION IF IT BIT HIM IN THE ASS.  ITO IS THE MOST INCOMPETENT JUDGE I HAVE EVER SEEN.
<LI>Money and poor law = no truth or justice
<LI>he'll win on appeal.
<LI>its a joke
<LI>is it over ------ YET!!!!!
<LI>Oh, PLEASE.  This is one case of thousands.  Who gives a fig?
<LI>Juatice will not be done.'
<LI>The trial SUCKS!!!!Its going to last for the rest of my life!!!
<LI>if guilty, God will sort out
<LI>what a waste of money and time for everyone
<LI>Tell me when it's over, PLEASE!!!!
<LI>If he never packs early why did he the night of the murders???
<LI>This trial confirms that if you have the cash, you can legally commit murder.
<LI>The Best Trial EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I am sick and tired of this stinking trial!
<LI>It is a waste of taxpayers' money!!!
<LI>How can the defense insist the gloves did not fit.  They fit the same way in the courtroom as they did on his hands on the videotapes.  Give us a break OJ, all you had to do is pull them on.  Great acting!
<LI>Thank God it is almost over
<LI>Reveals major problems with jury system, LAPD, racial problems, television, America.
<LI>I THINK IT WAS A MURDER-SUICIDE.  NICOLE KILLED GODLMAND BECAUSE HE WAS A FAG AND WOULDN'T FUCK HER, AND THEN SHE CUT HERSELF, SMEARED HER BLOOD AND GOLDMAN'S BLOOD ON A PAIR OF OJ'S GLOVES, WHICH SHE STOLE, AND THEN KILLED HERSELF. FURHMAN FOUND ONE OF THE GLOVES AND THEN PLANTED THE BLOOD AND GLOVE AT OJ'S ESTATE.  
<LI>it blows
<LI>This trial is an embarassment to our country's court system
<LI>I think OJ is guilty, but I think Marsha Clark is a bitch!
<LI>O.J. is scum.
<LI>This trial or "circus" is a waste of tax payers money.  End it now and save the cash.  Everyone knows that he is not going to be found guilty!
<LI>the Dream Team makes me sick. They know he did it.
<LI>ALL NIGGERS MUST DIE!!!!!!!
<LI>Jail the "Dream Team"
<LI>It's a racist show of bigotry.  O.J.'s not guilty of killing anyone, just marrying a White woman.
<LI>The legal system in CA sucks!!!!!
<LI>This trial is a joke, if the defendant was not famous, it would be open and shut within one week.  Pour millions of dollars into it and the circus comes to town.
<LI>the justice in LA is a joke
<LI>Should have hung him by his neck over a year ago.
<LI>a murder is now a circus event
<LI>Why is this on television??????
<LI>obviously, this man's got money to burn.  He's guilty. 
<LI>THEY SHOULD HANG THIS GUY FOR WHAT HES DONE
<LI>Hey, this case and its related aspects are an embarassment to the US, not to the rest of the world. For christ sake!st of the world
<LI>get it over with already
<LI>I HATE THAT FUCKING CUNT MARCIA CLARK!! SHE NEEDS A GOOD, HARD FUCK TO STRAIGHTEN HER OUT. AND THAT TOKEN NEGRO CHRIS DARDEN ISN'T ANY BETTER.  LET'S CONVICT THIS ASSHOLE AND GET ON WITH IT.
<LI>it should be over
<LI>I believe now that Nicole's sister was involved in her murder and she just wanted to get rid of her. OJ just happened to get himself into a bit of trouble with the spouse  abuse. They should not forget about the children they are not stupid eventually they are going to know what's going on.
<LI>I wish the trial would stay on forever
<LI>They should just get it over with, he is either guilty or not.
<LI>WOW...I thought Ringling Bors was entertainment!
<LI>REMBER NICOLE AND RON ? THEY WERE THE PEOPLE MURDERED!
<LI>Barry Scheck is, without question, the best lawyer in this trial.
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin, but will be acquitted because of that racist Fuhrmann.
<LI>Just get it over with.
<LI>The legal systems finest day (pathetic)
<LI>My name is Eddy Soema from Indonesia.  I'm not pleased with the CNN International coverage because they scramble their pictures.  I hoping you will help me and the others Indonesian friends to discramble the CNN International channel, so we can watch the trial and also the update anytime.  Thank you very much, Your concern is greatly appreciated.
<LI>defense stoops to a new low today (9/19/95
<LI>It is a travesty -- any other (normal) person in America would be in jail by now.
<LI>OJ is guilty.
<LI>More OJ!
<LI>Don't squeeze the juice, let him loose
<LI>OJ's guilty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Gas his Ass!!!!! of course the jury will not think so. 
<LI>TRIAL IS TOO LONG!
<LI>The defense throws everything at the jury and hopes something will stick.
<LI>KATO DID IT!!!!!
<LI>The entire trial is a media disgrace.
<LI>If he did it, she had it coming
<LI>Money buys freedom!  Trial's a disgrace!
<LI>LA NIGGERS CAN GET AWAY WITH *ANYTHING* AS LONG AS THEY THREATEN TO RIOT.  SHIP THEM ALL BACK TO AFRICA AND AMERICA WILL BE MUCH BETTER OFF.
<LI>Enough already!!!  Why must I hear about it EVERY GODDAMN DAY!  <ahem></A> 
<LI>What Nonsense...
<LI>it's lasted too long.
<LI>It should be took of T.V.    It is discusting!!!!!
<LI>Racism is still dividing this country - Just look at these comments from supposedly educated people with internet access.  People who make such vile comments (whatever their race) are just as lowlife as Fuhrmnan.
<LI>If this was anyone's else trial it would have been over by now instead of 10 months
<LI>I'm sick of it!
<LI>At least this may pop the admiration bubble and spell an end to all the dumb lawyer shows on TV
<LI>Jury should decide verdict, not the media!
<LI>disgusting, sleazy, and corrupt, Is'nt it great!
<LI>I think that had this been an ordinary person this would have been over months ago. But this oj case has taken over a news station down here in florida and I feel that it's disgusting. I'm a journalism major and i can not beleive the media has gone so far. This case is suppose to be about Nicole and Ronald, not the lawyers and their lives.
<LI>I think the media should mind its own business
<LI>A waste of L.A. money.
<LI>It is a totaol farce and I am surprised that it has been allowed to drag on so long. I am totally disgusted at the way the 'nigger' tapes have been allowed into court when they are pretty much irrelevant. Basically, OJ has a motive, no alibi and is the most likely suspect. It seems to me that the prosecution has not presented their case as well as they might have done seeing as the evidence is almost overwhelming.
<LI>Wheres OJs alibi? Wheres his proof of innocence? The reasonable doubt clause of our justice system is unreasonable, given the circumstances. I think the burden of proof should fall to the defense with the same requirement made of the prosecution. Proof
<LI>The world should butt out of other people's tragedies
<LI>He should have been excuted by now.
<LI>If an ordinary person murdered their ex-wife no one would care.
<LI>I think the judge should've added more tapings of Johnny Cochrane talking about framing blacks.
<LI>FUHRMAN WOULD NOT RISK HIS PENSION IN ORDER TO FRAME O.J!!..HE MAY BE RACIST, BUT HIS LINE OF WORK AND DEALING WITH THE SCUM OF SOCIETY MADE HIM THIS WAY...THIS BULLSHIT REGARDING HOW HE "PLANTED" EVIDENCE IS A BUNCH OF SHIT DREAMED UP BY THE DEFENSE BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR CLIENT IS GUILTY OF MURDER AND THEY ARE JUST DESPERATE FOR ANYTHING...DNA DOES NOT LIE. I SUPPORT MARK FUHRMAN 100%...guy's just doing his job and gets hounded by the BLOOD-THIRSTY DEFENSE..THEYRE A BUNCH OF ASSHOLES, LIKE OJ!!.....
C
<LI>fuhrman would not jeopardize his career for oj!!!
<LI>this is a waste of a tv network!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>THE CANCER IS SPREADING, YOU CAN BET THEY WILL RIOT IF O.J.s CONVICTED. AMERICA NEEDS TO STAND UP TO THE SELF SERVING BLACK RACE. THEY DESTROYED THE FABRIC OF THIS COUNTRY !
<LI>This trial is a bunch of crap!, and wasted millions! The lawyers are discraces to the job.
<LI>I believe the OJ Trial has been an unfortunate wake up call for Domestic Violence. The News Coverage should be appreciated considering the cost to US Taxpayers! The length of the trail seems outrageous until you think about how serious the charges are and that everything involved should be examined closely - hopefully another trial will not be needed. Thanks for allowing me the opportunity to share my thoughts!
<LI>The judicial system has a self-imposed black eye
<LI>I want O.J. to be either 100% guilty or 100% innocent so we all can move on in life and forget this sad delema.
<LI>racial prejudice and discrimination in the past has distorted and forced the legal process into allowing the media circus we are now seeing
<LI>oj is guiltier than sin
<LI>The media is making WAY too big a deal about it.
<LI>It's a JOKE!
<LI>OJ is being railroaded; Clark wants to win too much
<LI>The OJ case is a great litmus test of stupidity.  Only a moron could believe that he didn't do it.
<LI>Did Marsha Clark pose nude in Canada.  I want photos..
<LI>trials should NOT be broadcast until deliberations
<LI>I am not an "OJ WATCHER", however,I do realize an American Citizen's right written in the Constitution to his/her ASSUMED innocence UNTIL he/she is PROVEN guilty.  Has this basic right changed as a result of this sensational trial?  Or are we all still the same ol' same ol?  
<LI>this is a big joke
<LI>I really think, the Goldman family, and Nicole's family are being put through hell1! I mean they lost love ones, and yes the trial is a joke, get it over with!
<LI>O.J. is great, but he is still guilty.
<LI>Justice will not be served and he's gonna get off.
<LI>it's a shame, but i feel a guilty man will walk...
<LI>OJ is guilty but he will get off. Don't frget victems
<LI>THE HAVE TRASHED OUR INTER CITIES, THEY HAVE RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND NOW THEY SIT AS MAJORITY ON THE SIMPSON TRIAL, THEY WILL LET O.J. OFF EVEN THOUGH THEY NOW HE'S GUILTY. JUST LIKE THE JAPANESE SAY, THE BLACKS ARE THE CANCER OF AMERICA !
<LI>Somewhat fair until the Constitutional Abuse by the Judge. 
<LI>IT IS A FUCKIN GOD DAMN WASTE OF TAX PAYERS MONEY.
<LI>All prosecution witness, defence ask if they know Mark Furman
<LI>Money will usually get you off.
<LI>Johnnie Cochran comes across as a racist.  He shouldn't be pinting the finger at others.  He should not be allowed to conduct trial outside.  They should put a gag order on all the attorneys.
<LI>Free OJ!!!!
<LI>I THINK OJ IS INNOCENT.  IT SEEMS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT HE WAS FRAME BY A HORRIBLY CORRUPT POLICE DEPARTMENT AND DA'S OFFICE. PLUS, THE FBI IS PERHAPS AS CORRUPT AS LAPD. IT'S VERY SAD TO SEE GOOD MEN LIKE OJ BEING ABUSED BY THE SYSTEM. ANY ABUSE OF HIS RIGHTS IS AN ABUSE OF ALL OF OUR RIGHTS.
<LI>The trial is way too long.
<LI>i hate marcia clarke, oj is guilty but hope he gets off!!! from Dr Pat in Birmingham England. ps watch it every night and its great. pps my girlfriend hates it and me watching it !!!
<LI>OJ SHOULD HANG FOR THIS
<LI>Ito is not able to keep things moving
<LI>For question 16 there shouold be another option like all of the above.  O.J. is 100% positivily GUILTY
<LI>the most blatant display of non-justice ever seen!
<LI>THE HAVE TRASHED OUR INTER CITY'S, RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM, CORRUPTED THE AFIRMATIVE ACTION PROGRAMS AND NOW THEY SIT AS THE MAJORITY THE O.J. TRIAL, OH YE ! THIS IS A FAIR TRIAL !!!!!!
<LI>SAD AND A MIRROR OF U.S. TODAY
<LI>The family members are being cheated of a fair trial! Damn, they are the ones who are suffering!! Get this trial over-with! OJ is Guilty!
<LI>NO JUSTICE WITH BLACK DEFENDANTS/BLACK JURORS
<LI>this trial makes me sick he should be fried
<LI>I answered 16 this way beccause it is the prosecution who is using the victums families to speak to the press.  My sister was murdered and the defense attorney in that case resembles the prosecution in the OJ case.  I have seen the lies and deceptions on behalf of the prosecution.  The media may report it one way but I don't listen to the news media they are all biased escept for Larry King.  In the media we are guilty until proven  innocent.   In this county the coronor by law has to be on the scene o
e hour after the police arrive.    You know LAPD is a discusting department.  I am sure glad that my sister was murdered here and not there.  I can thank the DA for this we were handled with great care and concern and the DA's in sisters case were highly ethical.  Marsha Clark and Chris Darden are big winers.  My sister was murdered 21 years ago I did sit through the trial and I do know what I am talking about.  Judge Ito may be sitting up at his table but the prosecution has him sitting in their pocket.
<LI>the cost for getting away with murder is $10m.
<LI>JC says this should be a "search for truth;" yet, the Def. is always trying to skirt around the "real truth"--the physical evidence.
<LI>it is a bunch of croc
<LI>Finish This Trial and Be Done with it
<LI>Get it over with already!!!
<LI>Oj will have the last laugh when he sues LA!!!
<LI>what's the big deal?
<LI>being a suriver of a violent crime victum the prosecution is using the family's of the victums to get there messages to the public.  I sat through the trial of my sisters murder and I have compared the proseution to ours.  They Marcia and Chris should be good defense attorney's they are very deceitful.  If the road that they are wawlking on is a higher road It is much lower that the defenses.   They acturally make the defense look good.  Gill Garsetti well I would not elect him to dog catcher
<LI>Only in America!
<LI>The defense has proven reasonable doubt time & time again. I'm not saying he did or didn't do it- just the prosocution hasn't proven a damn thing!!!! 
<LI>California's justice system is terribly inefficient and slow. The demands on the jurors lives are insufferable . The entire process is an aberration .
<LI>Is the jury singing "I'll Be Home for Christmas?"
<LI>If he didn't have money or fame this would have been over a long time ago
<LI>This whole affair makes me ashamed to be a lawyer.
<LI>we need more oj coverage
<LI>will result in legal reform, undoubtedly
<LI>It is just TOO long.
<LI>TOO LONG
<LI>make Mark Furman Testify in front of Jury, OJ will go free. 
<LI>The trial of the century has dragged on too long.
<LI>I dont care how it turns out, just end the damn thing!!!
<LI>great stuff let's try tom hank's for personality defects
<LI>too damned long; ito is not doing his job
<LI>rest
<LI>get it over with
<LI>It is a complete waste of time and money!
<LI>What MARCIA CLARK, THAT WHINING BITCH needs is a STIFF, THICK BLACK COCK STUFF IN HER MOUTH SO SHE CAN SWALLOW A HOT LOAD OF THICK AFRICAN CUM. AND OJ IS JUST THE MAN TO GIVE IT TO HER, AFTER HE IS AQUITTED.
<LI>He is guilty, period!! Convict him and get it over with!
<LI>THE WHITE RACIST FBI AGENT LIED. THE WHITE RACIST COPS FUHRMAN, VANATTER & LANGE LIED. THE WHITE RACIST DA MARCIA CLARK LIES CONSTANTLY. THAT WHITE TRASH WHORE DENISE BROWN LIED.  THIS WHOLE TRIAL IS A SHAM AND A FRAMEUP BY A WHITE RACIST SYSTEM AGAINST A BLACK MAN BECAUSE WHITE PEOPLE WERE KILLED.  IT SEEMS LIKE MISSISIPI IN THE 1950S.
<LI>Get it over with!
<LI>I feel that this trail is a TOTAL waste of time & money....Fry em'!
<LI>America in Black and White
<LI>Remember there were two people murdered by O.J.
<LI>The Media is totally unprofessional; Nicole Brown's murder and OJ's particiaption should have gotten 15 minutes of media coverage in total.  
<LI>It is a joke. All this time and still no resolution
<LI>justice becomes prime time 
<LI>Enough money = Get away with MURDER
<LI>FREE OJ. FREE OJ. WE LOVE OJ
<LI>Fry the bastard....NOW!
<LI>OJ is innocent, Nicole deserves to die
<LI>confirms a law for the rich and justice for the poor bah humbug!!
<LI>The media are sleezeballs!!!!
<LI>Pathetic - the collapse of credibility for our legal system; many Americans now more cynical than ever about fairness of the "system"
<LI>The prosecution might have lost this trial!!!
<LI>The media has turned our legal system into a circus!
<LI>O.J. is not a God, he is evil.  No matter what happens in this case.  Vengeance is mine saith the Lord.  There is no reason to worry, man is not in control.  O.J. is guilty, sad but true.
<LI>crooked cops/corrupt judge and prosecution
<LI>Prosecution only wants their case. Why have a Defense? Both sides should be able to have a fair shot. Use common sense instead of legal mumbo jumbo and the jury will understand. Judge Ito is very good but he better start being fair to BOTH. Leave the jury hear everything.
<LI>OJ, will not get the death sentence, because he is OJ and has money, but he could get life.
<LI>I have lost respect for the american judicial system
<LI>The actions/reactions by all people involved in this trial where two people were butchered (including the victims families) is disgusting!!!!!
<LI>FRY FURHMAN - FREE OJ.  NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE!!! FRY FURHMAN - FREE OJ.
<LI>There is only one word; BIZZARRE!
<LI>It's taking too damn long!
<LI>HE'S GUILTY- BUT WITNESSES HAVE ALL BEEN ON TRIAL   BEEN ON TRIAL
<LI>Oj has not been proven guilty whithout reasonable doubt. 
<LI>OJ oughta hang!
<LI>ITO IS PRO PROSECUTION
<LI>Whay was bailey allowed to ask a question about racial descriptions without a foundation. Ito screwed up and now is trapped in his own hole.
<LI>it is a prejus. case
<LI>money talks
<LI>I think he is guilty but he didn't do it alone'
<LI>he is guilty,using his name to get off free
<LI>The defense should have the right to clearly demonstrate to the jury just how profoundly Evil Mark Fuhrman really is. Were there opportunities for him to enter areas where evidence was stored? The fact that blood was not taken from a gate until many days after the crime would seem to provide him with mnay chances to plant evidence. It took one O-ring to blast the Challenger out of the sky - it could take just one cop with evil intentions to convict an innocent man.
<LI>its sad that our judicial system is as lame as it it...period!
<LI>OJ's GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
<LI>Simpson probably murdered the two but will go free due to racial feelings exploited by defense lawyers.
<LI>AMERICAN JUSTICE SYSTEM STINKS
<LI>I love Marcia Clark..she's so HOT in a skirt!
<LI>Everyone should get the chair.
<LI>Way too looooooonnnnngggggg!
<LI>It's out of control.
<LI>The Scheme team should go to jail with their client.
<LI>he is 100 guilty
<LI>The whole thing stinks like yesterday's diapers
<LI>the dream team are loud mouthed clowns
<LI>I hope it
<LI>I THINK OJ KILLED NICOLE AND RON AND THE PLANTED THE GLOVE IN HIS BACKYARD, SO THAT HE COULD FRAME MARK FUHRMAN AS A RACIST!!!
<LI>He's guilty....juice The Juice!!!!!
<LI>Future LAGITIMATE Racial Cries will be ignored because of defense lies. As a liberal this can only hurt our cause !!!
<LI>GET OVER IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>It should be taken off TV and the lawyers should quit spinning their  nightly versions.
<LI>I find the parts of the trial without the jury most interesting. 
<LI>Get it over with!
<LI>Laura Hart McKinney has the stupidest expression on her face all the time.  She's trying to look soooo distressed that she's been 'dragged' into this, but now her tapes are worth $250,000. Just another asshole trying to make a buck from the trial.
<LI>lots of fun, too bad he's got so much money.
<LI>the parents are being delt a bad blow
<LI>I think Ito is prejudiced and is a bad judge.  His refusal to allow better tapes or to allow the cop to be recalled are inexcusable.
<LI>embarassment
<LI>Justice will prevail
<LI>If OJ is so innocent, have him TAKE the stand!
<LI>This whole trial is an embarrasment to American justice!!! It disgusts me
<LI>gass his ass
<LI>I believe it is an example of bureacracy of the judicial system at it's worst.
<LI>According to the law he is innocent UNTIL proven guilty.....everyone should do as the jury has been instructed and wait until ALL of the evidence is in B4 making their decision
<LI>this trial sucks!!!!!
<LI>Doesn't the judge have a responsibility to assume innocence?  He sure rules like he wants to protect the prosecution...
<LI>Ito is too pro-prosecution
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin.
<LI>DNA evidence is irrefutable to intelligent people.  The Jury should know how scarce the fibers are; & that they match being found in the Bronco and at the crime scene.
<LI>Johnny Cochran Ix a complete asshole
<LI>THERE WILL BE NO JUSTICE - O.J. WILL WALK.
<LI>Hmmm...What do we know: Cops hates african americans, and oj's dna, hair, foot prints, gloves (oj once owned a pair of gloves and shoes like those as evidence) are found at the murder sceen.  Therefore we have the police guilty of racism and a man guilty of murder.  It would seem that since racism is a worse crime than murder we should fire the cops and let the murderer go free.  At least that's what some would say.  I am reminded of Jesus, when the was crowd asked who should we free, it was the murder
  Now I'm not suggestion an analogy of furhman to Jesus, but our law enforcement system .  Today in america we have one of the most fair (go to bosnia ) system in the world.  The benchmark for fairness I would contend comes from GOD and this is the comparison I am getting at.  If we through out our law enforcement system because we think its unfair the replacement will be much worse.  Let's leave it to god to punish both the murder and the racist, and get on with our own lifes.
<LI>im glad its almost over
<LI>I'LL BE SAD WHEN IT'S OVER.
<LI>It costs taxpayers TOO much money!!!
<LI>The Police are guilty of planting evidence and that is a greater crime, that the innocent could pay for deeds not done than O.J. Going free and actually having killed.
<LI>See what happens when you kick Nicole Simpson's clit, the juice will kill ya
<LI>up chuck
<LI>What a joke!!!!!
<LI>Its murder not spouse abuse
<LI>Not a very good survey
<LI>ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!!!
<LI>Ito should start letting in some real Defense Evidence instead of covering it up!
<LI>Ferman should be hung
<LI>It's a circus du jour!
<LI>CHRIS DARDEN IS A FUCKING CRY-BABY, PUSSY, FAGGOT AND SHOULD HAVE HIS FUCKING HEAD CUT OFF FOR HIS CONDUCT IN THE COURTROOM.
<LI>Why isn't Mark Fuhrman also on trial for his crimes???
<LI>I've never heard OJ say "find who killed my wife..
<LI>Make it STOP!!!
<LI>Mar Furman is a racist, therefore OJ is not guilty
<LI>Innocent if proven wealthy
<LI>Whether guilty or innocent, the defense has clearly establish "reasonable doubt" with the help of the disgusting Fuhrman.
<LI>Mark Fuhrman SHOULD create reasonable doubt, therefore, aquittal.
<LI>Has anyone checked out OJs brother: BLT Simpson?
<LI>I AM SICK OF THIS DISGUSTING TRIAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I will be so happy when it's finally over!!!!  Too bad, but OJ will walk after all this time and money.  He should have commited suicide at the beginning and saved us from this disgusting display of the legal system!!!
<LI>The lawyers are performing for the camera.
<LI>FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN AND READ IT APPEARS THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF CONVICTING EVIDENCE.  IT SEEMS THE WHOLE MURDER AND ATTEMPTED COVER UP BY OJ WAS SLOPPY.  OJ'S ALIBIS AND THE FACT OF THE CUTS SEEM TO LINGER EVEN AFTER THE DEFENSES BEST ATTEMPTS ARE GIVEN.  THE DEFENSE APPEARS TO PULLING AND GRABBING FOR ANYTHING TO DIVERT THE JURY, INSTEAD OF SHOWING ANY SOLID EVIDENCE FOR OJ'S DEFENSE.  THEIR RESTING THE CASE ON FRUMAN'S RACISM EMPHASIZES THEIR WEAKNESS FOR FACTS AND THEIR FONDNE
S FOR HYPE AND DIVERSION.
<LI>I've got to the point of who cares! get it over with
<LI>I feel extremely sorry for what the jury has gone through. 
<LI>media biased towards prosecution/defense not required to "prove" anything/What happened to the presumption of Innocence?
<LI>When NIGGERS kill NEGGER FUCKERS there NO CRIME.
<LI>It sucks! Fry the guy!
<LI>The more I hear of the Mark Fuhrmann tapes, the more I like 'im!!!!
<LI>as the trial progress I feel that the attitude to the defense is frustrating because mr.Johnny is very annoying spewing out that bullshit about the truth and always getting chris darden's goat whenever possiable
<LI>I wish it would be over soon!
<LI>I wish it would end
<LI>why? why does anyone care?
<LI>Money talks
<LI>He was framed by Mark Furhman
<LI>If Simpson is found innocent, our country is in big trouble!
<LI>I think that this is an example of the morals of this country when you have two dead adults and two children without a mother, and all this country can think about are 2 things: 1. How to make more money off of this case 2. How to hang another black male! I'm disgusted. All the OJ jokes, lies, and bashing can't change history.  It sure is funny how Nichole's family loved OJ when he was beating on her, but the minute she comes up dead, they question him. And I am from LA, I can tell you thousands of sto
ies about the racist LAPD, nothing Furhman did is any different from alot of cops on the force...Really do some background reading about them and alot of cops around the globe, you will be amazed of what you find out!  GET EDUCATED TO THE TRUTH< GET OUT OF DENIAL!
<LI>Kato is a Slimeball!!!
<LI>defense team is making me sick !
<LI>Who gives a flying fuck? The only ones who should care are those that are involved (family and friends)
<LI>O.J. is guilty, but I loved Naked Gun!
<LI>IT IS NOT "WORLD CLASS NEWS" AND DOES NOT DESERVE THE COVERAGE IT IS RECEIVING. IF IT WERE THE TRIAL OF A NON-CELEBRITY, THERE WOULD HAVE NOT BEEN THIS MUCH COVERAGE.
<LI>It is a circus
<LI>In hindsight, it probably should not be on TV.
<LI>This trial is a joke!! Time for the curtain to close!!
<LI>Judge Ito is obviously another racisst scum for not allowing all of the Fuhrman tapes.  Maybe his robe should be white and have a hood with it.
<LI>Disgusting!
<LI>FUHRMAN THE VERMIN SHOULD BE SHOT FOR HIS CRIMINAL RACISM.
<LI>Fire anyone that Gates hired on the LAPD.  (LAPD = Lying And Pathetic Department)
<LI>Don't waste tax payers money if guilty he should die.
<LI>Most valuable outcome of trial: Fuhrman tape.  Drives home why blacks feel they can't get justice.  Prosecution is incompetent.  Wish ability to defend against criminal charges didn't depend on income.
<LI>The whole thing is a travesty of justice!
<LI>it sucks
<LI>I'll be glad when the whole thing is resolved
<LI>It is ashame, that Mark Furman, had anything to do with the case. They should throw out the evidence, he brought in and his testimony, and tell the jury, ok it is gone, we will deal with him at his trial, look at the remaining evidence and make you decision.
<LI>Who Cares?
<LI>This is supposed to be American justice, not entertainment. Too much coverage.
<LI>No way he will be found guilty. They will be afraid of another race riot.
<LI>How ridiculous can we get?
<LI>What about the people who are dead? Do we care who killed them!
<LI>Take off and nuke 'em from orbit!
<LI>it is a shame that the prosecution has such convincing evidence, and the poor jury doesn't even understand what DNA is!!
<LI>OJ will walk. LA afraid blacks will riot.
<LI>I can't believe I wasted my time with this survey!
<LI>This trial is not representational of justice.  The evidence for guilt is overwhelming, beginning with the woman whom he almost ran into at 10:48 on 6/12
<LI>We will have another LA riot if found guilty.
<LI>It would be the best comedy in years if the issue were not so serious.  The system should be changed like numerous countries to have no reporters, TV, press or anyone in the courtroom.  Something more origial should have been done for a sequestered jury for this length of time.
<LI>Pleeeeease! Nuke the court building! Kill them all! Outlaw TV! Do WHATEVER, just make the fucking thing disappear! :)
<LI>FAY "EXPLOIT" RESNECK
<LI>Would this have happened if he wasn't a celeb????
<LI>It's a joke, OJ should have been taken out and shot.
<LI>The defense had the contents of the tapes played publicly because they know the information will get to the jurors outside of the trail since they can't present it in the trial.
<LI>Prosecution is telling too many lies about O.J.
<LI>Pure shit. OJ is guilty as hell.
<LI>I'm sick of it and can't stop tuning in
<LI>Find OJ's shoes, clothes he wore that night
<LI>The focus is incorrectly placed on Fuhrman and the two victims are forgotten
<LI>this trail is so funny that stouptes!!!!!
<LI>This is the most ridiculous thing I've seen on TV...
<LI>Any other trial would have wrapped months ago!
<LI>The race card is bull!!!
<LI>enough oj coverage on tv!  no more!!!!!
<LI>I think that they should just ban the media (i.e. TV coverage) and hurry up and come to a decision.  Just look at the Bernardo trial which was settled in a few months and where TV coverage was restricted.  
<LI>fuck the whole thing
<LI>Go O.J :-)
<LI>It is making a mockery of the U.S. judicial system. It should not be on TV and should have been over by now.
<LI>Even after Furmans secrets,there too much evidence to prove OJ's guilt
<LI>when is it getting over
<LI>It has turned into a joke
<LI>It's a joke
<LI>it's basically all about race ,not justice
<LI>Law and Justice is often a contradiction
<LI>BuLLShiT!
<LI>Where was Fuhrmann on the night of June 12, 1994?
<LI>Doesn't the nation have anything better to do?
<LI>It is disgusting that both sides get to play games.
<LI>I'm glad the prosecution & defense had nothing to do with the creation of our earth, we'd still be on day 2!!!
<LI>Find him guilty and let's move on.
<LI>Do you what the difference between OJ and Christopher Reeves is?        OJ will walk.   OJ is guilty.... no justice no peace  ... the white man will riot.... Johnny can kiss my lilly white ass... no justice no peace... FRY OJ... He's just so fucking guilty, this trial makes my head hurt.  FRY the RAT BASTARD!  Whitey will take it to the street.  1992 will look like a picnic compared to what will happen.  Good luck!  As office Joe Friday used to say "just the facts ma'am".  Well Johnnie can blow smoke u
 somebody else's ass.  Just sign me "Piss off at OJ"  Did everyone  forget 2 people were murdered.  I know I didn't do it.  My blood isn't all over the murder scene.  OHY! I can't take much more of this crap!  Where do I get off this roller coaster?
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin and I wouldn't be surprised if his dream team is responsible for some of this so called planting of evidence.  Kato should stand up like a man and tell the truth!  Furhman is guilty of purjury.  However, OJ is guilty!
<LI>put oj on people's court and decide his fate
<LI>I wish people would let the court do its business, without assuming guilt (what ever happened to not-guilty until proven innocent?) I don't know if he did it, or not, but everyone else seems to have an opinion and that theirs is right (even though they weren't there when it happened!)
<LI>it's awful-the dead are all but forgotten.
<LI>If OJ was white and killed a black girl, this would be over.
<LI>The prosecution and Judge makes me ashamed to be an attorney!
<LI>none
<LI>O.J. is guilty, but you can't convict $10 million.
<LI>let him burn
<LI>let him burn
<LI>Specific to Question #16:  Johnny Cochrane is using the trial for personal nad racial gains.
<LI>When 70% of the Afrian Americans think OJ is innocent and the other 30% don't live in Central LA how can anyone expect OJ to be found guilty.
<LI>O.J.'s lawyers should write fiction, they have created a perfect suspension of disbeleif!
<LI>Race is a issue! defence can ONLY win if the tapes are heard!
<LI>This can happen only in the USA.
<LI>I think that the cop framed simpson i mean somehow that glove just came out of no where, i think he planted the blood on the bronco and all that other jazz, and i also think the whole thing is a crock, if OJ wasn'tthe celbraty he is he would have been sitting in jail for a few months/weeks/year awaiting a fiar trial like every other Tom Dick and Harry!
<LI>He is guilty as sin!
<LI>trial is a microcosm of the state of the Union - a marriage of lawyers & advertisers baiting the public to a feeding frenzy. 
<LI>no
<LI>The trial is a travesty that mocks the concept of justice.
<LI>I am disappointed in judge, he favors prosecution
<LI>quit it already Marcia and the media!!!
<LI>This last ruling of Ito is disgusting
<LI>Money distroys the system. unequal justice 
<LI>I wish they would hurry and finish so I don't have to see it on TV every night.
<LI>i can't wait til it's over so i can see what happens with the menendez brothers
<LI>If he was white he would have been hung already, and nowone would have noticed or cared.  The ass who perged himself may end up freeing the man he wants in jail
<LI>OJ is SEXY!!!
<LI>O.J. is guilty as sin!
<LI>Rotten Police reflect their community
<LI>This trial will prove that niggers can get away with anything if they threaten to riot.
<LI>OJ should fry for beating that little 90 lb woman alone - he deserves no pity!! 
<LI>Go Johnny!
<LI>It O J gets off because of race. It''ll be a joke.
<LI>I hope that jackbooted thug gets the same thing OJ deserves . . . the GAS CHAMBER.
<LI>I think that it should drop off the damn TELEVISION!  I'm tired of my favorite shows being interupted for boring court proceedings!!! It's ridiculous, between the trial and sports!! There's nothing good on TV anymore!
<LI>It's all a conspiracy! Let's just fry him regardless!
<LI>interesting-different-educational
<LI>I just wish it would end...SOON!!!!
<LI>I went looking for Joe Friday and found Bull Connor
<LI>don't _cut_ the deck, 'OJ' it!!
<LI>Get it over with, we all know he did it!
<LI>Just REACH a fucking verdict! The length of this trial is ridiculous.
<LI>I'll be sad when it's all over
<LI>The trial is a waste of people time and money.
<LI>Too much publicity.  O.J.'s JUST another person.
<LI>Jeez, what a sorry excuse for a justice proceeding
<LI>The defense and prosecution have turned it into a circus - obscuring the fact that OJ is on trial!!
<LI>its making me sick
<LI>waste of time, money; folks involved are sorry
<LI>disgusting, everyone has been on trial but OJ
<LI>This is the best evidance for judicial reform yet!
<LI>fuhrman is a racist idiot but irrelevant to the guiley verdcit against oj
<LI>He's black, rich and inperfect that alone makes him a candidate. 
<LI>Abraham Lincoln should've shipped all the "free niggers" back to Africa when he had the change--now it'll take us forever!!! 
<LI>Abraham Lincoln should've shipped all the "free niggers" back to Africa when he had the change--now it'll take us forever!!! 
<LI>CNN should air the damn trail in Europe
<LI>DENISE BROWN KILLED RON & NICOLE BECAUSE SHE WAS JEALOUS NICOLE COULD GET YOUNG STUDS LIKE RON IN THE SACK AND SHE COULDN'T.
<LI>Too bad the real murderer (O.J.) will go free.
<LI>FACT:  Fuhrman is a NAZI.  FACT:  Fuhrman HATES everyone who is not a white male cop.  FACT:  Fuhrman admits on the tapes to planting evidence, framing suspects and being a general bastard.  FACT: Fuhrman 'claims' to have found 'blood' on the Bronco and this precipitated the unlawful entry by police into OJ's estate.  FACT: Since Fuhrman is a liar, the cops had NO REASON TO SEARCH OJ's estate, the search warrant should be thrown out, all 'evidence' found and/or planted during execution of that search w
rrant should be thrown out, and OJ SHOUD BE SET FREE.  All of this is quite sad, because OJ DID KILL RON & NICOLE.
<LI>To solve the problem, we should make both Mark Fuhrman and OJ submit to lie detector tests, and sodium penathol tests to find out exactly, WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!!!
<LI>boring
<LI>I wouldn't mind if I never here another word about for the rest of my life.
<LI>I lost interest in the case 10 minutes into the chase!!  GET IT OFF THE TUBE!!!!
<LI>Hurry up and end for F*@!'s sakes!!!
<LI>Hurry up and get this travesty over with
<LI>T*R*A*S*H
<LI>Trial by popular opinion?  Only in America...land of the free, home of the stupid.
<LI>i cringe when marcia resorts to feminine 'wiles'
<LI>disturbing/makes one question justice system
<LI>This is the worst Trial What about Susan Smith?
<LI>Ito's decision to allow TV was devastating to the public's perception of the Jury System
<LI>Big waste of taxpayer's money.
<LI>Probably the most perverted thing i have ever witnessed. This is not justice. It is the antipodia of justice!
<LI>This trial is like the Energizer Bunny...it keeps going, and going, and going.....
<LI>Interesting to watch but police interf. exagerated
<LI>It's all a bunch of bull.
<LI>Mark Ferman screwed the whole thing up.
<LI>LA will BURN if OJ is convicted.  The people of LA have had it with racist cops and a racist just-us system. 
<LI>I'll be glad when the circus is over!
<LI>The "Dream Team" should fry along with their client just for being so dumb. OJ bites the big one 
<LI>Swing the fucking spook
<LI>The defense seems to be on quite a strong comeback. I think that they might actually win this case.
<LI>Even if OJ did it, he should still be set free.  He is the victim of white racist cops, white racist prosecutors and a white racist system.
<LI>By the time we get a verdict, OJ will have already served his life sentence.
<LI>It's all a farce and they should of hung OJ long ago and saved the taxpayers alot of $$$$!
<LI>I absolutely hate the CNN "OJ TRIAL" Theme song!!!
<LI>What a farce - I have not watched 1 minute!
<LI>It is showing America the truth about legal system
<LI>I hate it.  Fuhrman is a loser!
<LI>It is taking too long!
<LI>This trial isn't about justice, it's about who can look good for the camera.
<LI>We truly have a failed justice system when an obviously
<LI>I O.J.is found not guilty money lets guilty go free
<LI>Of course Mark Furhman planted the glove..we all no that a nigger could never be guilty of murder, especially in Los Angeles
<LI>No wonder the Ku Klux Klan came into existence!!!
<LI>I hope they FRY FURHMANN'S WHITE ASS!  He is guilty of criminal racism!!!!!
<LI>It is obvious. the Illuminati is framing both Fuhrman and O.J. Look, nicole was killed on the 12th, only 5 less than 17 and we all know the significance of that number. Fnord.
<LI>Confusion=Reasonable Doubt in this trial
<LI>How to punish OJ:  Ship him back to Africa.
<LI>I'm not sure who is sleazier, Denise Brown or Marcia Clark!?!?   
<LI>Judge Ito should be put to pasture.
<LI>The defense has done an excellent job of presenting REASONABLE DOUBT.  Remember, it is the evidence that is on trial, not the accused.  FREE OJ!  NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE!  FREE OJ!!!
<LI>FARCE! great for a laugh
<LI>It is over-rated.
<LI>OJ is guilty of having my money, thats enough to lock him up!
<LI>Pitiful.  Ridiculous that it's taken so long.
<LI>O.J. will probably get off and thats really sad.
<LI>money makes the difference
<LI>The defense team is a joke
<LI>take out the tv cameras!!!
<LI>Looks like OJ guilty...but the cops are surely crooked as hell, and liars.
<LI>ITO IS BEST OF ALL. NO ONE DESERVES THE PREJUDGEMENT OJ HAS RECEIVED. THE POLICE VIOLATED OJ AND OTHERS RIGHTS IN GOING OVER THE GATE. THEY LIED!
<LI>Defense should be allowed "equal" court time.
<LI>Sad. Pathetic. Travesty of Justice. 'Nuff Said.
<LI>A mockery of the judicial process
<LI>why not add 'all' to question 16?
<LI>I'm suprised I answered this stupid survey!
<LI>its a circus
<LI>OJ is disgustingly guilty.
<LI>If he's not found guilty then it's a sad day for all of us.
<LI>Why are we wasting so much time on it? including me
<LI>I just hope they quickly get over it!!!
<LI>The evidence says he's guilty!
<LI>No one will ever know for sure!
<LI>Guilty as sin.
<LI>he not guilty it all the evidence is in.
<LI>If the Prosecution would have presented its case, instead of reacting to the defense, all would be over by now, good or bad.
<LI>A ridiculous circus, no possibility of a fair trial
<LI>Get it over!
<LI>Do I have to wear my KKK hood when I apply for a job with the LAPD, or would be enough to just goose-step into the office and snap off a smart "Sieg Heil!"???
<LI>I believe he did it, but he is not guilty.
<LI>zzzzz
<LI>You can't spell. CA taxpayers should be disgusted.
<LI>it is a zoo, and the crime is what has been lost
<LI>Blame Faye Resnick-the druggie;not O.J.!
<LI>I think it is getting old, put something else on TV
<LI>In court, you're innocent until proven guilty.  This isn't Iraq.
<LI>if it were not a celeb. on trial it would already be over and it would likely be a conviction....this does no imply my view of O.J's guilt or innocence just my view of the judicial system.
<LI>I used to like to watch it, but now it's getting boring! FINISH THE TRIAL ALREADY! 
<LI>shows how unfair the court system is 
<LI>THE GLOVES DIDN'T FIT.  FUHRMANN, THE NAZI COP, PLANTED THE GLOVE AND THE BLOOD. VANATTER LIED TO GET THE SEARCH WARRANT. MARCIA CLARK, THE WHINING BITCH, HAS A PERSONAL GRUDGE AGAINST MR. SIMPSON, IT ALL ADDS UP TO A DISHONEST STACKED DECK.  OJ SHOULD BE SET FREE NOW!!!!
<LI>If O.J. was any normal black man, the freakin' trial would have been over in a month, tops!
<LI>Mark 'the vermin' Fuhrmann was dumb enough to leave bloody footprints behind at the murder scene.  It must be obvious that OJ IS INNOCENT.  
<LI>Get it over with!!!!
<LI>If anyone thinks there can't be a cop conspiracy, they should check on the Shirley King Trial in NY State....Quite a few on New York State troopers are in prison now for planting evidence and lying under oath for that trial and others
<LI>get it over with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>These are the times that try mens souls
<LI>if oj was innocent,  he'd testify!
<LI>He's guilty and the "dream team" knows it!!!
<LI>he did it
<LI>I hate Lisa Kahn, and I think the prosecution could have done a better job, cut all they have is the work of the LAPD.
<LI>it's dragged on too long because of the media circus and games played by the defense. Our justice system is based on one's financial and celebrity status.
<LI>THIS HAS POLARIZED THE WHOLE NATION AGAINST BLACKS
<LI>It just goes to show, you can buy your way out of just about anything.
<LI>The prosecution and LAPD are incompitent!
<LI>Marcia Clark is a whinner.
<LI>O.J. is guilty as sin!
<LI>How get jury for second trial?
<LI>Is it common for American police to be racist extremists like mark Fuhrmann?  The judge should stop this charade now and let Mr. Simpson get on with his life.  It is clear that he was set up by corrupt and racist policemen.
<LI>The only thing OJ is guitly of is betraying his race by marrying a white woman.  But, he has made up for that by hiring a brilliant African-American like Johnny Cochrane.  It's Fuhrmann who should be subject to capital punishment, not OJ.  I'm sure that new footprint found by Dr. Lee belongs to a white man. It was white racists like Vanatter, Lange and Fuhrmann who framed OJ.
<LI>NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE, NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE, NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE, NO JUSTICE - NO PEACE!!!  FREE OJ!!
<LI>We're getting nowhere fast!  Only the criminal knows th truth so face justice is truly impossible. Simpson has money on his side anyway,so, GIVE IT UP!!!!
<LI>It is now abundantly clear that Det. Fuhrmann lied and planted evidence because of his hatred of African-Americans.  This case should be dismissed and OJ should be set free.  Fuhrmanm should be tried for perjury, tampering with evidence in a capital case and criminal racism.  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!
<LI>It's Barry Scheck!!!!
<LI>shows up US lousy system
<LI>help out more
<LI>Can't they hurry up
<LI>Mark "Vermin" (because that's what he is) obviously planted evidence in order to frame a black man.  I predict there will be another uprising and LA will burn if OJ is convicted.  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE, That's the law of the street here in LA, whether you white folks like it or not!!
<LI>I am very tired of this trial, I wish it was over!
<LI>Rich nigger kills a SLUT and a FAG and then the STUPID CORRUPT LAPD SCREW UP THE CASE.  THIS IS JUSTICE, CALIFORNIA STYLE!!!
<LI>I WOULDN'T LEAVE MY BLOODY SOCKS AND BLOODY GLOVE TO BE FOUND AND DUMP THE REST OF MY BLOODY CLOTHES IN CHICAGO. WOULD YOU?
<LI>Who's the asshole who keeps writing "No Justice, No Peace, Free OJ"? Probably the same asshole who keeps spelling "Fuhrman" as "Vermin".
<LI>     I hope it lasts forever!
<LI>It's sleazy and frustrating, but at least it's usually not boring
<LI>HE's GUILTY AS NUTS!!
<LI>OJ is buying his way out of this one.
<LI>It is pathetic beyond comment, is America this bored?
<LI>No TV coverage, no sequestration of jury, no permitting too many hypothethicals.  Also, change the law, so that statements in court are no longer privileged statements and that one can be sued for libel for what they say in court.
<LI>Intelligent people can see through the defense claim of a conspiracy.  Only 
<LI>A 25 cent bullet up OJ's ass would be alot cheaper than the millions this bullshit trial is costing. As for Mark Fuhrman being a racist--I say how could anyone not be a racist living in a city where the blacks commit 80% of the crimes?
<LI>The trial was out of control, I`m glad Ito has been trying to get it under control.
<LI>GOOD  FOR   FUTURE   ATTORNEYS
<LI>Ito has lost control.
<LI>Too long, waste of time and money, boring
<LI>If only this had happened 150 years ago in the Old South.
<LI>O.J. COULD HAVE BEEN SET UP JUST AS EASY AS HE COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIMES
<LI>wasting too much money on it!
<LI>MARK VERMIN, WHITE RACIST COP, PLANTED THE GLOVE AND BLOOD.  FREE OJ!!!!!!
<LI>OJ may get away with murder in this life, but he'll certainly pay for it in the next.
<LI>The judgement of Mark Furman will determine the outcome of this trial...He has prevented any chance of getting a true vedict
<LI>DNA  ALL THE  WAY  
<LI>Get it over with!!!!
<LI>Your American Legal system is a joke!!!
<LI>Get to the point....
<LI>Since the case has gone on sooo long, and obviously guilty person has a better chance of being set free than he should have.
<LI>I just gotta appreciate the fact that we get an innovative TV program every day, thanks for the show!
<LI>It makes a joke of legal system. Should be stopped.
<LI>GOD IS NOT MOCKED, WHATEVER YOU SOW, YOU WILL REAP .... IN THE LANGAUGE OF THE STREETS "WHAT GOES AROUND, COMES AROUND"
<LI>God is the only true judge.  Pray that His knowledge of the events of 6/12/94 are revealed.
<LI>He is so fucken guilty, you have to be blind to miss it
<LI>ridiculous
<LI>it's not justice, it's a circus
<LI>I'll be happy to see the end of this bullshit
<LI>this trail is about murder not race
<LI>I think the trial is a waste! They know O.J is guilty!
<LI>I think O.J.IS innocent as the world will find out soon enough.
<LI>OJ is guilty.  The media won't say it, though, so they can claim non-bias.  I think they should sprout some testicles and give their real opinions!
<LI>It's the most overdramatized thing on T.V.
<LI>Prove or disprove.  Don't speculate.
<LI>It's good to see the system take a slap right in the face.
<LI>Unfortunately Shaps and the boys will free O.J.
<LI>I won't even begin!!!
<LI>speed it up!
<LI>THE TRIAL SHOULD BE BANNED FROM ALL T.V.!!!!!!!!
<LI>He's guilty, but he'll walk because of an incompetent jury with their own agenda(s).
<LI>no
<LI>no
<LI>defense has disgraced the system, and themselves.
<LI>KATO PROBABLY DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING AND IS TRYING TO MAKE UP FOR IT.
<LI>Colonol Mustard did it!!! 
<LI>This is a stupid waste of money and I'm pissed!
<LI>lock em' up
<LI>oj is a guilty nigger
<LI>justice is blind yet much swayed by wealth
<LI>Race is a major factor because of jury 
<LI>THE DREAM TEAM AND OJ ARE SCUM
<LI>It's awful!!!
<LI>Mark Fuhrman may be a racist, but he is not stupid enough to plant blood at OJ's.
<LI>The Trial of the Century
<LI>Fry the BUM !!
<LI>too many black jurors
<LI>A First Class Circus!!
<LI>O.J. is 100% NOT INNOCENT!!!
<LI>I hate marcia clark!!!
<LI>What a zoo! It's so obvious he's guilty!!!
<LI>he's guilty,was not planned,crime of passion
<LI>Go Peter Neufield!!!
<LI>We MUST revamp the justice system in America.  This proves it beyond any reasonable doubt!
<LI>Fuhrman needs to be indicted
<LI>Disgustingly slow way to speedy trial.
<LI>Just kill O.J and save some time. 
<LI>it is a farce it has turned into the Furman trial
<LI>The trial is becoming a circus!
<LI>This trial is a farse because they already said they wouldn't seek the death penalty if found guilty.
<LI>i am sick of hearing about the whole thing.
<LI>It's too long!
<LI>Only in AMERICA......GOD BLESS !!!!!!
<LI>The gloves didn't fit!
<LI>TV DISTORTS
<LI>hang the bastard
<LI>Can anyone really believe he's innocent??!!!
<LI>This is not the trial of mark fuhrman!
<LI>Why don't you get gender, race & age for survey
<LI>Finish this travesty of justice!
<LI>Fuhrman's a racist, lawyers suck, OJs Still Guilty
<LI>"A lawyer's profession is to disguise matters."-Sir Thomas Moore, 1516.  Moore must have forseen the Simpson Trial.
<LI>OJ's acting now is worse than in the Naked Gun movies
<LI>It will be a travesty if, due to a racist cop, a killer will go free
<LI>defense lawyers should be de-barred
<LI>It's dragging on too long for anyone to maintain a desire for justice.  What we want now is simply a respite from it all.  A great tactic on the part of the defense team!
<LI>IT'S A JUNGLE OUT THERE!
<LI>Way too much TV coverage
<LI>A definite PROLONGED circus! The man is GUILTY!! Get it over with!!!
<LI>innocent until PROVEN guilty!
<LI>As a European I don't like the system
<LI>This could be the end for the criminal justice system. I think anyone can get off with a few million bucks!!
<LI>Who Cares
<LI>My opinion is that this is a simple case and I don't understand why it takes so  much time to make a decision
<LI>stupid questions!
<LI>money buys freedom.look at Delorean
<LI>I think This trial should be over fast
<LI>Judge Ito's first and enduring mistake was allowing it to be broadcast.
<LI>He is guilty and he is gonna walk.
<LI>What a shame for the families... Guilty, Guilty!!
<LI>May justice be surved!!!
<LI>It's a shame to see this happen to our legal system
<LI>GOOD THING EVERY TRIAL ISN'T LIKE THIS/
<LI>i think this is a waste of taxpayers money
<LI>Alright Already!!!!!
<LI>Mistrial again? Time to abolish the jury-system    
<LI>OJ should just admit he did it, save his money for his kis, and spare all of us from this charade he's pulling.
<LI>I feel the us legal system in NOT working AT ALL
<LI>to exclude racial bias, there should be no black or white jurors.
<LI>This is a disgrace to the American legal system
<LI>too much time wasted at side bar
<LI>The bottom line is OJ will not get convicted.  Whether he is guilty or innocent is not relevent.
<LI>I've solved it!! Ron & Nicole caught OJ having sex with Kato the dog, and well....why do think the dog ain't talking?
<LI>People should be tried on their actions,not race or wealth.
<LI>Marcia Clark - Quit Whinning
<LI>I hope the "dream team" rots in hell with OJ. They know damn well he's guilty, and this bullshit about the Mark Fuhrman tapes is just a ploy to divert the attention away from OJ. OJ was asked if he was willing to take a lie-detector test and he said no because he had"had dreams about killing Nicole" and felt that that would "affect" the results. Doesn't that tell you something? 
<LI>The trial is proving the system to be seriously flawed, and because it is so public, it will result in several systematic changes.
<LI>Nicole caught O J giving Ron a blow-job and he had to kill them both.
<LI>To convict in circumstantial case you need to trust the investigators and evidence. Not here!
<LI>P T Barnum would be proud of the defence
<LI>If Mark Furman is arrested for Purjury....watch how many people he will take with him....The same as the infamous New York State Trooper
<LI>The whole damn thing is a complete farce. This is what our criminal justice system has come to. Kill him!
<LI>I think OJ is guilty, but not the way the prosecution thinks he is.  No way he kills 2 healthy, athletic people on his own with a knife -- there had to be somebody else with him.
<LI>This is a joke!
<LI>Too long; too costly; unfair to a sequestered jury
<LI>I hate the prosecution team.  They whine, they bore, they repeat and they do not know how to properly cross-examine witnesses.
<LI>Free OJ so that he can KILL WHITEY AGAIN!!!
<LI>try the evidence, not Ferman!
<LI>LA will burn if the GUILTY Motherfucker is convicted so, the bastard will walk!!!
<LI>Defense Lawyers don't need 4 yrs SchooL - Just $$$
<LI>way too long
<LI>Judge Ito is like an elevator,everyone gets a ride
<LI>I think it was a BIG mistake to allow television into the courtroom. Sure, it's entertaining, but it has also affected the trial in a big, negative way. I was hoping Ito would be excused ONLY because I hoped that the new judge would have the presence of mind to pull the plug on the TV camera.
<LI>Money talks. OJ Walks.
<LI>VERY ENLIGHTENING
<LI>The truth will never be known.
<LI>Mark Furman lied, he planted evidence, and is an embarrisment to the LA police... he should be forced to resign and even IF OJ is guilty he has tainted the evidence and therefore made a mockery of the court system
<LI>It's a circus !
<LI>cohran should be disbarred
<LI>Whether oj did it is totally illrelavant,the state has to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt,without violating the law, and they have not done that.
<LI>Whether oj did it is totally illrelavant,the state
<LI>A waste of taxpayer money   WAY TOO LONG!
<LI>It's a joke
<LI>its a 3 ring circus. a mockery of the justice system.
<LI>The jury system doesn't work anymore.
<LI>After all the god-damn money that has been spent on this farce of a trial, and now we could have a Mis-trial because of something said against Judge Ito's wife?! Althought it's obvious now that Det. Furhman is racially prejudice, I still feel that OJ did in fact murder Nicole and Ron.  Why the hell don't they simply give OJ some truth serum?
<LI>I feel that the mofia did it cause of drugs and they mistaken Nicole when they meant to get her friend Faye, and I think that some of the moffia is on the L.A. Police Dept.
<LI>A disgrace to the legal profession!!
<LI>It was intereting when it started but now it's moronic
<LI>Theories not supported by evidence should not be allowed!
<LI>DETECTIVE MARK FURMAN SHOULD GO TO JAIL FOR ALL HE IS BEEN SAYING ABOUT OTHER RACES. IF HE CANT DEAL WITH A MULTICULTURAL WORLD THEN THE POLICE STATION IS NOT WHERE HE SHOULD BE. THERE ARE PLACES FOR PEOPLE LIKE HIM.
<LI>turn it off
<LI>Johnny Cockroach and Barry Shithead make a nice couple
<LI>O.J. is guilty, but he'll get off !
<LI>F.Lee Bailey need to wear a girdle, the fat slob
<LI>Has anyone thought about Ron Goldman defending himself by hitting OJ in the nose and causing a nose bleed. Thjs would accout for the many blood drops at the crime scene and there is a chance that OJ did not know his nose was bleeding ?
<LI>would like to get to the verdict soon!!
<LI>I hope a circus like this never happens again
<LI>This trial isn't about race, it's about a domineering, possesive, male chauvinist, who couldn't bear losing control over what he deemed "his property", namely, Nicole. This is nothing new, in fact 54% of women who are killed each year, are murdered by their spouses, either when they leave, or are attempting to leave. Because OJ is famous, handsome and rich, people somehow think that he couldn't possibly have done it. Think again!
<LI>I THINK ITO IS SHOWBOATING
<LI>WHY ASK ABOUT YOUR GOLF CLUBS AS SOON AS YOU HIT LA
<LI>speculation without evidence should NOT be allowed
<LI>Ito should control things more.
<LI>I will be glad when it's over!!!
<LI>he is guilty and if he gets off. God well Know
<LI>I don't know why black people find it so difficult to believe another black person is capable of murder!! White people have no problem realizing that other whites are capable of the exact same thing, so who's being the racist?
<LI>OJ IS INNOCENT, Racist cops conspired with racist DAs and a racist media to frame him.
<LI>all the complaints, yet everyone watches!
<LI>Revelation 14:9:"After the thousand years were ended, Satan was let loose for a little while, and the jury in the OJ Simpson case were allowed to view new DNA evidence....."  This trial is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen in my life!!
<LI>Mark Fuhrman - Grand Poobah of the LA KKK - PLANTED THE GLOVE!  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!!!!!
<LI>If Mark Fuhrman planted the glove, that means that he would have been involved in Nicole's murder. Does anyone really believe that the LAPD has nothing better to do than to sit around going "let's kill a white woman, so we can frame a black man"? Come on people--get with the program and use the brain cells God gave you. 
<LI>MARCIA CLARK IS A WHINING BITCH!!!
<LI>If it were anyone else (say poor, white and not famous, he would be frying right now.
<LI>The evidence against this jerk is overwhelming, and yet this circus continues.  The media just loves it.  Anyone else would have been convicted months ago.  The Dream Team and their Cop Conspiracy are a joke--an insult to normal intelligence.  The most disgusting creature of them all is Kato Kaelin, capitalizing on the death of Nicole.
<LI>O.J. will get to honor a luncheon date with Jimmy Hoffa
<LI>Well? Who killed them?
<LI>The defense should be thrown in jail along with OJ
<LI>Disgusting farce.  Proud to be in different system
<LI>Too LONG!
<LI>joke.can't kill that way w/out blood/injury youself
<LI>Get this crap off TV!!!!!
<LI>Somebody ought to watch the tape of OJ trying on the glove again. He NEVER had the latex glove on....of COURSE the glove wouldn't fit!
<LI>Does anyone remember Nicole and Ron?
<LI>they should fry his ass
<LI>Just end the damn thing so everyone can cash in.
<LI>I hate the OJ Simpson trial!!!
<LI>A sad statement of the legal system.
<LI>Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!
<LI>Please End!!!
<LI>It's a complete mockery of what the search for truth ought to be.
<LI>The defence atts are disgusting. Know he's guilty!
<LI>too long drawnout
<LI>pathetic
<LI>George Carlin once said, "I believe we should all live and let live.  And anyone who won't go along with that should be killed."
<LI>Court TV has received the most benefit
<LI>Judge Ito is giving the Prosecution all of the calls.
<LI>Cochrane works for D
<LI>I can't wait til the trial is over.  That will be the best Christmas present that the media could give the American public.
<LI>If it were me on trial, without O.J.'s considerable financial resources, I'd have served nine months of my life sentence by now!
<LI>I believe OJ is obviously guilty and the cop conspiracy theory is ridicules.
<LI>OJ will walk, but he can't hide
<LI>I believe he is absolutely 100% GUILTY but he'll be walking around a free man in a few months just like nothing ever happened.
<LI>evidence is tainted or nonexistant. Marcia is a brat.
<LI>It seems that if a black person is accused of killing a white person, it's labeled a 'conspiracy' by whites, even though all the evidence shows that he's guilty! But if a white man kills a black man, then it's deemed that all whites are out to get blacks! OJ is guilty, any fool can see that--I say fry him
<LI>IT COOL
<LI>The guy will fry, if not here on the street.
<LI>Hey Kato, can you say 'duuhh?' Who is he leaching off of these days?
<LI>Why don't they question O.J. about the knife he bought?
<LI>I think that the only reason OJ is making the headlines is because to white people were killed. Had he killed a black person, I don't think it would have played in media as much. I really think that this country has this thing about a white person's life being worth more. It's a sad thing to say, but being black kind of gives me that inside view.
<LI>A big cost in time/money for what will be a waste of time for everyone in the end, especially since he is a celebrity.
<LI>Spending to much time and money on guilty defendent
<LI>I feel that the prosecution presented alot of circumstantial evidence that points towards O.J.  However, the defense has done a good job showing reasonable doubt.  I do believe that it will be a tough decision for the jury.
<LI>Islamic justice has its merits.
<LI>If he weren't a celebrity, he'd be on death row by now. A black man killing a white woman? Hell, in some states a black man _talking to_ a white woman is a capitol offense.
<LI>just afarts
<LI>OJ is the SKUM of the earth! ZI hope he rots in hell
<LI>Shit or get off the pot!! This trial's too long!!
<LI>Answer to #16: all of them
<LI>this trial sucks so bad!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Answer to #16: all of them
<LI>I think its amazing that this has turned into such an event.
<LI>Until Lawyers are sworn in, justice is not certain
<LI>They need to speed it up!
<LI>if they can't find oj guilty then free manson
<LI>Lee Harvey Oswald did it, he had help from Elvis
<LI>The media should mind their own business!!!!
<LI>It is dumb
<LI>This trial has lasted WAY too long - he should have been found guilty awhile ago - it's all racial.
<LI>shortcomings of ourjustice system
<LI>We need other general info on WEB; detectives, etc
<LI>Fiy OJ!!
<LI>OJ had the means, motive & oportunity & no alibi
<LI>PUKE CITY
<LI>The defense is proving that if they blow enough smoke they can hide the truth.
<LI>It was the tow truck driver
<LI>Free OJ!!!!
<LI>The defense lawyers are all guilty for defending IJ, the murderer
<LI>If OJ is guilty he should pay the govt's costs!
<LI>He didn't kill the devil
<LI>We should have a verdict by the year 2000!!!
<LI>It should have been over 4 months ago!
<LI>I'm glad o.j.is finally doing some time for beating his wife!!!!
<LI>Disgusting/sad, yet enthralling.  If this trial had taken place before television, the newspapers would have been on it non-stop.  Mass media today (to its credit ] and to its discredit) have turned this into a circus.
<LI>...make it go away...
<LI>THE BROWN FAMILY, particularly DENISE have acted like slimy MEDIA WHORES since this whole thing started.  THEY SHOULD BE IN JAIL WITH OJ.
<LI>The look on O.J. Simpson's face the majority of the time shows the guilt that lies underneath, especially when he displayed such amazement and then glee when the glove was too tight, doesn't that tell you something?
<LI>BITTER WHITE BITCH PROSECUTOR, UNCLE TOM ASSISTANT DA, CROOKED FEDS AND RACIST COPS LIKE MARK VERMIN . . . ARE THEY CAPABLE OF FRAMING A BLACK MAN?  YOU BET YOUR ASS THEY ARE!!!  NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE!!!  FREE OJ!!!
<LI>This trial really pisses me off! It sucks!
<LI>This is yet another sick example of European-Americans oppressing African-American men. 
<LI>Please God! Let it end!!!!!
<LI>Johnny Cochrane? is for the Defense
<LI>frustrating
<LI>it sucks.  Give Juice the Juice!
<LI>Innocent until proven guilty it's ani't over til it's over
<LI>Because OJ is famous, he'll never get a fair trial
<LI>I've learned more about the law from this than anything I've ever seen.  What I've learned scares me!
<LI>IT'S A JOKE, O.J. IS AS GUILTY AS SIN!!!!
<LI>he's guilty,   he'll walk because of who he is.
<LI>It is way too long and expensive.  How is the State going to afford this Trial?
<LI>OJ IS INNOCENT!!  IF OJ WERE WHITE HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN ARRESTED.  I FEAR THE ACTIONS OF WHITE RACIST LA COPS COULD CAUSE ANOTHER UPRISING IN LA IF HE IS FOUND GUILTY.
<LI>is it over yet? is it over yet? is it over yet?
<LI>NICOLE BROWN-hyphen-SIMPSON was a coke sniffing slut.  Her family are a bunch of leaches who bled OJ and now are sucking $$ out Nicoles death.  The BROWN famil makes me sick
<LI>If this wasnt Oj the trial would be over!
<LI>It's better than mosts soaps on daytime TV!
<LI>If you think OJ is innocent, then you're either a racist, stupid, or both!
<LI>i hope he did it-hope he walks-hope he is 4 hire !
<LI>The Dream Team is lying slime. I'd respect OJ a lot more if he didn't endores their tactics, even as a murderer.
<LI>none
<LI>THIS IS THE MOST ABSURB TRIAL I EVER SEEN 
<LI>the fact that O.J did not have a cut when he flew to chicago indicate any blood of his found definetly came from somewhere else
<LI>superceding everything else said o.j. is innocent
<LI>should not be on tv, should have been over by now.
<LI>OJ'S JUSTICE WILL BE HIS LAWYERS FEES
<LI>OJ'S LIFE IS AT STAKE NOW. HE NEEDS TO TAKE THE STAND.
<LI>This trial sucks!
<LI>its costing too much money, get it over with NOW
<LI>Imagine the productive messages that could be transmitted over all that air time being taken up by the trial!

<LI>Its sad that if you have money and if you don't ?
<LI>It's a joke
<LI>Get over with.
<LI>If this involved anyone other than OJS it'd be over.
<LI>The camera does not belong there.
<LI>It SUCKS!  Netwoeks, get a new line up, 'cause your losin' ratings!
<LI>It's sick to see the system work like this.
<LI>I believe the Jurors will come in with a hung-jury due to racial bias
<LI>waste of time
<LI>They should stop television coverage
<LI>hurry and get it over with.
<LI>If it were you or I on trial, we'd be on death row right now
<LI>boring
<LI>The judge is incompetent, he does not control the lawyers as he should.
<LI>NICOLE TRADED HER LIFE FOR MONEY AND AFTER ALL IT IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.
<LI>He maybe innocent, and is so until *proven* guilty
<LI>I do notthink the trial should have be on TV to begin with.  Had they not put it on TV, it would be over by now.
<LI>It's an embarrassment to America, that people can become famous for being associated with a multiple murder, Kato should get the chair
<LI>I find it difficult to believe that anyone with normal intelligence can doubt his guilt!
<LI>It's pathetic and I'm sick of it.  End it now!
<LI>Follow the Homolka/Bernardo trials in Ont/Canada to see a more acceptable/less media controlled contraversial murder trial.
<LI>The waste of money on this farce sickens me.
<LI>in a word..a circus
<LI>It should be taken off the air immediately.
<LI>You have J Cockrane on survey as (P) he is (D) !!!
<LI>If this is "liberty" give me DEATH.......
<LI>It's between OJ and God.  Only God will judge!
<LI>The trial is on T.V. way too much.
<LI>It is great that americans get to see this slow legal system in action.
<LI>Hope it never ends.
<LI>The prosecution is lousy and the police are worse.
<LI>where is o.j.oldest son?
<LI>world wide our justice system stinks!!!!!!!
<LI>The truth will make sense,but I haven't heard it yet.
<LI>they will never get a verdict
<LI>WHEN FOUND GUILTY HOW LONG FOR THE APPEALS??
<LI>BORRRRRING!
<LI>O.J. sucks a big one!
<LI>Make the execution as public as the trial, as a deterrent to future criminals.
<LI>Cops can't organise days off, let alone conspiracy!
<LI>Hang Him
<LI>It's close to being a fair trial, now let's hang him!
<LI>An international disgrace. Logic has flown this coop.
<LI>Wish I knew what REALLY happened that night.
<LI>too dragged out
<LI>O.J. is a killer and he deserves to get fried.
<LI>I am SOOOOO sick of it!
<LI>It is stupid. Things like that happen every day. Why is it special because a former football player is a suspect?
<LI>It's a bunch of B.S.
<LI>O.J and Susan Smith should be fried together, now!
<LI>Marcia Clark is HOT!!!
<LI>He's guily as sin.
<LI>I think Judge Ito is a wuss.
<LI>Nicole is framing O.J.
<LI>Defense tactics are indefensable
<LI>I wish I was on Court TV
<LI>This trial glamourizes the death of two innocent people
<LI>I think our justice system looks very sad!
<LI>I think its a sad day for our justice system
<LI>It is not the search of the truth just winnning or losing what is important
<LI>please spell names correctly next time
<LI>He's guilty beyond reasonable doubt!
<LI>O.J. is Guilty
<LI>Frankly you should look at the Paul Bernardo trial here in Canada to see how trials of infamous crimes should be done. Your media should not have been allowed to report on the trial before it even started.
<LI>Definitely should not be televised!
<LI>The clothing fibers belonging to Simpson found at the murder scene could not get there unless he was there.
<LI>O.J is guilty! Ba-ba-booey to y'all!
<LI>Undecided until testimony frm lawyer on plane
<LI>Could you imagine if OJ wasn't a celebrity?? Maybe he would have been put to death by now?
<LI>It is a complete waste of all viewers time. Every one involved is there for their own personal gain, except OJ, who has no choice, other than he should not hve committed the murders.
<LI>This has shown the worst side of our system & we need to demand reform.
<LI>Way To Long A Waste Of Tax Payers Money
<LI>For better or worse, (our legal system) the best around.
<LI>money will set O.J. free
<LI>Black rich personable athlete -- can't lose. Sad!
<LI>The trial should be fair but O.J. is famous
<LI>ojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojjojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojojoj
<LI>hey! guess what! I farted!
<LI>This was never a trial of race, and the defense should be punished for using it. This is a cas of MURDER!
<LI>I think the general media is very biased!
<LI>He's guilty, but will get off.
<LI>The "wham-bam" defense never materialized.
<LI>it's taking up to much quality air time for other shows like----well just other shows darnet!
<LI>it shows how lame our legal system is.
<LI>sorriest excuse for american justice i've seen.
<LI>BULLSHIT!!!
<LI>THE DEFENSE IS BEING RUN BY THE CLIENT.
<LI>Great example of how bad the US court system is
<LI>It doesn't matter anymore, he has paid w/ $ & time
<LI>will be happy when it's over to see OJ in prison
<LI>The trial is a farce! We'll never know the truth!
<LI>the poor jury
<LI>So Much for Justice
<LI>The Dream Team and this Trial are a disgrace to the Legal Profession
<LI>A shame for the world to see
<LI>the trial should have been over a long time
<LI>he is guil;ty as it gets
<LI>This has been the biggest waste of money I've ever seen.
<LI>I am white Idahoan, that feels the Pros. has no integrity.
<LI>ALL THE EVIDENCE POINTS TO OJ BEING GUILTY. DNA ESPECIALLY
<LI>Restoring public confidence in the legal system may not be possible after this!
<LI>If O. J. is not guilty why did he run!
<LI>Just a BIG MONEY MAKING SCAM !!!!!!!!!!$$$$$$$$$$$
<LI>Power and money give defendants special treatment.
<LI>I's a joke!!
<LI>SEND THOSE 2 JEWISH SHISTERS BACK TO NEW YORK!
<LI>to long
<LI>The OJ trial has more than cost Los Angeles County.  If they were SMART, they'd deliver a verdit by the end of August and let California get back to "normal".
<LI>the judge should not allow this media circus.
<LI>LOT'S OF BUCKS BEING SPENT-HOPE THERE'S NO RETRIAL
<LI>The trial has so much coverage it's turning into a m
<LI>I believe there will be a hung jury with no chance of a fair trial
<LI>Everyone's guilty of something in this trial, but OJ's the guiltiest.
<LI>o.j. will never be convicted because of his race
<LI>Too many defense theories. OJ will have to take stand.  Defense is trying to confuse jury into hung jury.
<LI>re #7 - defense just starting case presentation!  Can't say one over the other coz hasn't happened yet!
<LI>Its a circus!  It should NEVER have been allowd on Television!
<LI>IT SUCKS!!!!!!
<LI>The trial has been interesting to follow.
<LI>Juice the Juice.
<LI>Best lawyer is the prosecutor who cross-examined the County Medical Examiner - he did his homework on his portion of the case.
<LI>While I would not like OJ to take any woman I like out (I dont trust him) I dont think the prosecution can defend the citizens of the state the police are just as bad.  If Oj is guilty prove it fairly, this is not what I have seen.
<LI>The Media is the single biggest problem with this trial.
<LI>Sad.
<LI>they are all poopie heads-they're all OK
<LI>Give me a break. Get it over with-let the man go or convict him.
<LI>The Brown family are a bunch of leaches!
<LI>Why isn't the glove cut in the same place where OJ's finger is?
<LI>Marcia Clark is a f****** BITCH!!!
<LI>DENISE BROWN is a SLEAZY lying, money grubbing SLUT, Just like NICOLE was.
<LI>a waste
<LI>It is to long
<LI>IT'S AN INSULT TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM
<LI>The cameras should have been pulled out long ago!
<LI>He is guilty, but some evidence was planted
<LI>that last man was a genius
<LI>the whole thing gives me a very sad view of mankind
<LI>It is a bunch of BS!
<LI>OJ rules! I love OJ!
<LI>The defense should be ashamed of theirselves.
<LI>take it off the damn television
<LI>This whole thing just proves that you only have to be rich and famous in America and you can get away with murder.  (comment from an African-American, middle class woman)
<LI>Get it over with already!
<LI>A landmark case that will change our legal system.
<LI>Convict him and get it over with.
<LI>THIS HAS TO BE KILLING SOAP OPERA RATINGS.
<LI>WHY DO THEY NEED MEDIA IN THE TRIAL?  I HATE IT!!!
<LI>Televised trial is a FARCE
<LI>How could a man who starred in Naked Gun 1, 2, 3 have it in his heart to kill someone
<LI>get off TV, It should have taken only 4 weeks
<LI>Kato rules!!!
<LI>unbeliveable
<LI>They should all be on trial.
<LI>If not O.J., then who?
<LI>hopefully he gets what he deserves. He's guilty.
<LI>NICOLE GOT WHAT SHE DESERVED.  SHE WAS A COKE SNIFFING TRAMP AND AN UNFIT MOTHER.  GOLDMAN WAS A QUEER, SO WHO CARES ABOUT HIM?
<LI>FBI Agent changed story,adds to conspiracy
<LI>Hey MARCIA - "Show us your tits!"
<LI>The Media Has Swallowed this case and I
<LI>I'm very, very sick of it!
<LI>it absolutely sucks
<LI>money beats the truth
<LI>the whole thing is a  farce! ! 
<LI>it's a joke
<LI>Hey!!!  Chris Darden!!!  WASH YOUR FACE YOU BUM!!!
<LI>if common person on trial we'd been dead already
<LI>This trial show's you what money can do.
<LI>Get this charade over with!
<LI>OJ will walk, hung jury. Case closed. No new trial because they cant get another jury.
<LI>It is sick to see the white man attack and frame yet another African-American - NO JUSTICE, NO PEACE - FREE OJ.
<LI>The evidence is overwhelming...GUILTY!!!
<LI>It's a bunch of crap and shouldn't be on TV.
<LI>It has become a circus.  I believe TV should never have been allowed in the court room.  Ito is just barely competant.  LAPD evidence technicians should be fired.
<LI>It amazes me that OJ can sit there and put his family, friends, victim's family and the public through such a long and expensive ordeal knowing he did it.  It's all about self-preservation in the most despicable way possible.
<LI>I am in the field of Genetics, and He's Guilty!!!
<LI>who else could have done it? It's so obvios that he is guilty
<LI>Simply a disgusting, drawn-out pile of crap
<LI>ALAN IS A JOKE WITH HIS COPS PLANTING THE GLOVE STORY
<LI>I'm sick of minoritys using claims of racism as an excuse for any crime, no matter how violent.
<LI>time and money is being wasted
<LI>I think O.J. stalked Nicole and saw Ron kill her and then killed Ron.  It's possible!
<LI>Give him the Chair!
<LI>Race card should NOT be used!  Dangerous in LA.
<LI>Why did it only take 2-1/2 hours for Susan Smith and so darn long for him?
<LI>The trial is taking up to much time, for the media
<LI>fry O.J.
<LI>Without Simpson's "Celebrity" status and Cochran's "Race Card," the trial would be history.
<LI>This whole thing insults your intelligence.
<LI>too long
<LI>anyone not seeing OJ's guilt is either starstruck,naive ,stupid or a racist
<LI>Hes guilty
<LI>I THINK IT'S GETTING OUT OF HAND.AND MAKING GOOD RATINGS
<LI>very interesting
<LI>The BROWN FAMILY are a bunch of disgusting MEDIA WHORES and liars!!!!
<LI>You can get away with murder, if you have enough $.
<LI>MARCIA CLARK: M E G A   B I T C H ! ! !
<LI>Judge EATO is an embarrasment to the State of California - He doesn't have the BALLS to keep the prosecution in line!
<LI>It's an embarrassment to our legal system, and a burden to CA tax payers
<LI>OJ is being framed by white racist cops, a white racist DA's office and an Uncle Tom named Christopher Darden.  FREE OJ!!!!
<LI>IF HE WERE AN ORDINARY MAN - LOCK HIM UP  
<LI>What a joke! Equal justice, my rear end!
<LI>We need professional juries or no juries
<LI>If your rich your innocent
<LI>Waste of taxpayers money!
<LI>ito-shave, marcia-shave, nicole-deepest apologies oj-dump shaperio and hire gump.
<LI>I think this trial has gotten way out of hand.  Simpson is so guilty.
<LI>OJ is obviously guilty.  Just gas him!!
<LI>It demonstrates the sad state of consciousness of this country.
<LI>It's boring. Leave O.J. alone, he's suffered enough!
<LI>Prosecution-Johnnie Cockroack, Marcia Crap, Chris Poophead
<LI>He did not do it!
<LI>EVERYONE WHO IS MAKING A BUCK OFF IT SHOULD HAVE TO LOOK AT THE AUTOPSY PHOTOS.
<LI>I think this whole trial is a disgrace to the Brown and Goldman family's and it also shows the public how we cannot rely on the justice system to protect us!
<LI>This proves that if you have money you get control
<LI>Ms Sullivan E entertainment Channnel sucks
<LI>Dirty LA cops frame another black man.  I'm not surprised.
<LI>massive media beat up
<LI>A distraction from attn. to our getting screwed
<LI>NICOLE SIMPSON's family, the BROWNS, are DISGUSTING SCUM TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF NICOLES DEATH LIKE THEY MADE MONEY OFF OF OJ!
<LI>It is unimportant compared to other things in life.
<LI>the defense-f. lee poop, rob shitpiro,alan desintegrating,hank goldass, barry shit 
<LI>I think O.J is a killer and he is guilty
<LI>OJ is as guilty as hell, so just gas the crappy,cruddy, freaky ass 
<LI>the whole stupid trial is just crap so just kill him
<LI>WHITE WOMAN AND WHITE MAN GET KILLED.  FIND THE MOST CONVENIENT BLACK MAN AND FRAME HIM. It must be in the LAPD handbook!!
<LI>People have been given the death penalty on a lot less evidence!
<LI>IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IS COMING UP.  SOME SAY THAT THE MOFIA IS INVOLVED AND OTHERS SAY IT COULD BE THE CIA ONCE AGAIN.
<LI>The KeySotne Cops would have done a better job
<LI>It's an abomination, remove it from TV.
<LI>When is it going to end!
<LI>Stoooop! Please No More FUCKING OJ I can take it anymore
<LI>I wish they would all SHUT UP!!!
<LI>it's a total crook.  the media has turned it into a circus
<LI>Free OJ!  Fry OJ! Free OJ! Fry OJ!
<LI>Yet another example of how THE MAN continually OPPRESSES the brothers and sisters......(even though he's guilty)
<LI>It's very excitting
<LI>Defense is bringing up waaay too many different scenarios for what really happened.
<LI>Redundancy puts you to sleep
<LI>LAPD set OJ up, everyone can see that!
<LI>correct!!!
<LI>It really sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Its very sad to see that because some one is arrested for a crime...they are automatically convicted by the media.
<LI>WHITE COPS FRAMED OJ -  CASE CLOSED!!!
<LI>WHO'S HOUSE IS KATO STAYING AT NOW???????
<LI>Kill the bastard and his lawyers!
<LI>DNA is about as accurate as TEA LEAVES or Palm Reading.
<LI>We should chuck it and start a new one in a few years.
<LI>I'm surprised more Blacks don't think he's guilty.
<LI>he is guilty
<LI>Will it ever end?!!!?
<LI>They should NEVER have let tv cameras in the courtroom!
<LI>I know he did it; it will be very hard to prove
<LI>Dream team...more like barf bag team!
<LI>I HOPE ITS OVER SOON
<LI>you've spelled Mr. Sheck's name incorrectly!
<LI>The O.J. trial is American capitalism.  Money
<LI>Our Justice System is a farce!!!
<LI>Trial is too drawn out and waffley
<LI>Where does KATO sleep these days????
<LI>This is a good time for Black Americans to show they are not biased,and look only at the facts.
<LI>it's stupid and of course he's guilty.
<LI>Viewers should see all photos, hear sidebars.
<LI>What is OJ is guilty despite a racist cop force?
<LI>Why didn't OJ go ballistic when they arrested him if he didn't do it?
<LI>Good luck OJ,  we LOVE you (still)
<LI>I cannot believe anybody even gives a rats ass!
<LI>O.J. should've sot himself when he had the chance.
<LI>I like listening to the lawers argue motions rather than listen to them question witnesses.
<LI>Domestic violence should be the main issue, not race.       
<LI>Next time NO TV cameras
<LI>It has only proved to be the most racially divisive event since I was born in 1968 -- it is truly an American farce/tragedy.   
<LI>Everyone is trying to exploit the situation
<LI>Get a rope.:-/ This town did hang killers once.
<LI>youpil
<LI>Ugh.
<LI>It shows just how corrupted our justice system is.
<LI>WE LOVE OJ IN BEAVERTON OR.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>your o.j. survey is very one sided. did Marcia make it?
<LI>DEF. ACT PROFECCIONAL AND STICK TO THERE CASE, WERE AS THE PROSS. JUMP AROUND AND CRY IF IT DOESN'T GO THERE WAY
<LI>O.J. had a helper
<LI>It seems like everyone is on trial except for OJ.
<LI>The money being generated from this exploitation should be used pay teachers so that they make more money than laywers; more people would be smarter and wouldn't act like stupid lemmings, intoxicated by the media sensationalism.

<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>dont squeeze the juice mother fucker
<LI>OJ is guilty
<LI>Money bought him freedom and an uneducated jury
<LI>It was all race and money that let him win.
<LI>oj is guilty but the best of the state blew it he is/should be completely exonerated and not be subject to the "double jeaoperdy" he now faces.
<LI>WHY DON`T THEY LET THE  TRIAL DIE  OK TI`S OVER.  
<LI>The jury was not tuned to the real issue of justice
<LI>What a farce!!  He did it and now thumbs his nose at the world!
<LI>I think the verdict in the trial was correct. A lot of people particulary white people don't give the jury the credit they deserve.  They said they were incompetant and were only trying to get back at the LAPD.  This Jury did the best with the evidence they were given, not to mention the defence team was excellent while the prosecution sucked!  I am very happy that O.J. Simpson won this trial and hopefully will realize that white people are crazy, vengeful, rude, intolerant, and they also have no faith
  I am glad the man or the Black man got something in his favor for once.
<LI>I don't understand why the media thought a considerable portion of viewers wanted to see and hear about O.J. at least once during most of our waking hours.
<LI>I think it is sad that a murderer walks the streets today due to ruthless tactics made by the defense
<LI>when i say that race was a factor, I mean that if the jury had NOT acquitted him, they would have been accused of racism
<LI>O J Simpson was guilty without question!! The verdict was atravisity of justice.
<LI>I've come up with a few theories on this.  A.C did it to frame O.J; Ron killed Nicole so O.J killed him; the dog did it; O.J stalked and killed Nicole and upon finding her with Ron, killed him too.
<LI>I have always believed in OJ's innocence.
<LI>The evidence is against him,  the civil trial will prove this,  a quick message to OJ: "What goes around,  comes around,  and yours is just about due"
<LI>MEDIA IS WHY OJ WAS THOUGHT TO BE GUILTY
<LI>oj did not murder anyone, however HE does know who did.!!!
<LI>OJ  killed the mother of his children, and got away with it !
<LI>orchestrated coverup of cia involvement in drugs in la  and police compliance with the cia    coverup  headed up in  d.c.
<LI>I live Brentwood, I avoid him at all cost..he got away with murder
<LI>The legal SYSTEM itself works.  It wasn't meant to be perverted by crybaby jurors, liberal lawyers, and corrupt politicians who are more scared of riots than seeing justice served.
<LI>It is my hope that somehow, these comments get to both OJ and the members of the prosecution and defense teams involved. It is hoped that Judge Ito will seriously review and institute practices of control in the courtroom.  Had this been done from the beginning, I don't think the trial might have been quite the media circus that it was, nor would the main issue of the trial have been so fragmented.  I think televised trials are beneficial, but not when the Judge cannot control his own courtroom.  In th
s instance, Judge Ito has done more to shake my faith in the justice system than any legal representative present.
<LI>Guilty people are not always convicted.  I think he was guilty but he had a fair trial and was found not guilty.  We can't judge the justice system on one case.
<LI>I have learned it is next to impossible to form an educated opinion from just the data you receive from the press, there is always a twist or false information given.
<LI>The verdict indicates,to me, how wide the division between races is in this country.  Blacks still think he is innocent, whites still think he is guilty.
<LI>This survey is outdated. I thought you were talking about the current civil trial. I think O.J. got away with murder. Before I thought he did it himself. Now I think he may have planned it and had the assistance of Al Cowlings . I think his older son knew SOMETHING and was keeping it secret because he wanted to protect his father. His son's demeanor after the verdict was announced seemed peculiar, he was very emotional & looked distracted(because he had something bothering his conscience perhaps?) 
<LI>no
<LI>The prosecution did not prove beyond all reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty, so the jury could not convict.  However, I don't believe that this means the defendant was innocent.
<LI>I think it's sad that the jury felt OJ was one of them, since he's not lived as a black man since high school, and I feel he and Johnnie Cochran used the race card in the worst way.  It isn't fair to good black people.  Also, I think OJ needs to face up to what he's done, but he's always gotten away with everything.  If LAPD is guilty of anything, it's that they never arrested him before, and he thought he could just do anything he wanted and he'd get away with it.  And he did!
<LI>The main point why the thing become so popular is not if OJ killed Nickol but if one can get through through the trial just because he is A. black  B. rich  C. famous .
<LI>Millionaires have rarley ever been conviced of murder.
<LI>shocked by media bias and sloppy reporting
<LI>the justice system is not about guilt or innocense but about winning the case. poor people are in jail and the rich are free
<LI>Stuipid.Ihate O.J.Iwill not even drink ornge juice no more.deat h to O.J.
<LI>were all in trouble
<LI>IF ITWAS ANYBODY ELSE, THE TRIAL WOULD HAVE ENDED MUCH SOONER THEN IN THIS SAD DEMONSTRATION OF OUR NATION'S LEGAL SYSTEM.
<LI>IT'S A SHAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>O.J. had to go free under American law, but the trial was a travesty of justice. People should read "Guilty" by Judge Harold J. Rothwax for more info on the collapse of American justice. 
<LI>This trial was a complete setback for both race relations and the U.S. justice system.
<LI>I think O.J. was a rich, sly man who weasled his way through the system.
<LI>that the planting of the glove was even allowed to be brought into court when there was only  one ever seen at the at the bundy scene.too many unsubstantiated theories allowed in the court case. This only distracts the jury from dealing with the facts of the case.
<LI>As a law student, I understand the defense's purpose. I now truly am disqusted with OJ as a person. As C. darden summed it up, "He will one day face up to the truest judge."
<LI>I can't believe that bastard got away with double murder.  I hope he knows he will burn in eternal hell for what he's done.
<LI>Ummm no comment
<LI>I think it's pretty obvious to anyone what occurred here, but it's too politically incorrect to talk about on the Internet.
<LI>The whole process sucked.
<LI>This whole thing has been blown out of proportion.  O.J. Simpson was acquitted the first time because he's O.J. SIMPSON!  That is the only reason.  If he were some unknown black man, he'd be on death row right now, whether he did it or not!
<LI>OJ didit and i think that slick johnny confused the jury and had no chose to rule the way they did.
<LI>Die OJ Die
<LI>don't squeeze the juice, baby!
<LI>the trial was dumb
<LI>Uh, the flaming goat of the ancient sun god Ra has declared this web page sanctified ground.
<LI>pickles are a man best freind
<LI>O.J. is GUILTY.  Anyone who says he is innocent is either uninfomed, an idiot, or a racist.  Hopefully he will lose the civil trial.
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!!!!!!!
<LI>I got tired of hearing about the stupid trial, O.J's guilty send him to prison
<LI>Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty, Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilty,Guilty , Guilty, Guilty, Guilt
<LI>This trial was conspiracy. O.J. is a guilty mother fucker, lets give him the electric chair.   "Juan Valdez"
<LI>even if the jury would have had a 10 x 12 glossy of oj doing the deed. they still would have found him not guilty.
<LI>O.J. Simpson should be castrated and forced to eat his genitals and then drawn and quartered.
<LI>why is there no cut in the gloves that o.j. was supposed to be wearing during the murders???
<LI>never have so many lies and liars been together in the same room
<LI>O.J. is not Guilty!  He was even found Not-Guilty.  The media is going out of control!  Get it guys he is N-O-T G-U-I-L-T-Y!!!
<LI>Justice has not been served!!!!!!!
<LI>O.J. can suck my big johnson
<LI>THE JUDICAL SYSTEM FAVORS THE RICH NOT RACE.
<LI>Until O. J. Simpson became a suspect--"the sole murderer" I really believed a person in this country was innocent until found guilty by a jury of his peers.  He was found not guilty but the jury which found him not guilty has simply been ignored by Clark, Garcetti, many  people in the media, etc.  I have had many young adult foreign exchange students live in my home for many years.  They ask lots of questions about our country--until Simpson became a suspect I always told the students thar in this coun
ry a person is innocent until proven guilty.  I don't have any idea how to answer questions about our legal system--a new aspect of which includes the D. A.'s ability to announce over national T.V. the guilt of a person who hadn't even seen a court room yet.  I'm very confused about how the prosecution, news media, etc. have been allowed to judge Simpson regardless of the jury's finding.What happened to words like 'alleged'.  I think 
<LI>I wish that some of these o.j. suporters would start looking at the evidence and not just the wild acusations and impossible theories of the defence.
<LI>HOPEFULLY THE CIVIL TRIAL WILL PROVE O.J. GUILTY
<LI>Who cares who killed Nicole!  She was a tramp and everyone knew it!
<LI>i believe because o.j. had money and could afford the best lawyers that is why he got off. Also got off because he is a big ex-football star.
<LI>JUSTICE IS FOR THE RICH.  THE LAW IS TO CONTROL THE POOR.
<LI>The evidence was so obvious! The defence had only theories-- no proof of anything.  Fuhrman should have been out of the force if he was a racist but noone proved to me he planted a thing.
<LI>The media's participation was unfortunate- especially 4 the victims!
<LI>THE ENTIER FUCKING BROWN FAMILY SHOULD HANG FOR LEACHING OF OJ WHEN NICOLE WAS ALIVE AND NOW LEACHING OF THE PUBLICITY OF NICOLS DEATH.  AND . . FRED GOLDMAND SHOULD SHUT HIS FUCKING MOUTH.  I'M SICK OF HEARING THAT FUCKING JEW!!
<LI>Stop beating a dead horse.
<LI>money talks bull- - - -  walks
<LI>Sue LAPD
<LI>no answer!!!
<LI>Truth is a moving target, hairs to split and pieces that don't fit, how can anybody be enlightened, truth is afterall, so damn poorly lit...
<LI>I hope they hang him in the Civil trial !!!
<LI>I guess money can buy freedom 
<LI>Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.
<LI>This  would have been a simple homicide case, if everyone hadn't been  playing  to the camera.  I believe the media played a much greater role in this case than they should have been allowed.
<LI>I wish that someone would do the same thing to OJ as he did but even worse.  I can't wait the day that he meets his "maker" and he sends hime straight to hell were he belongs!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Largely uninterested, but OJ is clearly guilty as sin
<LI>it was media circus
<LI>Hang in Chris. Try to get under allen's skin!
<LI>THE PROSECUTION WA "OUT LAWYERED - THE DEFENSE WERE ALOT SMARTER - PETERS PRINCIPLE APPLIES TO THE PROSECUTION  THEY [P] SURE DID BOTHCH THE CASE  I AM NOT A LAWYER BUT I FELT EMBARRASED FOR THEM THE PROSECUTION
<LI>This was a sad commentary on our society!!  The saddest part was the people who took a real interest in it--what a bunch of saps!!!!!!!!
<LI>OJ did kill them!  He's a psychotic liar! But with all the evidence left out, the jury was able to find "reasonable doubt".  :(
<LI>I believe that OJ should have been found guilty and sentenced to death row
<LI>I got sick and tired of hearing about it!
<LI>Hello Everybody!!!
<LI><font size=30>OJ KILLED EM ALL!!</font></FONT>
<LI>There was more than resonable doubt. Like Henry Lee said"something is awful wrong"
<LI>OJ Simpson is a two bit hood and a deserves to rot in hell.
<LI>The only thing that I can think of about the OJ Simpson's case  is that the prosection tried to nail OJ using scientific evidence. They did not have concrete proof  that he committed the crime alone and the LAPD  framed  OJ 
<LI>Time-line is all wrong for it to have been O.J. ,Ron would have fought harder if it had been one man should have gotten in some good punches enought to leave a mark or two.,I can't get over the feeling that if they would concentrate on Ron's stabwombs  they might wonder who he was tring  not to hit???
<LI>The media ruined all chance of a fair trial.  Justice was not served.  Evidence should not be dismissed based on technicalities
<LI>What a bunch of crap.  I hope they stick him in the civil trial.
<LI>LAPD  wasted a lot of precious time that could have been used to get the REAL  killers
<LI>Case lost when jury was picked. Nothing could have affected their thinking.
<LI>He got away with murder--Maybe he'll have to pay in the civil trial (I hope so)
<LI>There was a history of abuse by o.j. and is typical in mixed marrages.  They typically end in stalking and murder 
<LI>Guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty - got away with double murder....
<LI>I think the community of Los Angeles was afraid of the outcome if the verdict would of been guilty.
<LI>OJ id it with help from AC, SHUN OJ
<LI>Personnally, I'm glad it's over.  I was getting freaking sick of hearing about it.  Now I get to look forward to ten years of the civil trial.  YAYYYYYYY!
<LI>I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO THE RESULTS OF THE CIVIL TRIAL.
<LI>I hope OJ shoots himself, but misses... and is permanently brain damaged.
<LI>It was a racial circus.  It was not about justice.
<LI>It was long and drawn out.
<LI>If you have enough money, you can get away with murder.
<LI>Mindless mush for the masses, typical of southern california, can't say I care a rat's ass about what happens(ed) to O.J or Nicole!!
<LI>I HOPE I'M WRONG BUT I WONDER WHO THIS SERIAL BUTCHER WILL KILL NEXT.
<LI>If he's not going to pay by serving prison time, having him pay financially will have to do.
<LI>Only the fucking $$$cash won again...
<LI>It was terrible and all a lie.  It was like watching the news of the 96 Election.
<LI>Too much attention has been paid to this event.
<LI>JUSTICE TRULY IS BLIND.  This trial has made us all see that.
<LI>If the gloves didn't fit, he killed her with tight gloves on.
<LI>OJ did it and will burn in hell for this crime!!  Fuck you OJ!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Simpson clearly murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.  If you have any doubt of this, read "Outrage" by Vincent Bugliosi.  It is shocking and disgraceful that an obvious murderer could have been acquitted, regardless of who that murderer is. 
<LI>Prosecution could not put OJ in the Bronco. ( P.s witness's..Kalin,Parks, & the guy walking his  dog at 10:30), all  said the Bronco was NOT on the street's or in the yard between  9:00 & 11:10 that nite. Robin Cotton said blood from Rockingham had from 2 to 50 times more DNA than blood (4 drops) from Bundy.  She said sunlight (UVL) does degrade DNA                                                                                                                                          
<LI>TO ME IT BECAME CLEAR THAT FAME, FORTUNE & RACE OVERRIDE JUSTICE IN THIS COUNTRY.  SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE JURY APPARENTLY DIDN'T FULLY COMPREHEND/UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS PRESENTED AND DIDN'T BOTHER TAKING THE TIME TO FIND OUT.
<LI>Prosecution could not
<LI>I think they should of hung the bastard.
<LI>Its time for America to move on.
<LI>American people should respect juries' decisions
<LI> What was "reasonable" to the jury was "obfuscation" to most
<LI>Race was never an issue to me.  I always hoped he didn't do it until I couldn't help but face the facts that he did do it.
<LI>OJ is a cold-blooded murderer
<LI>Everybody has an opinion on wether O.J. was guilty or not, but I don't think you can really say unless you sat through all the testimony.  This is why we have a "jury of our peers", rather then "Court T.V."
<LI>I think it's nice a rich black man can get the same justice as a rich white man.
<LI>Wake up!  O.J. did it, we have racist cops, a screwy legal system, and freedom that can be bought.  This country is still the greatest, but we *REALLY* have some issues!
<LI>Wake up people OJ Did it !!!!!!
<LI>the LAPD is so incompetant that couldn't frame an guilty man
<LI>It is a darn shame that just because your white people assume your against O.J.  This trial enables police to enter your property without a warrant.  The laws that were in place were there to keep the cops out of our lives without a good reason to be in them!  I am a law abiding citizen, and so was O.J.  What the police did was threw the law out the window then worried about it later.  How would you like to come home and find the police in your house because no one answered the door, so they assumed yo
 were hurt!!  Who's kidding who!
<LI>I hope OJ loses the civil trial but it's still not enough.
<LI>The trial never gave much focus on the the two little victims left motherless, They paid more attention to the Furhman issue.
<LI>It was an interesting teaching tool for my children -- we watched together, researched disagreements and learned a lot about the process of a criminal trial
<LI>O.J is GUILTY!!!!!!
<LI>It was a show not effort to seek truth and justice
<LI>Big joke
<LI>OJ is guilty and most of the people thinking he's innocent feel that he is innoncent because he is black, and as they all know, African-Americans are ALWAYS descriminated against by EVERYONE.
<LI>Too bad we can't convict someone on their actions.  He acted guilty...look at his jestures
<LI>I THINK THE WHOLE THING WAS VERY SAD FOR THE CHILDRENS SAKE
<LI>The Timeline tells it all--he did not have time to commit the murders and the police knew it and I also believe the police had an idea where they should be looking.
<LI>OJ DID IT!
<LI>As sad as it truly is, our justice system worked in the exact way it was designed to.  -- Dave MacKenzie 
<LI>As sad as it truly is, our justice system worked in the exact way it was designed to.  -- Dave MacKenzie 
<LI>Not only is justice blind but she is also ignorant
<LI>The first time your mate shows any signs of violence towards you GET OUT!
<LI>in my opinion the trial proved that in this country a man with enough money can get away with murder
<LI>It was a sad day for women. The verdict was a boost to spousal abuse. 
<LI>A travesty of justice
<LI>SURE IT WAS O J S BLOOD BUT WHO PLANTED IT. 1.5 CC BLOOD WAS MISSING (PIRATA) GOLDBERG DID NOT INVITE DEFENSE TO PIRATAS INTERVIEW
<LI>I THINK THE PROSECUTION BEHAVED OUTRAGEOUSLY AND HOPE THEY CAN LIVE WITH THEMSELVES.  THEY PROBABLY CAN THEY MADE ENOUGH MONEY
<LI>I believe that the main reason for O.J.'s verdict was the fact that the jury was uneducated.  Education is a main concern for this county.
<LI>the prosecution was not ready for trial
<LI>I hated Marcia Clark!!!   I wanted to see her lose her case!   She had way to much hate for OJ.
<LI>I was very disapointed in the verdict
<LI>The timeline testemony proves O.J.s aliby.
<LI>A liar should get the penalty intended for the accused.   (Deuteronomy 19:15-21)  Mark Fuhrman just got a $200 slap, and seems to be insulated thereby from further legal trouble.  Wonderful  how our authorities administer justice equally and fairly!  The crusades for "law and Order" too often degenerate into such circusses and "witch hunts".  Big city, or the "sticks"... LA or Wenatchee, WA, the eager rabble gets its show.
<LI>oj did it
<LI>This trial was a complete mockery of the American justice system. O.J. is an asshole!
<LI>The Jury's NOT GUITLY verdict was racially motivated. 
<LI>The LAPD screwed up the investigation from the beginning. THEY were convinced OJ was guilty and tried to make the evidence fit their case! I'm white and HAPPY OJ is free.
<LI>none
<LI>He was guilty before he was tried and even before all of the evidence was in.
<LI>Too many funny circumstances with the police investigation, therefore reasonable doubt
<LI>Equal justice under the law.  It's an ideal.  Should we try it somehow?
<LI>This case was horrible.  It shows that money can buy anything and everything.  Also, this was not the case of the century.  Anyone who says this is completely ignorant of the past 96 years.
<LI>In now TWO trials, the "majority media" seems to believe that "air tight" justice in a police state will solve society's problems and eliminate their fears.    The legal profe$$ion is "politically correctly" hijacking our basic American freedoms.  Fortunate for OJ he's been relieved of the apppeal process so far,  since many appeals are corrupt "rubber stamps" on cursory convictions of lower courts.  Rednecks and others could save their bullets for the real enemy,  Fuhrerman and his ilk.
<LI>There is something fishy when a detective can walk around a crime scene with a vial of blood taken from a possible suspect.  As to OJ's Bronco drive, it's hard to say what was in his mind, but with a black man's perspective, he may have expected  dirty treatment, and that seems to be borne out out by events since then.  It is also terrifying to me that a tiny piece of tissue, hair,  or whatever so easy to plant by bad-intentioned ones could be what convicts.
<LI>I am amazed at how much interest it garnered.  Most of the people I know who were giving it their undivided attention had little or no intrest in O.J.'s past or football career.  It was primarily grandstanding on the part of the Defense and the complete idiocy of Furhman and the LAPD (i.e. Rodney King) which landed the accquital.  What a poor reflection on the attitudes and intelligence of the American public this whole fiasco has been. 
<LI>This trial brought to painful public view the mindset which packs thousands of innocent into our prisons.  It's a huge waste of scarce resources and a multiple tragedy.  For innocent OR guilty, American "justice" is running on "overload".  Why?  They resort to too many "necessary" shortcuts?  Lawyers have created a profitable mess for themselves.
<LI>The Prosecution Team sucked.  Why wasn't Al Cowlings called? Where did OJ's luggage go?  Why were the blood samples carried back to the crime scene?
<LI>Tonight NBC gave a garbled/confusing update on public opinion regarding O.J.'s verdict.  Whites are swinging his way, and blacks are...?(3 Oct 96)  The prosecution would have been better off with strict adherence to constitution.  They lost my sympathy with the illegal search.  Do it right, then come to trial!
<LI>It's over everyone should go on with their lives
<LI>Anyone who thought that any or all of the black females on the jury would vote guilty in ANY trial  of a black man is not paying close attention to whats going on.
<LI>the trial was a mockery of justice. 
<LI>My hope is that Mr. Simpson's money will be given to others and he will have to  suffer the lose of face and prestige he deserves. I hope he becomes a pennyless nobody. 
<LI>A predominantly black jury will not convict a black person for murdering white people.  I predicted that there would be a hung jury because I knew that the black jurors would ignore the evidence but I did not not think that the whites on the jury would be so timid.  When the white male and one white woman were removed from the jury,  I knew that Simpson would walk.  May that jury rot in hell for this travesty of justice.
<LI>Ito and the prosecution did everything, no matter how sleazy to win. Thank God the jury was not fooled.
<LI>OJ is Guilty, period.
<LI>it was payback
<LI>oj needs to admit he did it and get on with his life.
<LI>The point at which history was truly made was the "white bronco" chase. Now media can pin ANYONE down ANYWHERE for the whole world to see if they so choose. We better hope its not us, because there will be nothing we can do about it. Think about it! ...OJ did it, by the way.
<LI>Waste of money
<LI>race will determine the outcome of the civil trial as well...
<LI>I believe this case is a fasimile of what occurs in court rooms all over the country.  The system is corrupt in many ways.  O J was tried and convicted constantly in the media.  This entire case is symbolic of people who feel the need to pass judgment without thinking calmly about facts.  Too many open questions for me before I could believe he committed these murders.  Police and prosecutors make up a seniro and then manufacture facts to support their fiction.  I pray to God we stop this folly and get
more mature in our system of the law.  
<LI>God will get OJ and those who lie in bed with him
<LI>Money can buy happiness!
<LI>What a bunch of bullshit...  He was guilty as hell and everyone knows it
<LI>This case should have taught us the meaning of " the law suppose, then the law be."  Cases still have to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.
<LI>It just goes to show you, money and fame are power.
<LI>His guilt is nearly as obvious as Dahmers..
<LI>He's guilty, it was a race thing.   That's a no-brainer.  I'm tired of African Americans defending him.  Are they proud of him?  That's a scarey thought!
<LI>I believe that if a man is found not guilty, that no one has the right to try to single-handly ruin a man because the feel that there "opinion" was disproved
<LI>I believe that if all citizens watch the full trial, they would have arrived at a non guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If they only watch the The Rivera show, they would have definitely convicted OJ because of the slanted news reporting.  Rivera is an attorney and knows that the  prosecution did not prove, beyound a reasonable doubt, that OJ was guilty yet he continued to report the happenings of the trial that the jury did not see, thereby causing the non-watching audience to believe that the jury w
s biased and freed OJ because of race.  I think that the jury did an outstanding job.  There was no need for a long deliberation.  There were so many areas that the prosecution did not prove that the jury had an array of non-answered questions that would have caused they to acquit OJ. I think that the criminal justice system review their method for permitting evidence.  Evidence should not be disallowed if submitted late.  The jury has the right to hear all the evidence.   
<LI>sad,very sad.
<LI>HE WILL PAY
<LI>it is sad what happen to nichole and ron, however the case did not prove that oj did the killing. the amount of blood that would have been found would not have been drops here and there it would have been massives of blood. i feel that people are letting their emotions judge instead of common sense.  i do believe oj known something but i do not believe he did the killing.  i also think the goldman's are just trying to get some money, they had not heard from their son in three years, that does not consi
ute a close relationship. get real people deal with facts not  emotions. no one person could have committed those murders. 
<LI>O.J. is guilty of spousal abuse and may know the true identity of the murderer(s), but he is not the one who perpetrated the crime.  There was reasonable doubt as to his guilt.
<LI>The trail shows if someone has enough money they can get away with murder
<LI>RON's Boss, the one with the ponytail hair do, murdered them
<LI>There was no integrity in the verdict. The juror's are just as guilty as OJ!
<LI>I believe O.J. probably did kill Nicole and Ron, probably with the help of someone else, but I agree with the verdict of Not Guilty because I do not believe the Prosecution proved O.J. guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  There was too much doubt raised by the Defense to find him Guilty.
<LI>too much TV coverage
<LI>With all the evidence and the Prosecutions lack of expertise Johnny Cochren did the impossible he got OJ off with a non-guilty verdict.
<LI>To bad there is double jeopardy and he can't be tried again not mater if he admits to it
<LI>We pay the Justice system to seek the whole truth, they did not. They got the verdict they earned... and they should not be paid....
<LI>GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>How can any unbiased person find Simpson not guilty?  I was hoping he was innocent but was convinced otherwise.
<LI>The whole thing was blown up into something it wasn't. There was NO WAY, with the publicity that it could really be a fair trial. People had their minds made up before they ever heard ONE WORD and STILL feel the same way regardless of a trial. There is no way, OJ Simpson will ever be free of this. The American public and the American media have thrown away our rights to a fair trial and to freedom from double jeopardy ( OJ Simpson is now on trial for the SAME CRIME in a civil court!!!) This is a traves
y of American "freedom"!
<LI>He probably did it but I am not certain enough to say Guilty. The people sueing him now should be SHOT, he was declared not guilty, leave him alone.
<LI>Doubt does not mean not guilty.
<LI>oj is the lowest form of life on this planet, except for cochran and bailey
<LI>I believe the whole thing was a travesty, yet I knew what the outcome would be. Regardless of what the jurors may say, it *was* all about racial conflicts.
<LI>This trial was a travesty, and has destroyed any faith I had in the "justice system".
<LI>O.J. SIMPSON IS AS GUILTY AS SIN!!!  The trial turned into an issue of race.  Everyone ganged up on Mark Fuhrman, and he hadn't even killed anyone!  In the end, it became the People vs. Mark Fuhrman, and oh, did someone say something about an . . O.J. Simpson?  Of course he got off.  What else would happen with a black majority jury for a famous black football player?
<LI>When is this search for the "REAL" killer going to start.  Oh, wait a minute, you see him everytime you look in the mirror, don't you OJ.
<LI>GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>Americans need to seriously address the wide gulf between the races or there will soon be utter chaos in the United States.  Already in California, it would appear that juries are unable to arrive at rational verdicts because of all the extraneous racial factors that influence perceptions.
<LI>OJ is as guilty as hell, but from the evidence presented there was reasonable doubt--ITO is a joke
<LI>I hope the Brown's & Goldman's take him for every penny he has in the Civil case.
<LI>Justice is for sale (if you can afford it)
<LI>What a travesty of justice.  Glad I'm not an American.  The jury should hang its collective head in shame!!!
<LI>No one knows for sure what really happened.
<LI>What a farce !!!
<LI>So much for justice for the victims...
<LI>WHEN THE VERDICT CAME IN, I CRIED BECAUSE I BELIEVE HE WAS DEFINATELY GUILTY AND DESRVED TO PAY THE ULTIMATE PRICE, JUST LIKE NICOLE BROWN AND RON GOLDMAN DID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>ALL TV COVERAGE OF TRIALS SHOULD BE BANNED!  The OJ trial was a total zoo!
<LI>Why was the bath water NOT tested for temp.? Where is that picture of the watch Nicole had on taken supposedly at the coroners? 
<LI>a murderer runs free as he trumphed justice by playing the race card
<LI>Had he not been able to afford those lawyers,  he would have never gotten away with it.  
<LI>O.J. may be free now but there will come a day when he will stand before God and answer this charge.  God is the ultimate judge and we will all stand before Him.  He will have the final say concerning us all.  O.J. might have gotten away in this life but our life on earth is just a moment compared to eternity in hell. Let us all be prepared for eternity for with God there is no sin worse than another.  We all need to repent of ours sins.  Otherwise we will be spending a long time with O.J.
<LI>Blown out waste of time
<LI>Oj's GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1!
<LI>Who knows if he did it, it was possibley OJ!, but the evid was so poorly collected and presented, who can believe lying cops, incompetent criminalists and a prosec who embraces  who they know was a racist:mark fuhrman
<LI>I'm truly disappointed with the verdict and I was one that trusted the jury to do the right thing in the face of the overwhelming evidence.  Listening to their reasons, they are nothing more than ignorant fools.
<LI>Prosecution totally screwed this one up. They were too thorough. At least in their production of the prosecution. They  should have been, in hindsight, just brushing on his guilt, the bloodstaines, Fuhrman etc. They went into too much detail, giving the jury too many opportunities to poke a hole. Even at this late date, I am appalled at the decision, and am horrified at the future of our justice system and our Nation.
<LI>OJ has searched every golf course in America for the killer(s), where does he go next?
<LI>The entire exercise is more embarassing than educational. What does it say about American society that we view our legal system as a source of entertainment?
<LI>If Johnny Cochran knows in secret that OJ is guilty then Johnny ought to go to the chamber with OJ...no jail... 
<LI>disgusting
<LI>OJ Simpson is guilty. The whole trial was making a circus out of a tragedy in which 2 people DIED.
<LI>Money and the media buy freedom
<LI>It sucked, They should of never let the T.V in the court room!!!!
<LI>O.J. better always look over his shoulder!  A .308 cal, 168 gr match hollow point might find its mark.
<LI>OJ Simpson was guilty....definately....
<LI>JURY DID A GOOD JOB - THERE WAS REASONABLE DOUBT
<LI>I think O.J. did it, but the defense did their job, by creating "reasonable doubt" and the jury followed instrucions by not convicting him.  The justice system is screwed.
<LI>What still puzzles me,  1. no one actually tried to retrace the route..no one tried to time anything....how long it would take to get to Nicoles's ...how long it would take to commit the murders...where would he have parked? ..too much blood...yet what was found(outside the murder scene) was microscopic...where was all the blood????
<LI>Knowing what DNA is should be a prerequisite for serving on a jury
<LI>Maybe the civil trial will have a different outcome.
<LI>I think it was the biggest and most expencive joke there has ever been
<LI>It was a circus. In view of the actual pre-trial investigation, and the matter of bringing in past offenses, frankly, I'm glad that this trial ended as it did for the civil liberties of the rest of us. Consider being the presumably innocent defendant in a Grand Theft trial and every single on of your petty thefts as a minor were brought up. Or even a theft as an adult that allegedly happened years before and that you were never charged for. Prior investigation or even conviction, and connection, does n
t make a person the only suspect for a current crime. That was the precedent and case law I personally did not want set by the OJ Simpson trial. As an end note, if the investigation "had" found, beyond reasonable doubt that  he was the murderer and the invetigation had not been so botched, eg., mixing DNA samples at the crime scene, then I would have whole-heartedly agreed with a verdict of "Guilty"
<LI>I was surprised and very saddened by the verdict and the reaction in the African-American community.
<LI>Money talks.  Racism in our country spoke LOUDLY via this trial.  The black race must forgive the white race for past mistakes.  Unity is the key to peace.  To vote "Not Guilty" just because the man was black is prejudice in its ugliest form.  Evidence was conclusive.  The whole country is ashamed because we (blacks & whites alike) all knew the truth from the start.  It's hard to watch a hero turn into a monster.  Innocent men never run.  O.J. - what goes around comes around - I'm talking about the aft
r-life.  Do you think you can buy God off?  God bless the Browns & the Goldmans.
<LI>No matter what the verdict was, it would be a surprise.
<LI>I'm SO SICK of OJ.....
<LI>It was a travisty of justice, & the outcome made me ill
<LI>It simply reinforces the fact that "justice" has a different definition for the rich & famous than it does for the average American.
<LI>Based on the evidence that was presented in court, and that is what counts, I too would have found OJ not guilty.  The trial was a joke and the prosecution screwed up big time, as did the LAPD.  If it weren't their bungeling of the case, OJ would have probably been found guilty, as he probably is.  I don't think we can entirely blame our nation's justice system for letting OJ go free.  
<LI>The prosecution blew this case with over confidence in blood evidence which I believe in.
<LI>Think twice about avoiding jury duty.
<LI>Blacks saw this as a chance to get, "even with whitey" totally acquiting a man who slaughtered two innocent people!
<LI>It was the most disgusting display- black people sticking together and letting another one get away with murder. Civil Rights was always a pack of bullshit! I hope members of the jury's families get murdered and see how they like it!!
<LI>It was a disgrace and I wouldn't be surprised if OJ threatened them. He should die a horrible, painful death and rot in...well....you get the point.
<LI>This case only serves one purpose.  To prove that the u.s justice system, and those who participate in it are whores.  If one has enough $$$$$$$$ or fame then you will be set free. 
<LI>Shows how truly low the American public can get.
<LI>The fat lady has sung for America's legal system.
<LI>It was a total farce,  blacks on the jury seeing it as a way to "strike back" against whites; forgetting that they as women are being beaten and injured; and killed every day by abusive husbands.  The female jurors basically said it is okay to beat and even to kill your spouse.  Talk about slavery.
<LI>He did it alright.  Prosecution did not prove their case.
<LI>I NEVER want to hear about O.J AGAIN. 
<LI>I'm pissed that that murderer got off
<LI>Let it and everyone associated with it disappear forever. I'll have no more of it!
<LI>The Viet Nam War, Watergate, and the OJ verdict have done more to damage our country than any other other previous events in our history.
<LI>The jury was influenced by the LA riots
<LI>Anyone who thought the African American women on the jury were going to convict isn't paying close attention. They had to go HOME after the trial.
<LI>The LAPD was so incompetent that they couldn't frame a guilty man. The prosecution's case had a bad smell from the start.
<LI>I hope oj gets hung by his balls like the murderer he is!
<LI>The jury selection process must be changed so that the most ignorant people are excluded (just the opposite of this trial).
<LI>It's really sick that the black jurors could not see past the color of Simpson's skin.  This shameful trial has set back race relations for this Euro-american and makes me distrust blacks.  If Ron and Nicole had been black O.J. would have been convicted.  But maybe not as he is considered a so called sports "hero" and they are sacred in this crazy country.
<LI>Lessons evident:Ban Court TV ; Adopt English legal principle of Sub Judice -i.e. restrain trial by media ; the spectacle of third world quality rabble rousing enhanced by high tech facility demeaned the judicial process- in particular the complementary ou
<LI>Prosecution failed to make Furhman's racism overt but not germane 
<LI>L.A.police planted evidence
<LI>It's over already....leave him in peace to find "the real killer".
<LI>OJ Simpson probably did it and the misconduct of the LAPD justifies him going free.  They should clean up their act.
<LI>trial was too lenghty and a huge waste of time
<LI>Why do people make such a deal about it?  Also, I'm sure the jury had a reason for their verdict.
<LI>OJ is the guiltiest guy I have ever seen!
<LI>It was an outrage--the verdict I mean
<LI>justice is not blind, she cold in the ground lying next to Nicole
<LI>It was a disgrace OJ WAS guilty as sin!!
<LI>If he did not do it why did he run?
<LI>It was a travesty of our Justice system. He is guilty and should be punished, but the system was aborted by the jurys' failure to accept DNA evidence, I don't care why they didn't, they simply didn't.  Race should not be a factor in court, but, as it is in life, so it is in court.  Our criminal justice system and our society need help.
<LI>It is my deepest hope that blacks can learn to put aside racism as well as whites.  The test here was supposed to be about whether the man committed the crime, not about racism.  Yet we saw thousands of blacks rejoicing in the streets because OJ was acquitted.  If he wasn't guilty, why did he run (remember the Bronco chase)?
<LI>LAPD and the Coroner's Office lost this case for the prosecution. Even Fuhrman himself , years ago, admitted to growing racial animosity and instead of giving him a desk job or disability, they PROMOTED him. Fung/Mazzola are incompetent.Waiting 10 hours to call the coroner, 4 lead detectives leaving the crime scene, and missing blood added to the reasonable doubt. LA asked for this verdict...even though OJ is guilty.
<LI>He did it, he did it, he did it, murder.
<LI>OJ did it, 'Nuff said,
<LI>I think it was a total waste of taxpayers time and money.....
<LI>Simpson was not found innocent.  He was found not guilty with the evidence that was presented.  The man is not innocent.  He murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.  He is now bargaining for his children.  The Browns will be allowed to keep the kids provided they do not press on with the Civil Suit.  I would agree with them on this.  OJ does not, however, have any such bargaining chips with the Goldman family.  He will be ruined financially, and eventually, he will have to live in Europe.  He got away w
th murder because cops have been getting away with racist, disgusting, brutal policies for years.  If Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman were black, Simpson would have been found guilty.  He is guilty.  My heart breaks for his children.
<LI>OJ is a BEAST, he should go to hell.
<LI>OJ - Absolutely 100% NOT GUILTY!!!
<LI>The prosecution did not prove their case beyond reasonable doubt.  It was their obligation to do so and they failed.  Being found not guilty doesn't mean he didn't do it.  It means that it can't be proven.
<LI>A murderer golfs among us! :(
<LI>Rodney King cops were tried again, Simpson should be too
<LI>The whole thing was a cluster@#%*!
<LI>It's too bad race is such a factor for some people.
<LI>Somehow this stupid trial has become a martyr in our society.. Nothing about the trial merits any of the attention it recieved from the media or the impact it had on so many people.
<LI>Guilty.
<LI>This whole case has been a disgusting mockery of the system.  This case also brought our society back many years any progress made in race relations.  I should hope that we should learn from our mistakes.  O.J. Simpson: Guilty.  He'll serve a social payback now. Good luck tidying your image, O.J. 
<LI>It cost millions in court fees, and all that money was the biggest fucking waste, the trial gummed up a good portion of TV, preventing me from seeing some pretty good shows, also, OJ's hero status, and his reknown played a big factor in the outcome of the trial...
<LI>Money buys so-called justice
<LI>enough!!!!!
<LI>GET OVER IT!!  MOVE ON!!
<LI>The defense did good
<LI>He told her he would kill her and get away with it, and he did.
<LI>I THINK OJ SHOULD GET THE KIDS HIS THERE DAD
<LI>He's guilty, and we all know it.  He's a crimminal, and the Jury is blind if they can't see his guilt.  The only reason O.J. is free, is becuse like Robert Shipiro said "[the defense] played the race card from the bottom of the deck."  Race had virtually nothing to do with this case, and absolutely nothing to do with the murders.
<LI>The very rich can buy their chosen verdict.
<LI>oj sucks dick
<LI>the best thing I have ever watched 
<LI>I think everybody should be entitled to the defense OJ got. The police should be truthful in their investigation.
<LI>It was a sad day fot the victims familys
<LI>OJ Simpson was a victim just like The Beloved Nicole Brown Sipmson and Ron Goldman, OJ was a great target, but he had a better shield than others had for ammuntion. If you think there was not a resonable doubt, than you have closed your eyes. And if you think that nothing pointed at OJ, you also closed your eyes. It was a trial of all trials. The outcome was right, no matter what anyone says. If our Legal system works when people get put behind bars for rape, child molestation, and robbery, I don't thi
k that it broke just for OJ. He is free and he is now innocent. Leave the man alone and let him live his free life, like we all wish to.
<LI>Glad its over.
<LI>I think the only form of justice would be if Ron Goldman's dad would blow OJ's head off, and then be acquitted.  And the Brown family needs to feel like shit for not helping Nicole in the first place.
<LI>the verdict is so unfair! everyone knows o.j. did it1
<LI>Since an American jury found him innocent, we must abide by that decision. Right or wrong, this is the system we all follow. Eventually truth wills out, and the guilty party will live with that information all his/her life. What I find interesting is that if Nicole hadn't been murdered, no one, her family included would be doing anything to prevent her rich husband from beating her. Guilt is a powerful emotion. 
<LI>Oh what money can do!!!!
<LI>The jury were morons
<LI>Money/influence buys freedom. always had always will
<LI>The media made race a factor not anyone involved in the trial except for maybe Johnny Cochrane
<LI>It sucked but i love kato
<LI>I think the police truly believed O.J. Simpson committed the crime, because of his past of spousal abuse, so they planted the evidence to make a strong case.  It was ridiculous for the prosecution to have video taped the nurse's statement which was not done under oath.  The nurse's performance was so bad !  Most of all, I do not think O.J. would have jeopardized everything to have committed the murders.  With his money, he could have easily paid someone to do it.  Most of all, THERE WAS NO MOTIVE.  Bot
 of them were living their lives separately to the best of their ability.  Considering, Nicole, was a divorced woman, she was certainly well provided for by O.J. Simpson.  I also was married to an abusive man, but when I left my marriage, I walked out with the clothes on my back, and had to pay my lawyers dearly to get divorced.  I believe Nicole could have got mixed up with some unsavoury character and, of course, Ron Goldman was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
<LI>The most unbelievable miscarriage of justice in history
<LI>The jury was biased. The one of the _VERY_ few times Rush limbaugh was wrong :(
<LI>The media hype and rumors and theories regarding the case should not affect the process that ensures every citizen's rights.  Gut feeling should not take the place of due process.  Those in the business of upholding the law, the cops, judges, lawyers are 
<LI>Only a higher authority knows the truth about O.J.
<LI>I believe the jury voted "not guilty" because they were afraid that a "guilty" verdict would generate another riot.  Also, I believe that O.J. did it, but not alone.  And as far as the leather glove not fitting on his hand??...  how the hell can you get a leather glove on over a rubber glove?  It's virtually impossible.  That was such a crock of shit as far as the defense goes.  If the jurers were so moronic to take that piece of so-called "evidence" into consideration, it only proves that there should
have been 12 different jurers hearing the trial.  Honestly, the whole think pissed me off.  Now, I'm not a promoter of this book, but if you want to read an enlightening book, read "Outrage:  5 Reasons O.J. Got Away With Murder" by Vincent Bugliousi
<LI>It was the media fascinated by their own power more than anything else, and America fascinated by the dark side of human beings.
<LI>Kill the bastard.
<LI>Showed how far the jury system has strayed from reality.
<LI>that bastard should be dead
<LI>OJ SHOULD BE REPAYED FOR THE TIME HE SPENT IN JAIL AND ALSO THE POLICE FORCE SHOULD CONTINUE INVESTIGATING ON FINGING THE REAL MURDER.
<LI>The nigger should have hung for it!!!!!!
<LI>I believe O.J. Simpson is guilty. The trial was an education in the American Justice System. What a joke!!!!
<LI>Jury verdict was a Rodney King LAPD payback
<LI>WHAT A FARCE!
<LI>verdict sucks
<LI>OJ got away with murder because of 1 sleazeball on the LAPD!!!
<LI>It just showed that the judicial system really doesn't try to find the truth anymore.
<LI>It was a complete farce.  Not guilty unless proven *beyond a reasonable doubt*!  Bad behavior on both sides contributed reasonable doubt. Lawyers suck.
<LI>what a joke
<LI>Way too much media attention; let's get on with our lives. I only participated in this survey to express this opinion!
<LI>A sad miscarriage of justice
<LI>It totally sucked!! It must be nice being a celebrity!!
<LI>oj is scum and a liar.  He did murder Ron and Nicole!!
<LI>I can't believe the uneducated opinions some people have! 
<LI>I am so sick of OJ that I can't even drink it for breakfast anymore
<LI>BORING BORING BORING!ENOUGH ALREADY!
<LI>COME ON O.J DID IT
<LI>It was a joke.  Believe it or not, blacks kill, too.
<LI>I'm sick of it. Make it go away, mommy.
<LI>The LAPD did a lousy job of investigating the murders; the detectives in charged violated OJ's 4th Amendment rights, then lied to the judge in the probable cause hearing; too many in the media and the public fell for the razzle-dazzle of the alleged DNA evidence; the LA County DA should never had moved to prosecute on the basis of the evidence presented, plus knowing that Furhman was a liar; and the public's knowledge about the US Constitution is sadly lacking: In this country, an accused does not have
to prove his innocence, he is presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  The great injustice here is that a person acquitted by a jury of his peers can then be sued in civil court for damages for something for which he has been acquitted in criminal court.  So much for the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.
<LI>no trial, you need a jury!
<LI>There was plenty of evidence to prove O.J. guilty!!!
<LI>I hope we never see the likes of it again!
<LI>I think having OJ try on the gloves over his latex gloves pretty much described the overall stupidity that abounded in that case. Hey, some things made even Kato seem bright. Maybe MArsha and Chris were concentrating on each other too much to realize how to prosecute the case. Then again, the jurors were about the dumbest things within 50 miles of the courtroom.
<LI>The trial shows that if you have the money you can pay to create doubts in a jury's thinking.  In this manner you can sway the jury to vote in your favor.  One more example of a separate system of jurispurdence (I do not say "justice" here) for the wealthy another for the avareage income person and the poor.
<LI>OJ is innocent, he DID not do it.  Police planted the "evidence", and a few of the cops should be hauled up in front of a judge to explain!  M. Clark should have known beforehand that she would not be successful and they should *NOT have wasted the taxpayers money.  
<LI>If Simpson were seated in my restaurant, I'd walk out.
<LI>O.J. is guilty as sin and how can somebody elses blood magically get changed into O.J.s blood by contamination?
<LI>O. J. DID IT!  Duh.  The jury was VERY obtuse and ignorant!  I wonder what what going through their heads . . .
<LI>It is my siincere hope that everything OJ tries to do is a failure. That way he will be in a virtual prison, where he belongs!
<LI>It was a travesty of our legal system.  Money and fame will get anyone off.
<LI>O.J. went into court innocent. The Jury's job was to listen to the evidence and determine if the Prosecution could prove the contrary. The Prosecution failed. Wether or not each individual believes he is guilty, Justice as defined in the USA was administe
<LI>To interject jury-nullification in order to send a race message is pathetic! Justice was NOT served.
<LI>This trial was a joke but I watched every second of it.
<LI>OJ SHOULD FRY
<LI>We have forgotten that once the jury says not guilty it is not guilty and not up for public retrial.  It's scarey what the American Public is like.
<LI>IN THE END VIGILANTE JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL
<LI>He'll get his ... some day, some way.
<LI>Judge Ito allowed too much in, prolonging the trial
<LI>THE JUSTICE SYSTEM IS A JOKE. LAYWERS ARE A DISGRACE
<LI>Ultimately, he will pay for what he did. The trail was a farce.
<LI>The jurors came to the right decision.  Read "LEGACY OF DECEPTION"   A real eye opener.
<LI>What the children have to live with is horrendus
<LI>The media did not portray the responsibility of the legal system adequately.  OJ is not legally required to prove his innocence!
<LI>Had Nicole been black and OJ white I would have believed that he was guilty and should have been convicted of first degree murder and either put away for the rest of his life or executed. The racists in our society wait to see the color of a face before they decide. I have no more respect for a black racist than I do for a white racist. Until our society has as much contempt for one as they do for the other our society will continue to head straight for the garbage bin. 
<LI>ANYONE WHO THINKS O.J. IS INNOCENT NEEDS TO HAVE A BRAIN SCAN TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY ACTIVITY.
<LI>O.J. murdered the mother of his kids and left her in a pool of blood for his children to find.  Luckily they didn't.
<LI>I'm so glad it's over!
<LI>It was a circus, not justice.
<LI>Christopher Darden's new book, In Contempt, is excellent
<LI>I think that the primary reason the jury voted not guilty wae.  I think that he lied, twisted facts, played to the jury, and inflamed the racial issue.  I also think that Judge Ito played a large part in the verdict by allowing cameras in the courtroom, g
<LI>Give a intellegence test to a all black jury before proceeding.
<LI>did oj get his hat & glove back?
<LI>It is a travesty of the system that O.J. should be living a normal life now, getting the same fame as always when we know that he is sickeningly guilty.
<LI>O.J SIMPSON IS THE BIGGEST JOKE ON THIS PLANET. HE SHOULD BE ROTTING IN JAIL. THE ONLY CONSILATION IS THAT HE KNOWS THAT HE IS GUILTY AND HE HAS TO LIVE WITH THAT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. ALL OF YOU O.J SUPPORTERS DERSERVE TO BE KICKED IN THE HEAD. WAKE 
<LI>After watching most of the trial on TV and listening to the rest on the radio, I am convinced there was a serious miscarriage of justice when O.J. Simpson was found not guilty of murdering two innocent human beings.  Nobody deserves to die the way Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman died!  O.J. Simpson thinks he is god....
<LI>OJ is an asshole.
<LI>OJ is a discrace to the community that made him a ftbl hero.
<LI>it was a slap in the face of the american justice system.
<LI>The Prosecution claims they fought so hard because of the interests of "all the battered women" out there.  If they wanted to do something for "battered" women, how about channeling some of the $5+ million they squandered on lawyering into shelters?  There is *NO* evidence to support the idea that OJ did it - there is only suspicion:  "Well who else then?" is not evidence and is not grounds for even charging him, much less finding him guilty and comments like this demonstrate the ignorance of those who
utter them.  If OJ cut his finger in the Bronco as Clark suggested, then why no blood inside the glove?  Reached for his phone "after" - no evidence of that.  How is it even POSSIBLE for a man with a mangled finger to fly 1/2 way across the continent and *NOBODY* notices?  The fact of the matter is that THIS alone is evidence that he didn't do it.  If there is no hole in his finger, then the *ONLY* way to get the blood out of OJ was with a needle!!!  Clark should have realised this at the outset, but like 
OST lawyers, her (and the prosecution team's)  interest was to turn the situation into a game - "and see if they could win"  ...all at the taxpayer's expense of course!   Marcia, want to help abused women?  Donate the windfall $$$ from your book, etc. to a women's shelter.  BTW, I'm a white male and I'm *NOT* a football fan.  Never really heard of OJ before the trial.
<LI>Black Power
<LI>Demonstrates that 1) Police can not be trusted & 2) legal system does NOT work!!!
<LI>Guilty as sin.
<LI>I don't really know if OJ did it, but somehow reasonable doubt was raised about the judicial system. (PS:  it's spelled "perjury")
<LI>Since OJ Simpson didn't take the stand they should have used the interview with Vannatter and Lang when OJ first came back from Chicago...It was a nail in OJ's coffin..but no worry...Vengence is mine saith the Lord....
<LI>This seems to be a trial that will never be over... Bad Procicutiers
<LI>It's over--but if he didn't kill them, who did?
<LI>They Framed a Guilty Man
<LI>The defense attorney's tactics and the obvious refusal of the jury to consider all the evidence in this case was truly disheartening.  The antics by attorneys that was allowed by judge Ito fueled the fire until it ran out of control.  It's obvious that discipline and moral responsibility was left at the front door.
<LI>It is frightening to see the effect black against white racism can have on justice.
<LI>The verdict was an embarrassment to the judicial system!!
<LI>In my opinion, I think O.J. Did it.  But either way anyone lokks at it, there is a vicious murderer running free.
<LI>it was stupid
<LI>My past belief that whites are more often racist than blacks has been changed forever.
<LI>Circus
<LI>Why is everyone so surprised? Did no one know there is racism in America.  Grow up and quit posing for the camera.  At some point, we're all going to have to just live our lives.  In a thousand years, will it matter what color you are?
<LI>The L.A. Police Department has an international reputation for dishonesty which makes their testimony suspect. 
<LI>If OJ did it then he has to live with it for the rest of his life because he has to look at his kids knowing that he killed their mother.
<LI>The verdict was a joke.  OJ's guilty!  Juice The Juice!
<LI>you have to be a complete asshole to think he is innocent
<LI>A travesty of justice...
<LI>I don't know if OJ done it or not but, if he is guilty white people can feel how blacks feel about the system
<LI>It wasn't about justice. It was often presented like a sporting event, and the lawyers and the judge loved the spotlight so much that they forgot the serious matter at hand. I feel the most sympathy for Ronald Goldman's family. They were dignified throughout the trial. I think that people would have forgiven O.J. if he had admitted that he killed them in a jealous rage. People don't forgive lies and smuggness. O.J. is now being punished in the court of public opinion. 
<LI>Justice may be slow at times, but it does eventually get served .
<LI>Long-term implications haven't even begun to be examined.
<LI>I will never visit LA!
<LI>The poorest excuse for justice that I've ever know about.
<LI>Black folks go to jail everyday for crimes that didn't commit. O.J. gets off and all of a sudden, there's no justice. Wake up and smell the truth!
<LI>To the stupid jury members - Resoniable doubt means that you may not fully believe all evidence but convict upon existing creditable evidence. God there are stupid people in the world like the three female black jury members who appeared on some TV programs. They define stupidity.
<LI>I never realized Blacks were such racists.
<LI>People are murdered everyday; far too much was made about O.J.
<LI>The whole thing was pathetic. OJ is one sick puppy.
<LI>OJ will start his REAL trial after he dies. Poor guy.
<LI>OJ was acquitted, quit whining.
<LI>The trial was a circus and did not belong on television at all.  Judge Ito is a wimp and did not control the proceedings, and I believe he is possibly on the defense payroll.  He dismissed the only unbiased juror on heresay.
<LI>OJ is 100% GUILTY!
<LI>The trial permitted re-victimization of the victims and let a gulity man go free. He will answer to a higher authority!
<LI>The jury did not say that he didn't do it they said there was reasonable doubt.
<LI>I wouldn't have been so upset if it hadn't pre-empted the shows on TV
<LI>The jury selection process needs to be re-examined. 
<LI>OJ should die, I hope Marcia gets crabs, FLee Bailey should rot in federal prison, I hope Johnnie Cochrane gets crabs, and everyone else should get a swift kick in the ass and a blow to the head for the shitty job they did.
<LI>The only reason O.J. Simpson was found not guilty is because he had enough money to get some good lawyers.
<LI>they should put the whole thing to rest, leave it alone.
<LI>The nigger did it.
<LI>the trial was a joke he is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY  and thats that .............
<LI>I am disgusted with the after verdict jury bashing
<LI>oj is a fucking asshole psychopathic liar who cannot be a father! He thinks he is so great because he made money by beating up on people. He is just a big ape
<LI>Trials such as this will eventually lead to "professional jurors"
<LI>The evidence didn't add up.  Definately tampered with.  Ito should have excluded the evidence obtained from jumping over the wall at Rockingham, the Bronco, which had been tampered with, and the unexplainable glove.
<LI>good trial
<LI>A travesty
<LI>The jury acuited him because he was black and a black won't convict a black. Exspecially for killing a white.
<LI>It was a classic example of the double standard of justice--one for the rich and famous and one for John/Jane Q. Public.  O.J. would be in prison if he were "just another person."
<LI>Simpson was completely guilty. The trial was a mockery and had nothing to do with "justice". It was not based on evidence, rather played upon the emotions of a weak jury. I feel very sorry for the Brown family who had to endure this. In the end however O.J. will undoubtedly meet his maker and get exactly what he deserves. He cannot escape himself.
<LI>Based on the evidence, I agree with the verdict.
<LI>Ito made a mockery of the very system that he should uphold to the highest.. He took an oath to, "SERVE."  The only serving he did was Hollywood.  Shame on you Ito, you disgust me..If you had a daughter, maybe you would have her marry O.J.  You were so impressed with his celebrity maybe he'll get you an acting job like Kato!!
<LI>circus
<LI>O.J, then who killed them?
<LI>Injustice is no way to find justice
<LI>I think I'm the only white female in America that agreed with the verdict--there WAS reasonable doubt!
<LI>OJ has a bad karma bomb ready to go off.
<LI>It was an embarrassment to our nation
<LI>Read Darden's book!
<LI>With $$$$ you buy almost....everything-including freedom!!! It's realy ashame!! 
<LI>I think illiteracy played the biggest part in the verdict.  The jurors were not educated and couldn't think in a logical fashion.
<LI>OJ Simpson will get what he deserves real soon.  Look for him to be 
<LI>Chris Darden showed me there are honourable lawyers
<LI>OJ SIMPSON MAY HAVE BEEN FREED IN REGARDS TO SOCIETY AND THIS CASE; HOWEVER, HE WILL PAY FOR HIS CRIME I HAVE NO DOUBT!  HAD ALL OF THE EVIDENCE BEEN PRESENTED THAT SHOULD HAVE TO THE JURY, THEIR JUSTIFICATION FOR A REASONABLE DOUBT WOULD PROBABLY BE ALTERED.  THE OUTCOME OF THIS CASE REALLY DISGUSTS ME!!!
<LI>It just goes to show that justice is not blind at least not color blind.
<LI>A Total Travesty.  
<LI>one more piece of america falls..the justice system
<LI>If you believe that a person can enter a huge mansion all bloody and dirty, get upstairs, shower, change clothes, dispose of evidence, and be seated outside in a limo within 4 minutes, than maybe he did it!  If you can ignore the fact that fibers from the carpet in the Bronco were found stuck to blodd on the glove at the crime scene go there without being tampered with, then maybe he did it!  Etc. etc. etc...  It's sinful the way people are reacting!  I don't care about him one way or the other, but it
was clear that the evidence had been tampered with...no way he could have been found guilty under the law!  The verdict wasn't based on race, the snotty middleclass white reaction is solely based on racist attitudes.  He was legally found "not guilty".  It is downright un-American they way the white public is treating him...like uncivilized barbarians.  I am a white middleclassed person. thank you vary much!!!
<LI>The jury had reasonable doubt due to the prosecution's mishandling of the case
<LI>Where did they find those jurors? It was the jury selection that was pivotal. They will use this case for years to come in Jury Selection 101.
<LI>I think it was a sad excuse for justice.
<LI>Fuhrman a racist? Absolutely.  Does that constitute REASONABLE doubt of OJ's guilt???  Absolutely NOT!!
<LI>I believe that O.J. hired a hit man to kill his ex-wife. I also believe that part of the contract was for O.J. to watch the murder. This was probably done so that he could not later "rat" on the murderer without implicating himself. It is possible that when Goldman showed up, O.J. panicked an either got too close to the murder scene and was splattered by blood or he assisted the murderer in some capacity. I have analysed O.J. 's transcript from "Burden of Proof" and his suicide note and it is evidence 
hat he was deceptive and has witheld evidence.  I also believe that O.J. confessed to the murder during the Burden of Proof interview when he stated "I had a woman killed...". This statement occured when he was on his way to the cemetary with Cowlling. As for the prosecution, I feel that they let themselves get drawn into an emotional and personal confrontation that took their focus away from the case. They behaved in a very unprofessional manner. 
<LI>It was the biggest farce I have ever seen. It was his money and fame that got him off. Nothing else
<LI>guilty
<LI>I believe the jury saw OJ as a stand-in for anonymous black men who may have been mistreated by the justice system throughout the ages -- I do not believe the case was decided on its own merits & that the defense played to the lowest common denominator on
<LI>If you weren't there to see it happen, then there is no way you can say for sure that he's guilty or innocent!
<LI>Television made it a circus.  Cochran did a disservice to African-Americans.  He did his job, yes, but the effect was to give the public the impression that African-Americans were more interested in vindication for past injustices than convicting a man who could not possibly have been more gulity.
<LI>Decision was made at time of jury empanelment
<LI>GROSS MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE
<LI>What a shameful circus this whole thing turned out to be. We are all responsible in some part for this.
<LI>Cochran is spelled wrong, sorry.  Murders should not be set free at any cost.
<LI>I have one thing to say about the American justice system, it's no different from the rest of North America when it comes to justice.
<LI>I have one thing to say about the American justice system, it's no different from the rest of North America when it comes to justice.
<LI>A very sad day for the American Justice system
<LI>a black jury will not convict a prominant black
<LI>I think the entire trial was a farce. Marcia Clark did not have the right stuff to try this case (and I'm a woman!).  She missed a lot of crucial points and made the DNA evidence unnecessarily complex.
<LI>fascinating
<LI>Can we say media overplay...who the hell cared?!  Was it any of my business?!  I think not.  I would much rather have watched Sesame Street--I would ahve been more entertained and learned a lot more about living my own life and dealing with others if I had.
<LI>OJ IS GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I think this trial proved to the people of America that if you have enough money, you can get away with anything including murder.
<LI>Get rid of Geraldo!!!!
<LI>What a crock!
<LI>OJ is as guilty as sin.  He's a wife-beating murderer.
<LI>The injustice served up for the Brown and Goldman families to swallow is sad and unfair.  I hope that a guilty verdict is rendered in the civil suit against Simpson.  Though, they will no doubt ever see retrobution in the form of cash, he will be OFFICIALLY pegged as the murderer I believe he is. Maybe that will give the victims families a sence of justice and closure.
<LI>It should have been tried in Brentwood. Oj's peers are there
<LI>it was such a circus.  The lawyers were only playing up to the television cameras.  The trial should never have been on television in the first place!
<LI>The whole thing was a joke!
<LI>During the trial, Darden said that the "N" word is one of the filthiest words in the English language, and it does not belong in a court. Following Darden's statement, Cochran replied: " I would like to make an apology to African-Americans across the country on his behalf." Apology my butt. He was really saying Darden was a traitor. Pretty soon he will be saying White Devil as the Japanese did in World War II. Darden should be a role model for anti-racism to children across the world. And about O.J. In
his new video, he explained Nicole's injuries he gave her. "Some of them are from her own clumsiness, and the others are from when I was defending myself from her violent temper. She was a very powerful woman." Oh sure, scrawny Nicole beating up muscular O.J., who weighs twice as much. He should be grateful to Satan for getting away with murder and keep his big mouth shut.
<LI>OJ and his lawyers are contemptible scum -- he is a lying murderer, they are totally sleazeballs.. This was a travesty of justice. The jury were cowardly lowlifes -- like OJ, totally devoid of conscience. Marcia Clark and Chris Darden are heroes -- conscientious public servants of great principle and integrity. This was a cut & dried case, with an embarassment of evidence for conviction. It never never should have been televised. The sad part is that the Brown and Goldman families are forever bereaved 
nd Nicole's children will have to live with this tragedy forever. Everlasting shame
<LI>I hope that OJ Simpson is forever haunted by the brutal images of the two people he butchered.
<LI>By allowing this tiral to be a"circus-of-stars"and by billing this trial as "the trial of the century", our own justice system did a disservice to Nicole and Ron.  All that was needed was the facts and just the facts surrounding the crime; if those facts were not strong enough to convict OJ then the jury had no alternative but to acquit.Let this be a lesson that law belongs  in the courtroom while entertainment belongs on the stage.
<LI>It's hard to second-guess the jury's verdict given the information which was kept from them.  Also the media provided the rest of us with so much analysis that it's hard to separate out all the facts in accordance with our legal guidelines.  However, given the statements some juror's made following the verdict, it appears that at least a few of the panelists (e.g., Moran) had made up their minds early on that Simpson was not-guilty.  As a result it is likely that any contradictory evidence went unheede
.  Allowing the TV in the courtroom is a mistake.  Yes, the public has a right to know, but not at the expense of serving justice.  If people were that interested in the trial they should have gone to LA to sit in the courtroom.  I think that jurors should be better protected so that they don't have fears about voting either way.  I also think that the ability to play to the jury by the lawyers and defendants should be eliminated by having the jury behind a one-way mirror so that they can see everyone else
-but others can't see them.  If Simpson didn't do it, he knows who did.
<LI>very frighting
<LI>Who gives a ----?!??!
<LI>Travesty of justice. 
<LI>I would like to see the Civil Case televised
<LI>Hey, why waste time re-hashing the trial? We should be looking for the "real killers"! !!
<LI>The lesson: if the LAPD does not clean up their own house, then guilty men will continue to go free because of the reasonable doubt created by the testimony of crooked cops.
<LI>The prosecution attempted to introduce two timelines, but the two cancelled each other out. In addition they never proved that O.J. either owed the gloves or the shoes.
<LI>There was too much pre-trial publicity, and too many opinions dominating the media.
<LI>It was the most boring thing my mother has ever been addicted to.
<LI>A joke.  He's guilty as Hell.
<LI>J.C. has led race relations set about 30 years back. I may not have been around then, but I know things were race issues from books. It looks like race relations will continue going backward, but in reverse. Pretty soon it will be the whites who have to give up seats on the bus. It was terrible blacks had to, but we couldn't prevent our ancestors from doing it. Now, we can at least not do it again, But we are on our way. I hope R.R.'s will advance to a more civilized state. 
<LI>Who Cares?  My butt cares!!
<LI>oj is an uncivilized ape who made all his money because lazy couch potatoes across America like to watch people beat up on each other. He is uneducated and is incapable of being any kind of father. He should pay his kids lots of money and STAY THE HELL OUT OF THEIR LIVES!
<LI>The system worked like it was supposed to, and people are upset about it.
<LI>OJ is guilty as SIN
<LI>This trial has changed my view of justice.  Too many of the 
<LI>If you have money or fame, you can buy anyone off...!
<LI>Enough is enough, let's get on with life.
<LI>Criminal trials have no place on television
<LI>It was a media circus and a joke on the justice system.  Money can buy justice.
<LI>Jury showed a new level of stupidity.
<LI>I have no idea why Ito was nieve to judge O.J.
<LI>the jury practiced nullification of justice, there should have been a hung jury, charges should be pressed against them for not following the directions
<LI>Major waste of time.
<LI>The jurors are a bunch of morons. Need I say more?
<LI>By allowing the media to participate judge Ito extended the trial by probably 3-4 months.  The defense did what they were paid to do , namely divert the trial from the real issues, confuse the jurors with extrenious details and drag the trial out till the
<LI>People get acquitted for killing Blacks every day without the entire criminal justice system being called into questions.
<LI>I felt the trial did not change anybody's mind, but if you began assuming his innocence the evidence as presented and gathered was not convincing as to his guilt.
<LI>I feel the trial was a joke. Also that a few of the Main players saw the operunity to try and further their carreers. (pesonaly I hope it fails)
<LI>the rich are above the law
<LI>This is.....beyond belief. You can now by your way out of justice.
<LI>all bad things must come to an end
<LI>It is a very sad day. Crime and money pay.
<LI>It interupted the NBA playoff's and pissed me off!!!!!

<H2 ALIGN=CENTER>SURVEY.NET FAQ</H2>

Last updated: 01/30/1995

<H3><A NAME="1.0.0">What is SURVEY.NET?</A></H3><H4>

SURVEY.NET is a public service network of servers designed to poll 
users and generate information on demographics, public opinion, 
trends, etc.  SURVEY.NET is based around a customized, ever-evolving 
script engine developed by Michael Perry (wisdom@icorp.net).
<P>
What makes SURVEY.NET special is that users have the ability to 
instantly view the latest results of each questionnaire - upon 
submission of your survey, the system automatically compiles the 
data and generates a new report, adding your responses to the data 
pool.
<P>
The nucleus of SURVEY.NET is the special engine, which has many 
advanced features, including the ability to handle user-specified 
comments (essay-type answers) as well as regular multiple-choice 
responses.  New features are continually being added to the system 
as more is learned from the process of querying users' opinions and 
perspectives.
<P>
But perhaps more important than anything else, the SURVEY.NET site 
represents a location users on the web can go and seek demographics, 
opinions and other information - as well as contribute their own.  
The underlying engine would be useless if the site itself did not 
attract a wide variety of internet participants - and this is an 
aspect that is as critical as anything else - as a result, we strive 
to keep the site vibrant and alive with opinion and controversy in 
order to consistently attract users and keep regulars coming back.  
Each of our surveys is considered a living entity: dynamic; 
sometimes predictable, sometimes chaotic - just like life.  In fact 
it can be facinating to watch the surveys on various events change 
in relation to the events unfolding themselves - the OJ Simpson 
trial survey is a prime example - we captured public opinion before 
and during each of the side's presentation of their case.  The same 
technique will be used to monitor the events leading up to the 1996 
US Presidential election.  When scenarios change which affect public 
opinion, sometimes old surveys will be closed and archived and new 
ones will be opened - to chronicle not only public opinion in 
general, but changes in perspectives through time.
<P>
Unlike other sites, at SURVEY.NET, the users are the true value - if 
they're going to submit information, they should have instant access 
to that information - this is the main reason for making the results 
automatically available - the data collected is for the enjoyment 
and education of everyone - and not something devised under the 
guise of verifying a preset agenda.
<P>
If there is an ulterior motive in all of this, it's nowhere near as 
controversial as our surveys - it is simply to be considered an 
accurate, reliable source of information on public opinion - the 
highest honor we can imagine.

Who Runs SURVEY.NET?
</A></H3><H4>

SURVEY.NET is run by Mike Perry, an independant software developer 
and president of Progressive Computer Services (established in 
1986).  Mike has been involved in developing information systems 
since the age of 13, creating sites on systems from Control Data's 
PLATO network, to developing SIGs (Special Interest Groups) on The 
Source (now CompuServe) and other networks long before the Internet 
was conceived.  Mike has been running a BBS since 1979 and has been 
awarded "Editor's Choice" in PC Magazine, as well as numerous other 
honors and endorsements from major publications and writers 
(including John C. Dvorak) for his programming projects.  In the 
area of marketing, demographics and market research, Mr. Perry has 
extensive experience in working with advertising agencies, broadcast 
media and print media - no formal training - just a PhD from the 
University of Reality in association with services provided to a 
plethora of very prominent firms.
<P>
Ok, this is me (Mike) and obviously I'm also the author of this FAQ 
- I hate writing about myself in the third person - it's pretty 
weird, but I'm also not particularly interested in using this forum 
to blow my own horn (I'd rather be judged by my work exclusively), 
but I guess these are valid questions and responses to put in a 
FAQ...
<P>
I run SURVEY.NET.  I guess you could say it's my baby.  It never has 
been profitable, which IMO is probably the true mark of integrity (ha ha
- that's easy to say when you're poor isn't it?). 
Like everybody else out there, I want to make a mark - I want to do 
something important, and SURVEY.NET is something I take great pride 
in.
<P>
I'm associated with Inter Commerce
Corporation, a local internet service provider - 
they have been kind enough to indulge my experimentation and 
attempts to establish this system, and for that I am grateful.  If 
you're looking for an ISP and you're in the area, take a look at 
what they have to offer.  Beyond this friendly suggestion, that's 
about as much influence as you'll see from me or this site with 
respect to my hosts; I might have a link to their homepage 
in places or promos for other local sites, but that's it - anything 
more would in my opinion be inappropriate considering that we're trying 
to make this site as 
objective as possible.

<H3><A NAME="1.2.0">
How does SURVEY.NET work?  What's the methodology in collecting 
information?
</A></H3><H4>

Obviously, the idea of collecting information online in an automated 
manner presents some interesting challenges.  Traditional polls rely 
on a 'human factor' and a supposed 'random sample' from which to 
generate results.  It has been argued that traditional polls could 
be more accurate than the SURVEY.NET system - someone once commented 
that my system was "biased towards those who are willing to 
participate."  That's funny.  I challenge anyone to show me any 
survey which endeavors to collect accurate information which isn't 
as biased.  The scenario doesn't exist.
<P>
Unlike other survey methods, SURVEY.NET is incapable of prejudice.  
Anyone able to participate is welcome to.  There are safeguards to 
protect against 'spamming' however (see later sections of the 
document).
<P>
The ONLY bias or slant in SURVEY.NET demographics is that our 
respondents have access to the Internet's World-Wide-Web.  If you 
want to argue whether this group is representative of any sizeable 
portion of the world society, that's a good topic for debate - but 
not here.  It is my opinion that it's just a matter of time before 
those who have access to the net will represent a major portion of 
the world community.  Aside from that, we can consider SURVEY.NET's 
results to be the opinions of those who are on the Internet with WWW 
access.  And as we speak, this segment is getting larger and larger 
by the minute!
<P>
A typical survey in the system presents a small set of questions - 
usually multiple choice.  The results are automatically compiled 
upon submission of the form.  These answers are then added to a 
"master database" of responses to each question, updated, and then 
the system re-creates a new report (an html page) reflecting the 
latest results.  The answers to each question are sorted based on 
the number of respondents, with the most-popular answer being listed 
first and the least-popular last.
<P>
Enhancements are currently underway to implement special variations 
of surveys which dynamically present new questions based on the 
results of previous answers - a truly dynamic surveying system... 
There are also plans to be able to generate results based on 
specific conditions and responses to specific questions - stay 
tuned...


<H3><A NAME="1.3.0">
How accurate is the SURVEY.NET information?  What about multiple 
users posting answers?
</A></H3><H4>

There are numerous techniques implemented to protect against users 
trying to taint the
survey results by completing surveys more than once.  For me to 
elaborate on our 
protection scheme would defeat its purpose.  
<P>
In the intial stages of developing the system, we had more than our 
fair share of people attempt to 'spam' the surveys - it helped us 
protect against such tactics.  In a few cases where users were 
successful, we were able to identify them in cooperation with their 
ISP and take appropriate action.  There is one person out of a job 
and one person expelled from a major university as a result of such 
subversive activities - and even now, they could not repeat their 
performance as a result of our new protection.  Those that were 
caught that did not have diciplinary action taken against them have 
had their entire system banned from the survey system - yes we do 
have an automated blacklist (it's very small though).  This isn't to 
say that it's impossible to defeat our protection against people 
posting multiple answers, but if you do it, we will catch you and 
you'll be sorry.  In the computer world, ultimately there is no 
fool-proof security - just like in every other segment of society, 
people should be left to their own devices to act appropriate and 
not destroy the work of others.  With that being said, at any time 
we can produce log files identifying the integrity of our surveys.
<P>
However, I stand behind the integrity of the SURVEY.NET data and
can produce log files which clearly demonstrate that the information
comes from unique respondents all over the net.

<H3><A NAME="1.4.0">
Are the Surveys anonymous?
</A></H3><H4>

YES, YES they are.  The system in its present configuration does not 
keep track of any individual survey answers - never at any time are 
user responses even written to disk - they are instantly compiled 
with the main data file.  There is no way we can specifically 
identify what answers any specific user has provided to any specific 
question - period!
<P>
The survey system does log activity however, but it is limited in 
its scope of what we can identify.  The Internet is by its very 
nature somewhat anonymous - anyone using a browser can fake an 
e-mail address - so it's very difficult to identify users 
specifically.  We have always had the option of authenticating users 
and requiring valid information in order to access the site, but we 
are not implementing this option - for the most part, 99.99999% of 
our visitors are honorable and honest in answering questions and 
following the rules - our logs prove this.  We don't want to make it 
a hassel of getting to the site by specifying a username and 
password - this hasn't become an issue and we hope it never will.

<H3><A NAME="1.5.0">
What language is the Survey system written in?  What system can run 
it?
</A></H3><H4>

The Survey engine is written in Ansi C and has been tested in a 
variety of environments - it can probably run on just about any 
computer that is capable of connecting to the web with a standard 
Ansi C-compiler available.  The source code is about 7,000 lines and 
growing as we add more features.  We have executable code for Novell 
Unixware, BSD, Sun, and other platforms. 

<H3><A NAME="1.5.1">
Is the Survey engine available to others?
</A></H3><H4>

At the present time there are no plans to make this software publicly available.
The main reason for this is that having too many copies of the Survey Engine
on the net would dilute the value of our site, and if other people were running
more-biased survey systems, it might reflect badly upon SURVEY.NET's reputation
as being objective.  This is not to say that there are no other versions of
SURVEY.NET available online.  We're currently working on setting up a European
version called "InterPoll" which will be run in the United Kingdom, and of course,
being a starving artist, if the money is right, we may consider licensing use
of the system.  <A HREF="mailto:wisdom@icorp.net">Email</A> me if you are
seriously interested in utilizing the technology - we might be able to work
something out.


<H3><A NAME="1.6.0">
How are new surveys designed?  Who decides or creates a new survey?
</A></H3><H4>

I pretty-much decide what goes up on the site.  I rely heavily on 
user-input to decide what surveys should be added or how surveys 
should be modified.  I try not to modify a survey after it's been 
released - at the most I'll correct spelling errors (which I'm 
slowly becoming famous for (grin)).
<P>
The decision to add a new survey is not solely my own - I may have 
an idea for a topic that I feel may be investigated, but at that 
point I use the full advantage of the net to seek out other, 
more-experienced people to help me create a survey.  Our current 
religion survey is a good example.  Regardless of my personal 
religious philosophy, there was no way I or any single individual 
could come up with an appropriate questionnaire on this topic that 
would not alienate particular groups - I contact the an agency, the 
Ontario Centre for Religious Tolerance and asked for their guidance 
in helping me develop an appropriate survey.  Quite often, the 
intial survey is run for a short period of time; I get feedback, 
revise the survey and start a new one with enhanced questions.

<H3><A NAME="1.7.0">
If I have an idea for a survey, what should I do?
</A></H3><H4>

Send me <A HREF="mailto:wisdom@icorp.net">e-mail</A>.  
Most of what's online is the result of user 
feedback so please feel free to offer your suggestions for new 
surveys or enhancements to existing surveys.
<P>
The more organized your response is, the more-likely it will become 
a reality.  If you present a well-thought-out list of questions & 
answers, there may be a good chance it could be the basis for a 
future survey.  BUT, please be advised that we primarily publish
surveys of a general nature - if you're looking for something
specific, there's not a great chance that we will run a survey.

<H3><A NAME="1.8.0">
What if I wanted you to run a specific survey?  Will you do that for 
organizations?
</A></H3><H4>

Yes.  It depends upon the nature of the survey however, as to 
whether or not it would be included in the main SURVEY.NET system.  
There is a standard which the main system adheres to.  Being a 
starving artist, I'll gladly produce surveys for commercial 
entities, especially if I can help subsidize my activities, but if 
it is something in conflict with our principals of objectivity, I 
may ask that the survey be isolated and promoted independetly.  
Along this line, I'll also entertain offers to license the Survey 
Engine for use on other systems by other organizations - this use 
will be limited in most cases - either for private, non-competitive 
use, or in accordance with the Survey Net standard of being as 
un-biased as possible.  
<P>
Recently, I was contacted by the folks at MegaMall who wanted to 
accumulate some demographics & opinions on online shopping - 
obviously this is something of great value so we worked together to 
create an appropriate survey.  Everyone is now able to exploit the 
information generated.  I'm particularly interested in major sites 
sponsoring surveys - especially if they direct traffic to SURVEY.NET 
- the more people the merrier!

<H3><A NAME="1.9.0">
If my company wanted to license your software or have something 
customized done, is it possible?
</A></H3><H4>

Yes.  You'll have to contact me, but I'm open to a variety of ideas 
on this.  Send e-mail to wisdom@icorp.net or wisdom@enterprise.net.  
I develop net-based client-server applications
in my business, and if you like SURVEY.NET, then you have an idea of
the quality of my work.  I also have a number of other advanced systems
which have been created after SURVEY.NET, including "The Engine", an
automated shopping mall system, and WebSet - a program that can be
used to create web pages using "templates" from a browser.  WebSet is
currently being implemented in SURVEY.NET to allow authorized columnists
to automatically update sections of the SURVEY.NET site - in this manner
the authorized writers can update their own pages without any intervention.

<H3><A NAME="1.10.0">
Can the survey results be republished?  Are there any restrictions?
</A></H3><H4>

All information generated by SURVEY.NET is republishable in any 
form.  We ask that you give us credit in your reference in return - 
that's all.  If possible, list our WWW URL of 
"http://www.survey.net/index.html, or credit "source: Mike Perry/SURVEY.NET".  
Other than that, feel free to re-print the information.  Please 
endeavor to reprint the information in it's entirety however - we do 
not want the data to be extrapolated and used out of context.  It's 
ok to extrapolate responses to individual questions, but do not 
endeavor to mis-represent the data accumulated.  We reserve the 
right to restict any organization's ability to republish data from 
our site if it is distorted in its presentation.  We ask that any 
republished information be sent to use (primarily for my own 
amusement) to:
  PCS, PO Box 7638, Metairie, LA 70010
<P>
More information can be found on the 
<A HREF="http://www.survey.net/license.htm">License Page</A>.

<H3><A NAME="1.11.0">
I've noticed some disparity between the number of respondents and 
total survey answers to specific questions, what gives?
</A></H3><H4>

This disparity seems to be the result of certain types of browsers 
not completely sending all forms data to the script - it's beyond 
our capability to deal with.  We try to keep the number of survey 
questions limited so that those who are running 'buggy' browsers 
don't make the numbers not properly add-up.  This doesn't affect the 
accuracy of survey data - however there may be some cases where some 
users' answers to specific questions are simply not recorded.   It's 
very difficult to track down the cause of this problem - it is 
noticable when you get into the area of having a thousand or more 
surveys completed - so it's not very common.  Different browsers 
handle forms data in different manners - some browsers will NOT send 
a survey answer if the user didn't specifically pick the response 
(and instead left the default answer as it was).  If you're 
analyzing survey data, assume any disparity in the number of answers 
to a specific question to be defined as "No answer."
<P>
In some RARE cases, the disparity may be due to the survey being 
modified after it was released and the results not cleared.  If I 
run across a survey where I feel an additional question should be 
added, I may add the question/answers to the survey - I've only done 
this once and will not do it often.  And in such a case, the rule 
above applies.  If 75 people answered a survey and I decide to add a 
new question, you may notice that one question has 75 less responses 
than all the others - just consider those 75 to be null or "no 
answer" since the question wasn't there before.  This will very 
rarely occur.  I'm more apt to reset an entire survey if I make any 
major changes.
<P>

The END  (for now)

<H3 align=center><i>User Comments [ARCHIVE II]</i></H3>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>Jury were race biased,low education level.
<LI>The issues were more fame and wealth than race or justice
<LI>  
<LI>The trial was a joke and has exposed the gaping holes in the American Legal System.
<LI>I THINK (I'm not pointing any fingers) that the jury was paid off. Even if they hadn't been, the fact that OJ is black would have led them to a verdict of "not guilty" anyway.
<LI>I still have a hard time believing that this media circus pushed real news right out of the way.
<LI>Reasonable doubt was why O.J. was found not guilty
<LI>Waste of money and time.
<LI>Money can't buy happiness, but it can buy freedom
<LI> there was never sufficient evidence to arrest oj the entire episode was a slap in the face of the american people
<LI>Trail went to long, maybe the taxpayers of California can sue the Lawyers for misue of taxpayers funds.
<LI>I stopped even caring after the first month
<LI>O.J. COULD HAVE WON WITH A PUBLIC DEFENDER, BLACK BIAS
<LI>GUILTY!  GUILTY!  GUILTY!
<LI>I cried with Mr. Goldman and felt shocked upon hearing the final verdict.
<LI>I think O.J. should rott in hell with barry schef
<LI>The greatest travesty of justice ever perpetrated
<LI>It took too damn long!
<LI>The outcome of this trial was predictable.  I believe O.J. probably did kill Nicole, but there wasn't enough hard evidence to convict him, and what evidence there was seemed at lest partially tainted and/or planted, which is what really blew the prosecution's case in my opinion.
<LI>Jury system = a failure: Go to a system w a panel of judges
<LI>THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT OJ DID IT, OR THAT THE JURY AQUITTED BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK
<LI>I probably would have voted not guilty as a juror because I think the LAPD broke the chain of evidence in many places. Shredded it would be a better way of putting it. I suspect OJ did the murders, but the LAPD's evidence is suspect enough to make me doub
<LI>GIVE AN OSCAR TO OJ AND SEND HIM TO BOSNIA!
<LI>This case was too hyped up by the media
<LI>The Justice Department should take special emphasis on jury selection: that is, a jury that will serve the interest of the nation as a whole, not for a particular group of people or race.
<LI>I use to think that native American Indians were the most useless race on the planet, but after seeing OJ and Cockrane sniveling all the time, I must say that the niggers are sure giving them a 'race' for their money.
<LI>If you saw and heard it all, you had to go along w/ jury.
<LI>The murders were crimes of passion and should have been prosecuted as such!
<LI>It saddened me deeply that the women jurors thought of themselves first as black and second as women, rather than first as women.
<LI>I think the people who say OJ is guilty are crazy
<LI>OJ is a dirty bastard who will rot in hell
<LI>No one saw O.J Simpson kill Nicole Brown or Ron Goldman and though alot of evidence pointed towards O.J. Simpson the jury found him innocent because the prosecution did not prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt.  I am not saying that O.J Simpson is guity or innocent because none of us was there to see it.  The only people that do know is Ron, Nicole,O.J and God!  O.J wasn't even caught on video camera and the whole world assumes that he is guity but when those police officers beat Rodney King's as
 and the whole world was there to see it they still got off, so I don't want to hear about justice not being served in the O.J trial because justice wasn't served in other areas and I didn't see the world go into convulsions on the verdict of those police officers.
<LI>it sucked 
<LI>I WONDER IF THE TRIAL AFFECTED O.J.'S GOLF GAME.
<LI>The case just proved that the so-called Justice System is broken and all stupid "victims's Rights" laws shoud be removed from the books.  Buy a weapon and get training and to hell with the justice system.
<LI>He did and got away with it and is laughing his ass off now...
<LI>He did and got away with it and is laughing his ass off now...
<LI>very frustrating verdict
<LI>TO ALL OF THE WHITE PEOPLE WHO HAVE  MADE EXTREMELY RACIST REMARKS, I REALLY PITTY YOU.  YOU ACCUSE US OF WRONGFULLY CRYING "RACISM" EVERY TIME SOMETHING GOES WRONGE, YET YOU SIT BACK AND  CALL US NIGGERS AND  PEICES  OF SHIT AND EXPECT US NOT  TO  THINK  THAT YOU FEEL HATRED  TOWARDS US?   YOU EXPECT US  NOT  TO BE DEFENSIVE?   FACE IT, YOU ARE THE ONESWHO ARE  UNEDUCATED IF YOU THINK THAT BLACK PEOPLE ARE THE ONLY ONES COMMITTING CRIMES IN YOUR COUNTRY!   IN THE WORST PARTS OF THE U.S,  (where all of
this  black violenc is comming from)  WHO  DO YOU THINK BUILT A LIQUIR  STORE ON EVERY CORNER?  AND ALL THE GUN SHOPS?  THAT WAS YOU.   HOPING WE WOULD DESTROY OURSELVES.  IT'S  WORKING TOO, BUT BOY DO YOU GET PERTERBED WHEN A BLACK IS SUCCESSFUL, RICH, AND INTELLIGENT!  IF WE'RE SUCH A PROBLEM FOR YOU THEN I'M GLAD, IT WAS YOU WHO  BROUGHT  US HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO GET USED TO IT CAUSE IT'S  TOO  LATE TO TAKE US BACK NOW!!
<LI>It's a sad commentary on both the media and the U.S. public, that this this trial received so much attentioon.   /
<LI>the only race lines were those that the media created.
<LI>Unfortuntely reading from the internet, alot of white americans still do not understand how it is to be a black human being.  We are still treated unfairly through the justice system, why? Economics. White americans do not get pulled over for no reason. White americans do not get beat up by the police as much as miniorities and obviously alot of you still think O.J. is guilty, get a grip! Leave the man alone. The only fault I have against him is beating Nicole! and trust me I as an African female can r
late.
<LI>The jury did not have access to all info the public did so you can't say why they ruled the way they did.  From what I saw (which wasn't everything by a long shot) I was under the impression OJ did it.  There was some doubt but then what is "reasonable" doubt.
<LI>He should have fried.
<LI>Short-term victory.  Eternity in hell for other reasons probably awaits O.J.
<LI>Not Guilty verdict was just showing black power, like getting even with people like Mark Furhman instead of thinking of the mudered victims.
<LI>It was a huge waste of time and iI don't really care what the verdict is/was etc.
<LI>Blacks deserve whatever they get in their neighborhoods
<LI>The lawyers should be taken out into the street and executed!
<LI>I THINK THE VERDICT WAS GREAT!  WHAT REALLY PISSES ME OFF IS ALL THE RACIST COMMENTS THAT PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN ON HERE.  WE'RE NOT ADULTS BUT WE THINK SOME OF THE ADULTS OUT THERE WHO ARE WRITING ALL THOSE RACIST COMMENTS SHOULD LOOK AT YOUR OWN LIFE BEFORE YOU LOOK AT OTHER PEOPLES AND JUDGE THEM UPON THEIR RACE.  IT'S NOT FAIR IF YOU DO NOT KNOW EVERY SINGLE PERSON PERSONALLY FROM EVERY DIFFERENT RACE; TO JUDGE THEM.  I THINK SOME OF YOU SHOULD LOOK IN THE MIRROR ONCE AND A WHILE AND SEE IF YOU LIKE I
.  IF SOME OF THE AUTHORS OF THOSE RACIST COMMENTS LIKE WHAT THEY SEE IN THE MIRROR AND LIKE WHO THEY ARE THIS WORLD IS GETTING SADDER BY THE SECOND AND ALL THE RACISTS OUT THERE AREN'T HELPING TO MAKE THIS WORLD ANY BETTER.  SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT ALL THE CRIMES, EVERY CRIME IS COMITTED BY A VARITEY OF DIFFERENT RACES AND RELIGIONS.  BLAMING ANOTHER RACE IS JUST TAKING THE EASY WAY OUT AND BEING A COWARD.  WE CAN'T SURVIVE IN A WORLD LIKE THIS. WE HAVE TO MAKE SOME CHANGES AND WE HAVE TO MAKE THEM NOW !  
 THINK O.J IS NOT GUILTY BASED UPON ALL THE EVIDENCE(((( THE REAL EVIDENCE NOT RACE)))) THAT IS OUR OPINION IT'S NOT YOUR'S AND YOU ARE INTITLED TO YOUR OWN OPINION.  EXCEPT IT'S PRETTY SAD IF IT'S BASED ON RACE.  THIS IS FROM TWO FOURTEEN YEAR OLD CANADIAN GIRLS WHO WERE APALLED BY THE RACIST COMMENTS THAT ARE PRETTY FREAKY IF YOU ASK US!   
<LI>Is Mark Furhman single 'cause I want him baaaaaaaaaaad !!!!
<LI>The trial as a whole was a big joke.  Justice was not served in the courts, but it will be served when God gets his chance to deal with OJ.
<LI>I have lost my faith in all humanity.  OJ did it!!  The verdict was sickening!!!!!!!!!
<LI>We have finally achieved true equality in this nation -- if you're rich you can get off regardless of your race
<LI>OVER KILL
<LI>if you have money you can get awat withmurder!
<LI>So OJ's actually going to sit down for a no-holds bar interview eh? Why bother? He's only going to lie his black ass off (how un-like a negro). He's obviously doing this in a desperate attempt to gain sympathy before the Civil Suit goes to trial. I think he knows that this jury will probably find him GUILTY (which we all know he is) and he's simply getting desperate. And so he should be. He's not going to have that mother fucker Cockrane on his team this time, whining about racism. This time, he HAS to
answer some questions that were nicely avoided at the criminal trial. Like why he fled, why he a a disguise, cash and his passport with him, why he has no alibi, why he refused to take a lie detector test, and why he never took the stand in his own defense. I hope the Goldmans and the Browns sue his ass off and leave him pennyless...that way he can live in the gutter, which is where he belongs.
<LI>A real circus!
<LI>I'm waiting for LA to fall off into the ocean. I will neither go there or do business there.
<LI>It's sad that the issue became racial
<LI>if O.J's wife was black, the media would not have made an issue about the situation.
<LI>If Charles Manson had Cochran as his lawyer, he walks.
<LI>Too much Media Coverage
<LI>It's not that OJ didn't do it, but that the evidence presented at the trial was so badly handled that it couldn't be PROVED that he did it. Race politics aside, the jury was only doing what juries are supposed to do, look for "reasonable doubt."
<LI>Who else would have had a motive to kill them? OJ was so jealous that Nicole was dating someone else, he went psycho and killed them.  Plus, he beat Nicole even while they were married. What kind of loving husband would do that?  OJ MURDERED BOTH OF THEM. HE IS GUILTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>As a Canadian, I releaze Canadian has a better legal system!
<LI>Sad example of how American "justice" works
<LI>Jury sysyem must be changed.
<LI>MARK FURHMAN:SAD EXCUSE FOR A POLICE OFFICER!!!!!!!.
<LI>O.J. Rules and he is innocent
<LI>Are you kidding me?  He is so guilty.  This could be the worst case of misjustice in the history of the world.
<LI>A black jury acquited a black criminal, What else is new?
<LI>It's digusting that a brutal murderer was set free.  
<LI>The DA's Office and the LAPD blew it!  OJ was guilty.  Defense was sleazy enough to place resonable doubt, but jury was affected by race and punished the LAPD and DA instead of OJ
<LI>This trial represented a deeper rooted problem that we have in our society, and that's the status in which we give the rich and famous in our society.  People keep saying, "If OJ was a normal black or white man, he would be on deathrow."  Of course he would.  We as a society are just as guilty because we act as if these people are saints, when in fact they are some the most disfunctional people in the world.  When OJ was abusing Nicole, and she tried to get help, I'm sure that friends, family members,a
d even clergy advised her to somehow try to make the relationship work.  People probably thought, "Oh that nice, charismatic man, and ex-professional football star can't possibly be abusing his wife."  America depicts people like OJ to be perfect and flawless, when in fact we don't know these people at all.  For those of you who were left with hate and bitterness because of this trial, try to bring about some sort of peace, but don't condemn others for their views, as this is America.  Isn't it supposed to
work for everyone?
<LI>O J was proven not-guilty by the court of law, and still this.  Tell me, if a whiteman was to be on trial for the killing of his wife and another man, where would all the hype be?  Everyday, ever before O J, rich whitemen buy the best defense team their money can afford them.  And they walk free; everyday.  It is kinda funny that a blackman, in this time, can now do the same thing(Ha, Ha!).  Also, there's a general opinion(among whitepeople) that blacks are violent.  Hhaa!  the African race is thee mos
 humanistic living beings on this planet.  Look back, thoughout history death and destruction has been from the hands of whitemen.  If O J did do it, think about where he got the idea from?  Last, if you call us niggers, your holding all the race-cards; and their JOKERS!!!
<LI>White America just can't believe that a black man could get off with killing two white people.  If the two people were black, it wouldn't even have made the news.  All of a sudden when white's don't get their way, the judicial system needs to be reformed, or they have lost their belief in the system.  Wake Up America and realize how deeply ingrained your racism is!
<LI>The only reason he wasnt found guilty is because he had money and he was black. If it had been a poor man that would be all it would take.

<LI>OJ's son did it - OJ helped and took the heat because of his status in the community and because of race.
<LI>OJ is guilty as sin!!
<LI>Fine example of what is wrong with the current "need no warent" system we have today.
<LI>What a grievous shame it was.
<LI>Why isn't there an appeal by the prosecution? Jury selection needs to be re-defined.
<LI>Cartesian doubt is not reasonable doubt.
<LI>The prosecution did what was expected of them, a not guilty verdict.
<LI>Very Very sad at the outcome, guilty man went free!!!
<LI>The jury did their job.  I wish people would stop this notion of how the jury did something wrong.  The make up of the jury by race had nothing to do with it.  I sincerely believe that if the jury had been all white, the verdict would have come out exactl
<LI>Johnny Cochran served no purpose other than to re-enforce the beliefs of Louis FaraKKKahn and other racist black "leaders" that every woe any black ever had was the result of a white man's racism
<LI>It is pretty sad that people automatically thought that OJ was guilty. There was an illigel search of his homestead which certainly doesn't make me feel very secure as a US citizen.  Amazing.  The general public spends all of there time cluck-clucking about how a murderer got off and they don't even realize what is happening to the justice system, as far as our rights as citizens.  They don't even give it a second thought.  They just obediently believe whatever is in the press and whatever the family o
 the victims say in their grief.  Scary stuff.  The police are scary, the media is scary, and the public in general are scary.
<LI>Garcetti and Clark are total failures.
<LI>It proved that if you're rich, you can get away with anything.
<LI>If it doesn't fit you must acquit!
<LI>He is guilty
<LI>The whole thing was a gisgus
<LI>when prosecuters present evidence and testimony from police officers prone to lying under oath, and later they are found to have perjured themselves then the public has to realize that the prosecutions whole case has to be tainted!!!!!!!......period
<LI>It was foolish for the media to add so many false facts about this case.
<LI>TO BE GUILTY,JOIN THE LA PD
<LI>IT SUCKED
<LI>in short, it was a long, meaningless case that could have been handled better.
<LI>I will protest any profit OJ attempts to make from this!!!
<LI>Guilty as home made sin. With this jury it was lost from day one.
<LI>What a farce--it seems Nicole's worst fears came true
<LI>The whole trial was simply a horrible thing.
<LI>THERE WAS SO MUCH EVIDENCE THE JURY MUST BE BLIND
<LI>Man what's wrong with you people! OJ IS GUILTY.  You know it I don't know why people have to think he's innocent just because he was a football player.  He didn't give you anything except entertainment.  He really doesnt even give a shit about you!  And for Johnny Chacran he can stick his deck of race cards up his butt.  I think if he wouldn't have kept dealing the 'race card' the outcome of the trail would have been different.  That really sucks, just because a man is black like you then he's automati
ally innocent.  If he was whit and more than half of of the Jury was white and he got off then the black people would have shouted racisim.  You know it!  I give credit to the prosecution for doing a fine job.  OJ knows he is guilty! He knew it the day of the verdict! So did Johnny Chocrane!  Please these people that think Oj is innocent are due for a reality check!  LOOK AT THE EVIdENCE!  who else would have the motive to kill them?  Drug dealers? YEAH RIGHT!!
<LI>THE DEFENCE WAS ABLE TO GET THIER JURY SEATED AND THAT WAS THE END OF JUSTICE.IF YOU SEAT UNEDUCATED PEOPLE TO HEAR HIGHLY TECHNICAL EVIDENCE YOU CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO GRASP WHAT IS PRESENTED.THE PROSECTION FAILED IN NOT CHALLENGING JUROR'S WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE.IT'S AS IF IN ORDER NOT TO APPEAR TO PLAY THE RACE CARD AND EXECPT ANY JUROR THEY DID'NT UNDERSTAND THIER OWN CASE.
<LI>A travesty of justice.
<LI>Fuck the defence and OJ!
<LI>THe trial was OK, but the verdict SUCKED!
<LI>How could anyone not watch it--it's entertainment
<LI>in our legal system, the issue is not guilty or innocent. It is who presented the better case. In this particular trial, it was definately the defense. Wether or not OJ committed the murders is between OJ and God
<LI>goes to show that money can get you ANYWHERE
<LI>This was the blggest bull-shit trial of the century.  The jury cared about one thing, and that was that a black man was on trial.  There was no true interest in justice. 
<LI>OJ's a lyin' sack of brown nigger shit. So is Johnnie Cockrane. They better both be lookin' over their shoulders the rest of their lives...cause someone's gonna get them.
<LI>The Verdict demonstates an additude of blacks towards whites
<LI>Too much of the evidence was deamed inadmissable. Hang OJ
<LI>verdict says nothing about sexual harassment
<LI>if you didn't watch,then your opinion doesn't count!
<LI>This was the biggest obstruction of justice that has ever been seen.  OJ is as guilty as he is alive and black people today are living in a fantasy land to think that he did not do it and that the LAPD set him up.  That's rediculous!
<LI>OJ did it but it doesn't matter if he's convicted because he won't do it again.
<LI>nooooooooooooooo
<LI>I think OJ had something to do with the murders but he didnt do the actual murders.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>What a load of shit!!! So, how's OJ's 'investigation' going? Has he lifted a finger to "find the real killers"?  Actually, all he'd have to do is look in the mirror and he'd see the fucking killer. I'm so sick of the blacks screaming "racism" every time a black person is arrested by a white cop. Have they stopped to think that maybe if they didn't commit the fucking crime, they WOULDN'T get arrested? The negro race has turned out to be completely useless. I also have a comment for the gentleman who cla
med that the African Negro has contributed nothing to our Society. That's not true. Because of them we have more welfare, more prisons, more lawyers, more drug dealers, more law-enformcent officers, and last but not least, more GUNS. What is really ironic, is that it's only the uneducated black who supports OJ. Why they support a guy who has done less that NOTHING for them (he only hangs around white people and only dates white women)is beyond normal thinking. OJ doesn't give a shit about you!!!
<LI>this case added to my distrust of law enforcement officials
<LI>longest trial
<LI>The trial shiuld not have been about race or celebrity 
<LI>it was big waste of time
<LI>If You have enough money you can buy justice in this country!
<LI>Justice was served. Yeah right! Pigs can fly out my ass too!
<LI>He is fucking guilty
<LI>the trial was sorry
<LI>There were too many cracks in the case to convict, but there will always be that nagging feeling that he did do it!
<LI>Money talks & justice walks.  The one who has the gold, makes the rules
<LI>I think the defense was the sleaziest bunch of lawyers I have ever seen.  NOT A GREAT JOB!! They are a disgrace to the legal system in this country... or perhaps it shows what a disgrace the legal sustem in this country is!
<LI>IT SUCKED! DOWN WITH COURT-TV!!
<LI>Personally I believe O.J. did it, but his defense team did their job by showing a reasonable doubt...I often wonder why O.J. has been so subdued since his acquital.  One would think he would be mad and hell about spending so much time behind bars for a crime he says he didn't commit.  So far he hasn't let out so much as a whimper.  What happended to the "bag" taken away by his lawyer friend?  Where was O.J. for the unaccountable hours?  Why did he have large amouts of cash, checks, a passport, etc. wit
 him during his highway ride?  One thing is for sure, O.J. will answer for what he has done in the end at the final judgement place we will all report to!!!
<LI>What a travesty of justice-anybody else would have been hung.
<LI>We sho watched should have not been so entertained by the murder of two people and the people who made money off of it.
<LI>Remember Nicole & Ron.........
<LI>oj is guilty of the crime of murder and should be hung, shot, lethally injected and electocuted
<LI>It's a sad statement that most blacks just really don't care about crime and have little morals.  That statement makes me a racist I guess but its true.  If anyone thinks otherwise just take a walk in any black neigborhood in any major city late at night and see otherwise.  It's time to stop using racism as an excuse for crime. 
<LI>If you have money you can even buy "innocence"
<LI>O.J. can bite me!!!
<LI>It was considered entertainment by the majority of the public when it should have been taken more seriously.  People lost their lives and the media exploited the incident just because someone famous was involved.
<LI>oj is a sick man. If he wasn't black justice would have prevailed.
<LI>It's not over yet:  "Vengence is mine, I will repay, saith the Lord."
<LI>There was reasonable doubt, and LAPD did a appalling job.
<LI>If the glove had fit, defense would've had a shit!!!!
<LI>The fact that the defense could get away with the large-scale use of ``fake science'' and racist agitation, in addition to the use of focus groups and controlled jury selection, strikes me as a failure of the worst order of the American justice system.
<LI>When are they going to re-open the other cases Mark Furman testified and help convict?  Why is that the Los Angeles distric Attorneys offic can break constitutional rules with no recourse, and finaly Will Gil Garceti have the heart to run for re-election?
<LI>I think that trial was a mockery of the criminal courts systems in the U.S.  The things that went on were both childish and unethical
<LI>it is a crying shame that the two families had to go through such an incredible mess only to be left without knowing exactly who is to blame for these murders.  i think that oj did commit the murders but because of the fact that the weapon was never found and that there were no eye witnesses it makes it hard to eliminate the reasonalbe doubt factor.  However, he still has to make it through the civil suits.
<LI>It sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>OJ may not be known for throwing a football but he is sure hell known for throwing a knife!!!!
<LI>I hope the Brown and Goldman families finally get justice in the civil action. OJ did it.
<LI>The trial was much too long.
<LI>The American Judicial system is designed to product the black minority and white establishment - If OJ was white he would have been convicted.
<LI>Just goes to show you what can be done with MONEY MONEY MONEY
<LI>to long
<LI>Nothing to do with the trial really....I was just thinking of a script for "The Simpsons" and how to tie in OJ. Whadaya think of this: One Homer's ancestors, (say, his great-great-great-great grandmother) was a Southern slut who banged one of the slaves on the plantation her daddy owned. Just trace both sides down to our day, and what do you have?! Give me Homer or Bart anyday over OJ!  Pretty cool idea eh?  I'm wasted at my job here....what the hell AM I doing here any way?
<LI>It's all crap. It was popular just because he is famous!
<LI>whether or not he is guilty, there is reasonable doubt
<LI>the whole thing made me sick!!!
<LI>He did it and only a racist cop and a shrewed lawter made the difference.  I just feel let down by the system.
<LI>Juistice does not exist in America.  If you're rich and/or black, you obviosly can get away with murder!
<LI>The whole circus made me sick
<LI>As long as our judicial system is based on reasonable, I don't believe that a single person should be dissatisfied with the verdict.  There were too many questionable things about this case.  The prosecution failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable do
<LI>Now that it is over with, forget it!
<LI>it sucked
<LI>I belive that race played a big part in the case. I also think that Mark is a liar and a races cop I think they just framed O.J. because of his race and that they put Mark on the case because he is a races COP!!! 
<LI>I think OJ's son and Kato did it.  OJ's son, because of the close DNA.  Kato, because nobody could REALLY be that stupid.
<LI>What a crock
<LI>Americans are sad, if the likes of OJ make prime time.
<LI>I think your mother should get them!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I feel that Kato Kaelin has some knowledge of who dunnit, if he didn't do it himself.
<LI>Although I answered These ?'s --I am pretty sick of hearing about them!
<LI>Too complicated for jurors
<LI>I think they should leave him alone,he deserved to win,and they keep spying on him
<LI>If you want to kill someone do it in LA
<LI>i think the ``trial of the century'' was not only an embarrassment to America, but proved how low our entertainment level has sunk.  the majority of americans, it seems, can watch anything.
<LI>We will avenge the murder of Ron Goldman,an innocent Jew killed by a black nigger. We are the Jewish Defense League and will not tolerate this killing. OJ. You best watch your step. NEVER AGAIN!
<LI>They should investigate OJ for the JFK assasination.Maybe he was involved
<LI>A tragedy.
<LI>Where the hell do I view the poles that were already taken?
<LI>It was about 9 months too long.
<LI>Marcia was unappreciated and overmanaged,  The commentators waffled with each days' news, though Geraldo--God bless him--did the best job of creating an exciting and (generally) knowledgeable exchange on the subject.  Ito should have shut Cochrane down ea
<LI>Too much tv coverage made it very boring
<LI>It was a waste of time because he was innocent.
<LI>Who cares?
<LI>This trial proves the corrupt LAPD and something drastic must be done to ensure justice is not burdened by a police system which is unreliable.
<LI>I think it's very possible OJ did commit murder, however the LAPD screwed up so much that so much reasonable doubt was created. I would have found him not guilty, however I would not have found him "innocent"
<LI>It sucked!
<LI>Guilty as Sin. Why didn't you cross-tab these results by race?
<LI>Celebrity justice is injustice for the rest of society.
<LI>It shows money can buy freedom.
<LI>i dont know whether he is innocent or not, so he is free
<LI>Trial was a travesty; and media coverage, dull as dirt.
<LI>GUILTY!!
<LI>oj should have died!!!!!
<LI>money talks!
<LI>Really, was anyone surprised by the results of this circus, er, trial? O.J. had the cash, he bought the most effective (not necessarily "best") defense, which pulled out all the stops. This clogged the proceedings, the jury of nitwits got bored because they were missing out on "Who's the Boss?" reruns, and conveiniently render a verdict based on "reasonable doubt". Then people who are totally ignorant base everything on race (regardless of their own). All in all, a sorry waste of time and brain matter.
<LI>Pros. did not do their job. Too much doubt and mishandlng of Evidence. The media convicted him before the trial and mis-informed public of what was said in the trial.
<LI>Too higly publicised, take a pill and lie dowm
<LI>Justice will be served when O.J.s children grow up and realize that he killed their mother and they do the same to him!
<LI>He's guilty, the jury musta been stoned
<LI>OJ got away with murder!
<LI>Do not uderstand why so much damning evidence, i.e. Bronco chase, was not presented.
<LI>A bloody mess, and a sure sign of how culturally dumb we are.
<LI>I hope somebody shoots the bastard
<LI>I have lost a lot of faith that I had in the judicial system and in race related problems.
<LI>O.J. Simpson is guity but they didn't prove O.J. did it
<LI>The whole event was a sad sight to see!
<LI>THERE WAS RESONABLE DOUBT, THEREFORE THEY MUST AQUIT!
<LI>I sure was irritated by the jurors who appeared on the talk shows after the verdict. They are so...dim.
<LI>JURY SHOULD BE COMPRISED OF 4 PEOPLE FROM EACH RACE
<LI>The bastard is guilty as hell and walking the streets a free man because of the color of his skin.
<LI>every one involved was for themselves and their own prestige, the victims were forgotten.
<LI>oj got away with murder. i hope he pays some other way!
<LI>A travesty
<LI>Gave ne a better sense of empathy with rioters after the Rodney King verdict!
<LI>I think the race issue was created by the Media.  The only people they interviewed who agreed with the verdict were black and the only people they interviewed who disagreed with the verdict were white.  If anyone had an opinion that did not conform to those race lines, they were never heard.
<LI>O.J. Simpson is the most Guiltiest Son of a Bitch I have ever seen!
<LI>What a disgrace! This was a murder trial, but the prosecution successfully introduced the extraneous matters of race, Mark Fuhrmann, the LAPD.  The jury ought to be indicted for stupidity.  Maybe at least we'll learn a few things from this trial, like: Don't sequester juries.  Require trials to be concluded in a reasonable time period. Johnnie Cochran is a sleazy lawyer in a $700 suit who has, unfortunately, become a celebrity in some quarters.
<LI>not on the trial--but correct spellings are PERJURY AND EMBARRASSMENT
<LI>It was a waste of time.
<LI>I think this trial just goes to show that racism aginst blacks and I think importantly against whites is still very much alive in this country!
<LI>it was very very long!!!
<LI>too long
<LI>as it has been asked...if not oj,then who? he did it!
<LI>I feel that the jury had no evidence of convicting OJ.  Who do you know who where's a sweat suit with fine leather Italian shoes, wouldn't tennis shoes have been more practical??????????? 
<LI>To answer question four fairly you would have to understand the way the judicual system works and
<LI>FURMAN'S PURGERY RUINED THE PROSECUTION
<LI>i didn't actually watch any of it. (what a freak, huh?)
<LI>The American society in a microcosm.
<LI>There was a lot of evidence in the case that we as the public did not get to see or hear...  That makes it difficult to judge how the trial went.
<LI>THE KIDS SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE WITH O J AND THE BROWN FAMILY WITHOUT A LOT OF HASSEL AND ARGUING.  BOTH SIDES LOVE THEM VERY MUCH AND I'M SURE THE KIDS FEEL THE SAME.  THIS NEEDS TO BE A CONCERTED EFFORT ON BOTH SIDES FOR THE SAKE OF SIDNEY AND JUSTIN.
<LI>The message  is  clear  :   money     talks.
<LI>The trial was one of the biggest jokes in the world .th
<LI>The only people (generally) who seem to think that he's innocent, are poor blacks with very limited intelligence. I am so sick of blacks using racism as an excuse for everything. They've been in the U.S. longer than any other "visible miniority" by about 300 years, and yet, even with all the laws forcing businesses and schools to hire them (giving them the edge, in fact), after they can apply for government grants like anyone else, they STILL have not progressed. They generally live in squalor, they ha
e the highest rate of unwed mothers (who naturally go on welfare as they probably don't even know who the father was), and their children learn how to steal cars and sell drugs before they can walk.  As a nation, they are complete losers.
<LI>It is over...  Keep it that way!
<LI>I THINK THERE WAS TOO MUCH HIPE ABOUT THE TRIAL
<LI>it was a sham
<LI>We don't know how he did it but he has there blood on him.
<LI>it was a boring show of crap and i hope i never see it again
<LI>He's guilty as sin!! Burn, oj! Burn!
<LI>the ampunt of money spent on the trial would have kept a third world country fed for a year.....
<LI>Big Damn Joke
<LI>I always knew he was innocent!
<LI>Its a sorry thing that 2 murders had to influence our lives like this..
<LI>What a crock! The entire trial was a joke. OJ is guilty as sin and everyone knows it.
<LI>guilty but let off because of the oppression of the past
<LI>it deeply repulsed me .I felt very ill afterwards .
<LI>the trial sucked!!!!!
<LI>LA law enforcement leaves something to desire.
<LI>SICK, SICK, SICK!
<LI>I think he got away with murder.
<LI>This trial was a total JOKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>This trial shows that race will always be a factor in everything in America.
<LI>We have a faulty judicial system.
<LI>RACISM DOES NOT PAY! ELIMINATE RACISM NOW! LAPD SMARTEN UP!
<LI>The jurors were too stupid to see the facts through their own ignorance!
<LI>he was guilty,but there was reasonable doubt.
<LI>i wish all concerned were caught in a nuclear holocaust!!!!!
<LI>I bet Macia Clark thinks Chris Darden is still doing a good job on her!!!
<LI>THIS SURVEY SUCKS
<LI>glad it's over!
<LI>I think strongly feel that he didn't commit the murders
<LI>OJ got off for many reasons..great defense, prosecution errors in detecting and caring for evidence, racism everywhere, especially in the law enforcement, I think evidence was planted, or totally not taken care of correctly, and the trial was so lengthy the jury also wanted to just go home. I believe OJ was not alone in this and that we will never find out who he protected, altho I have an idea, either way..he got away with it..but for what price..for the rest of his life..I hope! Two people are dead..
e is a free man..I hope he pays for this for the rest of his life.
<LI>Our System is now a BIG JOKE!!!let all of the convicts go free'they let O.J. go free!!!
<LI>defense attys. need more restrictions  
<LI>OJ should fry.
<LI>I think leaving domestic violence evidence out of the trial severly hurt the outcome.  People don't understand the systemic disease and how it can affect even the best of us..
<LI>Nice mole for Marcia.  GOD will try and convict OJ.  Remember that.
<LI>Know the difference between O.J. & Christopher Reeve? O.J. walked!
<LI>There was too much media coverage. I feel that the only reason the media made such a big deal about this case was because OJ was a rich black man and Nicole Simpson was white. Susan Smith drwoned her own children yet her trial was not turned into a media 
<LI>Black jurars will not convict a black celeberty
<LI>O.J. was a wife beater, what's to say he isn't a wife killer!
<LI>I thought it was a disgrace to the United States.  The jury voted not guilty, because he was black & they wanted to make a statement- but in the meatime, they let a murderer free.  They should have made a statement in a positive way, not a negative way.
<LI>He WILL be found guilty in the civil trials!
<LI>hip hip horray
<LI>The fact that a murderer like OJ Simpson is free to walk among us, is a crime in itself.  This has put the black community back another few steps.
<LI>The trial changed me - no longer a liberal.
<LI>WAKE UP WHITE FOLKS, YOU GUYS HAD HIM, DON'T BE MAD AT OJ, IF YOU WERE IN HIS SHOES YOU WOULD DO THE SAME THING, YOU THINK OJ CARES WHAT YOU THINK?  i WOULDN'T, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT YOUR SYSTEM AND M MAKE CHANGESES FROM THE TOP OF YOUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 
<LI>Not racial, it was the jury rules.......reasonable doubt!!!
<LI>Perhaps White America will wake up !
<LI>This verdict made me want to kill somebody
<LI>The trail was a total disgrace.  OJ did it and he got off because he had a whole bunch of money.  He should have been sentenced to the highest form of punishment
<LI>OJ needs todo Naked Gun 4!
<LI>I think that the main reason there were so many problems with this trial is because of all the media coverage.  Also there is no reason that the trial should have taken as long as it did. If it had been anyone besides a celebrity like O.J the trial would have been over and done with before you had the chance to blink!!
<LI>I sincerely hope that future jurors will have to take IQ tests to see if anything is rattling around upstairs.  To hear statements from that big fat black juror stating that wife beating had nothing to do with this murder shows how limited her intelligence must be. Over half of the women who are murdered in the States every year, are murdered BY THEIR SPOUSES OR FORMER SPOUSES!! To say that wife beating is not related to this murder, is like saying that smoking has nothing to do with lung cancer.
<LI>mother always said"What goes around, comes around"
<LI>prosecution did a great job.  the defense did their job, blew smoke over the prosecutions case, BUT they did not disprove anything.
<LI>NO new taxes; NO more OJ!!
<LI>Went out of my way to avoid watching the trial so could not really rate the lawyers other than to say they must of been doing their job.  It's too bad you didn't put OJ's friend Al Crowley on the list of suspects.  He is high on my list as a possible suspect. (Prime suspect for a Murder Mystery <grin>
<LI>it was the biggest farce of the century
<LI>IF YOU WANT JUSTICE YOU NEED TO HAVE PLENTY OF $$$$$$$
<LI>Bull shit,people...money can buy you a freedom...
<LI>Now, if he'd have been poor, he would have been found guilty. Its not so much a race issue as a class issue.
<LI>I think that the total case was based upon fucking race card from the begining: note to O.J. kiss my ass, you killer
<LI>Now what am I supposed to watch on TV???
<LI>To much time spent on racecial issues. DNA validity most people are not qualified to understand even the lawyers didn't
<LI>Only in the United States... makes me happy to be Canadian.
<LI>He was acqitted to prevent race riots in LA
<LI>ITS A SAD DAY IN AMERICA WHEN SOMEONE CAN GET AWAY WITH A DOUBLE MURDER!
<LI>I believe tha they should look at other possible people who may have had a reason for seeing Nicole and Ron dead and for giving a lot of greif to OJ.  One of the most prominent that I can think of is KATO .  I have asked a few people I know, including some psychics.  All of them think that he is a good suspect.  Why doen`t the LAPD pursue this
<LI>Thank God it's over!!
<LI>OJ has his own right to protest from his wife from doing drugs dealing or whore.
<LI>Total waste of Tax Payer's $$,$$$,$$$,$$$
<LI>satan rules and oj is gay
<LI>O.J. is as guilty as sin!
<LI>The whole system was a joke, as a black woman, I felt violated by the whole thing.  It was a sad day.
<LI>It sure blows my image of trials being like Perry Mason!! If your gonna kill someone you'd better be rich!
<LI>greatly disappointed
<LI>It destroyed the system of American Justice, and was nothing but a Circus.  It looked like Washington, District of Crooks
<LI>It's an extreme case. It doesn't say anything in terms of this country's legal system.
<LI>It sucked!
<LI>nordberg should burn in HELL!!!
<LI>If there's enough money, anything can be bought...including justice.
<LI>if the media hadn't gotten involved it would of been a much fairer trial. But that's America for you.
<LI>It's surprising how people are found guilty before innocent
<LI>Whatever happened to Al Cowlings?
<LI>Why did he flee in the Bronco if he was not guilty?!?!
<LI>This trial was a joke.  It just reaffirms that money CAN buy everything!
<LI>A lack of solid evident and sloppy work proved him innocent. 
<LI>Lawers exist in a moral vacuum.  Truth and justice had nothing to do with this trial.  Two people died and a cottage industry was created.  All that is ugly in human nature was on full display.
<LI>The trial took too long, they were presenting too much stuff that was not relevant to the case. 
<LI>My faith has never been in the police, but in our citizens
<LI>THE VERDICT WAS A SAD COMMENTARY BOTH IN TERMS OF THE LEVEL OF SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES.  THAT THE JURY WOULD TOTALLY DISMISS THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ON THE BASIS OF A RIDICULOUS ACCUSATION OF EVIDENCE TAMPERING IS BEYOND ME.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>It was a total waste of tv air time
<LI>you all are a bunch of cornballs.
<LI>Jury system sucks shit
<LI>Cochran in a pig who always brings race into a non-racial case! He should be shot!
<LI>This was a racist jury If OJ was white he would be guilty
<LI>It was a travesty.
<LI>The trial sucks big time!
<LI>He was obviously guilty, but the prosecution screwed up
<LI>All said and done, whether OJ was guilty is now irrelevant. The state failed to provide enough evidence (and much of that they did provide was of a questionable nature) and in the end, that was Marcia Clark's resxponsibility. She should never have gone to trial knowing that her case was built on lies if she really believed he was guilty. Miscarriage of justice it might have been, but the jury only acted within their remit. As for money - of course OJ bought the Not Guilty verdict *because he could affo
d a top of the range legal team*. There are no laws against having the best money can buy. But the guy was found not guilty, so leave him alone, and sort out the real problems with the country - namely those of race relations.
<LI>who cares anymore??
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY!
<LI>Rush to judgement prevented proving anyone guilty.
<LI>To bad Milk could not be the juice ? Then we could have said what trial? THIS IS ALL PART OF THE PLAN. MY ARIAN BROTHERS WE  MUST ASK OURSELVES  NOT TO BE SO JUDGEMENTAL OF THE BLACK. AFTER ALL WE FOOLE THEM FOR ALL THIS TIME. THEY WERE PRAYING TO A VERSI
<LI>If OJ was a White person there would not have been so much publicity! 
<LI>it was a pathetic excuse for a trial
<LI>We all would like to have the juices money! Because man he sure get's a lot of white putane!
<LI>Having been on juries in serious cases, all I can say is that the prosecution *MUST* prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt - if they do not, the only possible vote for the jury members is 'not guilty' even if they think the person is.
<LI>National Crisis
<LI>oj should have been hung with piano wire
<LI>I think America is a racist society that needs some serious 
<LI>ATHLETES DO NO WRONG
<LI>UM HELLO DNA DOESN'T LIE
<LI>Johhnie Cockran, like him or not, is a credit to the legal system.  He did what he was paid to do.  The LAPD & DA's Office got the messages they need to "reconsttruct". Finally, I think the American people are smarter than one would imagine. Conclusion, let's face it---"They all performed for the media.""
<LI>It's FINALLY over.
<LI>All jurors say they think he's innocent, none of them claimed reasonable doubt
<LI>I believe that the prosecution flubbed it, and that the jury was influenced by race, purgery, tired of serving, and protesting the LAPD all in one.
<LI>OJ Sucks
<LI>Help the Browns recover and maintain custody of minors involved.
<LI>The Justice system has not kept pace with Society.
<LI>The primary factor which helped O.J. be acquitted of his crimes was his social and financial status.  Had any other man of lower social stature been accused of committing these crimes, be him black or white, he would have been sentenced to death.  
<LI>The more important issue is not race, but money. If OJ had been a poor black or a poor white, he would probably have been found guilty, but if he had been a rich white, he would have been found innocent. Wealth can and does pervert justice.
<LI>dissapointed at the outcome
<LI>The jurors wanted the fame and fortune for serving in the OJ trial.
<LI>Only in Californa, the land of fruits & nuts could such a travesty of justice occur.  The whole thing made a mockary of the criminal justice system.
<LI>GUITLTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>The O.J. Simpson trial was a public hanging. It was a statement on the bastard white folks that run this damned country.
<LI>It was important that overall mistrust in the Police Department were raised, however it was at the expense of the victim's lives.
<LI>The world is laughing at America -Again...
<LI>This trial was over publisised, too long, and it had a bad conclution.
<LI>I dont believe there was any way a black jury would convict O J 
<LI>I think this whole black white thing has got to end!  The Nation of Islam can go to HELL.  If it had been a white man accused  of murdering two blacks and the Arian Nation was standing behind him waiting for the verdict there would of been WW3 here in the USA.  Wake up people deal with your ansestors trial and tribulations and stop trying to punish this generation  for things we never did or could never concive!
<LI>THE BLACK HAS NO INTENTION OF BECOMING PART OF THIS SOCIETY. I'LL SAY THIS TO ALL THE BLACKS OUT THERE, YOU ARE MAKING FOOLS OF YOURSELF BY BLAMING ALL YOUR PROBLEMS ON THE WHITES. IT IS YOU THAT TRASHED THE INTER-CITIES OF THIS COUNTRY. IT IS YOU THAT HAS RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM. IT IS YOU THAT ARE KILLING EACH OTHER THROUGH YOUR GANG VIOLENCE AND THE LIKE. MOST OF THE BLACKS HAVE NO INTENTION OF GETTING OUT OF THE GUTTER. BY NATURE, THE BLACK CANNOT LIVE IN A CIVILIZED SOCIETY, LOOK AT AFRICA AND HA
TI !
<LI>It don't think the jurors were a bunch of racists. They were tired, The DNA sampling and analytical protocols  appeared to overwhelm them.
<LI>The jury was ignorant and demonstates one of our society's major problem: lack of education
<LI>OJ is guilty as Hell and the only reason he got off was because he was black and so was the whole damn jury.  I don't mean this to sound racial.  No offense implied.
<LI>I think that the "statement on the issue of race" that the jury made has done much more harm than good...it's divided the classes and races of the American public.
<LI>This is a sad commentary on American SOCIETY.
<LI>He should appear on Letterman
<LI>Justice was not served w/the verdict.
<LI>Money buys freedom.
<LI>OJ was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  Maybe there was some doubt, but no reasonable doubt.
<LI>I believe race was a factor in the verdict because it WAS a factor in Mark Furman's purgery.  However, I believe the verdict was a statement of the people that whenever possible, heavyhanded governments agents will be rendered impotent to destroy a person
<LI>sad state of affairs on the current state of this country
<LI>Don't blame the jury sloppy work on all sides of justice 
<LI>Everyone who was invovled in the trial has no private life right now.
<LI>oj is a piece of shit
<LI>O.J. is Gulity
<LI>It sucked.
<LI>Shakespeare was right; if you want injustice, kill all the lawyers.
<LI>Not Guilty!!!
<LI>If the Butcher of Brentwood didn't do it then Monkeys will fly out of my BUTT!!
<LI>Orenthal James Simpson is proof that money is the only thing that counts in todays world.
<LI>Jury made the right decision, even though he was guilty.
<LI>I think that there was reasonable doubt.  We will never know if he really did it, but he was acquitted, so people need to let it go.  That show has been CANCELED!!!
<LI>O.J. was guily as @#$&!  Racism was a big part.
<LI>A complete joke, I wish it was never televised.
<LI>I wish the mediadidn' made out to be as big a deal as it was.
<LI>O.J. Simpson had a knife
<LI>I personnaly thought there was too much covery and it interupted a lot television showa here in Canada
<LI>I am considering moving to another country. Guilty Uncle Tom.
<LI>I think that O.J. is completely innocent but I don't think he actually killed them.  
<LI>The evidence was there.  LAPD self-destructed.  Furhman is a poor use of protoplasm.
<LI>Missed my soaps
<LI>god, why do so many people care about this OJ thing?  i'm only answering this survey because i'm bored while FTP'ing stuff...
<LI>OJ is guilty as SIN!!!
<LI>O.J is the only suspect in this trial, if he's innocent... then who did it?
<LI>According to the media, no one wants OJ around.....he's welcome to come live near us!
<LI>The US of A on its way down the drain. So long.
<LI>OJ and Nicole had no race issue, why should we? The jury did
<LI>O.j. Simpson will end up dead sometime, Goldberg's father will not let this rest. Simpson is a criminal and should be an emmbarrassment to the black community!
<LI>HOPE THEY THROW THE MURDERER OUT WHEN HE COMES TO A.C. NJ
<LI>The trial was over-publicised, and the prosecution screwed it up beyond help! Marcia Clark to me, was a whiny bitch! She needs to regroup!
<LI>Travesty!
<LI>OJ is just a nigger who got away with murder.
<LI>disgusting
<LI>i would like to eat o.j. poop
<LI>If the jurors understood DNA, guilty verdict.
<LI>Mark Furhmen wanted to fuck O.J. Simpson.  You could see it in his eyes!!
<LI>California Circus
<LI>Can't buy me love, but can buy me justice
<LI>I think he did it, doesn't matter what his colour was He's a piece of shit !
<LI>If anyone hires "OJ" in his life,I will actively picket and boycott them. He should exile himself to another country.
<LI>The media think they own the world
<LI>Virginia hasn't learned a thing from this trial.
<LI>oj simpson is no longer a her
<LI>I still can't believe the jury did not find enoughmevidence to find him guilty?????
<LI>The defense, especially Cochran, is SLEEZE and RACIST!
<LI>I am a white middle class male.  I live in Kansas City, and have never met the LAPD or anyone else in LA.  Yet, after seeing the evidence, I find reasonable doubt.  Not because of race, but because of the facts.  By the way, check out Steven Emerson's new (and old) books.  The inside word on terrorism and the middle East.  (Also read his frequent guest columns in the New York Times.  He's my favorite journalist!!)
<LI>if OJ is a Killer, he WILL FRY IN HELL..
<LI>THis is just the latest in a string of disastrous failures for the LAPD and the LA prosecutors.   Remember the McMartin preschool trial, in which all of the defendants were acquitted because all of that satan worship evidence was a load of *BULLSHIT?*  That was another famous Gil Carcetti performance.  The police and prosecutors in LA have pissed away all of their credibility.
<LI>whata a joke of a trial
<LI>THANK GOD IT IS OVER!!
<LI>it was a very long, drawn out process. Even though he was found not guilty, I feel that if he didn't do it, who did?  The children should be put into his custody, however, because there is no reason for him to not be with his children.  He was found not guilty.
<LI>O.J. was aquitted,live with the verdict and let him get on with his life.
<LI>He was a wife-beater, and he is scum for that; but that had _nothing_ to do with killing Ron and Nichole, and should not have been evidence. The entire trial was a travesty.
<LI>I think that the worst part about the whole think is that Sidney and Justin have to grow up without their mommy, and know that she was murdered.  The children always suffer the most.
<LI>No truth and no justice... If you have the money.
<LI>the justice system has long been a mess --people know that now. This could be good eventually if it leads to reforms
<LI>Justice is blind, and a man is innocent until PROVEN guilty
<LI>Fair coverage since the trial shouldn't have been on TV
<LI>People are very pig headed.  They can't the not guilty  verdict.....Well Tough!
<LI>MONEY TALKS AND BULLSHIT WALKS!!
<LI>I THINK IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A SIDE-SHOW CIRCUS!
<LI>I am an Indian and I came to U.S.A to do my Masters in computer science.  I am not a O.J fan nor do I know anything about football.  Only a couple of years back I came to your country.  The trial was a good exposure of the American Justice system.  I have that gut feeling that OJ did commit those murders but the prosecution was a total failure.  They just did not prove their case.  The bottom line is the American Justice system did work.  OJ was not convicted b'coz of miserable failures of the law enfo
cers namely the LAPD and the prosecutors.
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY. But of course he was let go "to make a statement on racism." [a.k.a. disregard the evidence]. But what did you expect?
<LI>If OJ did it, why wasn't there more blood in the bronco?
<LI>If you assume that the evidence wasn't ALL fabricated, then the only thing that makes sense is that OJ did it.
<LI>Send OJ lots of mirrors to help him in his search for the murderer
<LI>THE OJ SIMPSON TRIAL SHOWS HOW HIPOCRITICAL THE BLACK ARE AND HOW THEY ARE THE TRUE RACISTS. OJ GOT OFF NOT BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT HE WAS INNOCENT BUT BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK.  NOW YOU HEAR ALL THESE BLACKS DENIYING IT, BUT REALLY STOP IT CAUSE WE ALL KNOW THE
<LI>those who picked the jury should be looking for new jobs.
<LI>it is a sad statement of affairs media wise, political wise and justice wise
<LI>The jury eduation was saddenly laking resulting in a not guilty. 
<LI>I hope Ron Goldman's dad kills O.J.!
<LI>I am sick and tired about hearing O.J. all the time
<LI>I think it is absolutely sick that a obviosly guilty man was set free because the jury was practically illiterate and O.J. is famous!!!!
<LI>THEY TRASH OUR INTER-CITIES, THEY RAPE OUR WELFARE SYSTEM, THEIR CRY BABY TACTICS HAVE CAUSED LIBERIAL AMERICA TO FOLLOW THEIR DESTRUCTIVE WAKE. LETS FACE IT THE BLACK DOES NOT WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS SOCIETY, NEVER HAS, NEVER WILL. I', GLAD THE SIMPSONS JURIES FINALLY BROUGHT THE WAKE UP CALL TO AMERICA. BLACKS HAVE BEEN AND ARE RACIST !!!!
<LI>Here is an example of how a GUILTY SCUMBAG can buy a not guilty p verdict.  It is significant that the decision did not find that simpson did not commit the murders,simply that the jury could not findd the gumption to send him to the chair given the poor case presented but fuhrmann and some others. SIMPSON IS GUILTY AND EVERYONE KNOWS THATT  ESPECIALLY SIMPSON AND COCHRANE.
<LI>I think it was a downfall for our jusyice system and I'm outraged
<LI>OJ SHOULD BE HUNG RIGHT ALONG SIDE MARK FUHRMAN AS WELL AS THE JURORS AND THE DEFENSE TEAM
<LI>justice was not served!!
<LI>A distressing statement of how bad race relations are in the US.
<LI>Said from the beginning HE DIDN'T DO IT !!!
<LI>keep it off TV in the future
<LI>Too much publicity.  Too much time elapse because of junk brought in.
<LI>He is guilty !!! There should be reason to retry him. Possibly investigate the Jury's quick deliberation.
<LI>What happened to the wife  abuse allegations. I think that the whole crime happened due to the escalation of O.J. 's jealousy and obsession with Nicole and that should have been concentrated on more than the "race issue" which apparently was not an issue for Nicole and O.J. at all!
<LI>The only reason OJ was aquitted is because he is BLACK
<LI>OJ is hot on the trail of the murder/s and does not believe there on any golf courses in Fl.
<LI>The jurors apparently thought they were judging a debate, rather than addressing the central question, did he do it.   
<LI>The jury was far too black.
<LI>I'm glad it's over
<LI>O.J. is filthy sleaza and being a celebrity in this country should not mean that you are allowed to commit a double murder and then not be found guilty by a jury whos race is bearly O.J.'s own.  If you want a jury of his peers lets find his old, white, go

Compatibility & Troubleshooting</H2>
<H4>

This page is primarily for those who are having problems submitting survey results.
There have been a number of documented cases of users being unable to submit survey
data.  In most cases this is the result of one of two things:

<UL>
<LI>A bug in the browser software - Some versions of America Online's web browser have
known bugs relating to forms handling.  AOL recommends trying one of two things: first
attempt to turn off some setting in the browser relating to "compressed graphics", or
second (recommended) go to keyword "NETSCAPE" on AOL and download the Netscape browser
and Winsock software - this is definitely the best route to go since Netscape is the
standard, and moving away from AOL's browser and using Winsock will also allow you to
access other services and features.  (and SURVEY.NET looks 1000% nicer through Netscape
or Internet Explorer)

<P>

<LI>Another possibility is that you have limited system resources (either temporarily or
the result of minimal RAM or hard drive space).  Microsoft Windows (all versions) is not
reknown for being efficient in handling memory allocation (and de-allocation), therefore
it's entirely possible that if you have a lot of applications active, or previously ran
a program on the machine which may have left a "memory hole", that your system may be
unstable and you're unaware of this.  If you've been working on your computer all day, it's
a smart move to occasionally shut down all applications and reboot just to make sure 
that there aren't any remnants from previous programs that can cause problems.  The beauty
of Windows is that quite often, the program that crashes may not be the program that's actually
misbehaving - it could be something you ran an hour ago.
<P>
Contrary to what you might have heard about <I>minimum system requirements</I>, especially
in the area of RAM, they are usually <I>too</I> minimum for some intensive applications.  If
you're running Windows with less than 8 Megs of RAM on the Internet, there's always a possibility
that your system will run out of resources.

</UL>
<H3>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="warning">
Receiving a warning message about multiple survey submissions when you've only submitted a survey
for the first time...</A>
</H3><H4>

Some systems, namely America Online and Prodigy and similar networks provide internet access
through a Firewall - what this means is that SURVEY.NET cannot uniquely identify users.  As
a result, there is a possibility that you might get a warning message which tells you your
survey results are not going to be counted - the system thinks you are trying to "spam" the
survey and is issuing a warning.
<P>
In some cases you did nothing wrong - it's simply a question of timing - if too many people
hit SURVEY.NET from the same Firewall, the system may reject one or more of the submissions.  The
best thing to do is wait a little while and try again - there's not a whole lot I can do to
compensate for this without exposing the survey data to possible tampering.  I encourage the
major online services to deal with this issue - they can and should provide a means for outside
systems to uniquely identify users.  
<P>

<A HREF="http://www.survey.net/faq.htm">SURVEY.NET Frequently-Asked Questions</A> page.

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT SIZE=2><I>
Welcome to the Survey-Net SEX questionnaire!  Since the internet seems to amplify the typically taboo desires of individuals, we thought we should 
find out more about the desires and opinions of those online relating to sex.
<P>
Please <strong>honestly</strong> answer these questions.  This Survey is <font size=+2>completely anonymous</font> - at no time are any individual survey answers written to disk - they're instantly added to the master database; and of course, we really have no idea WHO you are in the first place - so answer truthfully.
<P>
We apologize if anyone is offended by the questions/responses in this survey.  While the survey covers "pornographic" topics, the survey itself is NOT pornographic - fill out the questionnaire and learn more...
</I>
<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://www.survey.net/mpr/survey?sex1">

<FONT color="#ff0000">NOTE:</FONT> This survey is a work in progress.  I'm going to use some commonly-found abbreviations for various things.  It would be a safe assumption that if you don't know what the abbreviation/reference means, you don't fit into that category.
<P>
There are also a LOT of fields in this form - some browsers may not handle it well.

Official SURVEY.NET Policy</H2>
<H4>

There aren't a whole lot of rules around here.  You are encouraged to fully express your
opinions in filling out surveys, specifying comments and editorial, <I>however</I>, there
are a few things to note:

<UL>

<LI><B>COMPLETE EACH SURVEY ONE TIME ONLY!</B>  This is the one cardinal rule of SURVEY.NET.  You
should only complete each survey <I>once</I>.  While there are safeguards in place to protect
against multiple submissions, even if you have two completely separate accounts on different
systems, please only fill out a questionnaire one time.  
<P>
This is <I>extremely important</I>, and I will take action against anyone caught spamming
or attempting to taint the survey data.  Logs are maintained of all activity, and while the
actual survey data is anonymous, I can clearly identify malicious activity and multiple
submissions of surveys - when this happens I will BAN you (or possibly your ENTIRE system) 
from participating in any surveys, and will notify your Service Provider and give
them evidence of this activity - while I might not be able to tell exactly who the person
is doing the dirty-work, with the cooperation of an ISP, a person can be identified and
action can and will be taken.  
<P>
It is only with displeasure that I occasionally have to take this sort of action, and it's
not very often; the system's ability to "weed out" bad and redundant surveys is
pretty good at automating this process, but even when an attempt fails, the activity is logged
and I will ban users who have these "red flags."  
<P>
SURVEY.NET is only as good as the DATA we accumulate - and anyone attempting to taint the survey
data by spamming or submitting multiple forms is undermining everybody else's hard work, as well
as my own.  This will not be tolerated, and it's probably illegal under many jurisdictions.
<P>

<LI>SURVEY.NET IS A <I>FREEDOM OF SPEECH</I> ZONE with virtually no exceptions - This 
means that we <I>fully</I> respect one's ability to express themselves in 
whatever manner they desire (as long as it doesn't violate any of our other rules).  
Our system is automated 
for the most part, and user-specified comments are generally not screened unless they contain
some characters or HTML tokens which are not allowed, otherwise <I>there is no censorship of
any kind</I>.  We ask that people do not abuse this principal - it should be fairly easy to
express even the most passionate opinion without resorting to expletives and "4-letter words."
<P>
<I>With the entire world community able to participate in our surveys, it would
be hypocritical and unrealistic to impose any sort of "moral guidelines" regarding what people
can and cannot say.   As a result, there's no telling what kind of comments you might find, so
keep this in mind.  On the other hand, if you're not somewhat offended by something on this
site, that's a sign that we're not doing as good of a job - because we aim to attract a diverse
group of people to SURVEY.NET, and we don't expect them to all have homogenous opinions on
the issues.</I>
<P>

<LI>OUR SURVEY DATA AND COLLECTION PROCESS IS ROUTINELY MONITORED - As a result, from time-to-time,
I notice unusual increases in activity or radical changes to survey data.  When this happens,
depending upon the circumstance and the log files, I may take some sort of action in order to
find out what's going on.  First, I'll check the log files and see if I can identify any
malicious activity, if not, then I may take some sort of preemptive action in order to figure
out where this sudden burst of activity is coming from.  In the past I have temporarily
"locked-out" answers in surveys or temporarily banned users or systems until more information
becomes available to explain the surges in votes for particular answers in the surveys.
<P>
Sometimes, this activity is legitimate - other times it is not.  If all of a sudden, the
results of a survey dramatically change, I will need some evidence to indicate WHY before
I allow the trend to continue.  Generally, this tends to be the result of some organized
group aggressively directing people towards the site.  As long as they follow SURVEY.NET Policy
and each respondent is unique, if they provide evidence of their campaign to direct users
to the survey, I will allow the results to stand.  (This evidence can come in a variety of
forms: providing me with a URL from an active site which shows redirection of people to 
SURVEY.NET, copies of mailing list correspondence, etc.)  
<P>
Generally, when a survey's results dramatically change, I feel compelled to notify the community
(usually in the <I>Letters</I> page) of this occurance and what's going on.  I often incite
people on both sides of the fence: some who complain about my action or exposure, and others
who are upset that the survey data doesn't appear to be accurate or representative.  At the
present time, I reserve the right to take some sort of action in these circumstances; if you
don't like it - I'm sorry, but my priority is to protect the integrity of the data and the
collection process.  Sometimes this means exposing campaigns to exploit SURVEY.NET; other times
it involves defending unrealistic data that was properly submitted to SURVEY.NET.  As long as
each respondent is unique, I have no choice but to allow the survey results to stand.
<P>


<LI>SURVEY.NET *DOES* HAVE A "HIDDEN AGENDA" - Okay, you've badgered me into admitting that
there is possibly some underlying objective to SURVEY.NET.
<P>
If anything, SURVEY.NET has as a goal, to make more people aware of the diversity of humanity,
and that ultimately we should all respect each others' opinions regardless of whether they
coalesce with our own.  Every person on this earth has at least one pearl of wisdom that if
shared, may help somebody else.  If SURVEY.NET can act as a catalyst in helping people 
further understand humanity and society, we all might make the world a better place in one
way or another.  If we have a "hidden agenda", this is it.

<H3 align=center><i>User Comments [ARCHIVE I]</i></H3>

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_OJ -->
<LI>O J bought his way out of a murder conviction.  The issue of murder got lost.
<LI>If you think OJ is still guilty. Then you must let out everybody convected by a jury if they were guilty. I don't see any body standing for the "system"
<LI>media coverage:  saturation;  trial process:  slow, deliberate;  jury decision process:  non-deliberative.  Justice done:  yes, within the guidelines given the jury.  If there is a desire for change, define deliberation for the jury.
<LI>What a sad state of affairs to have this thing crammed down our collective throats!
<LI>OJ & Mark Fuhrman: good luck, and keep looking over your shoulder
<LI>I'm not a US ciizen: it re-inforced all my worst prejudices about Americans' inability to distinguish between form and substance; and their romantic rather than realistic view of the world (eg the Forrest Gump Oscar
<LI>CNN became OJNN. Sensationalism won out over real news. If you notice, the only major newscast that wasn't OJ-drenched was the PBS Newshour? Know why? They don't depend on ratings. Clear example that networks and cable news don't care about providing information, just ratings. It's sad. Really sad. NBC was by far the worst, but that doesn't surprise me. They've spent the last few weeks trying to scare old people into thinking medicare is going away, too. As for the trial itself, no one who was not in t
at jury box has the right to claim that they know what the verdict should be. Outside the jury, we were undoubtedly influenced by the media analysis. Those who are saying "justice was not served" are pathetic. Those who are saying, "this is a victory for Black america" are also pathetic. America is looking bleaker every day. God help us.
<LI>The beginning of the end for American Civilization.
<LI>It only takes MONEY
<LI>The O.J. trial was a fat og of shit, floating in the toilet of America.
<LI>It was a completely inane thing for the American people to waste their collective time on.
<LI>OJ did it and everyone knows it, just 12 people think there was a tiny reaon he didn't because they didn't hear all the evidence that would have fried OJ's ass. OJ will live it up know because people want to even know what toothpaste he uses since the trial. The only reason people thought he was innocent was because they were in a group and he was a hero.
<LI>I got real sick of hearing about nothing but OJ. Also, I think a few of the jurors might have been paid off by the defense. Whoever wasn't was probably afraid of the riots that would undoubtedly have taken place if OJ was convicted.
<LI>it was a sham
<LI>I am surprised that the justice system did not convict and innocent black men!
<LI>Guilty
<LI>If Ron Goldman was a Black Belt Karate expert why didn't he fight back?  There had to be more than one person who did the killing.
<LI>Bullshit
<LI>I think that Johnnie Cochran, in the win at any cost move of raising racial tension issues to cloud the case and get an emotional verdict, has set race relations back 20 years. I thought there was a bottom depth to what a lawyer would go to to win, but a 
<LI>Hang all the lawyers...we need a judicial overhaul!
<LI>THE RACECARD DID It,
<LI>WELL, I'M GLAD TO SEE THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC IS STARTING TO REACT TO WHAT THE BLACKMAN HAS BEEN PULLING FOR A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME IN OUR COUNTRY. LETS SHOW THE BLACK THAT WE WILL NO LONGER STAND BY AND LET THEM TRASH OUR INTER-CITIES, OUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND SCHOOLS. THE BLACK CAN BE A RACIST, HAS BEEN A RACIST AND IS A RACIST FREE LOADING ON THE SKIRTS OF THE FINEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. JUST GET THE HELL OUT BLACKMAN, WE DON'T CARE FOR YOUR KIND ANYMORE !
<LI>I think the trial took to long!
<LI>Glad it's over - even though he walked!!!
<LI>eat at mo's
<LI>money/fame wins everytime
<LI>I feel that the verdict is correct because "reasonable doubt" was very present.  Even if O.J. is guilty, he had to be acquitted due to the way our justice system is established on the premise of "innocent until proven guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt."
<LI>During the trial, I constantly heard the term " African-American". If a person is born in Africa and then becomes a citizen  of the U.S., they are an African-American. If you were born here, you are black. On applications it states White, not European-American. And to the "educated" BLACK person who called us cave people, I bet you thought O,J, was innocent and supported the racist Million Man March. And people say that blacks can not be racist. Just do us a favor, keep blaming everything on our ancest
rs and fall deeper into the hole of poverty. Thank You!
<LI>AS ONE FROM KOREA, I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE BLACK HAS NEVER MADE AN EFFORT OR ATTEMPT TO BECOME A PART OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY. AMERICANS MUST BECOME TO REALIZE THAT THE BLACK DOES NOT WANT TO BE A PART OF AMERICA, THEY DO NOT WANT TO STRAIGHTEN OUT THEIR OWN PEOPLE, THEY WANT TO ONLY BLAME THE WHITE AMERICA FOR THEIR PROBLEMS. AS AN OUTSIDER, THE BLACK HAS CAUSED HIS OWN PROBLEMS. I WISH THEY WOULD LEAVE THE AMERICAN COUNTRY AND LET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE PART OF THE SOCIETY ENJOY IT.
<LI>During the trial, I constantly heard the term " African-American". If a person is born in Africa and then becomes a citizen  of the U.S., they are an African-American. If you were born here, you are black. On applications it states White, not European-American. And to the "educated" BLACK person who called us cave people, I bet you thought O,J, was guilty and supported the racist Million Man March. And people say that blacks can not be racist. Just do us a favor, keep blaming everything on our ancestor
 and fall deeper into the hole of poverty. Thank You!
<LI>This was a case of who could exploite it and make the most money and publicity out of it. The juror's had to find him not guilty to lock up thier exclusive rights to the trial for monitary gain. It was also the platform for the biggest Black Nazi like raciest Rev. F. (guess who). The theme of this trial was not justice but who can make the biggest buck.
<LI>OJ is a big BROWN piece of SHIT that got away with murder and many other pieces of shit happy because of it. Not because an innocent man got off but because a guilty BLACK man did. RACISTS RACISTS RACISTS.
<LI>I THINK THAT RACE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE VERDICT, AND THAT IN ITSELF IS SAD.
<LI>Black unity is going to foster a race war
<LI>too many blacks on jury
<LI>He got away with murder and the jury had no intention of convicting him. the minute the jury was selected the case was over.
<LI>Other countries now think we're all stupid for the whole trial issue.
<LI>The trial was sort of interesting
<LI>As I read some of the comments, I was wondering what the hell is an African-American. If you did'nt move to the U.S. from Africa, you are black. I am not called a French-American because some of my family lived there hundreds of years ago. And this oppression shit, we don't owe you all a damn thing. Do you think honestly believe that if your "oppressed" ancestors saw you today that they would be proud. I know just as many blacks as I know niggers and I know just as many whites as I know white trash. Th
s case was nithing but race and it hurt the black community more than it helped it. The only reason the Million Man March should'nt have been bombed is because it was held in our nation's capital. That was a poor excuse to express racist views. People need to realize that any culture can be just as racist as another. To the NIGGER that called us cave people, FUCK YOU. I got a 12 guage, long rope, and a tall oak tree for your black ass.
<LI>Glad it's over!
<LI>If a white man killed two blacks, blacks would say guilty!
<LI>He's guilty or a thousand coincidences did it. You judge.
<LI>I'M SICK OF HEARING ABOUT OJ
<LI>the verdict was not guilty so lets shut our mouths and let oj live his life the way he wants get off his back if he did he will pay GOD knows and see everything nicole was not angel she was drug user and gay so was ron goldmand face it
<LI>The verdict was a joke, now a know killer is walking free.  Watch out Paula!!!!
<LI>Money talks
<LI>I'm ashamed at the Afro American community's reaction to the verdict. They could have kept thier jubilation to themselves out of respect for Brown and Golman families. I think the reaction only supported negative impressions held towards the African Ameri
<LI>Guilty, but not enough evidence to convict.
<LI>Perhaps those who feel the trial is unfair should think about what it must have been like for all people of color who had to woory about a fair trial for more than 100 years.
<LI>They should televise more trials so that everyone can see what is right and wrong with our Justice system.
<LI>70 murders are committed a day in america , why is this one so important?The racial issue : the accusers of racism are only setting themselves back ten years when they do shit like that
<LI>Begone, foul media diversion and agent of division.
<LI>I feel the jury was unequally balanced, trail too long, the two jurors that voted no were made to change their minds, cochrane is a huge jerk that has stated how race has played a role in the trial and how this verdict now pacifies the anger of those hurt by the King verdict.  Very sad mess.
<LI>It was a waste of time, because there was no way in hell he was going to be convicted because he was a football player and a star.
<LI>Don't ever ban cameras from the courtroom. They're the public's eyes to the world.
<LI>USa - ????!!!!!
<LI>I didn't like the trial.  If they charged someone normal nobody would of heard about it.  I think all those lawers were a waist of money.  I would rather go to jail than go out in the world and have most people hate my and want me to go to jail.
<LI>A moral and ethical OUTRAGE !!!
<LI>The trial proved a few things without a shadow of a doubt: 1. Money talks.  2. California is a circus.  3. Racism is the biggest problem in this country.  The justice system in this country has always be a farce.  Money has always been the best defense.  This is the 1st time someone black utilized the technique, and white america cannot deal with it.  O.J. may be guilty as sin, but he did what every rich american is supposed to do...spend your way out of it.  What saved him in the long run was Mark Fuh
mann.  After Mark was exposed, jurors had to vote not guilty. LA. has a terrible, long and ugly track record with the poor communities. And the fact is Mark F. could have doctored evidence.  It would be hard to have anything other than reasonable doubt after that explosion.  Finally, we all know if this had been about his 1st wife and a friend, the whole thing would have been covered once and forgotten.  That alone speaks volumes about race and America.
<LI>OJ simpson is a piece of crap that deserves lethal injection
<LI>We Have Given The Black More Than Enough Opportunities Over The Past Several Decades To Become A Part Of The System. LET'S FACE IT, THE BLACKS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN TEARING OUR SYSTEM DOWN THEN THEY ARE IN CONTIBUTING TOWARDS IT'S FRUITFULLNESS !!!!!!
<LI>It's hard to get good information on what the evidence was.
<LI>America is sad.  Why did we all care so much?
<LI>It's funny how the black people were cheering after the verdict not because OJ was found not guilty but because a black man got off (with murder mind you). Let me ask this to the blacks, would the verdict still be the same if the two dead were white or if
<LI>TV coverage forced the case to be a huge pseudoevent, larger than it ever should have been.
<LI>That was the sorriest excuse for justice I've ever seen. OJ should hang!!! His lawyers are prostitutes.
<LI>Jurers should be selected that are smart enough to handle the degree of the information being given to them.  The remaining O.J. jurers dcould be persuaded into finding reasonable doubt about every piece of evidence put before them.
<LI>it was pointless, and nothing was accomplished, if OJ didn't do it, then who did.  All of the evidence they did have pointed to OJ.
<LI>I think the prosecution lost the case
<LI>Ito should never have allowed the question that Mark Fuhrman was asked, namely "Within the past ten years have you ever used the 'N' word when referring to a member of the black race...etc."
<LI>this trial sucked. death to O.J.
<LI>YOU CAN THANK THE LIBERAL ESTABLISHMENT FOR WHAT THIS COUNTRY HAS BECOME. THE BLACKS CRY DISCRIMINATION AT EVERY CORNER AND GET AWAY IT. THEY TRASH OUR INTER CITIES AND WELFARE SYSTEM AND WE STAND BY AND DO NOTHING. WE ALOW ILLEGAL ALIENS TO FLOOD OUR BORDERS, RAPE OUR MEDICAD SYSTEM, DISRUPT THE WELFARE SYSTEM, COMMIT SCORELESS NUMBERS OF CRIMES THAT GO UNSOLVED.... WELL, WE CAN GET MAD AND SAY WE ARE GOING TO REACT, BUT NOW WE HAVE A PROBLEM.. WE'VE INSTALLED A LOT OF THESE PEOPLE IN POSITONS IN THE 
OVERNMENT THAT ARE ALLOWING THE BLACKS AND OTHER MINORITIES TO RAPE AND PILLAGE OUR SYSTEMS. YOU SAW A PERFECT EXAMPLE IN THE o.j. TRIAL WHEN THE BLACKS LOOKED OUT FOR THEIR OWN IN LIU OF ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. WHITE AMERICA HAS A TOUGH ROAD AHEAD TO VOID THIS COUNTRY OF THE BLACK CANCER AND BRING BACK THE SAFE STREETS AND SCHOOLS. THE MOST OBVIOUS THAT COMES TO MIND IS INSTALLING THE BLACKS ON RESERVATIONS IN THE DESERT AND JUST LET THEM DROWN IN THEIR OWN WASTE.
<LI>There was so much evidence that OJ really committed this crime. It is so sad that there may never be justice for Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman.
<LI>It's funny how the black people were happy after the verdict not because justice was served, but because a Black man (who hasn't contributed anything to the black community) got off. This shows who the real RACISTS are.
<LI>The Justice system and the LAPD are corrupt.
<LI>the rich get richer and the poor get poorer
<LI>I believe that a non-famous person would have not have been tried do to the errors on the state's side with the mis management of the evidence.  
<LI>Absolute disgrace of a trial, disgraceful outcome, California should be kicked out of the US if they can't convict a murderer.
<LI>This is full of shit.. go to hell.. I'm gonna kill OJ
<LI>Money talks and that...is that
<LI>the jurors were biased because oj was a celebrity, and they were in awe of him.
<LI>What a Joke!  Guess the jury showed us, huh.
<LI>it's getting old--we should clue the media in on this fact!
<LI>RACE! RACE! RACE! RACE!  Black people can apperently do whatever they want, so long as there is a black jury to decide their fate!
<LI>leave oj alone.  the trial is over; if you disagree tuff. I think much of the fuss is still racial. i.e. white folks think a black man killed a white woman and they are ballistic.  get on with your lives; if oj is guilty, he will pay period and it is out of the hands of ordinary men and women.  OK.  So go back to speaking with the people of color on your job.
<LI>HE'S GUILTY, HE'S GUILTY, HE'S GUILTY, HE'S GUILTY
<LI>Puts american justice into perspective. All hail Fuhrman/KKK!
<LI>I don't agree with the verdict but they should leave it alone for the sake of the children of OJ and Nicole. Whether he's inncoent or guilty its the children who will suffer. So drop it and leave them alone.
<LI>The defense was sleazy, but i have seen sleazier
<LI>Disgusting!
<LI>A mockery of the American judicial system.
<LI>He's a murderer; we all know it!
<LI>The trial did not shake up my confidence in the system of law which we run but it did raise serious questions as to the right of the press to be involved. it became a circus and the best possible press in retrospect would have been that only artists be pe
<LI>An extremely sad circumstance for victim's families.
<LI>the jury didn't care about guilt-they're racists
<LI>OJ's Ride & Letter... Oh, he knows nuffin'
<LI>The jurors were a bunch of idiots...who had no clue about understanding the blood evidence
<LI>An innocent mans life is ruinned.
<LI>We (white america) need to change the judicial system, when a Nigger leaves court, and he isn't in in handcuff & sentence for 15 to life there is a serious problem with our Court System.
<LI>Until they  find the killer, I will in my heart believe OJ is Guilty as hell.
<LI>I believe the trial showed that our justice system can still work because there was too many inconsistancies for there to be a conviction.  The jury did what was asked of them by weighing what they saw and deciding if there was any reasonable doubt, which they obviously thought there was.
<LI>I think that it is a poor excuse for a trial.  If it had been me or you, we would have been hung within the hour.  If O.J. did not do it why did he run?  Who cares if the gloves didn't fit?  Who cares if he was black.  It should not have been made a race issue, but thanks to the defense team it was.  I can only pray that the Goldman family and the Brown family find some sort of comfort in this horrible tragedy.
<LI>It was good the trial was televised, because the viewer could hear/see the evidence and make his/her own decision about guilt or innocence.  Instead of "reporting" the news as the media should have done, the public was overwhelmed with personal opinion an
<LI>How can OJ go on in life when he knows what he did!
<LI>Somebody shoot OJ!!
<LI>I suspect the problem with the prosecution's case is the fact that the jury, as a group and individually, judging by their actions -Black Power salute to Simpson, rolling of eyes and inability/refusal of old lady jurors to listen to a brilliant white woman, the rush to the publisher's office--just who do these idiots think will buy a book when NO ONE in the world really can believe the man is innocent.  As a former abuse victim, I know that Nicole knew she was being killed, she knew that this man who h
d fathered her children and she appareently loved at one time was doing it to her, and then she didn't know anything.  But those of us who can relate to her nightmare of a life will never, ever look at OJ the same.  He doesn't deserve citizenship in the country.
<LI>Too bloody long!
<LI>OJ should live a quiet, private existence (as much as possible) for the next 50 years.
<LI>pathetic
<LI>too bad.... so sad..... bye-bye
<LI>The prosicution took too long to present their case.
<LI>O.J. is quilty as sin. The knife was dropped in the steel pole of the frost fence. Kato heard O.J. pounding the cap back on the tubular steel pole. The knife is in the steel frost fence. They never explained to the jury the fact that Kato heard the three bangs outside of his room...One of these days water will find its level!!! and O.J. will be drowing.. P.S. I hope that the jury do have good night sleeps!!!!!!!....
<LI>I really miss it.
<LI>OJ was guilty,but the jury cannot be blamed for their verdict due to teh sloppywork by the LAPD
<LI>Viva La OJ
<LI>MONEY TALKS, OJ WALKS.  MAYBE NOW ALL AFRICAN AMERICANS WILL STOP WHINING ABOUT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.  YOU SEE, THE JUSTICE SYSTEM DOESN'T DISCRIMINATE AGAINST THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, JUST THE COLOR OF YOUR MONEY!
<LI>It wasn't the "trial of the century". it was the "circus of the century"
<LI>The verdict stinks!
<LI>If that is the way trials are acted out--stay out of the courtroom!  It was a circus that was played for the camera and the victims were forgotten.  It could have been over in two months if the cameras were out of the room and the two sides had gotten down to business instead of showbusiness.
<LI>We (the People) never had a chance: most if not all the jurors never intended to find him guilty. They went into the trial believing he was not guilty and nothing the prosecution might have done would have ever convinced them otherwise.  Even if there had been an eyewitness or an admission of guilt they would have found him not guilty.
<LI>IT'S TIME TO STOP IGNORING THE FACTS, AFRICAN AMERICANS VIEWED THIS MATTER AS A RACIAL ISSUE AS THEY DO ANY TIME THERE IS A MATTER THEY ARE INVOLVED IN. 73% OF THE BLACKS THAT RIOTED IN L.A. DID NOT EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY WERE RIOTING OVER. THE JUSTICE SYSTEM WILL NEVER BEEN STRAIGHTENED UNTIL ALL RACES CAN ACT IN A RATIONAL MANNER. THE BLACKS ON THE SIMPSON JURY MADE UP THEIR MINDS THE FIRST WEEK OF THE TRIAL.
<LI>Money bought freedom to OJ / Race card invoked helped OJ to win jury sympathy. There was some doubt/ OJ is a killer
<LI>Words can't describe how devastated I am over this verdict.       
<LI>sad day for the justice system, evidence should have been hanle more properly.
<LI>Guilty or innosent isn't the important issue now.  The hate is.
<LI>Make police officers personally responsible for illegal action
<LI>Crime Pays
<LI>what a travesty of justice.all the facts and evidence proved the man killed Nicole and Ron.  Cochran inflamed the jurors with the race card, and L.A. is a hotbed of black anger.  the jurors were tired of being sequestered, which is why they voted "Not Guilty" so quickly.  Ito was a weak judge.  Darden, a weak attorney.  Cochran was full of rhetoric and inflammatory statements. He was the best lawyer there.  Clark came across as a prissy schoolmarm.
<LI>Mark Furhman, why hasn't he been arrested?
<LI>I am white, I am female, I am not a racist, this is not a racist issue, this issue is about one thing--our justice system needs severe and radical change!!! From the cops who messed up gathering the evidence to the cop that lied to the judge who was in charge to the lawyers who were a joke, to it all... These are the facts-- he beat his wife repeatedly, there was alot of "reasonable doubt", THEIR BLOOD WAS FOUND IN HIS PLUMBING!!! (although not entered into evidence those in crimianl justice arena know
this to be true and know it was not entered due to disclosure problems).  take a good look at our judicial system speak out for there is great need for radical change and its up to us as AMERICANS (black, white, purple for that matter!!!) to vocalize our desire for extreme change.Get a grip people this is the issue, it is not over it will continue until we make the system change.
<LI>No comment.
<LI>It sucked
<LI>I am white, I am female, I am not a racist, this is not a racist issue, this issue is about one thing--our justice system needs severe and radical change!!! From the cops who messed up gathering the evidence to the cop that lied to the judge who was in charge to the lawyers who were a joke, to it all...

<LI>This proves that our justice system needs despirately to be overhauled. It should not be "guilty-beyond a reasonable doubt", evidence should not be disallowed because of the untimeliness of discovering crucial evidence preventing disclosure, there should not have to be 12 full counts of guilt or innocence, for if the supreme court can't rule unanimously on most of their decisions as highly trained judicial personell, how can citizens be expected to do so? Speak out folks, not to me or to others but to 
hose who count-- petition, vote, scream if you have to-- change it now before its total anarchy in the streets instead of inadequacies in justice.
<LI>O.J. was guilty. He proved it by running in the begining.
<LI>I am glad it is finally over!!!
<LI>HE WAS GUILTY
<LI>with as much income as o.j has already collected from this, he's probably wondering why he didn't kill her years ago. 
<LI>I feel ill about the outcome. I hope someone picks him off!
<LI>A viscious murderer has laughed in the face of our justice system. The american psyche is in a state of unrest. It will interest me to see what developes from here. My only hope is that this issue will not fade away and that justice will prevail. 
<LI>PREDICTION::::: PAULA BARRBARELLI AND THE BRENTWOOD BUTCHERS RELATIONSHIP WON'T LAST TWO YEARS, ALTHOUGH AFTER THE BREAKUP PAULA WILL ANNOUNCE THAT THE BRENTWOOD BUTCHER COMMITED THE MURDERS.... AND MORAN AND THE OTHER BLACK JURORS WILL CLAIM THAT THEY FELT HE WAS GUILTY....
<LI>A guilty man  was set free by an uneducated/biased jury!
<LI>so what happens in a few years when Paula Barrbarelli turns up dead.....are we going to blame Mark Fuhrmann again?
<LI>Those on the jury should have to take an IQ test to see if they have the capacity of coming to an intelligent decision...Something that no one on this jury could even comprehend.  Did anyone get a load of that one stupid juror on Larry King Live? The black girl with the braids hanging over her face?  Larry asked her a question about DNA and she just SAT THERE! She didn't even know what he was talking about! Her HUSBAND had to answer the bloody question! She obviously had no brain cells working at all.
<LI>It is sad that so many should read so much about your country's legal system on the basis of one man's trial.
<LI>I cried for three days after the verdict. If I were an intelligent and fair minded black person, I would be very embarrassed and outraged. Early on the jurors said they were going to have a victory party when it was over and invite OJ.  That tells you that they went into this with the intention of finding him not guilty and at no time did they consider the evidence against him.  Sick. 
<LI>UGH!!! LET IT DIE!!!
<LI>IT WAS FUN TO WATCH
<LI>Ahmad Rashad set OJ up.
<LI>o.j.- good luck with your golf game-keep looking for the killer or KILLERS on the 14th fairway. Paula-watch out!!!
<LI>This case was handled very poorly!
<LI>the survey is incomplete because some questions wouldn't let me answer them.  I have a 386 with lots of memory.  I accessed the net via prodigy
<LI>What a joke!!!
<LI>the verdict was not guilty so we need to let it be whites seem to think that this was wrong but only GOD knows the truth and all name calling racist remarks should not be we all are human what if a white man commited the murders what would you say then I think you would probaly say she wasn't any good and he was gay but by this man being black he had to be the one I am a white american and have been around black men they don't kill this way they shoot or beat you with their bare hands only whites and G
YS cut you up
<LI>I GOTSTA KNOW, IS IT TRUE THAT JOHNNY COCKRAN IS MALE, AND IF SO, DID O.J. RECEIVE ANYTHING OTHER THAN LEGAL SERVICES FROM COCKRAN ? 
<LI>I now have no fear of snapping out and killing people...all I need are a few male jurors that find me attractive and I'll get off.
<LI>Marcia Clark needed to wear shorter skirts
<LI>SIMPSONS FUTURE LYES IN THE FACT THAT HE IS A PRISONER OF HIS GUILT.
<LI>The one thing nobody has mentioned is that no one but the jury knows what the jury knows.  They were pretty isolated, and lots of info was never presented to them.
<LI>I've found America had gone mad.
<LI>God is the only true judge
<LI>We need Jack Ruby Back!!!
<LI>the whole trial is the greatest job in American history
<LI>I'm glad O.J. was found not guilty. This Trial should have never gone to trial!
<LI>Niggers are the source of all problems in the U.S. today.
<LI>Solve one problem at a time. OJ not RACE, now RACE not Green , etc...
<LI>I HOPE THIS TRIAL WILL BRING LIGHT TO THE BLACK PLIGHT AND THAT IS TO USE THE RACE CARD AT EVERY TURN. I AM GLAD THAT THIS TRIAL SHOULD PROVE TO THE WORLD THAT THE AMERICAN "FREE LODING" BLACK IS THE CANCER OF THIS SOCIETY. 
<LI>I was incredibly shaken by the verdict, even though I did
<LI>it sucked
<LI>too long and too technical for the jury
<LI>OJ sucks and karma will get him in the end!
<LI>It was not a trial, it is a drama.
<LI>OJ got away with MURDER
<LI>Johnny Cochrane used this as another opportunity to divide us racially.
<LI>As a Canadian, I find the American Justice System very entertaining by NOT very effective. 
<LI>I avoided watching it whenever I could.  It was like a sleazy soap opera.
<LI>I believe the media has caused more problems than the trial. I also am tired of being told the only reason I believe OJ was guilty was because he was black, I believe it because of the evidence, and I'm sorry but whether he is innocent or not he is not a hero, he is a wife beater!!!!!!
<LI>No one knows whether he committed the murders.  What is shocking is the anger many whites felt after the verdict.  Many felt it was reverse discrimination, I guess know they understand how blacks felt moments after the Rodney King trial when an all white jury acquitted the police officers of the beating even though the crime was right in their faces on VIDEOTAPE.  Maybe one day there will be justice all around, but until we stop judging people by who they are and what they look like/the color of their 
kin, etc. the justice system will always stay the same.
<LI>I believe the media has caused more problems than the trial
<LI>This is the reason for NOT having TV in the courtroom!!
<LI>Justice was served the same as the Rodney King case being found "Not Guilty" does not mean the defendant is "Innocent"
<LI>Thank God I live in Canada with OUR justice system.
<LI>THEY HAVE TRASHED OUR INTER-CITIES, THEY HAVE RAPED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND NOW WE ARE ALLOWING THEM TO POLICE THEIR OWN. MAYBE IT'S TIME THAT AMERICA BECOMES AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IT IS THE BLACK THAT IS THE MAJORITY RACIST IN THIS COUNTRY. THE SIMPSON TRIAL SHOWS THEIR TRUE COLOR AND IT IS THE COLOR THAT HAS BEEN USED IN EVERY EXCUSE AND EVERY SEGMENT OF OUR COUNTRY. 
<LI>TH
<LI>Guilty as hell. if he didn't do it? who the hell did, then, huh? there is just nobody else who it could have been.
<LI>A verdict of not guilty has been handed down.  Except it.
<LI>gloup gloup
<LI>I never watched or listened until after the verdict. It was all too stupid.
<LI>I think the jury was afraid of what would happen if they voted guilty - didn't want a repeat of the Rodney King verdict-outrage. I also think the jury were not OJ's peers - they were ignorant, and very different than OJ's true peers.
<LI>money talks the guilty walks
<LI>I hope I never have to see another trial like that again.
<LI>The trial is not finished yet. We are going to see one more Hurricane Carter. The LAPD will not leave him alone. The FBI. The CIA. The IRS. You name it.    
<LI>This verdict makes me sick.  Not one of the BLACK jurors had a high enough I.Q. to even be considered a "human being".  O.J. was acquited because he is black.  But beware black America.... this verdict has brought so much anger to whites, that you should fear the TRUTH about your race being accepted.  Blacks are bleeding this country dry.  BLACKS ARE ONLY 12% OF THE POPULATION, BUT THEY COMMIT 2/3 OF ALL VIOLENT CRIME IN AMERICA!!!  haha, this is shocking, to say the least.  Oh, one more thing:  Throug
out 6,000 years of recorded history, the Black African Negro has invented nothing.  Not a written language, weaved cloth, a calendar, nothing, not even the wheel.  For shelter the African never progressed beyond the common mud hut, the construction of which a beaver or muskrat is capable.  I rest my case.
<LI>I hope all civil cases clean O.J. out!!!!
<LI>Jurors were bent on the idea "we've been oppressed 400 years"
<LI>THINK ABOUT IT BOZO'S MAYBE HE DIDN'T DO IT !!!!!!!!!!
<LI>time will tell justice was served
<LI>OJ's cool and if he did it he's lucky but i doubt he did it.
<LI>This is a total outrage, hope someone shoots oj 
<LI>Depressing, lies, smoke and mirrors.
<LI>Lack of deliberation by jurors exposed the sham.
<LI>The trial was a farce created by the defense.
<LI>THE JURY FAILED TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTI0NS OF THE JUDGE.
<LI>THE ONLY REASON HE GOT OFF WAS BECAUSE HE WAS BLACK AND THE 
<LI>If OJ did it, he will pay.  What goes 'round comes 'round!
<LI>O.J is guilty.
<LI>This trial was a joke and an embarassment to our society...it never should have happened.
<LI>This trial was enlightening to those  of us who thought race was not the main issue of the trial
<LI>It sucked
<LI>JURY SHOULD HAVE BEEN INTEL
<LI>If it doesn't fit, acquit--- that was KEY for me!!!
<LI>O.J. was an innocent man who angered whites because they did not get their way for once. LONG LIVE O.J. <rlong@acsu.buffalo.edu> Peace
<LI>no comment
<LI>That nigger should die! (just kidding, not that passionate)
<LI>" THE BLACK HAS AWAKEN THE SLEEPING GIANT, I FEAR FOR THE BLACKS NEXT GENERATIONS" read the polls, our intercities will not be safe, our welfare system will not be secure until the BLACK is seen as what they represent and that is a very low form of human life.
<LI>justice was served.and america should get over it
<LI>COCHRAN IS THE VERY EXAMPLE OF THE BLACKMAN, CRY RACE AND LATER DENY, "IF YOU CRY YOU MUST DENY". TAKE A LOOK, THE JURIES DOING THE SAME THING. A WEEK AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER MORAN AND THE OTHER BLACK JUROR STARTED CHANGING THEIR STORIES. WAKE UP LIBERIAL AMERICA, THE BLACK IS DUMPING ALL OVER YOU !
<LI>not guilty, not guilty, not guilty
<LI>With the muscle of money and influence (LAPD), it's no wonder that prisons are full of "Defenceless" and likely innocent minorities!
<LI>Denise Brown should ask her friend Tony to arrange a "hit" on O.J. - make sure they stab him at least thirty times before slashing his throat from ear to ear.  P.S.  It is pretty hard to have any respect for black people when you see them celebrating the release of a brutal murderer.  Maybe he'll kill a couple of black people next time, although I doubt it since they only people he seems to hang around with are white.
<LI>sad!
<LI>biggest joke in history, you got money, you can get away with murder
<LI>The trial was biased once it was put on the air.
<LI>O.J. should definitely be tried again! (and found guilty!)
<LI>Johnny Cochran & Alan dershowitz are two of the biggest loud mouths I have ever listened to.  Their ego's are beyond belief.  I have never seen anything like it.
<LI>OJ has been found innocent.  Let's leave it at that.
<LI>Even before this trail, i have felt the need for an IQ test for jurors.  I mean no racial animosity, I feel in my gut that this case was viewed as payback and restitution for prior wrongdoings by my racial ancestors.  Too bad it will probably backfire wit
<LI>No comment. 
<LI>Although I predicted the outcome, I really believe he is quilty and should be made to pay.
<LI>WHITE AMERICA, HOW CAN YOU EVEN DEFINE THE CONCEPT OF JUSTICE?  YOU RACE HAS RAPED CULTURES FROM THE BEGINNING OF TIME.  IN FACT, YOU ALL DO NOT EVEN HAVE YOUR OWN CULTURE, WHAT YOU ARE NOW IS SIMPLY A COMPILATION OF THE CULTURES THAT YOU HAVE HISTORICALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.  FUCK YOU CAVE PEOPLE.  YOU MAKE ME SICK
<LI>Where can I geta a hold of Marcia Clark????
<LI>Guilty, Guilty, Guilty... A travesty
<LI>the americans should let oj go on with his life GOD knows everything and Nicole was a LESBIAN and RON was a HOMOSEXUAL that is why his FATHER was crying and so angry because he disowned him and never got a chance to tell him that he loved him.  Ask his FATHER see his reaction
<LI>Everyone knows OJ did it, but everyone also knew he would get off because of his staus as a superstar and he is black with a black jury.  Even prosecution knew they were up against the wall before the case started.  Furman's a jerk and I hope he goes to jail for a long time, we don't need people like him around.
<LI>they neeed to find the killers
<LI>i think that this has contributed to the worst racial climate in US hitory!
<LI>Hang OJ
<LI>Money wins again, as exemplified by many corporate trials. This trial was "different" only because big corporate trials aren't as well publicized.
<LI>it's not about race.  It about a man who killed his ex-wife, regardless of race.  He is guilty! the jury was rigged!
<LI>your americans are totaly mad, doing such a media skandal trial. hinrichs@zeitgeist.de
<LI>the raisail virdict is discraceful 
<LI>Unreal! This is a joke!
<LI>victims & their families were not represented!
<LI>I think because OJ had so much money that he could pay his lawyers to give reasonable doubt.  If it was a poor person it would have been a guilty verdict.  
<LI>Juries don't have majic powers, just because they say he's not Guilty does NOT mean he didn't Do it.  Who else has Ron Goldman's blood in their car???
<LI>between the jury, the race card, and the experts Simpson was able to hire, it wqas clear he wouldn't be found guilty. Not guilty is not innocent. He did it!
<LI>the prosecution did their best, the LAPD screwed it up !!
<LI>I think it was just a big joke, an embarassment!
<LI>Who cares???
<LI>Disappointing - Gil Garcetti should be thrown out of office!
<LI>The race card was played and race relations are suffering
<LI>OJ is guilty,guilty,guilty,guilty,guilty!
<LI>It is over.  OJ is ruled not guilty.  Let's move on.
<LI>It is wrong to glorify a sick bully!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>This was a total moquery of the justice system
<LI>Just because OJ was aquitted does not mean he is innocent, his defense team just provided reasonable doubt. Guess you could say he "bought" his freedom. I was under the assumption that he was guilt, but I have to have faith in our Justice System,even though it has been shaken, in order for this country to stay free.
<LI>I sincerely think that the whole thing- from the car chase to the whole trial was a huge media circus. I sincerely think that the trial should have not been televised, but it does not matter because the verdict would have been the same anyway.
<LI>O.J. should declare a life of celibacy and get thee to a monastery
<LI>if marcia clark had been my lawyer i would rather have had Perry mason and he's been dead for over a year!
<LI>I can't believe he was found not guilty!!!!
<LI>I have been a fan and supporter of O.J. Simpson for many years, but I believe he moost likely committed the murders, or was at least an accessory to the murders. However, had I been on the jury, I think I would have had to vote "not guilty" because there was a sufficient defense case presented to support a "reasonable doubt" interpretation of the evidence presented. I feel so badly for the Brown and Goldman families. God knows what happened that night and if justice was not done in the courtroom, it mo
t assuredly will be done on judgment day. God bless Nicole, Ron, Justin and Sidney.
<LI>I think that we as Black people need to realize that this is BUT ONE victory for us.   It is simply one case in which Justice was truly served FOR US.  I doubt that there will be another high-profile trial like this one in which a black suspect will be acquitted.  White America is PITIFUL and SORRY for doubting the fact that we have the ability to make rational decisions.  GROW UP AND WAKE UP!  YOU MUST REALIZE THAT THOSE WHO WERE LAST WILL BE FIRST--SOON.  LOOK OUT, THE FALL OF THE WHITE MAN IS APPROA
HING AT AN EXTREMELY RAPID PACE.  CAVE PEOPLE---WATCH YA BACK!
<LI>I feel that the Browns and OJ should work out custody together.  Right now all that is important is the children.  They love their father and miss their mother and they need him.  I feel that the media has done a lot of damage to the justice system.  The TV coverage is good the media coverage is not necessary if we are able to watch and judge for ourselves.  The media needs to put themself in check.
<LI>Amazing that so many can easily consider him innocent.
<LI>The jury obviously did not understand their duty to deliberate (i.e., take some time to look at and discuss the evidence)  nor REASONABLE (as opposed to utterly fantastic) doubt"
<LI>"AND IT IS HE WHOM DORNS THE DOUBLE MASK AND SWINGS THE BRAZEN KNIFE, IT IS HE THAT LEADS HIS FELLOWS TO A DEEP DARKNESS" Qoute by Lance Ito when asked about COCHRAN.  
<LI>I think the people of our country need to get of OJ's back.  He's been found not guily beyond a reasonable doubt and that's that.
<LI>dissappointing
<LI>It was the second "Monkey Trial" of the century...except this time, the monkeys were on the jury!!
<LI>I  thin kthat this whole case is a bunch of bull shit I mean now tht it is over  they chould just let it be I mean they are turning this whole thing  into a racial issue which is really just piising me off they are putting this case on talk shows adn who 
<LI>It was the biggest miscarraige of justice I've ever seen.
<LI>NOW I CAN WATCH "DAYS" IN PEACE
<LI>The prosecution only brought this case to trial because their credibility was at a all time low, and garcettis political motives.
<LI>computers are so cool man, how do you get out of here?
<LI>I hope the US justice system learns from this fiasco
<LI>This perspective is from a second-year law student
<LI>if oj was innocent, defence did not infer it in their case
<LI>Trial was an abberation. No other signficance sociologically or with respect to the justice system.
<LI>I think the trial lasted too long.  I hope the civil suit isn't aired on television.  I think O.J. should get the kids, and everyone should leave them alone so they can go on with their lives!!!!!!!!!
<LI>wish I had discovered this area sooner.Still feel frustrated regarding the verdict.
<LI>The ultimate result is an increase in predjudical sentiment within the white community since he clearly got away with murder.
<LI>The information brought in during congial visits needs to be examined
<LI>Do Your Part to END RACISM!!
<LI>A disaster from the start.  The investigation of the crime scene was disorganized and unprofessional.  People in the Prosecuter's Office stated publicly that "O.J. is guilty" before ever reviewing any evidence and assembling their case.  The Police handling of matters was highly disorganized.  Maybe what both need to realize is that they can't wipe their asses with the Constitution and expect to win a case.
<LI>the car chase was a waste of time, the trial was a waste of time and teh whole thing was a waste of money.  A waste of tax payers moneis, a waste of private companies money and a waste of time for our nation.  OJ is a waste.
<LI>It's very sad that a brutal murderer got set free because of the jury's emotions!
<LI>only time will tell.  I hope he has trouble sleeping at night
<LI>GUILTY!!!
<LI>If this sort of thing happened elsewhere (not in LA, not in US), he would be frying right now.  Just come up to Canada and try to get away with that, baby.
<LI>THERE WASN'T ENOUGH EVIDENCE, THEY SHOULD HAVE GIVEN UP SINCE THE BEGINNING.
<LI>We MUST prevent OJ from regaining his social & economic status.
<LI>The verdict wasn't about race, it was about money. Rich people can get away with murder.
<LI>Sad day for American justice. Will the feds prosecute O.J. for violation of civil rights? Or is that only for 'white' police officers? 
<LI>it was the worst circus seen created by the media
<LI>Justice could not, would not, and did not get served
<LI>It was a circus
<LI>Judges should pick jurors, not lawers
<LI>GUILTY!
<LI>As an African-American, I am in the minority because I believe that O.J. is guilty.  I agree with the verdict because I belive that O.J. was rich enough to get lawyers that could prove reasonable doubt.  Race, of course, played an issue in this case. Our society has not reached the point where race doesn't matter and it will be a long time before it does.  There have been many comments made about how race relations have been set back, but that doesn't have to happen. Based on previous comments in this 
urvey, it seems that whites are the ones who want to set relations back by blatantly using the "n" word.  As Rodney King once said, "Can't we all get along?"
<LI> A sad commentary on the judicial d  system
<LI>OJ is a murderer, black people are stupid, justice was not served. The time is nearing and black people do not stand a chance. Let the war begin.
<LI>In the United States, you can get all the "Reasonable Doubt" you can afford!
<LI>convinced me to deny ever seeing anything that might go to court for fear of what the lawyers would do to me. If i had seen the actual murder happen, I sure wouldn't tell anyone.  I have a business to run.  Besides, I'd probably be murdered if my testimony had helped get him convicted...not because he's black but because he's so popular and rich. 
<LI>the cops blew the case
<LI>LAPD proved total unprofessionalness. USA lacks, but needs a Sherlock Holmes
<LI>The trial was OK, but the aftermath is disgusting.
<LI>Ito should have taken control of this trial and made it into a trial of OJ Simpson instead of whatever it  was.  The closing statements for the defense were disgraceful.  Ito should have stopped it.
<LI>He's guilty, what else can I say?
<LI>I think justice was served...the prosecution didn't prove their case....there is more to the story.....will we ever learn the truth????
<LI>I think justice was survey...the prosecution didn't prove their case....there is more to the story.....will we ever learn the truth????
<LI>It was not just Furman but a shitty job in general by the LA PD detectives
<LI>I realy dont know.
<LI>I am OUTRAGED that race and racism are used as excuses for black's crimes, and that no matter what the evidence may show, there are always other blacks who feel the responsibility to bond with their race. If O.J. was white he would be in jail today, and rightfully so. It is now becoming very hard for many whites to be "colorblind"; I feel as though most blacks group me in with the rest of the whites they feel are "out to get them."   BUT...one too many times you cry wolf, and it loses its impact...How 
ill whites react to the next case involving actual racism?
<LI>The other reason for his aquittal was his celebrity and public persona - they just couldn't believe that O.J. could do such a thing - "he's such a hero and a great guy" (not a jury quote).
<LI>What an embrassment for blacks, if the verdict of a black person is "Guilty, they riot (i.e. Rodney King and the LA riots), but if a black person is found innocent they are so happy.  Didn't see any whites riotting.
<LI>There was Reasonable Doubt but the jury showed it was influenced by race by only being out three hours.
<LI>as a Canadian, I am glad our trials aren't sensationalized and are shorter, ie. Paul Bernardo
<LI>it sucks!
<LI>I can't believe the SOB go off!! Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!!!
<LI>If he did do the murders, he has to live with the crime for the rest of his life.  And he has to make sure never to let anyone know he did the murders.  If he did not do the murders, so one did one helluva a good job framing him.  O.J still has to meet with one more judge -  God himself, he will be the ultimate sentence giver.
<LI>The crime has the characteristics and brutality of a homosaxually related murder. Goldman could have been the intended target of assailant or assailants.  Why will the prosecution keep saying that OJ is guilty when the jury has decided he is not? Will they only accept and respect their veredict if it's favorable to them, what kind of justice system works like that?
<LI>I just can't understand how a simple murder trial could get turned into a racial issue.  The whole thing was so stupid and blown completely out of proportion.  What a waste of money.
<LI>It's unfortunate that the result is so controversial.  The system in fact allows that OJ was found not guilty, and we MUST accept it.  However, without the explosive race issue, it likely would have resulted in a guilty verdict.  OJ did not, could not, and would not act as an innocent person throughout the entire episode; virtually all evidence confirmed him as the murderer.  An unemotional analysis of the evidence clearly convicts him.  The jury apparently focused their energies on finding, and justif
ing, doubt.  There exists no way to absolutely prove guilt or innocence - so our legal system provides all the tools for good lawyers to steer the jury toward the doubt issue.   Defense did their job, but it does not change the fact in any way that OJ did it.  The system worked as designed, a guilty man walked free.  I wonder - what would have happened if OJ were white and both victims black......
<LI>I hope the civil trials go better.
<LI>He still has to live with himself!
<LI>The only reason O.J. Simpson got an acquittal is because the defense played on the issue of race. The prosecution was not convincing enough. Mark Furhman damaged the credibility of the prosecution.  Yet, I do not think that he played a part in framing O.J. despite his racist beliefs.
<LI>the news made a mochery of the american people
<LI>What astonished me the most was the very low educational level of the jurors. I doubt that most of them were able to make critical judgement or understand the DNA evidence
<LI>Johnnie Cochrane should be held responsible for the fallout that will happen because of this trial.  OJ didn't represent black people everywhere in this trial.  The only group he could have represented would be the people who have money.  We all know that if any other black person from south-central LA would have been on trial with this much evidence they would have set them up long ago.  So a victory for blacks?  Only if Mark Fuhrman was the victim.
<LI>the verdict was a travesty of human justice, one which americans will never forget as a symbol of what happened all too often, to blacks and to whites. 
<LI>Just proves if you have money, you can get off!!
<LI>It's over!
<LI>I WANT TO KNOW WHY COCKRAN CAN DO THE THINGS HE DOES, BUT KNOW ONE HAS CALLED HIM A RACIST ! THE BLACK HAS FINALLY AWAKEN THE SLEEPING GIANT, MAY ALL BLACKMEN RUN FOR COVER. 
<LI>This trial did more to seperate the two races then any other incident to date
<LI>WAKE UP AMERICA ! THE ASIANS THAT HAVE RECENTLY COME TO AMERICA HAVE MADE SUCCESSES OF THE VENTURES, YOU DON'T SEE THEM GOING AROUND CRYING BECAUSE THEY ARE A MINORITY. THE BLACKS HAVE ALWAYS USED EXCUSES FOR THEIR FAILURES. POINT IN FACT: CLEAN CRIME FREE NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BECOME SLUMS AFTER THE POPULATIONS EXCEEDS 56% BLACKS. MEDICAL EXPENSES HAVE TRIPLED BECAUSE 93% OF BLACKS ARE REFUSING TO PAY THEIR BILLS. THEY HAVE DESTROYED THE WELFARE SYSTEM TO THE POINT OF CRUSHING THE MIDDLE CLASS.... I'M TI
ED OF THE BLACK EXCUSES, THEY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN MANY MINORITIES, BUT THEIR STILL AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PILE. BETWEEN COCHRAN AND FURHMAN, I SADLY SAY THAT FURHMAN MAKES MORE SENSE !!!!!
<LI>Hopefully the American legal system will learn something from it. Also the LAPD!
<LI>What A Fucking Joke!!
<LI>we all know what this trail was about. We all know why he was set free. I hope that butcher NEVER is able to get back what he had. As for helping the black community, he never did before, get real do you think he will? He is all set to marry a white woman and to try to fit in the white society he was in before. You definitely won't see him in south central L.A. helping anyone. I will not suppoert anything that benefits that monster, I will avoid and boycott anything like that. Even found not guilty he 
s still a batterer, that cannot be shaken off as he tries to repair his image. I hope he never gets a moments peace for the rest of his life.
<LI>There is a great gulf between lawyers and the rest of us. I really don't understand their motivation to be so sleazy.
<LI>Was a sad excuse for a trial!!! - Waste of taxpayers' money. Now having read the comments of some seriously sad people I will further add the following.  It appears that the majority of America (african and white) has a chip on its very large shoulder - no-one appears to have weighed up the evidence.  Since we in the UK had limited coverage (albeit the little we saw far too much) there was not enough to convict OJ beyond reasonable doubt.  If this case had been heard within the British judicial system 
t would have not even reached court as our Crown Prosecution Service would have found that there was not enough evidence to secure a conviction.  The overall system in the US has only gone to prove that if you have enough money you can buy anything (not saying that OJ was guilty or innocent).  If it had been your ordinary Joe Bloggs in the street would he have stood a chance?  It appears that the white population decided long before the trial had commenced that OJ was guilty and black america decided he wa
 innocent.  Its time to step back and take a good long look at yourselves... it's about time everyone in the USA looked at people as people and not someone with a little or a lot of colour pigmentation!  USA should realise that they created their own judicial system and therefore they should live by its verdicts irrespective of whether they themselves agree with it.  On another matter, now that this sorry trial its over - why are people trying to re-try him - you know you can't try a man twice for the same
crime.  Has it ever occured to anyone that when the civil action is being heard that if the Goldman and the Brown's really thought OJ did it, his money would not be good enough, since afterall it would be blood money!!!
<LI>People should wake up! Reasonable doubt was abundant!!!!
<LI>color was the determining factor, the color was green!
<LI>Was a sad excuse for a trial!!! - Waste of taxpayers' money
<LI>It is better to let a guilty man go free than to imprison an innocent man.
<LI>The whole thing was a farce from the get-go.  There was a lack of information all around and the media had O.J. convicted from day one.  I haven't seen such shoddy judgement since Rodney King.
<LI>Finally, now even Black money can BUY aquittal-what justice!
<LI>Leave the guy alone, he's paid a miserable price!
<LI>I can only hope that this fiasco will lead to meaningfull reform of the system.
<LI>No effect, just mild amusement at watching others
<LI>Very interesting from start to finish!
<LI>bullshit
<LI>What a country--The almighty dollar wins again
<LI>O.J. sucks ass. 
<LI>OJ is a double murderer
<LI>The jury did not deliberate, black racism or ignorance of the civic duty, you choose which one.
<LI>When you get a jury from South-East LA and put them to listen to white lady and believe what she says or to listen and believe what a black man with the Nation of Islam sitting behind him says - who would you think they'd listen to and believe?
<LI>O.J. is a sleazy lying murdering piece of ****.  He should have everything he's put out return to him twofold.
<LI>I agree with the verdict, but I don't believe in OJ's innoncence
<LI>I feel he was guilty of HAVING them killed rather than killing them himself.
<LI>it was all bullshit
<LI>I cannot believe we can let a muderer, in my opinion, loose!  I guess, from now on, women will realy have to be afraid that men like this can actually get away with murder!  How sad, and how far have we stepped back in terms of the racial issues!  Everybody is against everybody, African-Americans think he's innocent, White's don't!  I myself am Mexican-American am trying not to be prejudice to all races.  I believe that there are stupid people in this world, OJ Simpson is one of them!  He has cause a l
t of pain, to his own family, his kids, the Brown's and Goldman's, but most of all America!  I'm just going to ignore the race issue by believing that there are still some good people in this world, and there are the OJ Simpsons!
<LI>What a bunch of bullshit... I can't believe America's come to this.
<LI>There is no question that the verdict was based on race, 9 black jurors??  COME ON!!! 
<LI>O.J. is guilty. What has happened to the value of life?
<LI>We can't simply move on. It is good to talk about the trial, and to learn from it.
<LI>Why is so hard for people to believe that police can frame a person, we only believe things about police when a nother police tells on them
<LI>I think it was a circus.  Even now the media is on OJ. I boycott anything with  OJ on . 
<LI>regardless of the result, we have to live with it
<LI>I kinda like the spelling, Johnnie CROCKrane
<LI>its finally over!=)
<LI>this trial was a joke!!
<LI>The Trial shows that Hollywood is incapable of producing anything more entertaining and that the news media is more interested in advertising revenues than reporting news.
<LI>O J is a cool cat!
<LI>We need to appreciate a good scandal
<LI>You call that American justice... What a joke!! 
<LI>NIGGER !!! Thats right I'm a loser, I've trashed you cities, riddled your streets with crime, ruined the Cadilac name, filled your battered women shelters, consist of 85% of those on welfare. I have a 3.92 g.p.a. now, you have to repect me. FUCK YOU!!!!
<LI>An interesting view into the American judicial system.
<LI>THEY HAVE TRASHED OUR WELFARE SYSTEM, THEY HAVE DESTROYED OUR INTER-CITIES, THE BLACK USES THE RACE CARD AT EVERY TURN. I SAY TO ALL YOU BLACKS, WE ARE TIRED OF YOUR CRY BABY ANTICS, NO ONE BELEIVES YOUR CRIES OF DISCRIMINATION ANYMORE. THE ASIANS, HISPANICS AND OTHER MINORITIES HAVE DONE WELL IN OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT COMPLAINTS. WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU BLACKS !!!!!!!!!
<LI>I hope that two people who died, will rest in piece and who ever did it pays with life.
<LI>COCHRANS TYPE IS A DISGRACE TO THE HUMAN RACE, AS AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN I WOULD BE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO SNUF HIM. WRITE THE N.A.A.C.P. AND COMPLAIN ABOUT COCHRAN ! 
<LI>NIGGER!!, what a shallow mind that thinks a word (Nigger) is the way to black America's Heart.  My father once told me the reason a person curses, is he desn't have enough mastery of the English language to fill in the blanks.  I'm, as white America puts it a "Nigger".  One question to white America, What do you think this word does to black America?  I'm 3 times the person an of you low life out there are, I graduated the U of MD with a 3.92 GPA in Computer Sci, I will complete my Masters in CS in 2 m
nths.  I would measure myself against any of you NIGGER haters out there, my IQ(195), wit, ability.  Call me what you like, it doesn't matter to me, I know I am a better person than YOU could EVER HOPE TO BE,  Live long and ROT in your hatred, while I prosper and control your society.
<LI>It makes me sick to think that we have stooped to bashing the jury.  We made the system... we should work WITH the system!
<LI>NIGGER!!, what a shallow mind that thinks a word (Nigger) is the way to black America's Heart.

 would measure myself against any of you Nigger haters out here, my IQ (195), wit, ability.  Call me what you like, its doesn't matter to me, I know I am a better person than YOU COULD EVER HOPE TO BE,  Live long and ROTT in you hatred, while I prosper and control you society.

<LI>oj should be in jail
<LI>The jury acquitted Simpson for two reasons, racisim, and police abuse of authority.  
<LI>This bias bullshit, 1 nigger gets off, and white america goes bizerk.  How many white Maggots have raped, hung, burned, castrated, maimed, blacks and celebrated doing it.  Fuck off!
<LI>The morning the verdict was read, OJ had a smirk like he already knew the jury's decision.
<LI>It was just a circus by media to make $$$$$.  O.J. really did do it he just got aquitted because he had $$$$$.
<LI>This man should never "get his old life back".  If OJ or any of his lawyers appear in public, they should be publicly shunned, "booed" and humiliated.  Only the black community will accept him now, but he never wanted them, and still doesn't.  When they finally realize this, they will also turn against him.  I will enjoy watching this 2nd wave of piranhas tear apart the carcass.  This is what a murderer deserves.  Those who live by the sword will die by it.  
<LI>the whole trial was a joke.  the defense was unprofessional
<LI>Glad it's finally over.
<LI>WE NEED TO REFORM THE PROCESS OF JURY SELECTION.
<LI>The RACIST COCHRAN has set the race relations back 30 years. Don't blame THE JURY, Don't blame FURHMAN, Don't blame the LAPD. COCHRAN IS THE DOG OF DOGS, HE HAS USED THE RACE CARD FOR TEN YEARS NOW IN EACH OF HIS TRIALS. WAKE UP AMERICA ! WE MUST CASTORATE THIS DOG.  
<LI>everyone, put oj aside and get on with your lives
<LI>the verdit as a great travesty of justice
<LI>I won't support in any way shape or form anything or anyone who endorses "The Butcher of Brentwood"!
<LI>Just so participants of the poll know I am white, middle age female, and I never thought he had time to commit the crime.
<LI>It's scary that you need to be rich to get a fair trial
<LI>Travesty of justice!
<LI>The media was very biased against OJ
<LI>I hope Fred Goldman kills OJ. Run Juice, run!
<LI>OJ might be innocent but If he did it, which he did in my opinion, He has to live with himself. I HOPE HE DIES FROM HIS GUILTY CONSCIENCE!
<LI>If it was you or I, no one would care about this survey. It takes money!
<LI>Should have had a directed verdict, then jail the jurors.
<LI>While I do not agree with the verdict, I think that the trial has piqued my interest in law as a profession!
<LI>OJ,a double murderer, escaped a just verdict
<LI>Our current methods of Jury selection are ludicrous.  Lawyers should not only be unable to contest Jurors, but ideally jurors should observe trials from special screening rooms, unseen by the court participants, so that even the composition of a jury is unknown and cannot be used to the advantage of lawyers pleading a case.  Our current system only results in theatrics and juries overbrimming with the masses of the ignorant and the uninformed.  
<LI>I got sooo tired of it
<LI>very disappointed
<LI>Although I didn't watch the trial everyday, I don't the the prosecution proved anything beyond a reasonable doubt other than he beat his wife.
<LI>I LOVE OJ
<LI>keep tv out of the court rooms!!!!!!
<LI>I think that Maria Clark did a fantastic job and she was criticized too much.  She was very professional and didn't play up to the cameras as did the defense!!!!!
<LI>prosecution could have been more organized.
<LI>I think the news media did not present what really happened in court, thus we see the outrage.  I am 50/50 on if he did or not.
<LI>WHY DO YOU AMERICA STAND FOR THE BLACK PERSONS ACTIONS ? YOU LET HIM RIOT IN YOUR STREETS WHILE THEY RAPE YOUR WELFARE SYSTEM AND DESTRY YOUR INTER-CITIES. STAND UP AMERICA, DON'T LET THE BLACK DESTROY SUCH A GOOD COUNTRY !!!!!!
<LI>AS A AFRICAN AMERICAN, I AM OFFENDED BY THE WAY MY PEOPLE REACTED AFTER THE TRIAL. I AM THINKING THAT WE ARE THE RACIST IN THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE STARTED SOMETHING THAT WE WILL REGRET.
<LI>WHITW AMERICA IS ANGRY BECAUSE A BLACK MAN WAS FINALLY ABLE TO PLAY ON THE SAME TURF, WHITES HAVE BEEN PLAYING IN ALL ALONG.WHITE AMERICA HAS PROVEN TO ME THAT THEY STILL DON'T LIKE BLACK AMERICA.
<LI>I don't believe the jury weighed expert testimonies carefully.
<LI>IT WAS CLEAR AFTER THE TRIAL WAS OVER AND SEVERAL OF THE JURORS WERE INTERVEIWED THAT THEIR DECISION WAS RACIAL. I WILL BET $ 1,000,000 THAT NO MEMBER ON THE JURY HAD AN I.Q. GREATER THAN 80.
<LI>According to the white people, no black man is innocent, why don't you ckeck yourself out, I think it is the other way around. Those that keep saying hang him, you better prepare yourself for the blazing heat in hell.
<LI>none
<LI>every citizen should be equipped with such a defense team.
<LI>There are more things about Ron and Nicole than we are told. Maybe if other areas are investigated, the killer or killers could be found.
<LI>The wife-beater should have fried!!!
<LI>IT WAS A WAST OF TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
<LI>I felt that the Court TV would have done better had they ren the trial for the complete court day , as I felt that they ended the day earlier than they should have.After all the advertisers paid big bucks because we were the revenue generating part of the deal. In addition I would like to see the TV stations do a follow-up on the courthouse family that we lived with for the past 15 months. What Ito, Clarke, Cochran etc are doing after the trial. After all, to me they are somewhat family, or at least as
ociates anyway. Great deal folks!!
<LI>If the media hadn't been so envolved, it all would have been over a long time ago.  I don't think either side provided "good" evidence.
<LI>Can't understand why procecution have hid something from us, can't understand Mr. Vanneda deminour and absence of clear answers to the questions which we all have.
<LI>I think the media should be ashamed, tell news don't interpret for ratings reasons.  I will make my own judgements.
<LI>In the big picture, millions are focusing on a the good & bad of maybe 30 family member (Brown,Simpson,Goldman).  What about the terrible travisties in the world.
<LI>I think the jury did a great job on the verdict considering the amount of sequestration time they had to undergo.  They made the only choice that they had enough evidence to show for.  I probrably would have given the same verdict with the amount of infor
<LI>O.J. got off because of his money.
<LI>I'm glad it's over!!
<LI>When there was slavery, there were whites who stood up and said 'This is wrong'.  Where are the rightious Blacks saying this verdict is a travesty of justice.
<LI>Unfortunately, it made a lot of people see the Blacks don't practice what they preach.  Their solidarity despite OJ's obvious guilt is the blindest kind of racism.   
<LI>The trial is less important than the effects it has on race relations.
<LI>The prosecution should first check out if the jury is dumb or not. If they are dumb, they should not pick them.
<LI>This was bad for black people everywhere.  They will pay the price for O.J.'s acquittal.
<LI>Fucking nigger
<LI>Closet KKK? Oh, I get it--if you're white, and are discusted about a black man getting aquited of a crime he obviously committed--you're a racist...but if you're black and are discusted at a white man getting aquitted of a crime he obviously committed...you're standing up for your rights.
<LI>Disillusioning
<LI>He did it!!!
<LI>This is really a silly poll.
<LI>OJ's a guilty spear chucker - I think we should hand him over to Mark Ferman to deal with
<LI>Every-one should boycott OJ
<LI>I can't believe how divided this county is. Someone in the jury made the comment that the domestic violence was not an issue (this was a PROVEN thing that OJ did) however, they did use race as an issue.....Go figure!!
<LI>Reading the comments from this survey and other "white people" is what has set race relations back (if there is such a thing) not the trial.  Some of you are closet KKK and that is why we are where we are today.  MAKE A CHANGE!
<LI>The jury had no other choice because the police has failed to do their job correctly.
<LI>OJ may not be in prison, but he's far from being a free man. In a couple of months, after he finds that he can't go out to restaurants, football/baseball games, when he can't go for a walk around the neightborhood, or even take his kids for an ice cream cone, because there's so much hatred of him and what he did, he'll wish he HAD been found guilty.
<LI>Sad Day in American Law
<LI>Why does everyone assume race was the deciding factor in the verdict.  There was reasonable doubt!  Also question 16 does not even mention that the children are OJ's as well as Nicole and since we don't know if he committed a crime he has every right to his children.  Last but certaintly not least why is justice only justice when it works in the favor of those white people.  I am not prejudice I love all peopel.  I believe because OJ is black and the evidence seemed to point toward him people made up t
eir minds that he was guilty until proven innocent instead of the other way around.  
<LI>White people should except the verdict. It's their system and it worked the way it's supposed to work. Just because it did not go your way doesn't mean it doesn't work. Their are a lot of problems with this system but, their was a reasonable doubt. I won't rule out the fact that their was a mountain of evidence against OJ. But their was also a significant amount of doubt. Me being a black man, if I was on the Jury, I don't think I would be able to look at myself in the mirror if I set a murderer free. 
n the same hand I don't think I would be able to look my self in the mirror If I sent a man to jail on questionable evidence. No Murder Weapon, No Eye Witness, DNA Evidence Accuracy Questionable, Detectives Integrity Shattered = A weak case. 
<LI>There was reasonable doubt

<LI>The Legal system is made for loopholes for many interest groups and agencies; this is just another case that has proven that.
<LI>defense caused more racial separataion than should have been
<LI>Money can buy anything.
<LI>I feel very disatisfied that OJ was let to walk away a free man.
<LI>how could the judice system let this happen his is guity and will have to settle that with the himself and god
<LI>Thank you Johnnie Cock-sucker for setting race relations back 35 years, and wife abuse 100 years. Asshole.
<LI>What a farce!
<LI>Best justice money can buy
<LI>RACIAL DIVISION IS DESTROYING THIS COUNTRY. HOW SAD!
<LI>The entire trial was turned from O.J. proving his innocence to the LAPD proving non-prejudicial justice.  If it were any other American we would not have made it through the now famous car chase to begin with and saved the Judicial system an enormous amount of money.
<LI>I believe this trial has set the race issue back at least 15 years and justice was not served !!!!!
<LI>The case was determined by jury selection.
<LI>I do not think that he committed this crime. Not enough time and not enough blood for one man to have done all this by himself.  I do hop they find the real killers.  I think when people give their opinions about whether or not he did it, they should say "I think he did it" and not "He did it".  They were not there.
<LI>OJ guilty 
<LI>If O.J. was white, Nicole and Ron were black, the verdict was not guilty, the Rodney King riots would have started all over again. 
<LI>they should send the jury to a DR. first, to check and see if they have a brain at all !!!!!!!!
<LI>The richer you are, the more likely you can commit any crime you want and get away with it!!!
<LI>OJ got away with murder/the verdict has damaged race relations
<LI>Listening to the Dershowitz's (sp) spins is irratating
<LI>The Trial has set race relations back 20 years, and justice back 100 years.
<LI>Will the Civil Suits by televisied?
<LI>jury members were afraid - so they acquited
<LI>I'm sure it's not over...
<LI>Thank God it's over!!!
<LI>The fifth pleaded by fuhrman put enough reasonable doubt to mak it impossible for a jury to convict.
<LI>It was very entertaining
<LI>If OJ would have wanted these individuals dead, I'm sure he's smart enough to hire a professional while he is somewhere else with an aliby. 
<LI>Makes me glad I'm Canadian - law is a matter of pride here.
<LI>Great entertainment value....
<LI>It's a shame that so much was made of this trial (all the time, money, mental resources, etc...) when there are so many other problems in our society that may not be as comercially appealing but really need to be addressed. 
<LI>Thank god for Civil Suits - He needs to pay...
<LI>My opinion is unpopular, but it IS how I feel
<LI>The reaction to the verdict by African-Americans, not the verdict itself, was the stunning outcome of this case. Apparently, A-A still harbor deep-seated resentment of whites despite the countries efforts towards equality.
<LI>the jury did the only thing they could - which sucks
<LI>If innocent, he should take a lie-detector test to prove it!
<LI>His race saved him.
<LI>I don't think OJ is dangerous, as long as you don't date him.  He did it, no doubt.  But as long as he's going to get off scott free, hopefully something good will come out of it.  Maybe OJ ought to run for office.  He has the perfect credentials: Total name recognition and he's gotten away with murder. Sounds like most politicians to me.
<LI>OJ is to the black race what Kennedy is to the white race:  Money buys your way out of jail, but not necessarily your freedom.
<LI>a joke
<LI>What else is there to say that hasn't already been said?
<LI>The jurors I've seen interviewed didn't have the intellectual tools to reach a reasoned verdict, so they reached an emotional one.
<LI>What surprise?  The man's a celebrity who is wealthy, and just like any other celebrity who is wealthy, he got off.  If the jury had no choice and he was more-the-obvious guilty?  Two years in prison, tops.  More likely, community service or some other light sentence.
<LI>It seems like black people use their race as an excuse.
<LI>The justice system does not work...as long as the person is rich that person will get off..ie(Will K. Smith, and his uncle Ted)
<LI>This is all we need; people making more decisions on the superficial basis of one's skin color and not the facts.
<LI>The trial was a hoax, a media circus!
<LI>The jury found him NOT GUILTY, not INNOCENT.  Deal with it.
<LI>The jury found him NOT GUILTY, not INNOCENT.  Deal with it.
<LI>the whole thing is a big farse
<LI>I'm glad that it is over.  And to those who are furious about the outcome.....GET OVER IT!!!!
<LI>justice was served!!
<LI>Over confident Garcetti should have used Santa Monica
<LI>GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY
<LI>I wish I could have heard every word, but I had to work.
<LI>Media had a negative impact evidenced by society vs jury verdict
<LI>Black Americans should be ashamed
<LI>Almost as bad as the Guildford 4 or the Birmingham 6
<LI>The LAPD's sloppiness, along with the Furhman factor, helped OJ the most. 
<LI>This was a mockery of the Justice system and a slap in the face to fair and impartial juries.
<LI>What a fucking joke! I hope Ron and Nicole come back like in Friday the 13th or Freddy Cruger and kill OJ
<LI>I love it!  It's better than "Friends"!!!
<LI>I believe that Johnny Cockran showed reasonable doubt but that is not why the jury let him off, They let him off becasue of the race issue.  They did the right thing, but not for the right reason.
<LI>Johnnie Cockroach compared Mark Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler.....well I'd compare Johnnie to Judas Iscariot....anything for a buck! 
<LI>Boycott NBC & General Electric!
<LI>Let's move on with our lives!
<LI>I really really hate that Clark bitch!
<LI>IT WAS A SHAME
<LI>The best thing we could do for the system and the victoms is BOYCOTT O.J. Sympsom's media blitz.
<LI>DO UNTO OTHERS WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE THEM DO UNTO YOU . for what ever reason the jury set simpson free for murder of which i think he is innocent of. as for the wife beating i don't think there is a doubt that he is guilty. but all this buissness just shows that america did not outgrow the lynch mob mentality. womans groups want to hang him weather he did it or not. to further there cuase.if you get into trouble is this how you want peaple to react
<LI>I think that if the LAPD didn't have such poor investigative techniques that he would not have gotten off.
<LI>THE "NOT GUILTY" VERDICT FROM AN ALMOST ALL BLACK JURY, PROVES THAT A NIGGERS INTELLIGENCE IS ONLY ONE STEP ABOVE AN APES.
<LI>the outrage is on race, not on the verdict
<LI>A jury's verdict is good enough for me.  
<LI>if your'e rich and famous you can get away with any thing , even murder
<LI>OJ said to Fay Resneck at the funeral when she asked him "What happened?"...he said "I'm sorry, I just loved her too much". He also said "I'm sorry to other close friends". THAT IS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT!!  Then he told his other friend (the cop) that he refused to take a lie detector test because he had had dreams of "killing Nicole".  WAKE UP BLACK AMERICA! OF COURSE HE DID IT..DOESN'T IT BOTHER ANY OF YOU THAT YOU'RE MAKING A HERO OUT OF A MURDERER?
<LI>Only three people know who did it, and they're not talking!
<LI>THEY ARE HIS CHILDREN TOO, I'M NOT SAYING HE IS PERFECT BUT NOT A MURDER EITHER. OJ HAS ALL OF MY SUPPORT. IF GIVEN THE CHANCE I WOULD TELL HIM THAT AND YES I AM A WHITE FEMALE.
<LI>I think what happened here is this: Black people could not accept the fact that a black hero of theirs could do something so horrible. They (including the jury) completely ignored the evidence that showed OJ to be guilty. They ignored his drug problem, his violent temper, the fact that he was a WIFE BEATER and a man obsessed with having his own way. White people can be just as dumb. There are still millions of whites who 'worship' Elvis in the same manner. They completely ignore the fact that he was a 
errible husband, a lousy father, a drug addict, a spoiled rotten brat who threw violent tantrums when things didn't go his way...they ignore all that, and only see "ELVIS THE ENTERTAINER" and view him as a demi-god.  This just goes to show 2 things: (1) Image is everything, (2) the human race can be pretty damn deaf, dumb and blind when they want to be.
<LI>It verdict made me sick.
<LI>The longest saddest excuse for justice I've ever witnessed
<LI>You people need to get a life this survey waste your time and mine.  I just lost a whole 5 minutes of productivity by taking this stupid survey.  Have a great life
<LI>OJ definetely guilty
<LI>Face the System, found not Guilty.. everybody get a life now 
<LI>A shame to America
<LI>Great job by the defense! Hope they'll represent me if I ever should need them!!
<LI>The whole thing was ridiculous. It is possible that he did or did not fucking kill those people. I dont know and very few people still alive do know. One thing I do know is that our government and media control system are out to separate races to create further confusion and hatred among the masses, which encourages consumption, which the system profits from....Consume! Consume!! Don't believe the lies. Take back the power. 
<LI>Purely disgusted.
<LI>I did it.
<LI>In Texas, I think we'd say the boy had some hanging coming his way.
<LI>The trial has worsened race relations in the U.S.A.
<LI>I still can't believe something like this can happen in America !!!
<LI>In money we trust
<LI>I have lost all confidence in the American NEGRO
<LI>My faith in the jsutice system is shaken only because the prosecution proved to be so inept.
<LI>we will live with the fallout from this trial for years
<LI>I don't think that every one should put up such a big fuss on wether O.J. did it or not. God knows and will be the one and only juror in O.J.'s trial in heaven.
<LI>TRIAL WAS TOO LONG
<LI>How much solid evidence does it take to convict someone!!
<LI>If the LAPD was framing him,why didn't they take him more seriously about spousal abuse?  It doesn't wash. 
<LI>they should have hung that nigger!!!!
<LI>I think that this is the worst thing to happen to race relations in my life time
<LI>The statements that some of the jurors made after the trial, especially concerning their view of the irrelavence of the spousal abuse evidence, seems to question the practice of trial by a jury of one's peers.  With more and more sophisticated scientific and psychological evidence being presented at trials, a jury of one's peers cannot be expected to understand such evidence, and make a just verdict.
<LI>My real answer to #12 is that rich/famous people can *buy* reasonable doubt.  I never believed 12 people in LA could accept that wealth and fame do not mean you would not kill.
<LI>GUILTY!!!!
<LI>I'm white and I'm proud to say that I tihink O. J. is not guilty!
<LI>I feel for the children because they have lost their mother and nobody should have to go through life without their mother, and expecially if she was murdered it would be tuff.
<LI>what a joke.
<LI>TOO MUCH TIME WAS SPENT ACCUSING THE WRONG PERSON 
<LI>I, like many people, am just shocked and confused.  I'm not really sure which way I *really* believe now...
<LI>Money talks.  
<LI>THE JUICE IS LOOSE
<LI>boycott OJ
<LI>If you remove the issue of race, I believe that there was enough evidence to find reasonable doubt.  Further, civil suits constitute double jeapordy in my opinion and should be summarily dismissed.  I empathize with the families for their losses, but this
<LI>Whites are angry because a black man cot so of the "privilaged justice" reserved for themselves. They are being hyprocrites. Look at the menedez brothers. they kill their parents. Even if oj is guilty the jury found him not guilty..case done.. the whites do it all the time
<LI>How could the jury render a reasonable verdict in 3 hours??
<LI>race played no factor in the verdict-view evidence w/out bias.  I feel the media has done a great injustice to this country by perpetuating race as a motivating factor in this case.
<LI>Its a shame that OJ didn't go to Disney World!!!
<LI>We need to change the reasonable doubt law, and make it proponderence of the evidence
<LI>It was long, but interesting.  Good outcome
<LI>Your countrys justice system is a nullity.
<LI>this was the most pathetic trial ever
<LI>For those unhappy with the verdict, no one but the LAPD can be blaimed for giving the jury reasonable doubt with their sloppy procedures and lack of compitent detectives.   Oh... one more thing it's Johnnie Cochran, not Johnny Cochran.
<LI>the trial was a mokery to our justice system ,a joke  
<LI>The trial shold not be the focus.  The crime of murder should have been.  Also, the trial was a sad commentary on the even sorrier state of race relations in this country.
<LI>If you have lots of money, you can get away with anything!
<LI>That was quite a circus!
<LI>The jury system sucks!!!
<LI>I new he was innocent from the start
<LI>made me sick !!!!!
<LI>reveal the sign of crisis of law system
<LI>Justice Served? Christ! Johnny Cochran would defend Satan himself if he was paid enough bucks! I hope someone shoots OJ and his scumified "Dream Team"
<LI>Your #16 is ridiculous.  They are OJ's children too!  I am sick and tired of hearing the uproar about the acquittal.  No one seemed too upset about Emmitt Till's murder.  Finally justice is being served.  The prosecution did not prove their case and their
<LI>The outcome was exactly what was expected.  What, if anything, has OJ EVER done for the black community to deserve this type of support?  It seems to definitly be a case of brother looking out for brother here.
<LI>The jury did not give the right verdict or the wrong verdict......they gave THE VERDICT.....end of story 
<LI>I guess Justice isn't cheap.

<UL>

<!-- FIELD:CMT_PREZ -->
<LI>Harry Browne. Because he truely wants to reduce the size of government
<LI>Clinton
<LI>Alan Keyes, for the heart and soul of our country.
<LI>Hagelin; high ideals, specific plan for implementing change
<LI>Elizabeth Dole - Smarter than her husband - first woman prez
<LI>Alan Keyes--the values and logic of the Bible are intertwined with the constitution; that is very critical to all aspects of this nation.
<LI>Presidential Elections always come down to the evil of two lessers
<LI>Rick Tompkins. After reading what he stands for and looking around at how bad things have gotten...what have we got to lose? We've already lost so many of our personal freedoms.
<LI>The old Reagan, now he could do it
<LI>Any Libertarian Candidiate, the existing system is useless.
<LI>Alan Keyes because he has the correct views and everyone knows it!That's why he hasn't been invited to debate.
<LI>Rick Tompkins -- he's libertarian and I like his platform more than other libertarian candidates'.
<LI>Rick Tompkins for he's unabashed at returning our liberties
<LI>a Libertarian
<LI>I want more liberty and government only for life and property protection
<LI>Bob Dole because he stands most closely for the values and beliefs that I have and wants to take this country in what I believe to be the right direction.
<LI>Steve Forbes because I agree with his basic philosophy of less government involvement in the lives of Americans and his flat tax proposal.
<LI>Any non-Republicrat
<LI>Rick Tompkins- He stands for everything I beleive in
<LI>A libertarian; right now I'm leaning toward Rick Tompkins. I'm sick of career politicians who can't or won't do the right thing even when they can decide what it is; whose platforms consist of the most palatable panderings; whose blundering is ensuring that I and my children will be indentured servants to their misguided detrimental social machinations. I believe that only the Libertarians offer any hope of excising the myriad cancerous growths on what was once a good government.
<LI>Bill Clinton, he has continued to cut the deficit, lower un-employment.  He believes that in helping the poor we are helping this country.
<LI>Keyes - Rebuild the country the way it was meant to be
<LI>Steve Forbes
<LI>Harry Browne. Libertarian candidate and a true radical.
<LI>Harry Browne - it is the only vote not for same old same old
<LI>Anyone remotely libertarian who I can actually believe in.
<LI>Clinton; No other good and popular candidates; the president will be both. 
<LI>phil graham,I think he would be the best candiate
<LI>Steve Forbes, Fiscal responsibility, Tax & SS changes, Term Changes, nobody will own him & he can guide this national ship to the best interest of the American Majority.
<LI>A president with a backbone that takes a stand on something no matter how many votes he may lose.  In short a candidate that isn't out to win the presidency, but to serve the people.
<LI>Steve Forbes will return freedom of choice to the people, which will make everyone happier, not just one side. If you can choose what's right for yourself, you'll gain more happiness than you would form forcing others to do what6 you think is right.
<LI>Collin Powell-  He can lead the nation out of battle
<LI>HARRY
<LI>Bob Dole, because he is the best choice, and he has served his nation very well in many ways.
<LI>see above
<LI>Bill Clinton.  The Republican nominees are nothing but right-winged assholes!  Their beliefs in what a lifestyle or ones life should be doesn't matter to me.  I have the right  to be happy.  I don't want a Republican dick like Buchanan or Dole telling me their standards of what America should be, I live in it and I know what I want it to be!
<LI>Bill Clinton - He has the experience - He has matured in
<LI>Leadership, TRUTH, HONESTY, MORALS, experience
<LI>Phil Gramm because he was the only true conservative all important issues fiscal & social
<LI>Steve Forbes - He is conservative, but not out of control. He makes sense and I like his flat tax proposal.
<LI>Clinton, he's moderate, smart and looks ahead for the country
<LI>Bill Clinton. Of all the canidates hes the only one thats not way out there.
<LI>Steve Forbes,he is an outsider and some thing fresh for a change
<LI>someone who gives a damn
<LI>Libertarian Harry Browne -- for more FREEDOM.
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>Keyes - only one with integrety
<LI>undecided
<LI>Steve Forbes, because I believe the worst problem facing us is the national debt-- the cause of that being the failure of the government to be restricted in how much money it takes from individuals. With a flat tax restriction, the government would have a more difficult time attempting to take more money from it's citizens.  
<LI>I want Harry Browne, for a chance for us all to live our own lives.
<LI>i want the most libertarian candidate possible. We need to drastically cut government spending and involvement in all areas, and the gop doesn't have the stomach for cutting corporate welfare and the military. 
<LI>I haven't been impressed yet.
<LI>Pat Buchanan.  He is conservative on social issues
<LI>Buchanan because he understands Constitutional limitations on government power.
<LI>dole, Because I feel he is a true leader,clinton is not
<LI>Bill Clinton  His concearns for the low income, people.
<LI>Alan Keyes; addresses our critical moral problems in a unifying way.
<LI>Pat Buchanan. Because he is a person who stands for what he believes and his values are in line with mine and I think that he would be a strong President which this country needs.
<LI>Harry Browne.  He is the LP frontrunner.
<LI>Dole - Social and Economic Conservative - Reasonable, fair
<LI>Harry Browne; Only long-term solution for recreating US as the "Land of the free".
<LI>Alan Keyes: to bring moral, positive, unifying leadership
<LI>Obey the US Constitution. IT THEIR JOB!!!!!!
<LI>Bob Dole.  He knows the system, he is a leader, and he was wounded in combat defending the country that he loves.  He wasn't afraid to die for his liberty, or for the liberty of his family and friends.
<LI>Buchanan, he is committed to his conservitive beliefs.
<LI>Newt Gingrich because he tells it like it is and is conservative.
<LI>Lamar Alexander, he is quite possibly the Republican Harry S. Truman, little known--but honest.
<LI>Harry Browne - more freedom
<LI>Colin Powell - leadership & vision
<LI>Rick Tompkins
<LI>Pat Buchanan
<LI>Harry Browne, I just want the G.D. Government to leave me alone
<LI>Alan Keyes knows the problem & solution for our country.
<LI>Clinton, understands need for health reform and continued education and environmental programs
<LI>Alan Keyes, He knows moral decay is the biggest problem in the US today.
<LI>A human being with a mind and backbone.
<LI>buchannan
<LI>Of the candidates running, Bob Dole.  Clinton continues to take both sides of every issue after he has discussed it with his pollster.  If I had a choice of who should be president I would choose Jack Kemp. 
<LI>Tompkins. His Ethics.
<LI>Rick Tompkins because I simply believe his ideas are best.
<LI>I had a difficult time expressing many views with these one item choices.  I am politically somewhere between a Republican and a Liberterian.  I am 100% economically conserative making me in line with conservative Republicans and Libertains.  For example, I support abolishing the federal income tax and eliminating federal regulations on private enterprise.  I support the Libertain ideas to moderately legalize drugs; have freer immigration laws, and reduce miltary spending.  Where I come down more in th
 Republican camp is that I am pro life on abortion and do not support legalizing prostitution.  I will probably vote for Dole because he has a better chance of beating Clinton then does a libertarian candidate
<LI>I WANT TO SEE ALAN KEYES WIN BECAUSE WE NEED SOME MORAL LEADERSHIP IN THE WHITE HOUSE!
<LI>Alan Keyes.  We NEED GOD!  We Need a Spiritual Revival!  We Need Alan Keyes!
<LI>Pat Buchanan has a moral compass and can lead the country.
<LI>Keyes. Cause he is the only one who has identified both problems in America.. Morality and the easy one, Clinton & Clinton
<LI>Sonny Bono.  He more represents America than the others.
<LI>I'm still undecided about the Libertarian candidate that I want to vote for in the primary (Illinois).  But I would love to see a Libertarian in the office of president because I feel it's time for change.  not just the gong banging political rhetoric, but real change.  I don't believe a Libertarian would be able to do all that he/she would like, but they sure would shake the hell out of the system.
<LI>Buchanan, He is the only one with moral integrity.
<LI>Im not sure yet
<LI>Pat Buchanan because he stands on his views.
<LI>Bob Dole
<LI>Pat Buchannan,  He believes in God.  He also believes that if God and the Bible were put back into the school systems, problems would decrease, including the premarital sex and the horrible violence/hate crimes.
<LI>lamar! I love that plaid
<LI>Anyone who endorses individual rights.
<LI>Harry Browne - Deserves it - Said he'd quit - great retirement plan.
<LI>Harry Browne, I want complete freedom 
<LI>anyone but Bill Clinton
<LI>My preference is for Alan Keyes, because his message and vision is exactly on target.  I am in total agreement with his positions on all major issues.  If, due to his lack of financial support and Liberal media's attempts to totally ignore his candidacy, he does not win the Republican nomination, then I will support the Republican nominee.  In short, A.B.C. (ANYBODY BUT CLINTON!)
<LI>Rick because I know him to be a man of principle and honesty or Colin Powell inspite of what I disagree with him about because I belive him to be the same
<LI>Bob Dole- He will certainly do a much better job than Clinton!!
<LI>bob dole.
<LI>Forbes-I believe he will clean up DC, and make life better for me and my family.
<LI>Steve Forbes. Need an outsider who has few partisan ties and who knows how to run a multi-million dollar business that is successful and makes money.
<LI>BILL CLINTON,HE'S A GOOD PRESIDENT
<LI>Rick Thompkins.  I support his platform
<LI>This is difficult because I would prefer a stronger, more liberal candidate than Clinton, but I find the possibility of any of the current republican hopes winning the presidency terrifying and would do ANYTHING possible to keep that from happening.
<LI>Bill Clinton.  I believe he is doing a marvelously adequate job as President, and do not wish to replace him with the available alternatives.
<LI>Someone who can make America "Land of opportunity" again.
<LI>Forbes, because his platform is one of economics and optimism, he isn't out preaching about legislating morality
<LI>Buchanan/Keyes,Buchanan is smart, Keyes is greatest man of 20th centuryy
<LI>Anybody but Bill and Hillary--Why? Because they represent what is wrong with politicians--they lie about everything.
<LI>Rick Tompkins, he understands what is wrong with our country, and has the moral courage to face it.
<LI>Buchanan, not part of political establishment, cares about the American people first
<LI>Colin Powell because he is of the highest character and has views in line with the vast majority of America.
<LI>Harry Browne -- the ONLY candidate with the common sense and guts to cut the government back to what it is supposed to be and eliminate unnecessary spending.  Not to mention federal taxes.  :) 
<LI>Rick Tompkins;just to scare the hell out of the statists!!
<LI>Browne
<LI>Alan Keyes -- he's not a phony, arrogant politician
<LI>Bob Dole is a moderate conservative who will be good for America
<LI>Bob Dole, He is experienced in the art of politics and he is not a bussiness man
<LI>Pat Buchanan-- He is the only conservative amoung the Republicans
<LI>Bill Clinton because he defends what I believe in.
<LI>Rick Tompkins, the most principled Libertarian running.
<LI>Alan Keyes.  He focuses on morals and not just money
<LI>Colin Powell--because he is the best man for the job(if only he were running) 
<LI>Tompkins, constitutional ideals, vein of Jefferson/Washington
<LI>Steve Forbes, he is very intelligent, has excellent agenda and is a business person with sound business ideas. The single rate tax would be fair to all. Very interested in the tax limitations of single rate.
<LI>Bob Dole, but Clinton wil win.
<LI>Howard Stern - at least he's honest.
<LI>Alan Keyes, because he's right!
<LI>Still looking, unhappy with democrats and republicans. Does another party have a chance?
<LI>Tompkins, he sounds legitimate, and he is not tainted by Washington politics.
<LI>Bill Clinton - No other candidate has the education he does
<LI>Goerge Bush because hes the best president except for Goerge Washington
<LI>Clinton, he is the best man.
<LI>Rick Tompkins; HE supports all of the Bill of Rights and the ENTIRE Libertarian Party Platform!!
<LI>Phil Gramm, if he would get on board with the flat tax proposal.  Gramm has demonstrated in the past he understands the need to REDUCE the wasteful spending of our money.
<LI>Ideally, Harry Browne; he's the only candidate with the philosophy and the plan to substantially reduce the Federal Government.  Among the two "entrenched" parties, Steve Forbes; he's the only candidate among them that's for reducing government economically and socially.
<LI>Bob B-1 Dornin...No holds bard politian..tells it like it is...strong military influance...
<LI>Harry Browne for reduced government
<LI>Myself
<LI>Bill Clinton because someone needs to stop Newt 
<LI>I have yet to find a worthy candidate.
<LI>Bill Clinton, because he has not forgotten the poor and the elderly!!!
<LI>Keyes because he will face the morality problem in our country
<LI>Lamar Alexander: best brain in the bunch
<LI>More than two major candidates.
<LI>Rick Tompkins-He seems to have strong, guiding principles.
<LI>Pat Buchanan.  He has firm political opinions and the will to act upon them.
<LI>Rick Tompkins -- the only voice for uncompromising principle and liberty in the campaign.
<LI>Bill Clinton because he represents my views
<LI>Colin Powell - Integrity, balanced views, good arbiter between conservative and liberal viewpoints
<LI>A candidate who really supports personal freedom & limited government.
<LI>William F. Buckley
<LI>I'd like to see Rick Timkins because he is the candidate who most exemplifies my position on the government.
<LI>FORBES, HE IS A RICH MAN
<LI>Pat Buchanan: He has consistantly articulated my feelings.
<LI>FORBES, HE IS A RICH MAN
<LI>Randy Weaver
<LI>Rick Tompkins    He is the exception to every rule!!!
<LI>Rick Thompkins because he's an honest, libertarian candidate
<LI>legalize drugs, a president that gets us on the right track
<LI>Pat Buchanan. He'll shake things up.
<LI>Harry Browne - He is the only cndidate that realizes that Government Doesn't Work!
<LI>Alan Keyes is the only one out there whos heart is in the campaign
<LI>Harry Browne is the ONLY candidate who will CUT government!
<LI>Uncertain.  It appears as though my views are a hybrid of several agendas.  I like what Forbes says, however, much of his appeal is emotional and without substance outside of economic policy.  Ideally, I am in agreement with the Libertarian social agenda,
<LI>Bob Dole: because he is not Bill Clinton
<LI>my choices-in order- Steve Forbes, Harry Brown, Pat Buchannon
<LI>Jack Kemp (remotely libertarian, and could form wide support)
<LI>Rick Thompson-I like his platform and his ideas.
<LI>Harry Browne because he is simply the most qualified for the job at this time.  Others are too tied to their party affiliation as we have seen over the past two years to champion the cause of constitutional rights and freedom of american citizens in their
<LI>Undecided but definitely against Clinton.  Have trouble voting for Mr. Browne, since I want my vote to "count" against Clinton; I voted Perot last time in protest, sort of a "none of the above".  Intrigued by Forbes now, learning more about Browne.
<LI>Harry  Browne  repubs & dems both want big gov't
<LI>Ralph Nader - we need an alternative to the left of Clinton
<LI>I wish to see Bill Clinton re-elected because I do not see anyone else with enough experience or common sense...I know Clinton...I don't know what would happen with the others.
<LI>H Browne, will keep natl budget at $500 billion (defense only)
<LI>Forbes, he is up beat and dosn't preach
<LI>Steve Forbes - new ideas, pro growth, lower taxes 
<LI>Any libertarian type candidate with a chance to win.
<LI>Harry Browne. He is the only candidate committed to drastically reducing the size and power of the federal government.  
<LI>Bill Clinton - he will appoint better Supreme Ct justices 
<LI>See Bill Clinton get the fuck out of the White House
<LI>H. Browne...I still   believe in freedome
<LI>Forbes - We need someone who knows how to run a business.
<LI>Rick Tompkins, because he has integrety and stands for what I've believed in for 25 years
<LI>I hope Bob Dole will be the next president of our great nation. He knows our nations problems and will take the neccecary steps to put us on the right track.

<LI>harry browne; for Liberty
<LI>Harry Browne
<LI>harry browne because he will cut government and taxes
<LI>Phil Gramm - The most consistently conservative candidate
<LI>Alan Keyes - He understands the problems we REALLY face and isn't afraid to speak to them. He isn't a politician given to whim and he speaks with TRUE conviction and knows what is right and wrong REGARDLESS of popular or politically correct opinion.
<LI>Harry Browne or Rick Tompkins -- the only ones dealing with fundamentals of how government size and intrusiveness are destroying opportunity
<LI>Your "test" is very influated by USAs rightwing politics!
<LI>H Browne, hopefully to reduce federal gov and put the power where it can be effective(state/local).
<LI>Harry Browne,he is the only hope for our country.
<LI>Harry Browne -- because he advocates a decrease in the role government plays in our lives and espouses liberty as an ideal.

<LI>Alan Keyes.  His arguments are moral and speak to my heart.
<LI>phil gramm
