<title>LDA Position statement on IDEA amendments</title>

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>Position Statement on<br>
Committee Recommendations to Amend the<br>
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act<br>(IDEA)</h2>

<p>June 9, 1996

<p>LDA appreciates the important efforts that have been undertaken in both
the House and Senate to develop legislation designed to improve the IDEA.
Both House and the Senate Committees propose numerous changes in the Act
that LDA feels are important and positive.  Following are several of the
provisions LDA supports:

<ol>

<li>Changes related to the IEP, including:

<dl>
<p>A. Participation of parents in eligibility and placement decisions and
regular and special education teachers, where appropriate, in the IEP
team.

<p>B. Inclusion of short term goals or other benchmarks to measure
progress.

<p>C. Requirement for objective measurements of the child's progress
towards attaining annual goals.

<p>D. Inclusion of required accommodations. 

<p>E. Consideration of the emotional and behavioral aspects of a child's
learning disability as well as the communication needs of the child.

<p>F. The addition of the child's teacher to those who may reconvene the
IEP team to consider additional strategies for working with a child with
behavioral problems. 

<p>G. The requirement that the IEP team consider the appropriateness and
implementation of the child's IEP before a change in placement. 

<p>H. Reevaluations focused on the child's continued need for special
education and related services, not on whether or not the child has a
disability.
</dl>

<li>The retention of the current disability categories and the expansion of
the use of the term "developmental delay" for children aged 3 to  9.
Participation of children with disabilities in standardized assessments,
with accommodations if necessary.<br>

<li>Dropping the age for the beginning of transition considerations to age
14.<br>

<li>The requirement that parents be offered pre-due process mediation and
providing that either party can withdraw after a good faith effort has
been made.<br>

<li>The removal of the waiver provisions for model LEA programs and under 
Part H.

</ol>

<p>At the same time, LDA has concerns about other provisions within these
bills including:

<ol>

<li>Consolidation of  discretionary programs without adequate assurance
that the mission of these important programs will continue and that the
overall authorization level will be maintained.<br>

<li>  Changes in incidental benefit requirements and establishment of  a
coordinated services system which allows IDEA funds to be used for
students without disabilities.<br>

<li>Any new law that might result in coercion of  parents to "voluntarily" 
use their private insurance to pay for related services.

</ol>

<p>Finally, LDA is not prepared to support legislation which includes
provisions that would:

<ol>
<li>Alter state and local funding formulas to move away from the current child
count provision.<br>

<li>Allow state education agencies to suspend highest professional standards
for special education teachers and related services providers.<br>

<li>Allow a local education agency to reduce the level of expenditures for
special education when the reduction is attributable to the departure, by
retirement or otherwise, of special education personnel.<br>

<li>Change due process procedures. These procedures are essential to ensure
the rights of parents and individuals with disabilities. LDA is reluctant
to support any changes in procedural safeguards unless such changes
continue to protect the rights and enhance the educational opportunities
of children with learning disabilities.<br>

<li>Allow cessation of educational services to any student with disabilities.
LDA agrees that a student with disabilities who brings a weapon or drugs
to school, when such behavior is found not to be a manifestation of
his/her disability, may be removed from his/her current placement and
placed in an alternative placement.  However, LDA strongly believes that
cessation of educational services is harmful not only to the student and
his/her family, but also to the community at large.

<h1 align=center>Inclusion</h1>
<h2 align=center>Position Paper of the<br>
Learning Disabilities Association of America</h2>

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">LDA's position paper on full inclusion of all
students with learning disabilities in the regular education classroom,
1993</font></b></p>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America, LDA, is a National,
not-for-profit organization of parents, professionals, and persons with
learning disabilities, concerned about the welfare of individuals with
learning disabilities. During the 1990-1991 school year 2,117,087 children
in public schools were identified as having learning disabilities. This
is more than fifty percent of the total number of students identified in
all disability categories. </p>

<p>&quot;Full inclusion&quot;, &quot;full integration&quot;, &quot;unified
system&quot;, &quot;inclusive education&quot; are terms used to describe
a popular policy/practice in which all students with disabilities, regardless
of the nature or severity and need for related services, receive their
total education within the regular classroom in their home school. </p>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America does not support &quot;full
inclusion&quot; or any policies that mandate the same placement, instruction,
or treatment for <b>all</b> students with learning disabilities. Many students
with learning disabilities benefit from being served in the regular classroom.
However the regular education classrom is not the appropriate placement
for a number of students with learning disabilities who may need alternative
instructional environments, teaching strategies, and/or materials that
cannot or will not be provided within the context of a regular classroom
environment. </p>

<p>LDA believes that decisions regarding educational placement of students
with learning disabilities must be based on the needs of each individual
student rather than administrative convenience or budgetary considerations,
and must be the result of a cooperative effort involving educators, parents,
and the student, when appropriate. </p>

<p>LDA strongly supports the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) which mandates: </p>

<ul>
<li>a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment
appropriate for the student's specific learning needs. </li>

<li>a team-approved individualized education program (IEP) that includes
current functioning levels, instructional goals and objectives, placement
and services decisions, and procecures for the evaluation of program effectiveness.
</li>

<li>a placement decision must be made on an individual basis and considered
only after the development of the IEP. </li>

<li>a continuum of alternative placements to meet the need of students
with disabilities for special education and related services </li>

<li>a system for the continuing education of regular and special education
and related services personnel to enable these personnel to meet the needs
of persons with disabilities. </li>
</ul>

<p>LDA believes that the placement of <b>all</b> children with disabilities
in the regular classroom is as great a violation of IDEA as the placement
of all children in separate classrooms on the basis of their type of disability.
</p>

<p><b>LDA urges the U.S. Department of Education and each state to move
deliberately and reflectively in school restructuring, using the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act as a foundation-- mindful of the best interests
of all children with disabilities.</b> </p>

  <title>LDA Resolution on Neurotoxicity Testing</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>RESOLUTION</h2>

<h3 align=center>on<br><br>The Need for Federally Mandated Developmental
Neurotoxicity Testing  to Protect Human Health: Central Nervous System
Development </h3>

<p>The following resolution was adopted by the LDA Assembly of Delegates
on February 25, 1993. 

<p><b>Whereas: <br></b>
(1) The developing brain of the child before birth and in early life is
particularly vulnerable to insult from many substances; and, 

<p>(2) Neurotoxic effects in the developing brain can be both
quantitatively and qualitatively different from effects in mature adult
systems; and, 

<p>(3) Such toxicants can produce permanent alterations in brain
development and function, with subsequent effects on learning abilities
and behavior; and, 

<p>(4) At least 25% of industrial chemicals for which federal
occupational exposure limits have been met, have demonstrated neurotoxic
effects in adult systems; and, 

<p>(5) To date, only a small number of chemicals have been evaluated for
their potential to adversely affect brain development and function; and 

<p>(6) Many national and international organizations have called for
neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral testing for pesticides, food
additives, drugs, and priority chemicals; and, 

<p>(7) Collaborative behavioral teratology studies have provided evidence
of the validity and reliability of neurobehavioral test methods; and, 

<p>(8) Two federal agency reports to Congress have identified a number of
policy issues and options for Congressional action; 

<p><b>Be It Therefore Resolved: </b><br>
That the Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) urges all
federal agencies, responsible for the regulation and safety of products
for occupational safety and health and for the public health, to require
neurodevelopmental test data as an integral part of safety evaluations
and in setting standards to protect human health; and, 

<p><b>Be It Further Resolved: </b><br>
That LDA urges the Congress to amend and strengthen the statutory
authority of these federal agencies to require the inclusion of
neurodevelopmental data in safety and health evaluations and to ensure
greater access to and exchange of toxicological information. 

<hr>
<p><b>Amplification--LDA Resolution</b><br><i>
(1) The developing brain of the child before birth and in early life is
particularly vulnerable to insult from any substances</i><br> 
A toxic agent can affect the developing nervous system in many ways,
including changes in cell structure, function, production, migration, and
differentiation; and/or with the processes of axon and dendrite growth,
neurochemical mechanisms, synapse formation, and myelination.[l-2] 

<p><i>
(2) Neurotoxic effects in the developing brain can be both quantitatively
and qualitatively different from effects in mature adult systems.</i><br>
In the case of neurotoxicity, children are not "little adults." A safe
exposure cannot be estimated by extrapolating from adult toxic exposures,
because the developing brain may respond quite differently to an
exposure, than does a mature adult brain.[3] 

<p><i>
(3) Such toxicants can produce permanent alterations in brain development
and function, with subsequent effects on learning abilities and behavior.
</i><br>
The American Academy of Pediatrics has noted that early exposure to low
levels of lead incurs a risk of sustained developmental delays and
impaired cognition even in clinically asymptomatic children They
recommend directing pediatric efforts to routine screening, prevention
practices and regulatory action.[4] The Director of the Center for
Research on Mother and Children at the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development (NICHD) has pointed out that prenatal exposure to
many drugs, xenobiotic agents and toxic substances can cause measurable
and permanent behavioral abnormalities in the absence of visible
structural change or measurable physiological change.[5] 

<p><i>
(4) "At least 25% of hazardous industrial chemicals for which
occupational exposure limits have been set, have demonstrated neurotoxic
effects"</i> [6]<br>
The safe exposure limits of 167 of 588 chemicals set by the American
Conference of Government Industrial Hygienists were set on the basis of
their neurotoxicity.[7] The 1984 report by the Office of Technology
Assessment estimates that about one fourth of the chemicals encountered
in industry have neurotoxic effects. [8] 

<p><i>
(5) To date, only a small number of chemicals have been evaluated for
their potential to adversely  affect brain development and function.
</i><br>
Reports from the Office of Technology Assessment and from the General
Accounting Office to the U.S. Congress make this point.[9-10]

<p>There are a few chemicals and one pesticide for which EPA has
developed Test Rules for developmental neurotoxicity, one of the first in
1986.[11] However, no reference dose has been established for
developmental neurotoxicity as yet, and no action or regulation has
resulted from these data. 

<p>Testing for structural malformations is now required, while testing
for injuries to the central nervous system (CNS) is not. Yet neurologic
damage is a much more frequent outcome of chemical exposure than physical
malformations are. The result of our present regulatory policy is that we
are testing agents for neurotoxicologic effects on human subjects without
their consent or knowledge.[12] 

<p>FDA cannot require any toxicity testing for cosmetics[9] and does not
require developmental neurotoxicity data in the evaluation of drugs or
food additives. 

<p><i>
(6) Many national and international organizations have called for
neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral testing for pesticides, food
additives, drugs, and priority chemicals. </i><br>
The World Health Organization recommended in 1984 that efforts were
needed to include neurobehavioral tests for routine use in developmental
toxicity evaluation.[13] The Interagency Committee on Learning
Disabilities, mandated under the Health Research Extension Act of 1985
reported to Congress in 1987. The report recommended that data on
developmental neurotoxicity are needed to protect health and
development.[14] Japan requires several tests for developmental toxicity,
including behavior, in the evaluation of chemicals, especially
pharmaceutical drugs.[l5]

<p>The U.S. Congressional Committee on Agriculture Report pursuant to the
FIFRA Act Amendment of 1988 requested that EPA intensify the degree of
neurotoxicity testing in its pesticide program, including testing related
to prenatal and neonatal effects. 

<p><i>
(7) Collaborative behavioral teratology studies have provided evidence of
the validity and reliability of neurobehavioral lest methods. </i><br>
A major study was conducted in this country to check the comparability of
a number of behavioral tests, across six different laboratories[16]; in
Europe, five laboratories in four countries collaborated in the
evaluation of the detection levels of different test methods[17]; both
showed comparable sensitivities for the behavioral test batteries,
automated test systems, and the neurochemical assays. 

<p><i>
(8) Two federal agency reports to Congress have identified a number of
policy issues and options for Congressional action.</i><br>
The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) Report to the Congress
discusses the risk posed by neurotoxic substances, and evaluates the
Federal research and regulatory programs now in place to assess these
risks. The OTA Report found that neurotoxic chemicals constitute a major
public health threat, and that the social and economic consequences of
adverse effects are potentially very large.[9] 

<p>The US General Accounting Office (GAO) Report to the Senate Committee
on Governmental Affairs identified 30 chemicals that are of high concern
for reproductive and developmental effects. The report found that there
was insufficient protection from current risk assessment decisions, and
that 2/3 of the decisions were not based on reproductive or developmental
(including neurodevelopmental) data. The GAO report states,<i> We believe
it is unlikely that regulation based on other diseases will protect
against  reproductive and developmental outcomes in all cases.</i>[10]

Reading and Learning Disabilities</h1>
<h2 align=center>Position Paper of the<br>
Learning Disabilities Association of America</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>June 1996</b>
<p><b><i>LDA is concerned about the numbers of individuals with learning 
disabilities who have not learned to read and are currently not learning
to read in school.</i></b> According to the U.S. Department of Education,
1 in 5 American adults is functionally illiterate. Three-fourths of the 
unemployed lack sufficient skills to function successfully in the
nation's work force. There are many reasons for illiteracy - one cause 
is neurologically-based learning disabilities which have not been recognized 
and/or dealt with appropriately. 

<p>Many children, including children with learning disabilities, do not
learn to read in the first grade because they lack the basic readiness skills 
or the school's method is not appropriate for them.  They may be allowed
to fail for two or three years without effective intervention. Unless these 
children are identified early and appropriate instruction provided they 
may be passed along in school until basic reading instruction is no longer 
available. Quality reading programs must be available across the age range if 
we are to significantly reduce illiteracy. While accommodations may be
appropriate, they must not be substituted for direct reading instruction. 

<p>Common educational practice is for schools and adult literacy programs to 
adopt a single method for teaching reading, with the assumption that it will 
be effective for everyone. Research indicates that some students with
learning disabilities need a multisensory phonics approach, with instruction 
in phonological awareness; some students need a more meaning-based approach; 
while other students need interventions to address comprehension problems. For 
many students a combination of approaches is effective. <b>LDA EMPHASIZES THAT 
NO SINGLE READING METHOD WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH LEARNING 
DISABILITIES.</b>

<p>LDA believes that illiteracy is a national crisis. It is LDA's position 
that to effect a significant increase in reading achievement for all people the 
following elements must be in place:
<ul>
<li>a variety of methods for teaching reading in schools (in regular and 
    special education) and in adult literacy programs,
<li>intensive teaching of reading, written language, and spelling in 
    elementary and secondary schools,
<li>screening and diagnostic programs to identify students with reading 
    disabilities,
<li>evaluation of program effectiveness that goes beyond mandated periodic 
    testing,
<li>teacher certification requirements for elementary, secondary and special 
    education teachers include substantive courses in reading methodologies,
<li>individualized reading programs for students with learning disabilities, and
<li>a strong commitment to research which will identify causes/prevention of 
    reading failure and effective interventions. 
</ul>

<p>LDA recognizes that reading is crucial to success in school, to realizing 
one's potential, and to becoming a productive member of society. Therefore, 
every person must be given the opportunity to learn to read. Appropriate 
reading programs must be available to all ages... <b><i>it is never too late 
to learn to read.</i></b><br>

<h1 align=center>Violence in Schools</h1>

<h2 align=center>Position Statement of the<br>
Learning Disabilities Association of America</h2>

<h3>Adopted by the LDA Board of Directors May 21, 1995</h3>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) strongly supports
efforts to eliminate violence in American schools. LDA agrees that students,
including students with learning disabilities, whose violent behavior is
a danger to themselves or others must be immediately removed from the current
school setting. LDA also supports current law which ensures that students
with learning disabilities so removed remain entitled to a free appropriate
public education, as provided through the Individualized Education Program
process. </p>

<p>LDA is concerned about misperceptions that students with disabilities
are disproportionately involved with violence in schools and that schools
can do little or nothing to discipline those few students with disabilities
who do exhibit violent behavior. Nothing in the limited data available
indicates that there is any disproportionate relationship between students
with disabilities and violence in schools. Further, as stated above, current
law provides more than adequate procedures to appropriately discipline
students with learning disabilities. </p>

<p>Schools must intervene early, using techniques such as behavior management
strategies to prevent violence in schools. The U.S. Department of Education
reports that schools which have effectively implemented models for classroom
and behavior management practices have greatly reduced or eliminated entirely
the need for subsequent interventions. LDA believes that such strategies
are essential so that students whose learning disabilities may make them
vulnurable in a volatile school environment may benefit from their educational
program. </p>

<p>LDA recognizes that a free appropriate public education in the least
restrictive environment is only possible in violence-free schools. Therefore,
LDA is committed to working toward that end with all parties interested
in ensuring safe schools for all children.

   <title>LDA Fact Sheet - Assistive Technology</title>

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Assistive Technology for Individuals with Learning Disabilities</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Commitee<br>
      July 1994</b>

<p>Individuals with learning disabilities often have difficulty with skills
that others take for granted like reading, listening, organizing information
or writing and may benefit from the use of assistive technology. The umbrella
term &quot;assistive technology&quot; as used in P.L. 100-407 (The Assistive
Technology Act) can describe both devices and services. Appropriate assistive
technology for students with learning disabilities can include but is not
limited to computers, taped books, spellers, tape recorders, readers, calculators
and electronic date books. Devices (or equipment) may be high tech (using
sophisticated electronics, for example) or low tech (such as an abacus
for math computation or a grip for a pencil). Equipment or strategies developed
for individuals with other disabilities may be appropriate. The key is
to determine the functional limitation of the disability and to find an
appropriate accommodation. </p>

<p><b>Definition
<br></b>As defined in P L. 101-476 (IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act), the term &quot;assistive technology device&quot; means
<i>&quot;any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired
commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized that is used to increase,
maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities.&quot;</i>
In the same legislation, the term &quot;assistive technology service&quot;
is defined as <i>&quot;any service that directly assists and individual
with a disability in the selection, acquisition, or use of an assistive
technology device.&quot;</i> </p>

<p><b>Individualized Education Plans
<br></b>Both devices and services can be written into an IEP (Individualized
Education Plan) if the IEP team determines that assistive technology is
necessary for the student to receive a free, appropriate education and
the team designates assistive technology as either special education or
a related service. The need for assistive technology must be considered
like other needs, on a case-by-case basis. Although there are few opportunities
for assistive technology assessments and few qualified assessors, assessments
can be requested through the IEP. IEPs that include assistive technology
should be written so that students have access to these accommodations
not only for in-class work, but also for projects and for all types of
tests. In addition, Dr. Judy Schrag, (Office of Special Education Programs),
in a policy letter dated November 27, 1991, states that assistive technology
need not be restricted solely to in-school use. Lack of availability or
cost cannot be used as excuse for not providing what is deemed necessary
by the IEP team as long as the need is related to education. To support
the need for assistive technology, parents and professionals should document
precisely how the student benefits educationally. For instance, documentation
could include information such as: &quot;Mary usually takes 1 hour to do
8 math problems. With a calculator, she can do the same number of problems
in 20 minutes.&quot; Should the use of assistive technology be denied,
parents have a right to appeal the decision through mediation or due process.
</p>

<p><b>Employment and Assistive Technology
<br></b>Individuals and employers can get help in identifying appropriate
assistive technology and/or accommodations in the workplace by contacting
the Job Accommodations Network (JAN) at 1-800-526-7234. Consultants can
provide comprehensive, up-to-date information about accommodations, devices
and strategies. Calls to JAN are confidential. </p>

<p><b>Assistive Technology Projects
<br></b>P.L. 100-407 (Technology-related Assistance for Individuals With
Disabilities Act of 1988) provides an avenue for all individuals with disabilities,
including those with learning disabilities, to explore the use of assistive
devices and to access services. The Tech Act (P.L. 100-407) focuses on
consumer involvement and allocates funds for a maximum of 10 years to states
to help overcome barriers to appropriate selection, acquisition, and usage
and to make assistive technology more accessible. Pursuant to the passage
of the Act, projects in all 50 states have been funded. Generally the projects
are to 
<ol>
<li>provide access to computerized information on the use of assistive
technology,
<li>develop demonstration centers where individuals with disabilities,
may go to try out different pieces of equipment,
<li>provide consultants,
to help individuals make informed decisions about equipment,
<li>provide referral services, and 
<li>provide training to both individuals with disabilities
and others.
</ol>


<p>The funded projects in the various states are operated in either the
state vocational rehabilitation services office, the department of education,
the University-Affiliated Program, or by a coalition of service providing
agencies at the state level. The state department of education should be
able to provide information to help individuals locate the project in each
state. </p>

<p><b>Resources
<br></b>More information about assistive technology and information about
the assistive technology project in your state can be obtained from the
National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research at 202-205-5000.

users and researchers can be reached at <a href="http://www.webable.com/">http://www.webable.com/</a>.

   <title>LDA Fact Sheet - Central Auditory Processing</title>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>What are Central Auditory Processing Problems in Children?</h3>

<p>January 1966

<p>&quot;Okay, class, before you open your science book to page 95 for
the next lesson, get out your homework from yesterday, and put it in the
right hand corner of your desk for me to review; then we'll be ready to
start.&quot; Ron takes out his social studies book and stares into space.
Why didn't Ron follow the teacher's directions? Not listening? Distracted?
Not paying attention? Poor conduct? Hearing loss? Any of these explanations
is possible. Or maybe Ron hears the sound, but has a problem processing
or understanding what is said to him particularly when the language used
is complex, spoken rapidly, or is lengthy, and when there's a lot to look
at and lots of noise around him. The inability to understand spoken language
in a meaningful way in the absence of what is commonly considered a hearing
loss is called a central auditory processing problem. Other terms that
have been used interchangeably include: auditory comprehension deficit,
central deafness, word deafness and auditory perceptual processing dysfunction.
</p>

<p>Frank Musiek, audiologist and researcher in this area, has described
central auditory processing as, &quot;How well the ear talks to the brain,
and how well the brain understands what the ear tells it.&quot; </p>

<p>Evaluation by both an audiologist and a speech-language pathologist
provides important information about the person with central auditory processing
problems. An audiologist will evaluate a child's hearing and identify possible
processing problems. This professional will also make recommendations about
treatment strategies concerning improving the listening environment and
monitoring any changes in hearing status. A speech-language pathologist
can evaluate a child's perception of speech and his/her receptive (understanding)
and expressive (production) language use. These professionals and a child's
teacher and parents can work together to determine the scope of the problem
and the most effective treatment techniques. </p>

<p>Two general treatment approaches have been used for central auditory
processing problems. One approach focuses on training certain auditory
and listening skills such as auditory discrimination (e.g., telling the
difference between peas and bees), localization of sound, sequencing sounds,
or identifying a target sound in a noisy background. Training these skills
in isolation, however, may not help a child to understand complex language,
such as a teacher's instructions, Therefore, another approach concentrates
on teaching more functional language skills (e.g,, vocabulary, grammar,
conversational skills) and uses strategies (e.g., visual aids and repeating
directions) to facilitate the processing of language. </p>

<p>Changes can also be encouraged at home and in the classroom to help
a child with central auditory processing problems: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>1. Seating </p>

<ul>
<li>Select seating for the child away from auditory and visual distractions
to help focus and maintain attention. A seat close to the teacher and the
blackboard and away from the window and the door may be helpful. </li>
</ul>

<p>2. Setting </p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce external visual and auditory distractions. A large display of
posters or cluttered bulletin boards can be distracting. A study carrel
in the room may help. Ear plugs may be useful for distracting noise from
a heater or air conditioner, the pencil sharpener, or talking in the hallways.
Check with an audiologist to find out if ear plugs are appropriate and
which kind to use. Placing mats and cloth poster boards on classroom walls
has been shown to decrease the reverberation of noise. A structured classroom
setting may be more beneficial than an open classroom situation.
<br></li>

<li>To improve the listening environment, an audiologist may recommend
the use of a device that transmits the teacher's voice directly to the
student's ear while blocking out background noise. The audiologist can
provide recommendations on the potential benefit of available options based
on the child's individual needs. </li>
</ul>

<p>3. Speaking </p>

<ul>
<li>Gain the child's attention before giving directions. </li>

<li>Speak slowly and clearly, but do not overexaggerate speech. </li>

<li>Use simple, brief directions. </li>

<li>Give directions in a logical, time-ordered sequence. Use words that
make the sequence clear, such first, next, finally. </li>

<li>Use visual aids and write instructions to supplement spoken information.
</li>

<li>Emphasize key words when speaking or writing especially when presenting
new information. Pre-instruction with emphasis on the main ideas to be
presented may also be effective. </li>

<li>Use gestures that will clarify information. </li>

<li>Vary loudness to increase attention. </li>

<li>Check comprehension by asking the child questions or asking for a brief
summary after key ideas have been presented to be sure the child understands.
</li>

<li>Paraphrase instructions and information in shorter and simpler sentences
rather than by only repeating. </li>

<li>Encourage the child to ask questions for further clarification. </li>

<li>Make instructional transitions clear. </li>

<li>Review previously learned material. </li>

<li>Recognize periods of fatigue and give breaks as necessary. </li>

<li>Avoid showing frustration when the child misunderstands a message.
</li>

<li>Avoid asking the child to listen and write at the same time. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For children with severe central auditory processing problems, ask a
buddy to take notes, or ask the teacher to provides notes. Tape recording
classes is another effective strategy.

<p>Central auditory processing problems can affect learning particularly
in areas like spelling and reading. It is important to identify problems
early and help the child acquire adaptive strategies to compensate. If
your child is a &quot;poor&quot; listener, frequently misunderstands speech,
and has difficulty following directions, consult an audiologist or 
speech-language pathologist to determine if problems exist.

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>DYSLEXIA</h3>
<p>Educational Services Committee<br>
May 1996
<p><b>What is dyslexia?
<br></b>Dyslexia is a learning disability in the area of reading. It is
included in the category of &quot;Learning Disabilities&quot; in the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A person with dyslexia is someone
with average to above average intelligence whose problem in reading is
not the result of emotional problems, lack of motivation, poor teaching,
mental retardation or vision or hearing deficits. The term <b><i>dyslexia</i></b>,
however, is defined in different ways. While reading is the basic problem,
people include different aspects of reading and related problems in their
definitions. For example: </p>

<ul>
<li>Problems learning to translate printed words into spoken words with
ease, beginning reading skills (decoding) </li>

<li>Problems with word identification and/or reading comprehension </li>
</ul>

<p>Persons with dyslexia often reverse or mis-sequence letters within words
when reading or writing (b/d, brid/bird, on/no). They may also exhibit
difficulties with one or more of the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>Perceiving and/or pronouncing words </li>

<li>Understanding spoken language </li>

<li>Recalling known words </li>

<li>Handwriting </li>

<li>Spelling </li>

<li>Written language </li>

<li>Math computation </li>
</ul>

<p><b>What is reading?
<br></b>Reading is more than translating print into the spoken word (decoding).
<b>Reading is getting meaning from print.</b> People who have not developed
automatic word recognition skills may have comprehension problems because
their energy is focused on identifying words rather than thinking about
what they mean. Many of these children and adults read very slowly, often
having to read things more than once to understand. Others have automatic
word recognition skills, but cannot comprehend what they read. They may
also have trouble understanding spoken language. </p>

<p><b>What causes dyslexia?
<br></b>The basic cause of dyslexia is not known, however, much research
is being done to determine the problems underlying dyslexia. Research indicates
that, in many cases, dyslexia is inherited and may occur in several members
of a family, Studies are being done to determine whether there are slight
differences in the brains of people with dyslexia. Recent research indicates
that many children having difficulty learning early reading skills (decoding)
also have problems hearing individual sounds in words, analyzing whole
words into parts, and blending sounds into words (phonological processing).
</p>

<p><b>What should be done when dyslexia is suspected?
<br></b>Individuals suspected of having a reading disability should have
a comprehensive psychoeducational evaluation including hearing, vision
and intelligence testing. This evaluation <b>should include all areas of
learning and learning processes</b>, not just reading. The diagnostician(s)
should then be able to determine whether there are additional learning
disabilities, make recommendations for teaching methods, and specify whether
additional services are needed. </p>

<p>In many schools children are not identified as having a reading disability
until they have failed for an extended period because of a &quot;formula&quot;
used to determine whether a student is &quot;eligible&quot; for special
services. <b>A child should <i>not</i> have to fail for two or three years
to demonstrate evidence of a learning disability.</b> </p>

<p><b>What educational interventions are appropriate?
<br></b>If a child is diagnosed as having a reading disability (or dyslexia),
it is important for parents to ask exactly what the problem is, what method
for teaching reading is recommended, and why it was selected. There are
many approaches to teaching children with reading disabilities to read.
Recent research on beginning reading skills indicated that many children
having difficulty benefit from direct instruction in phonological processing
and a multi-sensory phonics approach to reading. There is, however, no
single method that will be effective with every child. A change in method
should be considered if progress is not seen in a reasonable length of
time. <b>Selecting the appropriate reading method for a child with a reading
disability is critical for success.</b> </p>

<p>Widely advertised reading programs that claim to be successful in teaching
phonics/reading to anyone should be viewed with caution. It is highly recommended
that before investing in these programs, research documenting their effectiveness
with individuals having diagnosed reading disabilities <b>(dyslexia)</b>
be requested and reviewed. </p>

<h4>Evaluate Your Child's Pre-School Skills</h4>

<p>Often it is the parents who first have concerns when their toddlers
are not &quot;on target&quot; in their development. Sometimes delayed development
is first detected in the doctor's office. </p>

<p><b>Warning signs are just that... Warnings.</b> They don't necessarily mean
there are problems, but they should be discussed with your pediatrician
or family physician at your next visit. If your toddler is developing normally,
your doctor will be able to reassure you. </p>

<p>Early intervention with a child who is behind in social, cognitive,
fine motor, gross motor, and/or language development can make a world of
difference. If you see some of these signs in your child, you may want
to contact your school district, primary physician or the local, state
or national LDA office for information. They can guide you on where to
start in determining whether your child has a developmental delay. </p>

<p>Federal Law, the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA), provides
for a free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities.
This includes early intervention for pre-school children who need special
education services. </p>

<p>The Learning Disabilities Association of America (LDA) is a national
non-profit volunteer organization whose members include individuals with
learning disabilities, their families and professionals, There are state
and local LDA chapters throughout the United States. For more information

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>TESTS OF GENERAL EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT (GED TESTS)</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>November 1993</b> </p>

<p><b>What is the GED?
<br></b>For students who have not graduated from high school, GED is a
means of obtaining a diploma that is equivalent to a high school diploma.
Most secondary programs will accept the GED as equivalent to graduation
from a regular high school program. The GED tests are designed to measure
the important knowledge and skills, usually learned during four years of
high school, that individuals may have obtained in a different manner.
</p>

<p><b>Who is eligible?
<br></b>Individuals who have not completed high school are eligible to
take the GED with the following stipulations: </p>

<ul>
<li>The individual must be a resident of the state in which (s)he is taking
the test. </li>

<li>The individual must <i>not</i> be enrolled in a public school. </li>

<li>Applicants under the age of eighteen must apply to the State Department
of Education, Adult Services, for permission to take the test. </li>

<li>Individuals with Learning Disabilities must fill out an &quot;Application
for Special Testing&quot; and sign a release of information to have certain
medical and psychological records sent to GED for review. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Which learning disability conditions may justify special accommodations?
<br></b>Learning Disability conditions which are eligible for special accommodations
include, but are not limited to, dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalculia, dyslogia,
attention deficit disorder, receptive aphasia, distractibility, and hyperactivity.
Documentation of the learning disability may be required. </p>

<p><b>What modifications are available to individuals with learning disabilities?
<br></b>Possible modifications which can be obtained include: </p>

<ul>

<li>Large print edition </li>

<li>Use of a scribe </li>

<li>Extended time </li>

<li>Use of a calculator </li>

<li>Frequent breaks </li>

<li>Use of a private room for testing </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Is there a fee for taking the test?
<br></b>Generally, there is a modest fee for taking the test for the first
time. An additional minimal fee is required for each retest. </p>

<p><b>Are preparation classes and/or practice materials available?
<br></b>Free classes and materials are provided to prepare and individual
to take the GED. Classes are usually held at local colleges or technical
schools and instruction is individualized to allow students to progress
at their own rate. Individual practice materials are also available form
Prentice Hall Regents Cambridge Adult Education Division of Prentice Hall
Publishers. </p>

<p><b>What is the format of the GED tests?
<br></b>The GED tests consist of five tests in the areas of writing skills,
social studies, science, literature and the arts, and mathematics. The
questions in each of these tests require a general knowledge of the subjects
and the ability to think. There are few questions asking about facts, details,
or definitions. </p>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>HOME SCHOOLING</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>May, 1996</b> </p>

<p>Families having students with learning disabilities who are struggling
in school frequently consider providing for their educational needs at
home. Parents are often attracted to home-schooling because of their disillusionment
with the traditional school. New technology is also driving the increase
in home-schooling. Sophisticated software is now available which evaluates
how much a child knows on a subject, designs lessons to fit the child's
needs, and tests how well the lessons are learned. </p>

<p>Although statistics are not readily available, most authorities believe
that the number of children taught in home-schools is growing (estimates
range from 500,000 to one million). In 1991 the National Home Education
Research Institute conducted a national survey of parents who belonged
to a home-school organization, and reported the following characteristics
of home-schooled children: </p>

<h3>Questions to ask when considering home-schooling</h3>

<p><b>Why teach children at home?</b> Home-schooling allows individualized
planning for each child-an opportunity to consider his/her needs and interests
and to tailor an educational program accordingly. It gives family members
an opportunity to spend more time together. Many families choose to become
involved in home-schooling because of strong mora] or religious convictions
and their desire to convey these values to their children through their
educational experiences. Sometimes parents disagree with the educational
philosophy of the public school system. </p>

<p><b>How does home schooling affect socialization?</b> Home-school advocates
might argue that sending children to school does not guarantee the desired
social opportunities and outcomes and that the home can protect the child
from negative influences. Parents serve as role models in the area of socialization.
Other social opportunities for children being educated at home include
interaction with peers after school and on week ends, dance/art classes,
theater groups, music lessons, sports teams, church activities, etc. Many
home-school parents belong to cooperatives which provide moral support
and information and often opportunities for children to study together,
go on field trips, or take informal classes. </p>

<p><b>What personal parental characteristics are needed for successful
home-schooling?</b> Parents who make this choice need to be flexible, patient,
sensitive to the needs of the children and spouse, have organizational
ability, a sense of humor, a desire to grow and learn, tenacity and determination,
a desire to spend extended time with children, good family communications,
financial resources and space, and be able to avail themselves of needed
resources (materials, support groups, community opportunities, etc.) </p>

<p><b>What is the financial impact of home schooling?</b> When considering
home-schooling, a side-by-side cost analysis of public, private and home-schooling
should be made. Home-schooling requires the presence of one parent in the
home, eliminating a second income. Expenses may include curriculum, support
services, resource materials, field trips, equipment, etc. Library services
can be used to reduce resource material costs. </p>

<p><b>What about legal requirements and record keeping?</b> Laws regarding
home-schooling vary from state to state, thus it is essential to contact
state and local education agencies to determine legal requirements. Some
states require that files be kept including proof of immunization, work
samples, evaluation of progress, etc. </p>

<p><b>How do home-educated children compare academically with other children?</b>
The National Home Education Research Institute reported in 1991, after
studying 1500 home-educated students, that the average scores for these
children were at or above the 80th percentile in all categories (reading,
listening, language, math, science, and social studies). Major standardized
tests used included the California Achievement Test, the Iowa Test of Basic
Skills, and the Stanford Achievement Test (SAT). </p>

<p><b>What about home-schooling students with learning disabilities?</b>
Children with learning disabilities represent challenges in finding educational
methods that work, and thus present additional challenges to parents who
attempt to serve as their primary educator. The attraction of home-schooling
for students with learning disabilities might be the ability to individualize
for his/her particular needs and to avoid the frustrations of trying to
find the right &quot;fit&quot; in the public school system. If home-schooling
is attempted for these children, parents must become informed about learning
disabilities and the resources which will address their unique needs. </p>

<h2 align=center>FACT&nbsp;SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Inclusion: Obtaining A Free Appropriate Public Education
(FAPE) and Placement for Your Child</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee,
<br>in consultation with Reed Martin, Esq.
<br>November 1995</b></p>

<h4>DEAR LEARNING DISABILITIES ASSOCIATION:</h4>

<p>Last week at my child's annual Individual Education Plan (IEP) meeting
the teacher said that students in special education programs will now receive
all special education services in inclusive general education classrooms.
Last year my child received special education services for reading and
written language in a resource room and made progress in both areas, I
do want my child in the regular classroom but I know he continues to need
direct and special help in reading and written language, If he does receive
all of his special education in the general education classroom and does
not make progress what can I do? </p>

<h4>DEAR CONCERNED PARENT:</h4>

<p>The IEP meeting you attended was not legal. Before such a change in
delivery of special education services, your school must do two things.
First, a reasonable time prior to that meeting your school must have given
you in writing notice of what they would be proposing; why they would propose
it; what alternatives they considered; why those alternatives were rejected;
a description of each evaluation procedure, test, record or report they
used as a basis for their proposal; and any other relevant factors, [34CRF
300.505]. Second, your child is also protected under Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act and The Americans with Disabilities Act. The school
must have conducted a re-evaluation of your child before proposing this
change, [34CRF 104.36]. You should demand both from your school district
even though it is after the fact. </p>

<p>The purpose behind the philosophy of 'inclusion' is to make sure that
all children have the opportunity to be educated in the same environment
as their non disabled peers. For many students in special education, innovative
programs in the regular classroom are fulfilling their needs. For other
students the opposite is true. Some children with learning disabilities
and/or attention disorders learn better in a resource room. The decision
as to <b>where</b> your child receives special education must be based
on your child's individual needs, not by what program the school offers.
</p>

<p><b>According to the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
all special education students must be educated in The Least Restrictive
Environment (LRE), which is often mistakenly interpreted as meaning that
the student must receive special education services in the regular or general
classroom</b>. The Least Restrictive Environment is decided after the individual
needs of the student are determined and written in the Individualized Education
Plan (IEP). If, with services in the regular classroom with the use of
supplemental aids and services, your child is not meeting his/her goals
on the IEP, then educating the child in a different environment like a
resource room for some portion of the day is one factor that should be
taken into consideration. The law is very clear in stating that in determining
the LRE a full continuum of placements (regular classroom, resource room,
self contained classroom placement etc.) must be available when making
placement decision for students in special education programs. In the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) under Continuum of alternative placements
300.552(b)(2), the resource room is specifically mentioned as an environment
where special education services can be delivered. </p>

<p>The ultimate goal in IDEA is to make sure that all students in special
education programs receive a <b>Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE)</b>.
Since all special education FAPE decisions are supposed to be made according
to your child's individual needs it is essential that you know and understand
your child's abilities and disabilities so that you will be able to give
well informed input as to what is appropriate or inappropriate in terms
of goals, objectives, learning styles, environment and placement. One way
of doing this is to familiarize yourself with all of the evaluation reports.
The evaluation report should include information on your child's abilities
and disabilities and how they are impacting both academic areas and the
entire school day. If you need a better understanding of the report, request
an appointment with your school psychologist, diagnostician or special
education teacher. </p>

<p>To make sure that your child is benefiting from his current individualized
education program (IEP) there are a number of things you can do: </p>

<p>1. Ask in writing for an IEP meeting. <b>According to law every IEP
must state the students 'Current Level of Performance &quot;in all areas
where your child is identified as needing special education.&quot;</b>
This statement should accurately describe the effect of the child's disability
on the child's performance in every area of education that is affected,
including (i) academic areas (reading, math, communication, etc,), and
(2) non academic areas (daily life activities, mobility, etc.)&quot; [34
CRF Sec. 300.345, Appendix e. Question 36]. Make sure that necessary academic
performance levels are addressed in a specific and meaningful way. If assessments
in those are not current, request that they be done right away so that
the IEP can properly address educational needs. Once the academic levels
are known, request that the special education teacher track the students
progress through frequent informal assessments. Have this frequent monitoring
written as part of the IEP and also designate how often the assessments
should occur. The Supreme Court has stated [Board of Education v. Rowley
(1982)] that &quot;parents are to be involved in assessing the effectiveness
of the program.&quot; So ask for things to be written into the assessment
that You can observe and report on, such as homework, behavior, etc. </p>

<p>2. Keep samples of all of your child's homework, tests, quizzes and
classwork. This will help keep you aware of progress and might come in
handy later on for use as documentation. </p>

<p>3. Find out how the special education services are being delivered to
your child in the regular classroom. </p>

<ul>
<li>How much time on a daily basis does the special education teacher spend
in the general education classroom? </li>

<li>How much time does the special education teacher spend with your child
giving direct instruction? </li>

<li>Does the teacher work one on one with your child or with small groups
of students? How many children are in the group? </li>

<li>Is the special education teacher certified in the area of learning
disabilities? </li>

<li>Is the instruction and curriculum designed with your child's educational
needs in mind? </li>

<li>Are learning strategies and organizational skills part of the daily
instruction? </li>

<li>How does this compare with the special education your child received
last year? </li>
</ul>

<p>4. If your child's academic skills do not seem to be progressing as
well this year in a general education classroom setting as they were last
year in a resource room setting, <i>ask the school system for written justification</i>
explaining on what they based their change of environmental placement decision,
Since the school system made the change in placement from a resource room
to the general education classroom based on a blanket policy of inclusion
without taking into consideration the individual needs of your child, it
is up to them to prove that this is the correct learning environment for
your child based on his individual needs. </p>

<p>5. If you continue to feel that your child needs a different special
educational setting, request in writing for your child to receive services
in a special education resource pull out program. State that you are requesting
that the school change the placement and provision of a free appropriate
education for your child and that they answer your letter within thirty
days. The school must then notify you in writing if they refuse to change
your child's placement. That notice must tell you: (1 ) What they are refusing,
(2) Why they are refusing it, (3) What alternatives they considered, (4)
Why they rejected those alternatives, (5) Every test, record, examination
or other report that forms the basis for their refusal, and (6) Any other
relevant factors. If the school district will not issue such written notice,
file a written complaint with your state education agency. </p>

<p>6. Ask in writing for an independent evaluation at public expense on
the issue whether reasonable educational outcomes can be achieved under
the current IEP and ask for the suggestions of names of independent evaluators
the school would recommend to perform the service privately. If you are
not familiar with names on the list contact your local Learning Disabilities
Association chapter for information. </p>

<p>7. Work with your local LDA chapter or other parents to make a presentation
to your school board on the lack of continuum of placements/different learning
environments and what the law mandates. </p>

<p>It is hoped that the IEP team will work with you in making sure that
your child is progressing in his educational program and that if a different
setting for his education becomes necessary that the team will make the
recommendation to change the environment where special education services
are carried out. Then steps 4, 5, 6, and 7 (as listed above) will not be
needed. It is important for everyone to remember that full inclusion is
a philosophy, not a mandate supported by law. With that thought in mind
all children in special education programs should be able to receive a
free appropriate public education (FAPE), designed to meet their individual
needs. </p>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Learning Disabilities and Educational Standards</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>October, 1995 </b></p>

<p>A major part of the educational reform is an emphasis on standards.
Efforts to ensure higher levels of competence in students inevitably focus
on higher and more rigorous standards. These increased standards are intended
to strengthen both student competence and teacher skills. </p>

<p>Higher or more rigorous educational standards can effect students with
learning disabilities in significant ways. However, little data or research
yet indicates the effects on changes in standards. Often standards that
offer the greatest promise for educational reform, raise the greatest concern
for individual students with learning disabilities. Thoughtful questions
need to be asked about many areas in which there are proposed changes in
standards. </p>

<ul>
<li><b>High school graduation standards.</b> In many states and districts,
more demanding courses (i.e. algebra, geometry, or foreign languages) are
required for a diploma. Similarly, basic and vocational classes such as
consumer mathematics and slower paced regular classes that are awarded
Carnegie units are being phased out because they are less challenging or
the teachers are needed to teach more advanced classes. 
<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;If a student cannot pass one of these classes, can a course
substitution be written into the IEP and accepted toward the
diploma?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>High school competency testing</b>. Some states use a passing score
on a competency or exit exam as a graduation requirement. While some modifications
are permitted, others may not be allowed. Some newer examination formats
claim to test reading by asking for a paragraph-length written response.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Are appropriate modifications permitted? Are students with
IEP's permitted to take an unmodified test if desired? Does the test format
allow the student with specific disabilities to show the ability being
tested?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Reporting standardized test results.</b> Sometimes students with
disabilities are actively discouraged from participating in testing because
lower group scores may result. In other situations, students with disabilities
are required to participate in testing which may be frustrating and self-defeating
even when accommodations are provided. The National Center on Outcome Education
and Fair Test advocate the collection of data by disability category in
order to establish accountability. 

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Are students discouraged from or pressured to participate
in testing? How are test results reported? Are test scores a meaningful
measure of teaching skill? of learning?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Differentiated or tiered diplomas.</b> Some states award attendance
certificates, standard diplomas, and advanced diplomas that each have different
course and competence requirements. Other states are eliminating all diplomas
except the advanced diploma in order to ensure high standards.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;What impact will an IEP, competency testing, accommodations,
course substitutions, or other factors have on the type of diploma received?
How early must a student decide which diploma to seek? Will employment,
vocational training, or college entrance be affected by the diploma(s)
available? What value will be placed on the diploma that students with
learning disabilities receive?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Admission to apprenticeships and other postsecondary options.</b>
In order to ensure a perceived competence level, some unions, professions,
and postsecondary programs establish criteria or entrance tests without
provision for accommodations or individualized consideration. Entrance
into a trade, for example, may require extensive written responses unlike
that needed for successful work in that trade.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;How can groups be Informed more accurately about the nature
of learning disabilities and the individual differences that characterize
them? Can legal means be used to establish needed and appropriate flexibility?&quot;</b>
</p>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Academic standards developed by professional groups.</b> Organizations
of content specialists and educators have been asked to establish content
and teaching approaches for elementary curricula and high school courses.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;How can groups be informed more accurately about the nature
of learning disabilities and the individual differences that characterize
them? How can parents and professionals knowledgeable about learning disabilities
participate in the development of academic standards?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Formation of charter schools.</b> The establishment of &quot;charter
schools&quot; that use a specific alternative approach to education for
a specified population with exemption from most state laws are being encouraged
by some states.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;To what extent will students with disabilities be included
in or excluded from charter schools? If included, how will the rights of
students with disabilities be protected? If excluded, how will students
with disabilities gain access to the education offered by charter schools?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Student test scores as a measure of educational success.</b> Some
states, districts, and programs use achievement or competency scores to
measure teacher success or compare success among school or school district.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Is a test score useful as a single measure of teaching
or learning success? How can test scores be most effectively used to improve
learning? Are the scores of students with learning disabilities included,
excluded, or presented as a separate category?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Changes in teacher certification.</b> Many states are changing the
process and criteria for certifying or licensing teachers. Those with military
or business backgrounds are provided alternative certification. Liberal
arts and science content is emphasized over teaching methods and knowledge
of the specialized needs of students with disabilities. A private National
Board of Professional Standards is establishing voluntary certification
based on portfolio and other evidence.

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;Are general education teachers developing skills needed
for mainstreaming and inclusion? Are teachers for students with moderate
and severe learning disabilities required to possess real competence in
basic skill instruction, clinical diagnostics, consultation, technology,
collaboration, and transition? How are teachers who come from primarily
liberal arts, science, or alternative certification routes prepared to
work with students who have learning disabilities? How do school system
constraints or flexibilities and other factors effect the success of competent
teachers?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>

<li><b>Dropout rate</b>. A pervasive concern is the effect that more rigorous
standards may have on self-esteem and thus, on the already high dropout
rate. Some students may be frustrated by academic criteria, competency
tests, and other seemingly impossible expectations. The important motivation
of a diploma as a key to postsecondary training and/or employment may also
seem even less attainable. A probable result is increased drop out rates
among students with learning disabilities. 

<blockquote>
<p><b>Ask &quot;What procedures for collecting dropout data will be used?
What special efforts will be made to encourage students with learning disabilities
to stay in school? Will participation in sports, clubs, and other attractive
activities be curtailed If specific academic criteria are not met?&quot;</b>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<p>LDA fully supports the efforts of educational reform to improve the
skills, competence, and attitudes of America's students and workforce to
increase competitiveness within the world market. However, these efforts
must be balanced by the need to nurture the unique abilities and talents
of each individual with learning disabilities. The questions raised here
must be communicated to parents, professionals, taxpayers, legislators,
and educational administrators before education reform is implemented.
The future education of individuals with learning disabilities may be at
stake. </p>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Entrance Tests for Postsecondary Programs</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>January 1994</b> </p>

<p>When individuals approach graduation from high school, decisions about
future education or training become of paramount importance. In order to
enter many academic and vocational programs, tests to assess abilities,
aptitudes, and/or general knowledge are often required. Among the most
frequently administered tests are the SAT and the ACT which are generally
taken in the eleventh and twelfth grades at specified places. Because courses
and grading standards vary widely from school to school, scores on standardized
tests help postsecondary programs compare the academic achievements of
students from different schools. These test scores, along with course grades,
and other information about the student's academic background help college
admission officers evaluate how well prepared an individual is to do college-level
work. Some high tech vocational schools also require this test. Both the
SAT and ACT offer special accommodations for students with learning disabilities.
</p>

<h4>SCHOLASTIC ASSESSMENT TESTS (SAT I)</h4>

<p>In 1994, the SAT changed both its name and its format. The new test
is the SAT I: Reasoning Test. it is offered in March, May and June. It
is fundamentally similar to the earlier version, but features significant
changes that reflect recommendations from educators throughout the United
States. The SAT I is a three hour test, primarily multiple-choice, that
measures verbal and mathematical abilities. The test consists of: </p>

<ul>
<li>two thirty minute sections and one 15 minute section that test vocabulary,
verbal reasoning, and critical reading skills </li>

<li>two thirty minute sections and one 15 minute section that test ability
to solve problems involving arithmetic, algebra, and geometry </li>

<li>a thirty minute section of questions (either verbal or mathematics)
that is used for a statistical process called equating and does not count
toward your score. (You will not know which is the equating section.) </li>
</ul>

<p>There is no longer a test of Standard Written English, Changes to the
verbal sections include the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>More emphasis is placed on reading passages; the proportion of questions
related to these passages increased from less than 30% to more than 50%.
</li>

<li>Reading passages are longer - 400-850 words, as compared with the previous
range of 200-450 words. </li>

<li>One or more of the tests' reading selections consists of a pair of
related reading passages, the second of which opposed, supports, or in
some other way complements the point of view expressed in the first. </li>

<li>Antonym questions have been eliminated. </li>

<li>More total reading time is provided for the verbal sections of the
test, even though there are fewer verbal questions. </li>
</ul>

<p>Changes to the mathematical sections include the following: </p>

<ul>
<li>A new type of question requires students to produce their own responses,
rather than choose from four or five answer choices. Students fill in their
answers on special grids on the answer sheet. </li>

<li>The use of calculators is allowed only on the mathematics sections
of the SAT I: Reasoning Test and it is recommended that students take a
calculator with them to the test. Four function, scientific, or graphing
calculators are acceptable. </li>
</ul>

<p>For information regarding special accommodations, contact a school counselor
or write to: </p>

<dl>
<dd>SAT Services for Students with Disabilities </dd>

<dd>PO Box 6226 </dd>

<dd>Princeton, NJ 08541-6226 </dd>
</dl>

<p>The following accommodations may be requested: </p>

<ul>
<li>large type </li>

<li>audio cassette with written form </li>

<li>a reader </li>

<li>a person to record answers </li>

<li>magnifying glass </li>

<li>extended time </li>
</ul>

<p>A student's counselor or other designated individual must certify that
the student meets the eligibility requirements as set forth by the Admissions
Testing Program (ATP). Documentation of the learning disability may be
requested by ATP. Requests for special accommodations must be submitted
at least six weeks earlier than a regular request. </p>

<h4>AMERICAN COLLEGE TESTING (ACT)</h4>

<p>The ACT is very similar to the SAT with both verbal and mathematical
sections. Requests for special accommodations must be made four to six
weeks prior to test date and a Request For ACT Assessment Special Testing
must be completed and sent with the request. To be eligible, a copy of
the current IEP testing accommodations which states that the student cannot
test under standard conditions must accompany the request form. There must
be a re-diagnosis or reconfirmation of the disability within the last three
years that the learning disability still exists and it must be done by
a qualified professional whose credentials are appropriate to the disability.
An IEP on file at the school within the last three years is generally acceptable
reconfirmation. The LD diagnosis must be more specific than &quot;learning
disabled&quot; (e.g., attention deficit disorder, developmental reading
disorder, developmental arithmetic disorder, or other specific learning
disability). </p>

<p>The following accommodations may be requested: </p>

<ul>
<li>extended time </li>

<li>alternate test form which is consistent with test accommodations regularly
used by the student and required by the student's IEP </li>

<li>audio cassette edition with regular-type copy </li>

<li>four-function calculator </li>

<li>a reader </li>

<li>a person to record answers </li>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic</h3>

<p><b>September, 1996</b> </p>

<p>Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic's services are available to anyone
with a documented print disability which includes learning disabilities.
It serves students at all academic levels, as well as people who use
educational and professional materials to pursue careers or personal
interests. </p>

<p>To become a member of RFB&amp;D, send your application for
service and include $75.00 ($50 registration fee plus $25 annual
membership fee). The application form is available from the Customer
Services Department at (800)221-4792. It can also be downloaded from
RFB&amp;D's web page at <a
href="http://www.rfbd.org/forms/apply.frm">http://www.rfbd.org/forms/apply.frm</a>. 
The application form
includes &quot;disability verification&quot; and &quot;certification&quot;
sections which should be completed by a professional in disability
services, education, medicine, psychology, or a related field. The certifying
professional may be any professional in these fields who is familiar with
print disabilities. To complete a learning disabled student's
application, a special education teacher may use the results of testing
given by the school psychologist.
</p>

<p>RFB&amp;D's recorded books require special equipment - a cassette machine
that will play 15/16 ips (inches per second), 4-track cassettes. This
is NOT the standard speed and format of cassette players sold in retail
stores. It is, however, the same speed and format used to produce the Library
of Congress (LOC) &quot;Talking books.&quot; Therefore, if you receive
services from a cooperating network library for the blind and physically
handicapped, you may already have a compatible cassette machine on loan
from your library. If not, you may purchase one from RFB&amp;D. </p>

<p>RFB&amp;D's catalog is available in three formats: on audiocassette,
on computer disk, and in print. On audiocassette, the Quarterly Recorded
Catalog (QRC) is available by subscription for $16 per-year and lists
500-1000 titles per issue. The Quarterly Disk Catalog (QDC) is also
available by subscription for $16 per year and is produced on IBM
3.5&quot; and 5.25&quot; disks, as well as Macintosh 3.5&quot; disks.

<p>The RFB&D Catalog of Books gives a listing of RFB&D's entire library of
books on audio cassette and computer disk (E-Text).  The new 1996
edition includes the following two collections which may be purchased
separately or as a complete set:
<blockquote>
The Juvenile Collection includes listings of books from
elementary grades through the high school level. Price (if
purchased separately): $29.95 (Plus shipping and handling).

<p>The Adult Collection (a 2 book set) includes listings of books from
the college level and beyond, including texts for professionals. Price (if
purchased separately): $49.95 (Plus shipping and handling).

<p>The Complete Set (3 books) includes both Adult and Juvenile
collections. Price: $69.95 (Plus shipping and handling).

</blockquote>
To subscribe to the QRC or QDC, to purchase the print catalog, or for
additional information on any of these, call Customer Service at (800)
221-4792.</p>

<p>Once membership has been established, requests for recorded books may
be placed by mail to Customer Service, 20 Roszel Road, Princeton, NJ 08540.
For more immediate requests, taped books may be ordered by telephone at
(800)221-4792 and (609)452-0606, or fax, twenty-four hours a day to
(609)987-8116. RFB&amp;D also offers an After-Hours Service which is in
operation from 9 p.m. to 9 a.m. Monday through Friday and continuously on
weekends. </p>

<p>RFB&amp;D's taped books are provided on free loan for one year and,
if needed, the time may be extended by calling Customer Service. When
RFB&amp;D's audiocassette library does not have a book you need, you have
the option of requesting that it be recorded for you. There is no charge
for the recording service; you are simply asked to provide two identical
print copies of the book and the recording will be done as soon as
possible. </p>

<p>Individuals with learning disabilities may wish to qualify for the Library
of Congress &quot;talking books&quot; through their state Library for the
Blind and Physically Handicapped and obtain the cassette players on loan.
Once this is completed, apply for membership ($75.00) to Recording for
the Blind &amp; Dyslexic to receive free taped materials. This is the least
expensive way to receive this service. If application is made directly
to Recording for the Blind &amp; Dyslexic, there is a charge for the cassette
players, ranging from $119 to $219 plus shipping. </p>

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Early Identification of Speech-Language Disorders</h3>

<p>&quot;Why is speech-language treatment needed? My baby doesn't talk
yet.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Everyone in our family was a late talker. My child will talk when
the time is right.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Why worry now? Speech and language services will be available
when school starts.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Treatment? Looks like they are just playing games to us.&quot;
</p>

<p>You may have had similar thoughts or comments. Usually, there is concern
about a child's speech and language skills if there is no speech by the
age of 1 year, if speech is not clear, or if speech or language is different
from that of other children of the same age. </p>

<p>WHAT IS EARLY IDENTIFICATION?
<br>It is estimated that 2% of all children born each year will have a
disabling condition, Many of these children will have speech and/or language
delays and disorders that may have a significant effect on personal, social,
academic, or vocational life. Although some children will develop normal
speech and language skills without treatment by the time they enter school,
it is important to identify those who will not. Many people falsely believe
that speech-language treatment cannot and should not begin until a child
begins to talk. Yet, research has shown that children know a great deal
about their language even before the first word is said. For example, children
can distinguish between their native language and a foreign language, use
different nonverbal utterances to express different needs, and imitate
different patterns of speech through babbling. </p>

<p>Early identification includes the evaluation and treatment provided
to families and their children under three years old who have, or are at
risk for having, a disability or delay in speech, language, or hearing.
A child can quickly fall behind if speech and language learning is delayed. 
Early identification increases the chances for improving communication
skills. </p>

<p>WHO SHOULD BE EVALUATED?
<br>Children identified as at-risk or high-risk, such as those from neonatal
intensive care units, should be tested early and at regular intervals.
Other risk factors include diagnosed medical conditions, such as chronic
ear infections; biological factors, such as fetal alcohol syndrome; genetic
defects, such as Down Syndrome; neurological defects, such as cerebral
palsy; or developmental disorders, such as delayed language. Children with
no obvious high risk factors should be evaluated if their speech and language
is not similar to that of other children of the same age. </p>

<p>HOW IS THE EVALUATION DONE?
<br>Evaluation may be formal or informal and include any combination of
standardized tests; direct observation of play and interaction with caregivers;
reports by parents, teachers, or physicians; and collection and detailed
analysis of spontaneous speech samples. Several sessions as well as ongoing
evaluation may be required to obtain enough information to make an accurate
diagnosis. The early intervention team may consist of the speech-language
pathologist, audiologist, psychologist, neurologist, electrophysiologist,
otolaryngologist, pediatrician, nurse, and social worker. Because speech-language
delays and disorders may be due to a variety of causes, each professional
makes valuable contributions to the evaluation. </p>

<p>WHAT IS SPEECH LANGUAGE TREATMENT?
<br>From the results of the evaluation, certain services may be recommended.
Prevention includes those children who have been identified as at-risk
for a communication delay or disorder because of low birthweight. Services
may be provided before a specific diagnosis has been made. Remediation
increases function in identified areas and may serve to prevent other related
problems. For example, remediation of a language disorder can help offset
learning disabilities. </p>

<p>Language is taught in a natural setting. It is presented at the child's
developmental level. Responses are consistently stimulated. Output is rewarded.
Play may be used to teach communication, language models or rules of conversation,
such as taking turns. </p>

<p>If you are concerned about a possible speech-language delay or disability,
consult a speech-language pathologist. A list of certified speech-language
pathologists in your area may be obtained by calling the American Speech-Language-Hearing
Association's toll-free HELPLINE at 1-800-638-8255. </p>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Spoken Language Problems</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>May, 1995</b> </p>

<p>The development of spoken/oral language normally occurs without formal
teaching. It develops as a result of exposure to spoken language. Problems
with language development may not be recognized for a long time unless
the child simply fails to begin talking. Oral language is the basis for
learning reading and written language and for benefitting from instruction
in other areas. It is important to identify children whose language is
not developing normally so that more specific stimulation and actual intervention
can begin as early as possible. </p>

<p>Language problems, like other learning disabilities, are called by several
different names including: delayed language, language disorder, language
disability, specific language disability, etc. Some people distinguish
between children who appear to be developing all aspects of language at
a slower rate (delayed language) and those who do not appear to be developing
language in the expected way or have uneven language development (language
disability). Regardless of the label, language problems should be assessed.
A language evaluation must include a hearing test since hearing loss is
one reason for delayed language acquisition. Speech-Language Pathologists
typically do the testing for spoken language disabilities. When children
are of school age, the evaluation must include the language of instruction
and reading and written language. </p>

<p>Like other types of learning disabilities, language disabilities differ
in type and severity. In young children there are many known milestones
that can be observed by parents and preschool teachers. Some of these are
listed on the table below along with some activities to encourage language
development. </p>

<p>Even mild problems in spoken language can have an impact on learning
in school. A child should enter first grade with the majority of the language
needed for learning. Problems in understanding language will affect almost
every aspect of school: following directions, learning vocabulary, understanding
instruction, reading comprehension, etc. Problems in using language are
often seen in children who do not understand. Some children understand
spoken language but have difficulty expressing themselves. A common problem
seen in expressive language is difficulty recalling words they know (word
retrieval problems). These children understand the word, know it when they
hear it, but cannot always call it up when they need it. These children
may say, &quot;You know that thing you sweep the floor with&quot;; &quot;I
know it, but I can't think of the word&quot;; &quot;Umm, umm, I forget&quot;;
etc. Retrieval problems can make children unwilling to participate in class
because they interfere with a child's demonstration of what he/she has
learned. For example, children may have learned color or letter names,
but are unable to give the names when asked. These children can point to
the color or letter when the name is said to them. </p>

<p>Some children have difficulty with spoken grammar. They omit words or
word endings or get words in the wrong order. Some have difficulty putting
their ideas into words in an organized way. </p>

<p>Problems in pronunciation of words can be the result of mishearing sounds
(Starvation Army/Salvation Army), getting sounds in the wrong order (aminal/animal),
or difficulty producing specific sounds (fum/thumb). Problems with the
sound system of language have been reported in many children who have difficulty
learning to read. While some speech sounds are acquired later than others,
children who have many sounds they cannot make and are difficult to understand
may have later problems with phonics. </p>

<p>Language activities with young children are fun for them and can stimulate
more language. Reading to children and talking about the pictures and the
&quot;story&quot; is an important activity. Making certain new vocabulary
is used in many ways and in different situations helps children learn new
words. </p>

<p>It is important to have children's language evaluated if there is any
concern. Too often, parents are told &quot;He'll outgrow it&quot; or &quot;Just
wait, she'll talk when she's ready&quot;. This is not good advice when
the child is not doing what is expected for his/her age. Speech-Language
Pathologists can determine what the problem is, if any, and make recommendations
for working with the child. Oral language is important for social development
and effective communication, as well as being the foundation for school
learning. Problems should not be overlooked or disregarded.

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>SUMMER ACTIVITIES FOR STUDENTS</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee
<br>April 1995</b> </p>

<p>How to keep children &quot;busy&quot; and happy during the summer is
a dilemma that has faced parents since the demise of the neighborhood sandlot
and the ole swimmin' hole. &quot;What are the children going to do this
summer&quot; is a question that parents now ask long before summer arrives.
</p>

<p>The purpose of this Fact Sheet is to help parents find a program that
is suitable for their child. Traditional and nontraditional summer programs
are listed to allow a child opportunities for exploration of interests
and maybe the development of a hobby during summer vacation. </p>

<p>Some of the programs listed require collaboration between school districts
and other government agencies such as city or county parks and recreation
departments. The collaboration may be detailed in a formal Inter-Governmental
Agreement (IGA). A school district may provide a building or multi-purpose
room for a summer program, pay the utilities and provide custodial services.
The other agency, either city or county, may provide the trained staff
and special equipment. </p>

<p>If your school district does not have a summer program, you might be
able to start one for next summer by sending a formal request or a petition
to your district school board or committee. </p>

<p><b>Extended School Year (ESY)</b> provides a continuation of special
education and/or related services beyond a regular school year if the need
is documented in a student's IEP (Individualized Educational Program).
Key factors in determining eligibility for ESY are <i>regression</i> and
<i>recoupment</i>. <i>Regression</i> is a return to a lower level of functioning
in those skills or behaviors on the student's IEP. <i>Recoupment</i> is
the amount of time a student needs to regain the knowledge lost over a
period of time. </p>

<p>Review your child's IEP for the last few years to determine if reasonable
educational progress has been made in the goals and objectives following
interruptions in service due to illness, vacations, etc. If you think your
child may be eligible for ESY, ask for a review of placement and request
ESY services. </p>

<p>Some school districts provide ESY services a few weeks following the
end of the current school year. Others provide ESY services prior to the
beginning of the next school year. </p>

<p><b>Summer school</b> remedial or enrichment classes are offered by many
school districts or community schools. Some of these classes may be appropriate
for students with learning disabilities. Tuition or registration fees are
usually charged. School-parent groups or educational enrichment foundations
frequently allocate money to assist families in paying summer school fees.
Some SEAs (State Education Agencies) require students below a certain achievement
level to attend summer school. </p>

<p><b>Private schools or learning centers</b> offering specialized instruction
to students with learning disabilities, learning differences or language
development deficits are available in many cities. These facilities charge
fees for services, sometimes on a sliding scale. </p>

<p>Check listings in the yellow pages of your phone book under headings
such as <i>Schools-Academic-Secondary and Elementary</i> or <i>Schools-Academic-Special
Education</i>. Your local or state LDA affiliate, <i>The Directory of Facilities
and Services for the Learning Disabled</i> (Academic Therapy) or <i>The
Complete Learning Disabilities Directory</i> (Grey House) may be of help
in locating a school or center. </p>

<p><b>Universities or colleges</b> sometimes have specialized summer classes
for high school students with learning disabilities. The classes usually
allow for the earning of college credits while becoming familiar with the
college environment and participating in specially structured programs.
Check with the disabled student resource center at your local college or
university. <i>Summer PreCollege Programs for Students with Learning Disabilities</i>
may be obtained from HEATH Resource Center, One Dupont Circle, Ste. 800,
Washington, D.C. 20036-1193, (202) 939-9320 or (800) 544-3284. </p>

<p>Various departments or colleges within a university system may offer
specialty camps in astronomy, chemistry, computers, math or science. </p>

<p>Many colleges and universities offer residential and day sport camps
(tennis, basketball, baseball, football and soccer) with college sport
stars in attendance. One major university is offering a month-long Sports-0-Rama
through their School of Health Related Professions, Department of Exercise
and Sport Sciences. Contact the sports information office at your local
college or university for more information on offerings in your area. </p>

<p><b>Libraries</b> have traditionally offered summer reading programs.
If your child has a reading or comprehension disability, ask if he/she
can participate in the program through taped children's books or if you
can read the books to the child. </p>

<p>The need for expanded services and community outreach has increased
the scope of programs offered at many libraries: orientation classes for
using the library; story hours for children and for families; programs
in music, art, history and travel; and specialty classes. </p>

<p>One major library system is offering a junior high/middle school survival
course for students and their parents, in separate sessions. The classes
deal with organizational skills, coping with class schedules, peer pressures
and development/maturity issues. </p>

<p><b>Recreational programs</b> offered by school districts in conjunction
with city or county parks and recreation departments are available in many
parts of the country. Games, team and individual sports, table games, arts
and crafts, dancing, environmental studies and special events make up the
usual programs. </p>

<p><b>Specialized day-camps</b> offered by therapeutic recreation units
of parks and recreation departments provide recreation programs for students
with disabilities. Day camps for children and pre-teens, teen social groups,
weekend outings, dances, special events, hiking and swimming classes are
routinely offered. </p>

<p>The day camps are sometimes co-sponsored by school districts through
an IGA. Frequently the day-camps are offered at no cost to the parents
since municipal or county tax dollars fund the programs. </p>

<p>Many day-care centers offer day-camp experiences for children up to
about age 10. Athletic and fitness clubs also offer recreation programs
for students, many times with reduced rates for multiple children in a
family. </p>

<p><b>Museums and zoos</b> may have summer programs within their specialty
areas. Some art museums offer classes in cartooning, ceramics, drawing,
painting, photography and sculpture. Some historical museums help children
develop an understanding of the history of their immediate area or state
through hands-on lessons. </p>

<p><b><i>A Directory of Summer Camps for Children with Learning Disabilities</i></b>
can be obtained from the Learning Disabilities Association of America for
$5.25. Your local or state LDA affiliate may also be able to provide information
on residential summer camps. </p>

<p>If you consider a residential camp, it's wise to include the child in
the decision. You may want to ask the camp for a local reference so that
your child can talk with another camper and you can discuss your concerns
with the parent. Factors you may want to consider are: the training of
the staff in working with children with learning disabilities, the structure
of the program, the opportunity for a child to maintain skills in reading,
the dispensing of medication, accessibility of medical treatment, how discipline
is handled and staff to camper ratio. </p>

<p><b>Cooperative &quot;intern&quot; arrangements</b> with friends or understanding
neighbors are especially good in more remote areas. Each parent agrees
to take the other's child for a particular period of time to teach a skill:
cooking, pet grooming, child-care, computers, wood working, horsemanship,
etc. A child might be able to develop several different skills during the
summer and have fun too! </p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous opportunities</b> for recreation and training are available
through organized sports programs (Little League); Boys and Girls Clubs;
Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts; Campfire; the Salvation Army; YMCAs and YWCAs;
hospital volunteer activities (Candy Stripers); computer camps; specialized
skills camps such as boating, swimming, archery, tennis, and horseback
riding; trail building and maintenance with the U.S. Forest Service; the
exploration of interests and hobbies; and, volunteer activities working
with younger children or seniors. </p>

<p>Have fun and have a great summer! </p>

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>FACT SHEET</h2>

<h3 align=center>Transition Services</h3>

<p><b>Educational Services Committee 
<br>December 1993</b> </p>

<p>&quot;Transition Services&quot; means a coordinated set of activities
for a student, designed within an outcome-oriented process, that promotes
movement from school to post-school activities, including postsecondary
education, vocational training, integrated employment (including supported
employment), continuing and adult education, adult services, independent
living, or community participation. </p>

<p>The reauthorization of Public Law 94-142, now referred to as the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, PL 101-476), in 1990, left no questions
as to the necessity for including transition services in the educational
program for all students with disabilities. In Section 602(a)(20) of IDEA,
the need for stating specific strategies to effect successful transition
is mandated (paragraph D). Transition planning must be included in the
Individualized Education Program (IEP) beginning at age sixteen and continuing
until the student leaves school, possibly as late as age twenty-one. The
transition goals are to be specified in an Individualized Transition Plan
(ITP) as part of the IEP process. The ITP itself may be outlined in a separate
document that is considered to be part of the IEP, or the ITP goals can
be specified in the main IEP document. </p>

<p>In high schools, transition services have traditionally been available
only to the most promising students. High school guidance counselors spend
approximately thirty per cent of their time working with the students who
are college-bound. Legislation now demands that students with disabilities
(including students with learning disabilities) who may or may not be college-bound
have the same level of services available to them. Providing transition
services within the school may require that not only the guidance counselor
and the special educator be part of the IEP team. Regular education personnel,
vocational educators, speech and language professionals and other specialists
may need to provide information or participate in writing the IEP to make
the planning process as comprehensive as possible. </p>

<p>Beyond simply meeting the mandates of the law, transition planning requires
a change in how school personnel view students with disabilities and how
they prepare those students for adulthood. Simply moving students forward
within the school system does not provide the type of guidance and preparation
necessary for transition to adult roles in the community. Clear and specific
goals must be identified early. The law stipulates that should there be
a need, transition planning can begin as early as age fourteen. Many transition
specialists, however, maintain that even age fourteen is very late and
that planning should begin as soon as the disability is identified. </p>

<p>The student and the parents must be involved in the ITP process. A wide
range of options should be considered based on the student's interests,
skills, and abilities, not just the student's disabilities. Also, the need
for services beyond what the school provides must be considered and appropriate
representatives from the community should be part of the ITP process. Appropriate
members of the community may include persons from Vocational Rehabilitation,
potential employers, service agency representatives, and personnel from
institutions of higher education. </p>

<p>Even though outside agencies may participate in the process, it is still
the local education agency (i.e. the school system) that has ultimate responsibility
for implementing the plan. Should outside agencies not provide the support
required, the school system then is required to reconvene the IEP team
to identify alternative strategies to meet the objectives outlined in the
IEP (34 C.F.R. Section 300.347). </p>

<p>Transition planning, used effectively, can increase the number and type
of options open to students with learning disabilities. By accurately assessing
students' interests, skills, and abilities early, students, parents, educators
and other professionals can work together to make sure that all school
experiences help move students toward successful adulthood. </p>

<p>Note: Final regulations for IDEA can be found in the September 29, 1992
Federal Register (Vol. 57, No. 189 pp. 44794-44852). </p>

<h1 align=center>IDEA Reauthorization Officially Dies</h1>

<blockquote>
Public Affairs Committee<br>
October 1, 1996

<h2 align=center>IDEA Reauthorization is Dead</h2>
On Sept. 30, 1996, Senator Bill Frist announced that the Reauthorization
of IDEA will not be introduced on the Senate floor before the 104th
Congress adjourns. Despite the many good provisions in the bill and the
uncertainty about what the 105th Congress might do with the
Reauthorization of IDEA, on Sept. 25, LDA, along with other disability
organizations (ASHA, CED, NASP, NESS, NPND, The Arc, and UPCA) and regular
education groups (the American Association of School Administrators and
the Council of Great City Schools) had asked Senator Frist to postpone
passage of IDEA until the next Congress. They were concerned because of
the lack of time to study the effect of a last minute Manager's Package of
Amendments to IDEA on students with disabilities.

<p>The CCD (Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities, a
coalition of over 65 disability organizations which work together on
legislation of common interest) Education Task Force sent a letter to the
Hill listing specific concerns:
<ol>
<li>cessation of educational services for certain students with
disabilities
<li>weakening of other civil rights issues, such as the requirement that
parents identify the remedy as well as the reason for the request for a
due process hearing, the stay put provisions under discipline, and the
provisions for changing the placement of children with "disruptive
behavior"
<li>failure to assure the presence of related services personnel, as
appropriate, at IEP meetings, and elimination of assistive techonology
considerations under special factors under the IEP
<li>uncertainty about discretionary programs
</ol>
<h2 align=center>What Does This Mean?</h2>
Failure to pass a Reauthorization bill does not affect Part B, which
contains all the assurances, protections, and safeguards for the education
of children with disabilities.  Part B remains the same and none of the
proposed changes - good and bad - are required. Authorization for the
discretionary programs (teacher and parent training, research and
development, early intervention, clearinghouses) has expired, but these
programs are all funded in the 1997 Appropriations bill.

<h2 align=center>What Happens Now?</h3>
Now is the time to prepare for the Reauthorization of IDEA in the 105th
Congress. Constituents should write or call their Congressmen (and
Congressional candidates) to express support for the promise of IDEA and
to offer to help explain any areas of uncertainty. Hopefully, the new
Congress will pass an IDEA which incorporates all of the good features and
eliminates the bad features of the proposals in the 104th Congress.
<p>Thank you all who responded to the many requests to provide input to
Congress in the last two years. Hope you will be joined by many more as we
work for a better IDEA in the 105th Congress

<P>Jan 2, 1997<BR>
PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE </P>

<P>Representative Frank Riggs, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Youth and Families, has announced that a bill reauthorizing
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will be introduced
when the 105th Congress is sworn in on January 7. Cessation of educational
services will not be mentioned, but proposals to allow cessation will no
doubt be introduced. Hearings - one on discipline and one on funding -
will be held on February 4 and 6, and the full Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee is expected to mark up the final bill in the second
week in March. Senate Labor and Human Services Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords
also expects to act swiftly on the reauthorization. The Subcommittee on
Disability Policy has been eliminated, so, as in the House, there will
be no opportunity for input before the full committees act on the bill.
</P>

<P>Time is short and the need to help Congressmen understand the importance
of IDEA for students with learning disabilities is great. Almost a third
of the 45 members of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee
are new, as are many of the members of the Senate Labor and Human Services
Committee. However, because of the short time frame, it is vital that ALL
members of Congress hear from their constituents. IDEA is only the first
of the bills affecting individuals with LD which will be reauthorized by
the 105th Congress. Input will be needed as well when bills reauthorizing
the Rehabilitation Act, the Higher Education Act, the Juvenile Justice
Act, and the Vocational Education Act are introduced. </P>

<P>A list of the addresses, phone and fax numbers of members of relevant
committees is attached. Please keep this list for future reference. Remember,
personal contacts are the most effective way of reaching Congressmen. Other
ways of making an impact, in descending order, are personal letters or
postcards, form letters, or phone calls. Letters or faxes have more impact
than e-mail. However, anything is better than nothing. </P>

<P>Please add your personal input to the following sample letter. <A HREF="idea96/IDEA.html">LDA's
position on last year's IDEA bills</A> was sent to all state and local
presidents and to the network. It is posted on the LDA Home Page on the
Internet and was reprinted in the Washington Update section of the Nov./Dec.
1996 Issue of Newsbriefs. Please add your own experiences, - particularly
about the difficulty of determining eligibility for students with learning
disabilities who are performing at grade level only because of their efforts
and the support of their families Stories about the success of students
who benefited from IDEA are also needed.<BR>

<P>Dear Senator (last name) Dear Congressman (woman)(last name)<BR>
I am (an individual with LD, a parent of a child with LD, a professional
working in the field of LD). I am asking you to support the continued federal
commitment to the education of ALL children with disabilities as promised
by IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Despite its flaws,
children with disabilities have greatly benefited from that law. Society
has also benefited as more IDEA graduates have gone on to higher education
and competitive employment. (EXAMPLES HERE) </P>

<P>One of the first acts of the 105th Congress is expected to be the reauthorization
of IDEA. I hope that this reauthorization will make very few changes to
Part B of IDEA Many of the positive changes proposed in the Reauthorization
bills which died at the end of the 105th Congress could be brought about
by regulatory changes. I am afraid that other changes, particularly those
which would deny educational services to certain students with disabilities
or would curtail their rights, would severely limit their opportunity to
obtain an appropriate education. (Attached is LDA's position on the IDEA
bills introduced in the 104th Congress.). </P>

<P>I will let you know of specific concerns when the bills are introduced.
In the meantime, I would be happy to discuss IDEA with you at any time.
My telephone number is </P>

<p><b>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES COMMITTEE</b><br>
July, 1996


<h3>More Children Being Home Schooled</h3>

<p><CITE>Education Week</CITE>  (June 12, 1996) reported that Home
Schooling is becoming more mainstream" -- increasing, "not just in their
numbers, but in the diversity of philosophies, politics, and approaches
represented in their burgeoning ranks." Home schooling is beginning to be
viewed as a "viable educational option" (1 to 2 percent of the K-12
population). Home schooling is legal in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. Thirty-four states regulate home-schooling. Forty states do not
require any parent qualifications for teaching. Few states ask why
parents are home-schooling their children, but reasons given range from
"school violence to poor academic quality to overzealous peer pressure."
Observers have seen "growing numbers of habitual truants, gifted
children, children with disabilities, and in general, older children and
teens being educated at home." 

<hr width="50%">

<h3>Student Standards for Speaking, Listening</h3>
<p><cite> Education Week </cite> (June 12, 1996)

<p>The Speech Communication Association released national voluntary
standards for speaking, listening, and media literacy that are meant to
apply across the curriculum. These standards are different from the
International Reading Association and National Council of Teachers of
English English-Language Arts standards because they focus on spoken
language. Free copies of these standards are available from Speech
Communication Associates, 5105 Blacklick Road, Building E, Annandale, VA
22003. 

<hr width="50%">

<h3>Teacher Licensing Project Begun by NCATE</h3>
<p><cite>Education Week </CITE>(April 17, 1996)

<p>The National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education and 7
selected states (Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, North
Carolina, Washington) are working to reform teacher preparation and
licensing. Their goal is to establish state standards for teacher
preparation and licensing that is focused on teacher performance rather
than specified coursework. These standards would be "aligned with NCATE's
standards for teacher education school."

<hr width="50%">

<h3>Educators Skeptical About New Tests</h3>
<p><CITE> Education Week</CITE>  (April 17, 1996)

<p>Teachers in Maryland and Kentucky (states that re-vamped the way they
measure student performance) question whether the new measures really
"gauge what students have learned." These states replaced standardized
achievement test with performance-based testing programs. The new tests
consist of "problem solving, participation in group activities, answering
open-ended questions, and writing." While many teachers said the new
assessments improved instruction, most teachers in both states also said
they thought some schools had found ways to "improve scores without
improving the quality of teaching." Most said the scores improved
"because the teachers and students were more familiar with the test,
students did practice tests, and the test-taking skills had improved." If
the teachers concerns are right, the gains reported "probably don't
represent generalizable gains in student learning." In both states 70
percent or more of the teachers said they had put more emphasis on
subjects and topics that were tested, reducing emphasis on those that
were not. Contrary to the "commitment to the belief that all children can
learn at high levels, the survey clearly suggests that many teachers
still believe some students can learn more than others." In Maryland,
"only 18 percent of teachers said they had increased expectations for
special-education students." Thirty-six percent said they "expected more
of their high-achieving students. The real test was said to be "whether
there will continue to be gains." 

<hr width="50%">

<h3>Teacher Attrition a Concern</h3>
<p><CITE> Education Week </CITE> (June 19, 1996)

 <p>A survey of new teachers in North Carolina "brought bad news and worse
news. The bad news was the large number of rookie teachers who leave the
profession within five years. Even worse, the ones who are quitting are
the brightest of the new teachers." 

<p>A review of the records of 81,000 teachers hired in 1979-80 found that
by the end of the fifth year after being hired, one-third had left teaching.
"And the survey showed that after five years of teaching, 44 percent of
teachers who came from colleges considered to be in the top one-fourth in
the state had left, compared with only 26 percent of teachers coming from
the bottom one-fourth of colleges." This high attrition rate for teachers
is not only in North Carolina. According to the National Commission 
on Teaching, 30 to 50 percent of beginning teachers leave the profession
in their first five years. Other studies have shown that new teachers
"tend to feel overwhelmed by classroom responsibilities and often do not
receive proper support." 
 
<hr width="50%">

<h3>Private Management of Public Schools Has Yet to Show Improved Scores</h3>
<p><CITE> Education Week  </CITE> (May 29, 1996) 

<p>The U.S. General Accounting Office recently released a report
indicating that "private management of public schools has often led to
cleaner buildings, greater access to computers, and more individualized
instruction. But it has yet to show academic improvement anywhere..." The
private management groups examined were: Public Strategies Group Inc. in
Minneapolis and Education Alternatives Inc. in Baltimore; Dade County,
Fla.; and Hartford, Conn. (Scores in Hartford were not evaluated.)  EAI's
contracts were either not renewed or ended ahead of schedule. PSI in
Minneapolis received only 66 percent of the total it could have received
because, among other reasons, student test scores did not improve.

<h2>Obligations of States and School Districts to Students with Disabilities and 
Their Parents in Interstate Transfer Situations</h2>

<p>Margaret Carr<br> 
Advocacy Committee 

<p>Thomas Hehir, Director, Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP),
December 6, 1995, in response to a number of requests for clarification,
addressed the responsibilities of states and school districts to students
with learning disabilities when they transfer from one state to another.
Under Part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) a
school district must make available a free appropriate public education (FAPE) 
to all resident children with specified disabilities in the mandated
age-ranges and must ensure both the children and their parents have the
rights and protections guaranteed by Part B of IDEA (20 USC  §1412(2)
(5). FAPE comprises an appropriate education program designed for each
individual student according to both Part B and education standards of
the state of residence. Each state, under 34 CFR  §300.600, must supervise 
and ensure programs in the state providing education services to students
with disabilities meet both federal and state standards.

<p>When a student moves from one state to another, the receiving school
district must first determine whether it will adopt the student's most
recent evaluation and individual education plan (IEP). Since the
evaluation and IEP from the sending state were based partially on the
education standards and eligibility criteria of the sending state, the 
student's evaluation and IEP may not be consistent with the education
standards of the receiving state. If the receiving district determines
that the previous evaluation complies with both state law and Part B of
IDEA, it may adopt the evaluation and provide parental notice in
accordance with 34 CFR  §300.504(a).

<p>The receiving district must also examine the student's IEP to
determine compliance with state law and Part B of IDEA. If the receiving
district determines that the IEP is appropriate and can be implemented,
no IEP meeting need be held if the parent is satisfied with the current
IEP (Appendix C to 34 CFR Part 300 (question 6)). If, however, either 
the parent of school district is dissatisfied with the existing IEP, and
IEP meeting must be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after
the receiving school districts accepts the eligibility determination and
evaluation of the previous school district.

<p>If the receiving school district does not accept the previous
evaluation, the district must evaluate the student without <i>due
delay</i> and provide proper parental notice under 34 CFR §300.128,
§300.220 and §300.504(a). The new evaluation must be treated as a
preplacement evaluation under 34 CFR §300.531. The receiving district
must obtain parental consent (34 CFR §300.504(b)(1)(i)). Special
education services may be provided to the student during the evaluation
process if parents and the district can agree on an interim IEP. If there
is disagreement, however, the student will be placed in regular 
education. Once the receiving district completes its assessment, an IEP
meeting must be held no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the
date of eligibility determination (34 CFR §300.343(c)). At the meeting an
appropriate IEP should be developed and adopted to address the unique
education needs of the student.

<p>If the parents disagree with the new evaluation or proposed IEP, they
may initiate an impartial due process hearing under 34 CFR §300.506.
Pending the hearing the student may be placed in the program proposed by
the receiving district, with the parents' consent, or in another
placement on with both the parents and district agree. If agreement on an  
interim placement is not reached, the receiving district is not required
to implement the interim IEP or to approximate services provided under
the previous IEP. In such a situation the receiving district will place
the student in the regular education program in accordance with 34 CFR
§300.513(b).

to all students who qualify for special education under the Act. FAPE 
includes "special education and related services" that are provided at 
public expense and at no charge in conformity with the student's 
individualized education plan (IEP) 20 USC §1401(a)(18). The U.S. 
Supreme Court in <b>Irving ISD v. Tatro</b> clarified that related 
services include everything needed by the student with disabilities to 
"reach, enter, exit or remain in school during the day."

<p>The need for related services should be addressed during the meeting 
at which the IEP is developed for a student with disabilities. The IEP 
must contain every related service the school district is to provide. It 
should also include the frequency and duration of the service as well as 
the title of the individual providing the service.

<p>Related services, provided under 20 USC §1401(17) include, but are 
not limited to:
<ul>
<li>transportation
<li>speech pathology and audiology
<li>psychological services
<li>physical and occupational therapy
<li>recreation, including therapeutic recreation
<li>early identification and assessment of disabilities in children 
<li>counseling services, including rehabilitation counseling
<li>medical services for diagnostic or evaluation purposes
<li>school health services
<li>social work services
<li>parent counseling and training
</ul>

<p>Related services may include developmental, corrective or supportive 
services which are necessary to assist a child with a disability benefit 
from special education (34 CFR §300.16 (Comment)). Assistive technology 
devices/services may also qualify as related services (<CITE>Letter to 
Goodman</CITE>, 16 IDELR 1317 (OSEP 1990)).

<h2>Court Decisions, OCR Ruling, OSEP Letter of Clarification</h2>

<h3>Determination of eligibility for services for a student with speech 
impairment not limited to use of academic criteria</h3>

<p>A court held that a student with a speech impairment was improperly 
denied eligibility. The court ruled the 7-year old student whose voice 
was often strained and fluctuated in pitch was eligible for special 
education services because the condition affected his ability and desire 
to communicate with others although he was performing academically at 
the level of his peers.

<p>The parents challenged the school district's refusal to declare the 
student eligible. Although the district admitted the child did not have 
a normal voice, it disputed that his condition adversely impacted his 
education because the  child was making passing grades.

<p>The court cited two reasons for its decision: (a) an advisory note to 
the federal regulations which states that in evaluating communicative 
speech disorders, the examiner must "focus on an objective level of 
speech ability and the observation of speech behavior" and (b) OSEP 
policy letters which have stated that eligibility for a speech/language 
impairment could not be "conditioned" on the existence of deficient 
academic performance. The court noted that federal regulations do not 
allow the use of a single procedure as an eligibility criterion but 
required an investigation of data from a number of sources. The court 
stated that educational performance is not determined solely on the 
basis of academic criteria but indulged the development of 
communication, social skills and personality.

<h3>Failure to implement student's IEP resulted in denial of FAPE</h3>

<p>The Office of Civil Rights (OCR) ruled that in the case  of Ocean 
View (CA) Elementary School District, 23 IDELR 903 (OCR 1995), the 
failure of the district to implement the individualized education program 
(IEP) of a student with disabilities denied the student a free 
appropriate public education (FAPE). OCR determined the district 
violated the student's rights under both Section 504 of the 
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and Title II of the Americans with 
Disabilities Act (ADA) when it failed to implement the IEP consistently.

<p>In their investigation OCR found confusion among the student's 
teacher, the instructional aide and other school district personnel 
regarding the implementation of certain provisions of the IEP. 
Inconsistency in implementation of an IEP is difficult to prove, but it 
was apparent in this instance that the school personnel who were to 
implement the IEP did not have the same understanding of how the student 
should be served.

<h3>District did not discriminate against student with disability by 
giving failing grade in physical education</h3>

<p>The parent of a student with dyslexia complained to OCR that her 
daughter was discriminated against because she received a failing grade 
in physical education. OCR found that it was the student's refusal to 
participate in physical education which resulted in her failing grade. 
Although the student had received an "F" on a written test in physical 
education, the examination grade had not been averaged into her physical 
education grade because of her dyslexia. The teacher had provided 
assistance to the student in opening the combination lock to her locker, 
but the student repeatedly failed to dress for class despite notice that 
doing so would result in failure.

<h3>Student with Learning Disabilities Ineligible for SSI Benefits</h3>
<p>A federal district court held that a student with learning
disabilities was properly denied eligibility for Supplemental Security
Income (SSI) benefits. The parent of the 14-year old student had
challenged an administrative law judge's denial of SSI. Diagnosed in 
first grade as having a learning disability, the student had attended
regular and special education classes. The court stated evidence
presented failed to substantiate "medically determinable physical or
mental impairment of comparable severity" and indicated the student had
'moderate' cognitive and communicative impairments. The court further found 
testimony regarding vocational abilities was not required in such cases.

Services</b>, 24 IDELR 266 (S.D.N.Y 1996).

<h3>Inclusion Inappropriate for Student with Learning Disabilities</h3>

A Missouri district court judge ruled that regular class placement was
unsuitable for a student with a learning disability because the student's
"self-esteem and behavior were aggravated by his associations with
students from whom he felt 'different' and that consequently, his
academic progress was hindered." The judge found that because the 
district failed to offer the student an appropriate education during his
third and fourth grade years, his parents were entitled to reimbursement
for tuition paid a private school where the child benefited academically
and emotionally. The student had repeated first grade. When he completed
his third-grade year, his reading was below grade level, and he 
was unable to write a complete sentence. His grades were declining.

<p>The court noted the school district had failed to change its teaching
methods and merely increased the amount of time the child spent in
resource. The district had previously decreased the amount of time the
student attended resource in an attempt to improve his self-esteem. The
court further found the district failed to develop the student's fourth
grade IEP until October when it proposed he attend resource and self-contained 
class rather than a segregated environment. By that time the parents had
already signed a contract for that year with the private school.

<h3>Additional Services Ordered for Student with Dyslexia</h3>
<p>The Rhinebeck Central School District of New York proposed placing a
student with dyslexia in regular classes except for one 40-minute
resource class. The district justified its proposal by stating that the
child has above-average intelligence and belongs in regular education
classes. They offered a 40-minute resource class for reading and writing
and 20 minutes daily consultation between the student's special and regular 
education teachers.

<p>The parents of the student appealed the ruling of a hearing officer
who upheld the district's proposed program. The parents charged that the
proposed IEP conveyed no educational benefits to their child. Specialists
testified that tutoring proposed by the district failed to address the
child's special education needs, that the child would benefit emotionally
from knowing other children with dyslexia and that he would struggle 
in the regular classroom.

<p>The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered
the district to develop and Individual Education Program (IEP) than
ensures the child will attend class with students having similar learning
disabilities. The Judge noted in his ruling that the district had failed
to:
<ol>
<li>convene an impartial hearing within 45 days of the mother's request,
<li>have an appropriate IEP ready for the beginning of the school year, 
<li>include a statement in the IEP of the child's present level of
functioning and strategies to evaluate progress,
<li>consult his classroom teacher, 
<li>observe the child in the classroom, and 
<li>prepare a written report stating the basis for determination of 
eligibility as learning disabled.

<h3>Physician's Diagnosis of ADD/ADHD Insufficient to Establish
Eligibility for IDEA</h3>
<p>In response to a letter of inquiry from LaNelle Gallagher on behalf of
the Learning Disabilities Association of  Texas, Thomas Hehir, Director,
Office of Special Education Programs, wrote that "a physician's statement
that a child has ADD/ADHD would be insufficient by itself to establish
eligibility under Part B" (of IDEA). Dr. Hehir reiterated that in order
to be eligible for services under IDEA, Part B, a child must be evaluated
as having one or more specified physical or mental impairments (34 CFR 
§§300.530-300.534) and found to require special education and related
services as a result  (34 CFR §300.7(1)(1)). The determination that the
child has a physical or mental impairment alone does not qualify the
student for eligibility under Part B without the conclusion that as a
result of having the impairment, the child needs special education 
and related services. The decision of eligibility is the responsibility
of the multidisciplinary team (§300.532(a)) which evaluates the child in
accordance with §§300.530-300.534. "Although public agencies have the
discretion to require a medical diagnosis of ADD/ADHD as part of the
child's evaluation under the OHI (other health impaired) category, the
multidisciplinary team must determine whether the child needs special
education and related services due to the existence of any such impairment."

<h1><image src="../images/ldalogo.gif" alt="LDA of America" height=62
width=91 align=center hspace=10>Congressional Update</h1>
<p><b>Public Affairs Committee<br>
July 1996</b>

<p>Congress probably will not be in session for the month of August and will 
adjourn the beginning of October. Because so few days are left for legislative 
action, leaders in both the House and the Senate are reluctant to move any 
controversial or time-consuming bills to the floor. Among the bills in this 
category are IDEA, the Job Training (Careers) Bill, the Kennedy  Kassenbaum 
Health Care Bill, and Welfare Reform. Any bills not passed by the end of the 
session must be reintroduced in the 105th Congress to be sworn in on January 
20, 1997.

<p><b>Will there be a new IDEA? Would it be good or bad? No one knows</b><br>
The House version of IDEA was passed by voice vote of the full House on June 
10. The Senate Labor and Human Services Committee passed their version of IDEA 
in March and asked that it be sent to the floor under unanimous consent rule. 
(Unanimous consent means no debate and no amendments.) However, Senator Gorton 
(R WA) (who has announced his intention of offering amendments 1) to severely 
limit attorneys fees and 2) to deny punitive damages under IDEA; and Senator 
Ashcroft (R MO) (who has announced his intention of offering amendments 1) to 
require administrators to document violent acts on a student's IEP which would 
be passed on to any new school attended by that student and 2) to allow schools
to deny educational services to violent students) have placed holds on the 
bill, which means that it cannot move. Both disability and regular education 
groups have been trying to get the bill passed in the Senate, so a conference 
committee can be named to come up with a final bill. A number of disability 
groups fear that, flawed as the current bills are, the 105th Congress could 
pass a worse one. Moreover, failure to pass a bill would not guarantee that 
Senators Gorton and Ashcroft would not put their amendments on any new bill 
in the Congress. A number of regular education groups seem to feel that the 
current bills are better for them than the current law. However, others are 
hoping that the 105th Congress could pass an even weaker IDEA.

<p>The recent federal appeals court ruling that public schools must continue 
to serve students with disabilities who are suspended or expelled may change 
the equation. Virginia, which brought the suit, has not yet decide whether to 
appeal the decision. In the meantime, school systems in Maryland, Virginia, 
West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina must serve all students with 
disabilities. The decision may not sit well with the National School Boards 
Association and the American Federation of Teachers, both of which support the 
current proposals which allow denial of educational services to students with 
disabilities who bring a weapon or drugs to school and whose behavior is found 
not to be a manifestation of their disability. KEEP TUNED ON IDEA.

<p><b>Appropriations</b><br>
The House Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations
Subcommittee passed a bill which would level funds to all programs under IDEA.
The Senate has yet to act. Even if IDEA is not reauthorized, the discretionary
programs will not be affected in the 1997 appropriations. However, there will 
be real problems with the 1998 appropriations if the discretionary programs 
are not reauthorized.

<p><b>The Jobs Training Bill</b><br>
Different versions of federal job training programs consolidation were passed 
in the House and the Senate. Although conferees have been working since last 
October, major issues between Republicans and Democrats have not been resolved.
If, as threatened, the Republication majority pass a conference bill, it will 
face a floor filibuster and a presidential veto.

<p><b>The Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care Bill</b><br>
This bill would prohibit the denial of insurance coverage because of a
pre-existing condition. However, further action has been delayed because of 
concerns about proposals to allow medical savings accounts.

<p><b>Welfare Reform</b><br>
Congress hopes to get some version of welfare reform passed before adjournment.
Disability advocates are concerned about proposals to eventually eliminate 
over 350,000 children with disabilities because of changing eligibility.

<p><b>Bills which could have an impact on individuals with disabilities</b><br>
The following bills, which are being monitored by various coalitions, could 
have an impact on individuals with learning disabilities.
<blockquote>
<p><b>The Local Empowerment and Flexibility Act</b> (S88, HR 2086), which 
allows states or localities to submit "flexibility or coordination plans" for 
any federal program under which financial assistance is available. This plan 
can include requests to waive virtually any local, state, or federal law or 
regulation. Although civil rights under the ADA, Section 504 and IDEA cannot 
be waived, a state or community could decide to use IDEA funds for general 
education rather than for special education services for children with 
disabilities. For further information, contact
<a href="mailto:harrys@rtk.net">harrys@rtk.net</a>.

<p><b>The Parents Rights and Responsibilities Act</b> (HR 1946, SR 92) would 
prohibit any government official from interfering with a parent's desires in 
the areas of medical care, discipline, home schooling, and religious education.
Sixty organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics, are 
opposing this bill.

<p>Remember <b>the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations 
(ACIR)</b>? The original report of the ACIR, which was established by the 
Unfunded Mandates Act, recommended changes in both the ADA and IDEA, despite 
the fact that both laws were exempted from the mandate. The draft of ACIR's 
final report does not mention the ADA. However, it repeats the recommendation 
that IDEA be funded to pay for 40% of excess costs and amended to relieve 
state and local governments from prescriptive, administrative, and 
recordkeeping requirements and to foster increased use of mediation and other 
forms of alternative dispute resolution. However, the original recommendation 
to prohibit a private right of action, i.e., due process, by parents has been 
dropped.

<title>Advocacy Memo #1-96: Denial of Eligibility</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>
<h2>Advocacy Memo: For Your Information #1 - 96</h2>
<p>
<b>Denial of Eligibility Because of Gifted Intellectual Ability and/or Lack
of Failure </b><br>
The U.S. Department of Education, in a written response to questions from the
Learning Disabilities Association of North Carolina, stated that "...each
child who is evaluated for a suspected learning disability must be measured
against his or her own expected performance, and not against some arbitrary
general standard." As required by Part B regulation (34 CFR §§300.540-300.543),
the multidisciplinary evaluation team is responsible for determining if a
severe discrepancy exists between a student's ability and performance.
Under
Part B of IDEA and Part B regulations there are no "exclusions based on
intelligence level in determining eligibility." <i>In other words, a
student cannot be excluded from consideration of eligibility for special
education services solely on the basis of a high IQ; no child's IQ can be
too high for that child to be considered for eligibility for special education
services -- even an intellectually gifted student may be considered for
eligibility for special education. </i>

<p>
In order to qualify as having a specific learning disability, the student,
according to Part B of IDEA and Part B regulations, must have a severe
discrepancy between achievement and intellectual ability "in one of more
of the following areas: oral expression, listening comprehension, written
expression, basic reading skill, reading comprehension, mathematics 
calculation, or mathematics reasoning." <i>Intellectual ability is
determined by administration of intelligence or IQ test(s). Achievement is 
determined by administration of tests designed to measure basic reading skill
and comprehension, math computational and reasoning skills, and the ability of
the child to express his/her ideas in writing. Oral expression and listening 
comprehension are generally determined by giving speech and language
tests. Scores earned on achievement and IQ tests are then compared.</i> 

<p>
In order to be eligible for special education services, the multidisciplinary 
team must determine if the student has an "impairment" or disability which 
"adversely affects educational performance" 34 CFR §300.7 (b) (1) - (b)
(13). In a letter to William M. Lybarger, Ed.D., dated September 14, 1990, 
the Department of Education described "educational performance" as
different for each child, "determined on an individual basis," and
"includ(ing) non-academic and academic skills." <i>In other words, a
student with suspected learning disabilities must <b>need</b> special 
education and related services in order to qualify for those services. </i>

<p>
A multidisciplinary team may find a child has a specific learning disability 
if "the child does not achieve commensurate with his or her age and 
ability levels in one or more of the areas listed in paragraph (a) (2) of 
this section, <b>when provided with learning experiences appropriate for the
child's age and ability levels</B> ..." 34 CFR §300.541 (a) (1). The
Department of Education, in its letter to LDA of North Carolina, wrote that
it is "generally" appropriate for the multidisciplinary team to include in
its written report (to determine eligibility) information regarding
"outside or extra" instructional help or support which <b>"may indicate
the child's current educational achievements reflects the service 
augmentation, not what the child's achievement would be without such
help."</b> Such information should be considered by the team in deciding if
the child has "a severe discrepancy between achievement and ability that
is not correctable without special education and related services." If,
for example, a student with an IQ of 125 and significantly lower achievement
scores maintains passing or even exemplary grades, the team should consider
whether or not the student achieves only because of special assistance or
support. If the student receives no special help, the multidisciplinary team
might conclude that student would not need special education. If, on the other
hand, the student has tutoring several times a week, works for three to five 
hours each night on homework with parental assistance, and must have extra 
time to complete tests in order to pass or maintain a certain grade level, 
that student might be considered to have a "specific learning disability." 
His/her grades may reflect all the assistance the student is getting rather 
than the student's actual achievement level.

<h1>Section 504 And Reasonable Accommodation Limitations</h1>

<p><b>Advocacy Memo: Legal Issues #6-96<br>
Advocacy Committee<br>
July 1996</b>

<p>Perry Zirkel, professor of education at Lehigh University, in a letter dated June 28, 1993, 
asked OCR to clarify whether the FAPE (free, appropriate public education) requirement under 34 
CFR §104.33 "incorporates a reasonable accommodation, reasonable modification, or other such 
cost-conscious limitation at least as applied to those students covered by Section 504" who are
ineligible under IDEA. Zirkel asked OCR to respond in light of court decisions such as 
<b>Southeastern Community College v. Davis,</b> 441 US 383, 410 (1979), <b>Alexander v. 
Choate</b>, US 287, 300 (1985), <b>Barnett v. Fairfax County School Bd.</b>, 
927 F.2d 146, 155 (4th Cir. 1991), and others, as well as "reasonable accommodation limitation 
under Title II" of ADA. 

<p>OCR responded that Section 504 regulations establish different standards of compliance for 
different settings. A reasonable accommodation limitation is contained in Subpart B covering 
employment and Subpart E covering postsecondary and vocational education. There is no such 
limitation, however, in Subpart D covering elementary and secondary education. OCR interprets 
the absence of any "cost-conscious limitation" in Subpart D, either in the original regulations or in 
subsequent actions by Congress or the courts, to mean that the writers of the regulations intended 
to create a different compliance standard in the elementary and secondary educational settings and 
the FAPE requirement of 34 CFR §104.33. 

<p>In the Supreme Court cases cited by Zirkel, OCR stated that the Court addressed modifications 
unrelated to either elementary or secondary education and ruled in both instances that  'substantial 
accommodations' were invalid only if they went beyond accommodations necessary to eliminate
 discrimination against otherwise qualified individuals. OCR explained that in all lower court cases
cited there was no need to alter the FAPE requirement of 34 CFR §104.33 If particular educational 
services requested by the plaintiffs were denied by the courts, it was because the courts found no 
discrimination was occurring. OCR stated the rulings were consistent with their interpretation that 
the FAPE regulation requires school districts to meet the individual needs of all students, disabled 
and nondisabled, to the same extent, "though not necessarily providing the same programs and 
services." 

<p>Because OCR adopted a specific FAPE requirement for Section 504 compliance in the 
elementary and secondary school setting, the general discrimination provisions, including any 
"reasonable accommodations limitation" of Title II, may not be applied to weaken the existing 
Section 504 standards.

<title> Special Ed Law & Juvenile Justice</title>
<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>
<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Special Ed Law &amp; Juvenile Justice</h2>
<p>Mental Health Committee FYI<br>
November 1995
<p>
In the District of Columbia, the average child in the delinquency system has 
fallen a minimum of two school years behind his peer group in terms of actual 
school placement, and is a minimum of three to four years behind in terms of 
academic achievement. The majority of children entering the juvenile 
delinquency system in D.C. have learning disabilities, emotional disturbances 
or mental retardation. Unfortunately, the professionals who deal with these 
children, namely, judges, probation offices, juvenile prosecutors and defense 
attorneys, typically lack the training to recognize these problems, and are 
unfamiliar with special education law. 

<p>Joseph Tulman, Associate Professor of Law and Director of the Juvenile Law 
Clinic at the District of Columbia School of Law, contends that lawyers who 
can discern learning disabilities in their clients can enhance the 
effectiveness of their representation in many ways, in his article, The Best 
Defense is a Good Offense: Incorporating Special Education Law into 
Delinquency Representation in the Juvenile Law Clinic. "Children with
learning disabilities, emotional disturbances and mental retardation do
not always understand their legal rights completely; lawyers can try
different methods of communicating with their clients, or have a guardian ad 
litem look out for the child s best interests. An understanding of special
education law can help an attorney hone her approach to the case." 

<p>A child with a learning disability may qualify for a dismissal of a 
delinquency matter and referral to the mental retardation system, if the child
is found to be moderately mentally retarded. Recognizing a juvenile client’s
mental or emotional disabilities can enable an attorney to argue for dismissal
based on "social reasons" under District of Columbia Superior Court Juvenile
Rule 48(b). Because prosecutors must not only prove that the child has
committed the alleged offense, but also that the child is "in need  of
care and rehabilitation", defense attorneys can pre-empt prosecution by
showing that the child has received treatment outside of the court, and 
therefore is not in need of additional care and rehabilitation. 

<p>In deciding whether to pursue special education rights, an attorney must, 
consistent with professional ethics, follow the client’s wishes. Often, a
client has dropped out of school and perhaps because of past academic failure
and frustration, is reluctant to return. While an attorney should listen 
empathetically, and counsel the client in light of his own perceptions of 
self-interest, an attorney should also follow the client’s wishes if he does n
ot wish to have a psycho-educational evaluation. Parents should also be 
consulted during this stage, since many education rights inure to the parent. 
While there is no inherent conflict in representing both the child and parent, 
an attorney should advise the parent of potential conflicts and what limits 
exist should a conflict arise. If the child agrees to pursue a 
psycho-educational evaluation, special education law requires the government
to place a juvenile in an appropriate educational setting within fifty days of 
a request for educational e valuation. Since delinquency matters in D.C. take 
at least sixty days from arrest/initial hearing to first scheduled trial date, 
under ideal conditions, a dismissal for social reasons could be made before 
the first trial date. 

<p>Special education law can also be used to improve the placement of the 
child. Federal and local laws require the government to provide each child 
with a "free appropriate public education" (FAPE), which does not mean an 
optimal learning environment. However, family court utilizes the "best
interest of the child" standard for dispositional orders. Thus an attorney
who receives an unsatisfactory result through the special education system can 
resort to family court Since special education law also requires the
"least restrictive environment", while family court has an obligation to
protect the community, an attorney may also be able to argue for placement in 
the least restrictive environment. 

<p>The legal community’s understanding of learning disabilities and special 
education law can be enhanced through juvenile law clinics within law schools. 
Law clinics can serve a dual function of educating the students at hand, and 
reaching out to the larger legal community. Using special education law in a 
juvenile clinic requires law students to actively develop alternative 
placements and strategies in the special education system, rather than rely 
exclusively on defense strategies. Juvenile law clinics can reach out to the 
larger legal community by offering training sessions in the law of special 
education for lawyers representing juveniles. These training sessions can 
include the distribution of useful materials, such as sample pleadings. Law 
clinics can also help establish a network of private special education experts 
who will accept referrals of cases from attorneys. These services will help 
raise the standard of practice within the community.

<p>The foregoing was summarized from an article entitled, <b>"The Best
Defense is a Good Offense: Incorporating Special Education Law Into
Delinquency Representation in the Juvenile Law Clinic"</b> by Joseph
Tulman. This article first appeared in 42 Journal of Urban and Contemporary 
Law 223 (1992).

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER</h2>
<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>Providing an Appropriate Education to Children with
Attention Deficit Disorder</h3>
<p><b>
ERIC Digest, October 1992<br>
#E512</b>

<h3>Clarification of Terms</h3>
<p>
Throughout this digest, ADD will be used to refer to attention deficit
disorder, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In the past,
the term minimal brain dysfunction  was also used.
<h3>Children with ADD</h3>
<p>
It is estimated that children with ADD constitute 3% to 5% of the
current school-age population, which would represent 1.35 to 2.25
million children. Most experts agree that ADD is a neurobiological
disorder that can have multiple causes. Research indicates that children
with ADD are likely to have a biological relative with ADD. In addition,
evidence also suggests that neurologic, neurochemical or, in some
cases, toxic factors may be involved. Other factors such as medical
conditions, medication side effects, familial functioning, or
environmental conditions may exacerbate an existing disorder or
contribute to the development of ADD-like problem in some children
(Parker, 1992).

<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
<p>
As with all other disabling conditions, evaluation of children suspected
of having ADD should be a multistep, multidisciplinary procedure. First
the assessment should determine whether a child meets criteria for
diagnosis of ADD; then, further assessment should determine the
degree to which the child's educational performance is adversely
affected. This information will help determine what types of educational
services are necessary to assist the student.
<p>
The first step requires gathering information about the child from a
number of sources and in a variety of ways. Medical information; parent
or guardian descriptions of the child's physical, mental, social, and
emotional development; school information; descriptions of social
behavior and classroom adjustment; and assessment of the child's
cognitive functioning are essential to making an accurate diagnosis.
Because the behavior of children thought to have ADD can vary widely
in different situations and environments, experts recommend obtaining
information from many sources, and observing the child in different
settings and at different times. Evaluations of children suspected of
having ADD often include rating scales completed by parents and
teachers.

<h3>School Responsibilities</h3>
<p>
Schools must provide appropriate educational services to students who
have been identified as having ADD. In September 1991, the
Department of Education issued a policy clarification on the topic of
children with attention deficit disorder (Davila, Williams, & MacDonalt,
1991). The memorandum was intended to clarify  state and local
responsibility under federal law for meeting the needs of children with
ADD in the educational system as a whole.
<p>
The responsibility for meeting the educational needs of children with
ADD rests with the entire educational! system, not just with particular
sectors. Thus, if the needs of these children are to be fully met in the
schools (whether through general or special education programs), 
increased coordination, collaboration, and consultation will have to
occur among regular educators, special educators, administrators. and
related services personnel. The report recognizes that:
<p>
Regular classroom teachers are important in identifying appropriate
educational adaptations and interventions for many children with
ADD.
<p>
State and local districts should take the necessary steps to promote
coordination between special education and regular education
programs.
<p>
Regular education teachers and other personnel need training to
develop a greater awareness of children with ADD and of adaptations
that can be implemented in regular education programs to address the
instructional needs of these children.
<p>
Children who are experiencing educational difficulties, whether from
ADD or some other cause, often fail to receive any assistance until after
difficulties, such as distractibility, disorganization, or inability to complete
assignments on time, have caused them yo fall significantly behind their
classmates. By the time children have experienced such failure, they
generally have already lost a great deal of academic ground In addition,
school failure may contribute to, or worsen, a student's feelings of low
self-esteem, depression, or anxiety.

<h3>Federal Laws Affecting Children with ADD</h3>
<p>
Both the Individual with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 provide coverage for children with
ADD. When the disability adversely affects educational performance,
eligibility for special education should be approached through the
processes of IDEA When the disability does not affect educational
performance but does substantially limit one or more major life
activities, eligibility should be approached through Section 504. The
following are highlights of each law as it affects the education of
children with ADD.

<p>
<b>Individuals with Disabilities Education Act Part B:</b>
<ul>
   <li> Requires that state and local districts make a free appropriate
     public education (FAPE) available to all eligible children
     <br>
   <li> Requires that the rights and protections of Part B of IDEA
     are extended to children with ADD and their parents.
     <br>
  <li> Requires that an evaluation be done, without undue delay, to
     determine if the child has one or more of 13 specified disabling
     conditions and requires special education and related services.
     <br>
  <li> Requires that children with ADD be classified as eligible for
     services under the "other health impaired" category in instances
     where ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that results in
     limited alertness that adversely affects a child's educational
     performance. Children with ADD can also be served under the
     categories of "learning disabilities" or seriously emotionally
     disturbed," if the evaluation finds these conditions are also
     present.
     <br>
  <li> Does not allow local districts to refuse to evaluate the possible
     need for special education and related services of a child with a
     prior medical diagnosis of ADD solely by reason of that medical
     diagnosis. On the other hand, a medical diagnosis of ADD does
     not automatically make a child eligible for services under Part B
     (IDEA).
     <br>
  <li> Requires that a full and individual evaluation of the child's     
     educational needs must be conducted in accordance with
     requirements in Part B (IDEA). These requirements include:<br>
    <dl>
       <dd>A multidiscipiinary team must perform the evaluation.
           At least one teacher or other specialist with knowledge
           in the area of ADD must be on the team.<br>
    </dl>
  <li> Requires that a due process hearing take place, at the request
     of the parents, if there is disagreement between the local district
     and the parent over the request for evaluation, the evaluation, or
     the determinations for services.
  </ul>

<p>
<b>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973:</b>
<ul>
   <li> Prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by recipients of
     federal funds.
     <br>
   <li> Provides appropriate education for children who do not fall within
     the disability categories specified in Part B (IDEA).  Examples of
     potential conditions not typically covered under Part B (IDEA) are:
     <br>
     <dl>
        <dd>communicable diseases (HIV, tuberculosis)
            medical conditions (asthma, allergies, diabetes, heart
            disease) temporary medical conditions due to illness or accident
            drug/alcohol addiction<br>
        </dd>
     </dl>
   <li> Requires that a free appropriate public education be provided to
     each qualified child who is disabled but does not require special
     education and related services under Part B (IDEA). A free
     appropriate education (FAPE) under Section 504 includes:
     <br>
     <dl>
         <dd>Regular or special education and related aids and services
             that are designed to meet the individual student's needs and
             are based on adherence to the regulatory requirements on
             education setting, evaluation, placement, and procedural
             safeguards.<br>
         </dd>
     </dl>
  <li> Guarantees parents the right to contest the outcome of an
     evaluation if a local district determines that a child is not
     disabled under Section 504.
     <br>
  <li> Requires the local district to make an individualized determination
     of the child's educational needs for regular or special education or
     related aids and services if the child is found eligible under
     Section 504.
     <br>
  <li> Requires the implementation of an individualized education
     program (IEP). One means of meeting the free appropriate public
     education requirements of Section 504 is to follow the IEP
     guidelines as set forth in the regulations for Part B (IDEA).
     <br>
  <li> Requires that the child's education must be provided in the regular
     education classroom unless it is demonstrated that education in
     the regular environment with the use of supplementary aids and
     services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
     <br>
  <li> Requires that necessary adjustments be made in the regular
     classroom for children who qualify under Section 504.

<h2 align=center>Parenting The Child With<BR>
Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder</h2>

<p>Children with AD/HD present a problem to their parents. Because they
are energetic, loving; at times impossible and excitable, many parenting
techniques simply do not work. Effective parenting involves patience, time,
effort, and inter-parental cooperation. The following represent some concrete
ideas and suggestions:

<UL>
<LI><b>Be Positive</b> - It is easy to notice the negative behavior of
a child with AD/HD because there is so much of it. Noticing and reinforcing
positive behavior is critical. There is a tendency to leave the child alone
when she or he is being &quot;good.&quot; To the contrary, this is the
time to say or do something that will make the positive behavior more 
probable.
<br></LI>

<LI><b>Use Praise</b> - Learning a variety of ways to say &quot;good 
job&quot; and &quot;thanks&quot; can do wonders for the child with AD/HD.
This is a major means that you can use to reinforce positive behavior.
<br></LI>

<LI><b>Be Specific, Concrete and Immediate</b> - Children with AD/HD
do not do well with generalities or with feedback that is delayed. Their 
rapid pace, hyperactivity, and distractibility make swift parental 
response critical.
<BR>
<DL>
<DD><b>Break things into manageable elements.</b> For example, when giving
tasks, be specific and to the point. Telling a child with this disorder
to clean his or her room is fruitless. On the other hand telling them to
pick up dirty clothes and put them in the hamper or pick up all of the
GI Joes and put them in a box will bring good results.
<BR>
<DD><b>Do not use complex, long-winded verbal communication.</b> Children
with AD/HD do not tolerate complexity and may hear a portion of what is
being said. They may only hear the first command of a series. Often, they
may need to have things repeated or be asked to say what they have heard
in order to accomplish a task.
<BR>
<DD><b>Reinforce or punish now, not later</b>. Because of memory problems
and a tendency to operate in the here and now and not in the future, parental
responses need to be immediate.<br></dd>
</DL>

<LI><b>Discipline Must be Positive, If Possible, and Not Negative</b> -
Children with AD/HD often do much better by hearing positive rather than
getting into a vicious negative feedback cycle, negative behavior escalating
parental negatives. Some concrete techniques to facilitate this are:
<BR>
<DL>
<dd><b>Give choices and options.</b> Children with AD/HD often create power
struggles and do not do well in confrontations, &quot;options&quot; are
more useful than &quot;musts.&quot; For example, &quot;Do you want to do
your homework now or in 30 minutes?&quot; 
<br>

<dd><b>Use charts</b>. Things written down in specifics will be useful
because they are visual and concrete. They can be helpful to remind children
what they have to do and when.
<br>

<dd><b>Use reward systems</b>. Children with AD/HD are more ruled by immediate
gratification than by mature deliberation or by long term consequences.
Using rewards for behavior with concrete payoff can be incredibly useful.
<br>

</DL>

<li><b>Structure is Important As Is Attention to Time and Sequence</b>
- Children with AD/HD do not do well with unpredictability, change and
a lack of consistency. Specific times for homework for completing tasks,
chores, and other requirements are useful. If charts are used, they can
dictate components of tasks in a sequential fashion. 
<br></li>

<li><b>Parents on the Same Wavelength and in Agreement</b> - To have a
parent coalition that is imbalanced and not working well together (blaming
and condemning) will wreak havoc. Part of therapy is to heal parental splits
and to come to agreement. 
<br></li>

<li><b>Parents Must Take Time to Nurture Each Other and Take Time Out</b>
- Due to the stress of raising a child who is hyperactive and distractible,
parents must take time away and not be locked into their child's world.
Going out and/or taking long weekends together can be very fruitful. </li>
</ul>

<title>ADD - Behavioral Management</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="F0f0F0">
<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>
<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Behavorial Management - AD/HD</h2>
<p>
Students with the characteristics of AD/HD do best in an organized
environment where behavioral expectations are spelled out clearly and in
advance and where consequences are delivered immediately. The main
principle behind the behavioral management system is to decrease the
undesirable behaviors and to increase the desirable behaviors through a
system of rewarding desirable behavior and ignoring undesirable behavior. The
environment needs to be predictable and the management of the behavior
must be consistent. The use of behavioral charts with systems of a token
economy or response cost and the use of time-out work effectively with these
children.
<p>
Some aspects of the use of behavioral management need to be designed
specifically for these students, including the following factors:
<ul>
<li>  Children with AD/HD are efficient learners when their behavior is reinforced
   100% of the time, but are less efficient on a partial reinforcement schedule.
   In the classroom, where the teacher is able to give the student direct
   feedback infrequently, the student with AD/HD who is not always paying
   attention is placed at a disadvantage.
<br><li>
   The timing of the reinforcement is also critical with the child with AD/HD. If
   the feedback is immediate, it is effective. If there is a delay in the timing,
   the student learns less efficiently than his peers.
<br><li>
   It is critical that the reinforcement contingency is clear to the student with
   AD/HD or it will be less effective.
<br><li>
   They work best with a system of positive reinforcement rather than
   punishment. It is important to respond to the behavior of these students
   without anger.
<br><li>
  The use of Cognitive Behavior Modification has successfully assisted these
   students in becoming aware of their own thinking processes and their
   approach to tasks. The approach gives them responsibility for their own
   reinforcement and assists them in learning to organize themselves and to
   control their own behavior.
<br><li>
   The provision of direct instruction in self-control and social skills can be
   helpful.
<br><li>
   Relaxation techniques may be useful and teaching the student to "stop,
   look, and think" and may assist the student in self-monitoring.
<br><li>
   Behavior management should be coordinated across all settings and
   communication between the home and the school is essential. If the student
   has a private therapist or counselor, they should be involved in the planning
   of the management system.
<br><li>
   If the child is on medication, a system to objectively monitor behavioral
   changes should be established and coordinated with the student's
   physician.

<body bgcolor="F0F0F0">
<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>
<h2 ALIGN=CENTER>Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorders</h2>
<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>AD/HD Issues that Impact School Planning</H3>

<p>1. Behaviors associated with AD/HD are frequently perceived as lack of
compliance or motivation. It is essential that all counselors and teachers have
training in the current research in the area of AD/HD and the other conditions
that may co-exist with AD/HD or result in similar symptoms.

<p>2. All school personnel should understand the legal requirements of the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act with regard to students diagnosed as having AD/HD.

<p>3. When medications have been prescribed by a physician, it is critical that
the school staff members cooperate with any measures requested by the physician
to monitor the impact of the medication. No school personnel should
recommend medication or suggest changes in the dosage of the medication to
the parent All issues of medication should be coordinated with the prescribing
physician. It is the responsibility of the school personnel to work out a system
for the administration of the medication if it must be given during school hours
that is sensitive to the feelings of the student and is effective enough to
ensure the timely administration of the medication, as prescribed.

<p>4. Parent and home collaboration is necessary in the management of
homework and the implementation of behavior management plans. Homework
assignments should always be written down and their complexity should be
adjusted to accommodate the ability of the student to work independently.

<p>5. Sound behavior management systems should be implemented.

<p>6. Instruction should be broken down into manageable steps and the students
should be taught at their instructional level not their frustration level. 
Give the student additional time to complete tasks and alternate the types of 
assignment to increase interest. It is also helpful to engage as many senses, 
as possible, in instruction.

<p>7. Instructions should be given to the student one at a time and there should
be some feedback requested from the student to ensure that the instructions are
understood.

<p>8. Learning aids such as listening centers, computers, tape recorders and
calculators will frequently increase the student's ability to pay attention.
Other strategies of stimulus reduction may also assist the student in focusing
on the school work.

<p>9. Assessment must include multiple sources of information which may include
formal and informal observations, interviews of the parents, teachers and the
student, traditional psychoeducational measures, behavior checklists and
medical input from the student's physician.

<p>10. Some students with AD/HD benefit from group or individual counseling
which focuses on problemsolving, social skills and cognitive behavioral
self-monitoring strategies.

<p>11. Give the student regular feedback about his academic work and focus on
the positive gains he has made.

<p>12. Provide as much structure as possible with a predictable schedule and
strategies designed to help the student move from one activity to another.

<p>13. Alternate activities that require the student to remain seated with activities
that allow movement. Alternate independent work with supervised work.Mve<

<h3 align=center>LEGAL ISSUES</h3>

<p>Children with ADHD may be eligible for services under special education
(IDEA) if they meet the eligibility criteria for one of the handicapping
conditions covered in this act, or they may be eligible for services under
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation act of 1973, if they fall within the
definition of &quot;handicapped person&quot; described in this legislation.
It is critical that regular education and special education cooperate to
ensure that the needs of these students are met and that a system be in
place that allows for a systematic identification of these students and
other students eligible for services under these mandates. </p>

<h4>IDEA</h4>

<ul>
<li>Students are eligible for free and appropriate education and related
services as other health impaired if the ADHD results in a &quot;chronic
or acute health problem that results in limited alertness, which adversely
effects academic performance.&quot; 
<br></li>

<li>They may also be eligible as emotionally disturbed or as learning disabled,
if they meet the eligibility criteria for these two handicapping conditions.

<br></li>

<li>Requires free and appropriate education and an IEP that is reasonably
designed to benefit the student. 
<br></li>

<li>Decisions are made by a committee made up of representatives from administration,
instruction, and special education, as well as the parent. If new assessment
is being discussed an assessment person must be present. 
<br></li>

<li>Placement in the least restrictive environment. 
<br></li>

<li>Consent is required before initial evaluation. Areas to be assessed
are specifically prescribed for each handicapping condition. Timelines
are provided and re-evaluations are required every three years. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Section 504</h4>

<ul>
<li>Students may be eligible for services under Section 504 if their ADHD
results in &quot;a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits
a major life activity.&quot; 
<br></li>

<li>Requires free appropriate education that is individually designed to
ensure that the eligible student has a program comparable to other nonhandicapped
students. Results in an Accommodations Plan. 
<br></li>

<li>Decisions are made by a group of knowledgeable persons, including someone
who knows the child, someone who can interpret the assessment data, and
someone who knows the district's resources. 
<br></li>

<li>Placement in the least restrictive environment. 
<br></li>

<li>Only notice is required before evaluation. No specific guidelines are
provided regarding evaluation except the assessment must use multiple sources
of information and must be conducted by someone who is trained in the use
of the measures used. No time lines are provided but periodic reevaluations
are required. Reevaluations are also required prior to any change of placement.

<br></li>

<li>The Department of Civil Rights monitors the compliance of Section 504.

<h1>LD Myths and Misconceptions</h1>
<p><b>Pasquale Accardo, MD</b>
<p>
<b>All teachers and physicians are experts in learning disabilities.
</b> Professionals in child health and education often have a limited 
understanding of the nature of learning disabilities. Parents may have 
to search for the appropriate expertise to diagnose and manage their
child. This deficiency in professional training is especially serious 
since "understanding" is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways 
of treating LD.
<p>
<b>Since learning disabilities are so common, they must be easy to 
diagnose. </b> Learning disabilities are very often "hidden 
disabilities" -- although they commonly occur they are often 
difficult to spot. While some children exhibit striking signs of LD 
and clear patterns on simple screening tests, others will need 
careful and extensive assessment by an interdisciplinary team to 
identify an underlying learning disability or disabilities.
<p>
<b>IEPs mean that students will go to special education classes. </b>
Interventions for most children with learning disabilities can occur 
in the regular classroom; the IEP simply formulates how such 
interventions will be implemented.
<p>
<b>It is the regular teacher's job to teach all children, regardless 
of so-called disabilities. </b> Learning disabilities represent a 
complex challenge to the regular classroom setting and one that 
needs to be addressed with a wide variety of intervention strategies 
-- a variety that demands the involvement of a number of different 
professionals. Close working relationships with other professionals 
should prevent the teacher from feeling alone, overburdened or 
abandoned.
<p>
<b>Some special medication, diet or other treatment can "cure" 
learning disabilities. </b> There is no magic pill, quick fix or 
one-stop cure for learning disabilities. When a diagnosis of LD is 
made, parents should be told that they are in for the "long haul." 
Love, support, attention and understanding remain the mainstays of 
long-term treatment of LD.
<p>
<b>Children outgrow learning disabilities. </b> Learning disabilities 
are life long. However, many adults with LD who receive special 
attention as children will build strategies to successfully adapt to 
life's challenges.
<p>
<b>Most children who experience difficulties with learning are just 
"slow." </b> Learning disabilities occur in children at all levels 
of intellectual ability. Some children with LD are bright enough to 
be academically gifted, some are average, and a few are below average. The specific neurological deficit that cause learning disabilities are distinct and separate from general cognitive ability.
<p>
<b>Learning disabilities are caused by poor parenting. </b> 
Childrearing patterns and home discipline may have an impact on 
classroom behavior, and parental involvement in education certainly 
has an effect on a child's enthusiasm for and success in school, but 
parenting skills have no association with the presence or absence of 
learning disabilities.
<p>
<b>Learning disabilities affect everything at school. </b> Learning 
disabilities are relative phenomena. The underlying patterns of 
strengths and weaknesses that cause LD may not seriously affect a 
child's performance in one classroom setting or at one grade level 
but may account for significant difficulties in another class or at 
a different grade level.
<p>
<b>Learning disabled students have school problems because they don't 
try hard enough. </b> Learning disabilities are not motivational. 
Ironically, even if an LD student claims not to want to try at school 
he or she may simply be covering up for their fear of failure. A 
child will sooner resort to saying, "I won't" than admit the more 
frightening, "I can't." It is up to adults to help children with LD 
learn to compensate successfully.

<h1 align=center>Select Causes of School Failure</h1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p><b>Pasquale Accardo, M.D.</b>
<p>
<b><font SIZE="+1">Attentional Deficits </font></b><br>
The term "attentional disorders" is used to characterize children with 
a varying constellation of short attention span, impulsivity, 
distractibility, and sometimes hyperactivity (unusually high level of 
activity) or hypoactivity (underactivity). Children with attentional 
disorders frequently exhibit difficulties with both their attention 
and behavior that can interfere with their classroom performance. The 
terminology for attentional disorders is constantly changing, to the 
confusion and consternation of <em>both</em> parents and professionals. 
Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), Attention Deficit Disorder with 
Hyperactivity (ADHD), ADD-combined type, ADD-predominantly 
inattentive type, ADD-predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type, 
Executive Function Disorder, and Primary Disorder of Vigilance are 
just some of the terms that clinicians and researchers use. The major 
areas of intervention used with children exhibiting attention deficit 
disorders include: classroom accommodations, behavior management 
counseling for the family, and possibly medication. Between fifty 
and seventy-five percent of children with attentional deficits also 
have learning disabilities; it is important to keep in mind that 
each will benefit from being specifically and separately addressed.

<p>Often, children with attention deficit disorders exhibit notable 
hyperactivity. Diagnosis of such hyperactivity is separate and not 
necessarily a part of all attention deficit disorders. According to 
current data, males seem more likely to exhibit hyperactivity early 
on in their school career; females are more likely to have 
attentional problems without hyperactivity early on and then show 
behavioral and emotional problems in middle to late adolescence. 
Girls with both mild attentional and learning disabilities are more 
likely to withdraw, try harder to compensate, and successfully keep 
their problem concealed, perhaps later developing psychological 
problems as the cost of this compensation.

<p>Although LD and attention deficit disorders are commonly related, 
early identification of attentional disorders may or may not help the 
identification of associated learning disabilities depending on 
whether or not one disorder masks the other. It may be of interest 
to physicians, teachers, and administrators to note that children 
referred to a health professional because the child is having 
"staring spells" in class are much more likely to have attentional 
problems than petit mal seizures (commonly assumed to be the primary 
cause of "staring spells").

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Physical Disabilities</font></b><br>
Physical disabilities can lead directly to educational problems as 
well. Children with visual impairment require ophthalmological 
assessments and eyeglasses; children with hearing impairment need 
audiological assessment, otolaryngological evaluations) and possibly 
hearing aids or other assistive listening devices. Both of these 
groups of children will also benefit from single classroom 
accommodations (such as preferential seating) that take into account 
their sensory disabilities.

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Language Disabilities</font></b><br>
A language disorder may involve the form of language (phonology, 
morphology, syntax , the content of language (semantics) and/or the 
function of language (semantics) and affect spoken, written and/or 
other symbol systems Children may experience educational difficulty 
as a result of language disorders (developmental disorders related 
to language, i.e., expressive language and/or receptive language 
problems) as well. For such children, the discipline of speech-language 
pathology has developed a number of intervention techniques that can 
effectively be used to assess and treat their specific disability. 
For more information, contact the American Speech-Language-Hearing 
Association.

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Brain Tumors</font></b><br>
Even more severe among physiological disorders, brain tumors may 
occasionally cause children who develop them to display learning 
problems at school In this case, educational difficulty may be 
symptomatic of a critical illness. In fact, in the case of a tumor, 
a careful documentation of academic deterioration may provide the 
earliest clue to what may very well be a life-threatening situation. 
Although rare, brain tumors highlight the need to take a serious 
approach to diagnosing the underlying causes of educational failure. 
If the child's learning difficulties are passed off as motivational, 
the resulting  failure to assess the child might delay a serious 
medical diagnosis in a case where time is critical to long-term 
survival. Similarly, children with degenerative diseases of the 
central nervous system may first evidence  academic problems. As 
with brain tumors, a careful medical assessment will be needed to 
make an accurate diagnosis and determine whether academic 
difficulties are the result of  a  serious and worsening system 
disorder.

<p><b><font SIZE="+1">Emotional Disorders</font></b><br>
Like physical impairments, emotional and psychosocial problems can 
have a serious effect on a child's ability to learn. Similarly, too, 
these causes of educational failure have their own fields of 
diagnosis and treatment; and, -- as mentioned earlier -- although 
these difficulties are not necessarily associated with LD, they 
commonly co-occur in learning disabled children. For children 
exhibiting any of a variety of different emotional diagnoses, there 
exists a range of professional psychological counseling and medical 
psychotherapy. In addition, emotional problems may be treated with 
medications (psychopharmacologicals). Unlike some other disorders 
that cause educational problems, major psychiatric conditions are 
not treatable through minor classroom accommodations and are probably 
beyond the typical experience of school counselors.

<h1 align=center>They Speak for Themselves</h1>

<h2 align=center>A Survey of Adults with Learning Disabilities</h2>

<p><b>LDA, 1996 (Shoestring Press)</b> </p>

<p>For years organizations, professionals, parents and others have spoken
for adults with learning disabilities. Of the few programs and support
services provided for adults with learning disabilities, only a small percentage
demonstrate a true understanding of the needs of this population. In order
to provide a format for adults with learning disablities to communicate,
LDA published a survey questionnaire in the spring 1994 
<b><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>. The results of this survey have now been
published in &quot;They Speak For Themselves.&quot; Some of these results
are presented in the graphs below. The complete booklet may be obtained
through the <a href="../../Email.html">national office</a>. 

<p>The survey was designed to obtain a complete description of the impact
of learning disabilities on the lives of these adults. It asked about age,
education, vocational history, mental and physical health, income, living
arrangements, and interactions with the justice system. It also included
questions concerning the incidence of learning disabilities or other disabilities
in other members of the family. Participants had the option of remaining
anonymous and of providing additional comments. These comments, which provided
insight into the concerns of adults with learning disabilities and their
parents, added an unexpected dimension to the survey. </p>

<p>It must be noted that the survey was not a random sample of the population
of adults with learning disabilities. The survey was distributed through
our national publication <b><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>. The respondents were
knowledgeable about learning disabilities and were motivated enough to
belong to a national organization concerned with learning disabilities.
It is not possible to know to what extent these responses reflect the total
population of adults with learning disabilities.

<title> How Many "A's" Are Enough?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1><img src="../../images/ldalogo.gif" alt="LDA Logo" width=91 height=62
align=center hspace=10>How Many &quot;A's&quot; Are Enough?</h1>

<p><b>Barbara Cordoni, Ed.D.</b>

<p>A local Learning Disabilities Association meeting had as its speakers a 
group of successful college students with learning disabilities who were 
answering questions asked by the middle and high school students in the 
audience. This meeting represented the first time the adolescent students 
with learning disabilities had ever had the opportunity to really interact 
with others who had gone through what they were going through.

<p>Both the older college students and the younger students had their stories. 
Some of the stories they related were enough to break every heart in the room. 
Some students reported good attempts by teachers to help them but one reported 
"being placed in a waste basket because that was all she was worth." They 
nodded their heads. These young people understood each other.

<p>As a listener at this meeting, I learned from the students, as is often 
the case. A lovely thirteen year old looked directly at my daughter, Tara, a 
member of the panel, and asked, "How many 'A's' are enough?" While I was 
still pondering the question, my daughter answered, "I don't know. I don't 
know how many A's you have to get before you feel worthwhile, before you feel
as competent as others; before you stop worrying that they will find you out."
As Tara spoke, I remembered that it was not until she had her master's degree 
in her hand that she had allowed herself to believe it was truly hers.

<p>Even though parents may learn a great deal from meetings such as these, it 
is difficult for us to hear of the painful experiences of our children. It can 
also be difficult to hear students reveal to their understanding peers things
they felt they couldn't discuss with their parents. When we, horrified, find 
out years later some of the things that happened to them, they tell us they 
couldn't talk about them, it simply hurt too much.
<br>

<h3>LIVING WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES</h3>
<p>The way families handle interactions such as these or those with school 
personnel depends on several factors: the mental health of the family; how 
badly and how often the child is wounded; the quality of help and support 
they receive from family, friends and the school district; and their own 
personalities. Obviously, families are different. Some are intact, but feel 
that educating children is the school's job and if the school did a better 
job many problems would be avoided.

<p>Some parents are fearful of confronting a teacher, fearing the teacher may 
retaliate and their child may receive fewer services. Some families are 
headed by single parents, who have to work long hours just to feed the 
children, leaving little time for parent involvement with the school. The 
structure of the family is far less important than the family's support of 
the person with learning disabilities. Acceptance of the person as a valued 
human being is the key to good mental health.

<p>In order to understand the family dynamics more comprehensively than one 
person's experience allows, the author spoke at length with a number of the 
Achieve Program's students.

<p>The Achieve Program is an academic support system for students with 
learning disabilities at Southern Illinois University. For seventeen years, 
these students have come from all over the United States and from thirteen 
foreign countries in order to go to college with the support of this
program. The author felt that a broad spectrum of experiences from
students from across the land would allow a better understanding of the
adolescent years as experienced by our children. As expected, their
experiences were varied. Some who came from very supportive homes, or who
were sports stars, or who went to private schools where their learning
disabilities were understood, came through those teenage years reasonably
intact psychologically. None was left without wounds.

<p>Students who came from homes where the learning disability was a source of 
embarrassment for the parents or where the parents didn't understand, had 
serious questions about their own self worth. Students who came from schools 
where the school district routinely restricted their classes and the makeup 
of those classes, showed a greater degree of stress than those from more 
supportive schools. All agreed that multicategorical placements produced the 
poorest results. Students who had been in classes with severely acting out 
students or who were mentally retarded rarely received appropriate services. 
The resource room in such schools represented the place where the "dummies 
go." This was a painful experience and memories continue to be painful.

<p>None understood the nature of his/her disabilities.

<p>Many said they were told that they were smart but had trouble learning. 
Others were given a label, such as dyslexia, which really had little meaning 
to them. The students perceived themselves as "not trying very hard"; not too 
bright; and outsiders in that critical group of successful high school
students. They felt lonely and were embarrassed over their inadequacies and 
because of having to spend time in the resource room.

<p>Teenage years are difficult at best; however, having a learning disability 
only makes this period more difficult. Adolescents want desperately to be 
liked by their peers, but may feel isolated because of their disability. 
Parents may continue to offer support by telling the child how smart they 
are but the child may not believe it. The feeling is: "They're my parents, 
they have to say it."
<br>

<h3>SCHOOL EXPERIENCES</h3>
<p>The Achieve students handled the trauma of high school in different ways. 
One took a full time job and went to school only occasionally. His single 
mother worked nights and could not be around for him. During one period he 
missed 45 days of school. Apparently, the school either was unaware or 
unconcerned. Another enrolled in as few academic classes as possible, taking 
several PE classes a semester and perhaps one history class. He arranged his 
study halls for the end of the day which meant he could leave school at noon.
His last math class was in 8th grade. The friends he made at his Catholic 
grade school were the ones he kept. He says he went back to his ten year high
school reunion and didn't   know anyone.

<p>As these stories are relayed, one wonders, "Where were the guidance 
counselors, the special education teachers, the truant officers?"

<h3>BEHAVIORS</h3>
<p>Others say they hid behind a mask of toughness - black leather jackets; a 
knife in your backpack; promiscuity; alcohol and drugs - defying anyone to get
close. Some shoplifted, hot-wired cars, ran away and dated unsuitable people. 
Many, of course, dropped out of school.

<p>When parents see these kinds of behaviors emerging, they may not know what 
to do. Most try to talk to the youngster, (which often evolves into a 
screaming match) but unless a strong family bond has been set up long ago, 
talking probably will not be very effective. Even if there was a strong bond 
established, it is very difficult for the young person to open up to a parent 
about issues he is convinced the parent will not understand. With a limited 
peer group, the young person is unlikely to ask their advice, certainly not 
as it pertains to a disability. Often, the only group that willingly accepts 
these students is the dropout prone, substance abusing group. Since everybody 
has a basic need to be accepted by someone, this group is often where the LD 
youngsters can be found and the worse they behave, the more accepted they are.

<p>Such behaviors are terrifying to parents who are frightened about where 
the behaviors may lead. This beloved child is rebelling against everything 
his parents have tried to teach him, willfully, it may seem.

<p>Constant worry and stress (will s/he come home tonight?) affects every 
family member.

<p>Siblings may resent the attention focused on the acting out child, in 
effect saying, "I behave and where is the attention I deserve?" Some strive 
even harder to "make up" for the dysfunctional child. At school they may be 
ashamed of, or embarrassed by the sibling. Parents may not agree on the steps 
to help this child, causing friction between them. Repeated trips to yet 
another specialist may result in financial stress.

<p>Therapeutic intervention with a psychologist or social worker seems the 
next step to take, but often the adolescent cannot be made to go. If the 
parent succeeds in getting the child into the building to meet the therapist, 
the adolescent may be so resistant to treatment that there is no point in 
pursuing it. Many Achieve students have been through therapy, or their 
parents have attempted therapy. They felt that the best approach is to find 
an LD adult to work with the student in a non-threatening environment. Very 
few therapists have been trained to work with and understand the needs of the 
person with a learning disability and such knowledge is critical to 
successful intervention.

<p>Another response of the LD adolescent is to become the "people pleaser" in 
an attempt to have some control over what is happening to him/her. This child 
appears less rebellious and is less frightening to parents. This child has 
learned to be a charmer, often a skillful manipulator, who can talk others 
into just about anything; who never takes no for an answer; who will later 
come back with another reason why s/he should be allowed to do it his/her way.
They tend to do better in school because teachers hesitate to fail these 
pleasant people who always have a smile. They can be maddening to live with. 
The pleasantness at school often disappears at home where it is less useful, 
but the manipulative behavior remains. Here, again, family dynamics come into 
play as they learn how to lead without destroying what, to the child, has 
become a survival skill.

<p>Parents need to remember that adolescents may be frightened and are doing 
the best they can to cope. They have little faith in their own abilities; they
feel that they are less adequate than their peers; and they are constantly 
afraid their inadequacies will be discovered.

<p>Sometimes a youngster just quits. A mother and father came to see me, 
dragging along their fifteen year old son. He sat down hard on the couch and 
glared at me as his parents told me his story. He had been seen by some fine 
specialists but his parents said that the school had never followed through 
on the specialists' suggestions. He was impulsive and distractible. He had a 
language disorder which did not allow him to formulate a sentence; rather he 
would talk all around a topic until people refused to listen. Having tried 
everything they knew to help their child, now they were very frightened. The 
school was threatening to send him away to a school for the emotionally 
disturbed; the last time the school psychologist had tried to test him he had 
refused to answer any questions. I turned to the child and laughed, much to 
the parents amazement. "Decided you weren't going to play his silly games 
anymore, didn't you?" He looked at me, startled, and said: "Yes!" I then said 
to the boy, "You felt it hadn't done you any good in the past so why go
through it again, right?" to which he replied, "Right!"

<p>His parents were stunned to find the reason for his refusal to submit to 
more testing. Often a child will so entrench himself in a position that only 
a person outside the family can be more objective and get at the heart of the 
matter. Why should he try to explain to his parents? After all, they had 
allowed this to happen to him again; they were no help in his eyes.

<p>They went on to tell me of his many talents while he rebuffed each talent 
they mentioned. Finally I turned to him and said: "You think that if you can 
do it, it must be awfully easy and everybody else can do it too, don't you?" 
He looked surprised when I told him that not everyone would be able to do the 
same things he could do, but that he would have to learn that himself.

<p>It was agreed that he would be placed in an alternative school that a very 
good special education director had opened. This placement was basically a 
self-contained LD class, which proved to be a lifesaver for this child.

<p>The nurses in the newborn nursery as well as mothers can tell early on the 
type of personality a baby is likely to develop. Some babies seem ready to 
take on the world while others lie quietly, hardly making a sound. These 
inborn personality variables, especially in the child with learning 
disabilities, are obviously affected by the way a child is raised. As the 
quiet baby grows he or she is easy to get along with but tends to be a more 
fearful child, less ready to be the first in line or to raise a fuss. This is 
the child who allows the parent - indeed almost forces the parent - to do a 
great deal for him/her. From homework to the ironing, these children appear 
helpless and if this behavior is allowed to continue, they will be. In 
adolescence, many become depressed.
<br>

<h3>DEPRESSION</h3>
<p>Adolescent depression can be very frightening. It is difficult for a parent to judge how severe the depression is and to know when to call for professional help.

<p>Some signs of clinical depression are: a lack of interest in things s/he 
was interested in before; a change in eating habits, either bingeing or 
rejection of food which can lead to bulimia or anorexia; lack of interest in 
personal appearances and/or personal hygiene; excessive sleeping; a lack of 
involvement in family matters; promiscuity; drug use; and truancy. While each 
of these behaviors can have other causes, it is very important for the parent 
to watch for them and to take action if necessary. Action may include those 
mentioned before such as talking to a social worker, psychologist, or another 
adult with learning disabilities. Medication, if indicated, must be monitored 
by a physician. If the adolescent refuses to consult a professional, then 
the parent must do so. Depression is too dangerous to just hope it will 
disappear. One of my students told me he was in third grade the first time he 
tried to commit suicide. All children can become depressed under certain 
circumstances, but it is not sustained. It goes away after a few days or a 
week and should not be of great concern. If the depression is constant or 
becomes more severe, seek professional help. Once again, a major secret to 
good mental health is to feel good about yourself.
<br>

<h3>INDEPENDENCE</h3>
<p>We parents help in the early school years because we must. The child with 
learning disabilities is under 	such stress to get the homework done that we 
are unwilling to place additional burdens, so the unkempt room is allowed for 
one more day or the chores left undone. It is also easier to do the chores 
ourselves than to get the child to do what s/he is supposed to do.

<p>Like water, taking the path of least resistance, the child learns to be 
helpless, and the parent feels needed. This isn't so bad while the child is 
young, but upon reaching adolescence most people want some control over at 
least a portion of their lives. Parents. unaccustomed to this behavior, may 
not willingly relinquish control. By this time, parents have been fighting 
for this child for a long time and may distrust other's promises. Even in the 
Achieve Program we have parents who call often, making sure that their child 
is getting the needed help. The students resent it. A young man lost his 
backpack the other day and since it contained some expensive equipment, he 
called his folks to tell them. His dad immediately called to ask for help for 
his son. Because we keep copies of their notes from classes and could help in 
replacing some of the lost material, I called the young man, who exploded, 
saying, "Can't they ever let me take care of anything myself!"

<p>A student, twenty years of age, requested a counseling session for her 
parents. She did not want to have to call her mother every day. She wanted to 
be allowed to make some decisions on her own. It was explained to her that if 
she wanted that freedom, she had to accept responsibility as well. She had to 
do her own work and not ask for her parents' help in writing every paper, 
ironing her clothes, and solving her problems. She understood that and was 
really trying to become her own person. This was discussed with her parents, 
concluding that we didn't think they really wanted her in the nursing home 
with them. They laughed and said that wouldn't be so bad, but one wonders if 
there wasn't an element of truth in that statement. Intellectually, they want 
her to have a life of her own; emotionally, it is much harder to let go.

<p>Many people with learning disabilities have grown up having had most 
things done for them, thus they come to expect it. Parents who wrote their 
papers; mothers who cleaned their rooms and who never taught, indeed insisted,
that they learn how to do a wash or fix a salad, should not be surprised when 
the young adults have difficulty surviving on their own. Parents are teaching 
dependency when they do not teach their children to use a credit card or 
write a check. Many parents say that all of those years they were just 
struggling to get their children through high school but there is another 
three fourths of their lives after high school when other skills are needed.

<p>Socially, our youngsters tend to develop later than their peers. Because 
of language disorders they may be unable to express themselves well and may 
become the victims of other's jokes. They may have trouble understanding 
humor or sarcasm. Teasing may not be understood since children with LD tend 
to see things as black or white. Teachers need to understand these language 
disorders so they can offer the support needed to develop social skills.

<p>Many children with LD mature slower physically, developing balancing
skills long after their peer group has been bicycling or roller skating
for years. Jumping rope or playing ball are things one needs to be able
to do on the playground. To be chosen last for the team consistently is
just another way to have one's self esteem shattered.

<p>Some children cannot follow an issue to its logical conclusion. For 
instance, some time ago, we were told to expect an earthquake on a certain 
day. A student who had a note taker for his classes because of his difficulty 
with writing, asked: "If a major earthquake hits, where should I go to pick 
up my notes?" An untrained teacher might laugh, assuming the comment was a 
joke. Such a reaction could further diminish self-esteem.
<br>

<h3>EDUCATIONAL SERVICES</h3>
<p>When I was a resource room teacher, it was fun to teach. I had in my 
classes five or six children per period. The only children I had were the 
real LD children. They could be grouped by skill levels and taught 
accordingly. My older daughter became a learning disabilities master
teacher, but in her classroom, she had a mixture of brain injured,
emotionally disturbed, retarded, and LD children. Out of thirty-one
children she saw in the course of the day, seven were really LD. Although
she had an aide, her role was more like that of a traffic cop. A student
assigned to her room for twenty minutes to work on spelling could not be
expected to accomplish much among the turmoil of so many children and so
many disabilities. In my own district, the range of IQ scores of children
staffed into the "LD" classrooms range from 59 to 122 - a range from
retarded to superior. With multicategorical placements where all the
children with disabilities are in the same resource rooms, it is little
wonder that being placed in special education classes today is such 
a stigma.

<p>High school teachers are trained, not in general education, but in content
areas. A history or math teacher generally teaches math or history. They
are not trained in special education or how to modify the curriculum to allow 
the student with learning disabilities to demonstrate what they have learned. 
Many prefer not to have special education students in their classes, believing 
that they slow down the other students and limit their teaching efforts. Their 
fears may be valid in cases where classes consist of students with varied 
disabilities.

<p>High school resource rooms are often used for tutoring students through 
their classes so very little effort is made to increase their reading, math, 
writing or social skills. There is no single person supervising the 
educational needs of an individual child and special education teachers say 
they have a hard time getting any modifications for their students. It is 
incomprehensible that one can take a Graduate Record Exam, an LSAT or an MCAT 
to get into graduate school, law school or medical school, untimed, with a 
reader or a scribe, but a ninth grade student is not allowed to take his math 
test untimed. Many teachers believe giving such accommodations is unfair to 
other students, ignoring or ignorant of research to the contrary. In some 
better schools, a student may be allowed to take his/her test with the 
resource room teacher, but developing basic skills is not accomplished.

<p>Additionally, many schools begin to track students into courses of a 
certain level based on their skills as early as the ninth grade, so many LD 
students are tracked into high school vocational classes. While that may be 
fine for some, it severely limits the student who may have other, more 
advanced career goals. When a student is reading poorly, it is indeed rare 
for a guidance counselor to suggest that s/he take this course if s/he wants 
to be a surgeon, or that course if s/he wants to be an archaeologist, yet 
college programs turn out surgeons and archaeologists all the time. What is 
so troubling is that we give our students so few options; we neglect to tell 
them that they have choices of careers and that we can help them discover how 
to access them. Parents may fall into the same trap.

<p>The idea of "mainstreaming" was to give special education students a chance 
to be with their peers in classes where it was thought thev would do well in 
order to improve their social interactions. Many of our students are gifted 
in art, music, math or other areas. However, if we place a student in such a 
class and s/he has to read or write  and that is an area of  disability, the 
student will fail without certain modifications.  We cannot have it both ways;
we cannot proclaim the  value  of a social learning situation and then not 
give the student a means to achieve success. A major reason gifted learning 
disabled children cannot get into gifted classes at the elementary school 
level is because there is simply too much writing, so their giftedness is 
ignored because they can't write or spell well or fast enough. Such treatment 
of our nation's children is reprehensible and it goes on every day.

<p>As the result of this nearly constant emotional trauma, many of our kids 
just give up. "What is the point of going to a place where I am constantly 
told that I am lazy, disorganized and dumb?" they say. They may not do a 
homework assignment finding it easier to say they simply didn't do it rather 
than admit they couldn't do it. Not doing it is better than failing it. One 
student brought in a paper covered with red marks: "Another bloody one," she 
said. How many "bloody ones" can a person stand before they give up?
<br>

<h3>PARENT INVOLVEMENT</h3>
<p>In the 1940's mothers marched on Albany to get  services for their retarded 
children. So it has always been. Parents must lead the way for their children 
with learning disabilities. Parents must make sure the schools use appropriate 
modifications for our children; special education teachers cannot do it alone. 
Parents must say to the schools that if they are going to fail a student on a 
history exam because s/he misspelled some of the words, then don't call it a 
history test, call it a spelling test. Parents must insist the student be 
given an oral exam to let the student show what the student has learned in 
the class. After all, that is what the teacher should want to know, and it is 
the information on which the grade should be based. At the college 
level we have no problem with this and professors are quite willing to modify 
exams, test orally, and so forth. Why must our students suffer for so many 
years before they finally get the services they deserve?

<p>As parents of children with learning disabilities, we have had to do many 
things we never dreamed we would have to do. We have had to watch our beloved 
children suffer. We have had to read the law when we would rather be reading 
a novel. We have had to intervene with schools that were supposedly there to 
support our children, but too often hurt more than they helped. It is hard to 
forgive that. All we can do is the best we can in preparing our children for 
the world in which they must live. There is still time, no matter what the 
age of your child.
<br>

<h3>STRATEGIES FOR SPECIFIC PROBLEMS</h3>
<p>If your child has dysgraphia (difficulty with  handwriting) do not delay 
in making a computer available. Get the use of a computer written into his/her
IEP; that way the computer follows the child when s/he enters middle school.

<p>If your child has trouble spelling, provide a spelling ace. This device 
looks like a calculator and is worth its weight in gold to our students. It 
also allows them to use the vocabulary words they know, such as "enormous," 
instead of the one they can spell, "big."

<p>Most LD adolescents don't have many friends and don't know how to make 
friends. One student gets migraines on those rare occasions when he is asked 
to a party. His fear is very real. Join a club with your teenager so you are 
the protector until s/he can go it alone. It doesn't matter what kind of club,
anything you think you both might enjoy. Don't expect your child to jump at 
the chance at first.

<p>Help your child to be comfortable in social settings by taking him/her to 
restaurants. plays and other social gatherings. Teach him/her how to 
calculate a tip in a restaurant; how to greet others; the importance of a 
firm handshake; and having eye contact with another. We sometimes become so 
accustomed to our children's behavior that we fail to help them understand 
that standing too close to another may make them uncomfortable; we never ask 
about things like a person's age, weight, or how much money he
makes; we never brag about how much we have.

<p>If matching clothing is a problem, use magic markers to mark on the tag or
on a seam; if your child cuts out the tags - they irritate them you know - 
make a colored dot. Then take all the shirts that go with that blouse or pair 
of pants and put the same colored dot on them. Pick another magic marker and 
do the same with the rest of his/her clothes. That way you don't get plaids 
with stripes.

<p>Get maps of your town, state, the country and the world. Let him/her pick 
the route to  grandma's. When the news comes on, find those places on the map.
Show him/her where Haiti and Bosnia are. That can open a family discussion on 
whether or not we should have gone. Discuss the pros and cons of the 
elections. Lead and discuss in a safe environment and treat their opinions 
as politely as you would a stranger's.

<p>Help them to realize that they have options. If reading remains a
problem, order books on tape from your local library. If they can't add
well, develop their skills with a calculator. Teach them how to balance a
checkbook, to figure out the best buy on a stereo. Help them develop
conversational skills by talking to them and by providing gentle
feedback. In other words, help them to develop a life style as close to
that of others as possible.

<p>Teach them how to clean the bathroom, peel a potato, what to do in
case of an accident. As a family, teach time management. Put up calendars,
color coding for specific activities. On a weekly calendar, color code
homework periods, TV watching, when a paper is due and so on. If you do
this as a family, writing down the dance recital, a business meeting, an
out of town trip, it will become a natural part of their lives.

<p>Involve your child in decision making, starting with things like
topping for a pizza. In this way you establish that you respect his/her 
opinion while still being able to lead and direct him/her, and you give 
him/her experience in making decisions. When s/he has to make big decisions 
for him/herself, it won't be so frightening.

<p>Help your child understand his/her disability and put it in perspective. 
After all, 90% of them works just fine; it's that one little part that is so 
difficult to deal with. The more you accept the learning disability that
gets in the way of an otherwise great person, the more they will be able
to accept themselves. When they fully understand their own strengths and
weaknesses, they should be taught how to advocate for themselves
intelligently.

<p>Continue to work with the schools. Become a vocal advocate for children. 
We must change our educational system for these children so that it helps 
rather than hinders.

<p>Perhaps Tara, in a paper for a class in her doctoral program, best 
described what those with learning disabilities want in education. "If I were 
to develop a school today the motto would read: 'Above All Else, Do No Harm.' 
It would be a school where students would feel good about their abilities and 
would not be ridiculed for their weaknesses; a place where children would want
to be. Kinesthetic and tactile learning would be used as well as the 
traditional visual and auditory format to reach a greater number of children's
potentials. Hands on, experiential tasks would be used as well as group 
discussions in order to teach and motivate students. All children would be 
valued, regardless of social status, ethnicity, gender or disability. Peer 
tutoring would be used to show that all students have their individual 
strengths and weaknesses. In this school, there would be no more than twenty 
students per teacher. This is what I wish I had had. This is what my son will 
have. This is what I want for all children."

<p>There is a wonderful Chinese proverb which reads: "Parents should give 
their children two things, roots and wings." Make sure your children can fly.

<h3><a name="1"></a>Introduction</h3>

<p>The secondary school years represent a significant period of
transition for adolescents (Levine, 1988). Students move from
pupil-oriented elementary or lower schools to more content-driven
secondary school settings. Students with disorders of learning and/or
attention can find graduating with a high school diploma increasingly
problematic. Often, students with learning disorders lack the requisite
skills for success and therefore are not ready to meet academic  
expectations. Moreover, traditional classroom teaching techniques may not be
suited to their particular learning strengths and content affinities or
interests.

<p>It is becoming readily apparent that within the adolescent age group,
traditional criteria and definitions of learning disability fall far short of
capturing the actual phenomena that lead to academic failure. Many of the
learning and attentional problems of secondary school students simply do not
conform to the subtests of an IQ test or the parameters tapped by traditional
group achievement assessments. Consequently, many struggling adolescents &quot;fall
between the cracks&quot; of diagnostic insight. The reasons for their
difficulty are misconstrued, and commonly they are deprived of needed
services and accommodations.

<p>In this chapter we are advocating a substantial broadening of the concept of
learning disorder. Our paradigm shift entails the recognition and proper
interpretation of clinical phenomena that are readily observable in the
classroom. Some of these phenomena may reveal themselves on standardized tests
while others are simply observable within academic contexts. If a student's
patterns of learning and working reveal the presence of one or more such
phenomena, that adolescent should be thought to harbor a disorder that is 
impeding learning and/or academic productivity. The well established
phenomenon in and of itself is a legitimate cause for concern and a clear
indication for intervention. 

<p>Research results suggest many students with learning disorders lack the
necessary skills to succeed in general education settings (Deshler, Schumaker,
Alley, Warner, & Clark, 1982) perform below the 10th percentile on
standardized measures of academic achievement (Warner, Schumaker, Alley, &
Deshler, 1980); and lack many of the higher-order thinking skills required of
self-directed learners (Schumaker, Deshler, & Ellis, 1986). Furthermore,
increased requisites for students to receive a standard high school diploma
may include mastering a second language, completing a mandatory mathematics
course such as Algebra 1, and taking four years of language arts and sciences.
Such educational reforms undertaken to produce literate and thoughtful
citizens (e.g., GOALS 2000, Healthy People 2000) may potentially &quot;push-out&quot;
students who realize early in their high school career that they cannot attain
such standards tied to a &quot;normal&quot; diploma; and other types of diplomas
(attendance) are not worth staying in school. The educational and professional
options having a positive life-long impact on these developing adults may be
few for students with disorders of learning and attention.

<p>Results of the National Longitudinal Transition Study (NLTS) suggested one
option being used by students with high prevalence/low severity learning
disorders is dropping out (Wagner, 1991). Students with learning disabilities
had the second highest drop-out rate (32%) among exceptional children,
included in a representative national survey. The figures reported in the NLTS
are conservative estimates of the percentage of students with learning
disorders who drop-out because students with learning problems who do not meet
federal and state guidelines for learning disabilities are not included. The
Carnegie Council on Adolescent Development painted the following bleak
economic future for our country and for students who drop-out compared with
students who graduate with a high school diploma (cf Hamburg, 1992): 

<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 
   <dd>the rate of unemployment is double for students who drop-out; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) 
  <dd> over their lifetime the United States loses almost $260 
        billion in lost earnings and taxes; and 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
  <dd> a male high school drop-out earns $260,000 less and 
       contributes $78,000 less in taxes than males who graduate 
       with a diploma; a female drop-out earns $200,000 less and 
       contributes $60,000 less in taxes than females who graduate. 
</dl>

<p>Clearly, the percentage of students who drop out of
school will have enormous implications for the overall well-being of our
economy and of our society as a whole.

<p>Parents, adolescents, and educators are left grappling with significant
educational issues given the multitude of academic, social, and behavioral
problems that can be associated with learning and attentional disorders. What
are the roles of parents, special and general educators, and the students
themselves for managing the educational process in the secondary schools in
view of the wide range of factors contributing to academic success or failure?
What knowledge and skills should teachers have regarding these students so as
to manage more effectively their education, thereby increasing the probability
that students will experience success and remain in school? The magnitude of
these issues is increased given the mismatch between the rate at which school
districts are adopting and implementing inclusionary models when contrasted
with the speed (and quality?) in which pre- and inservice teachers are being
developed to successfully include all students in their classrooms. 

<p>The purpose of this chapter is to present a phenomenological perspective of
learning disorders. A phenomenological perspective emphasizes improving
classroom teachers' ability to recognize and describe behavior associated with
cognitive, behavioral, and social development of students with high
prevalence/low severity learning disorders. The purpose of such descriptions
is to enhance classroom teachers' ability to manage the education of students
with neurodevelopmental variations in the classroom (i.e., selection of
accommodations, implementation of direct interventions, modification of
classroom materials).

<h3><a name="2"></a>Recognition Of Adolescents' Patterns Of Neurodevelopmental Variation</h3>

<p>As yet, no definition of learning disabilities has produced a consensus
regarding what constitutes a learning disability (Levine, Hooper, Reed,
Sandler, Swartz, & Watson, 1993). All definitions of learning disabilities
remain relatively vague characteristics emphasizing what a learning disability
is not rather than what a learning disability is (Levine, et al, 1993).
Discrepancy formulas, for example, are often intended to exclude students with
mental retardation or &quot;slow learning&quot; but fail to shed light on the specific
forms of learning disability. This has lead to an over reliance on
standardized tests of intelligence and achievement to determine eligibility
for services without illuminating the wider array of learning disorders that
thwart the academic progress of adolescents. From our perspective,
well-educated classroom teachers can derive information about students'
learning disorders by analyzing their error patterns and observing their
behavior. Evidence gathered by classroom teachers, students, and parents can
supplement information gleaned from tests of intelligence and achievement,
thus, providing crucial information aiding in the process of recognizing
students' learning strengths and points of cognitive breakdowns. Importantly ,
we believe that the information provided by a well-educated teacher(s) can
significantly enhance the development and successful implementation of
educational management plans that lead to success for adolescents who are not
meeting classroom expectations and whose external defenses and face saving
tactics mask serious underlying deficits in academic skills, in cognitive
functions, and in the strategies needed to facilitate productivity in school.

<p>In this chapter, we will describe the following four common phenomena of
dysfunction that teachers and parents of adolescents need to be able to
recognize and manage in adolescents: 
<blockquote>
(a) reduced attentional strength;<br>
(b) insufficient memory capacity;<br>
(c) superficial comprehension; and<br>
(d) output problems. 
</blockquote>
The purpose of this section is not to make readers expert
&quot;diagnosticians&quot; but instead to provide examples of phenomena that often
obstruct the quest for success as students traverse the bridge from early
adolescence to early adulthood.

<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="3"></A>The Phenomena Associated With Reduced Attentional Strength</h3>

<p>The heightened demands of secondary school curricula can place a strain on
adolescents' capacity to  attend to the varied sources of input from teachers,
instructional materials, and peers. Secondary schools require students to
sustain cognitive effort and to concentrate selectively for extended periods.
Many adolescents may lack the attentional capacity to differentiate multiple
levels Of saliency in information and fend off the ever present threat of
mental fatigue. An adolescent's problem attending may be confined to certain
contexts (such as highly verbal settings) or the difficulty can be pervasive
and manifest itself globally as a deficit in one or more of the following
domains: (a) academic recognition; (b) behavioral control; and/or (c) social
cognition (their ability to establish and maintain relationships with peers
and adults [Levine, 1993]). Students with reduced attentional capacity in the
academic/cognitive domain may feel tired, bored, or restless unless they are
focusing on highly stimulating, romantically alluring subject matter or
activities. These students are likely to show signs of insatiability or such
an intense desire for highly pleasurable activities that they are unable to
delay gratification and focus on less exciting stimuli (such as a lecture in
social studies). Frequently, these students are prone to extremes of
distractibility and an inability to be highly selective in their attention.
They focus on irrelevant detail or distractions and seldom make good
determinations of what is important or salient in a task, or a text. For
example, in reading, they may have a poor sense of what is essential to
remember and what is relatively unimportant. Adolescents may also reveal
prominent cognitive impulsivity, a tendency to &quot;undertake tasks hastily and
without sufficient planning. Consequently, many of them are observed to &quot;do
things the hard way.&quot;

<p>Attentional problems in the academic-cognitive domain may or may not coexist
with attentional problems in the behavioral domain. Adolescents with
attentional behavior problems seem to be unable to allocate attentional
resources to previewing the consequences of their behavior, monitoring their
actions or gaining from positive or negative feedback. The dilemma for parents
and teachers is to decide if the behavioral problems are the primary issues to
be dealt with or if these behavioral problems are related to the student's
frustrations over failure in the classroom. Finally, attention problems that
manifest themselves in the domain of social cognition can reveal themselves as
a student's inability to determine and to deploy appropriately the social
skills needed to establish and maintain positive relationships with peers and
adults. Adolescents may voice inappropriate comments, impinge on other
people's &quot;space,&quot; and appear to not have a sense of their negative 
impact on other people.

<p>The attention deficits of adolescents may elude detection because their
manifestations are highly inconsistent. Their difficulties tend to wax and
wane. Consequently, during some hours, on some days, or even for weeks, an
affected student may have no trouble concentrating, only to deteriorate at any
time and for any interval for no apparent reason. Sometimes the test scores
over a semester portray such performance inconsistency all too vividly.
Some adolescents with attention deficits show no evidence of other forms of
learning disorders; however, the existence of attention deficits in isolation
is actually unusual. Most of these students have trouble with other aspects of
function, possibly including memory, higher order thinking skills, language,
motor function or social development Additionally, these students are
susceptible to a range of emotional problems, including depression and other
forms of affective disorder.

<p>It is important to recognize that adolescents with attention deficit are apt
to harbor notable strengths. In particular, many of them are highly creative
and entrepreneurial. Often they are experiential learners. That is, they are
likely to learn most from active participation and direct experience (&quot;on the
job training&quot;) rather than through the usual formal modes of academic
learning.

<h3><a name="4"></a>The Phenomena Associated With Limited Memory Capacity</h3>

<p>The memory demands of secondary school exceed the capabilities of many
students with learning disorders. Secondary school curricula place a premium
on students' cumulative recall of information (e.g., using information in May
that was learned in October), ability to summarize information for oral and
written presentations, differentiation of memory skills by content area and by
teacher expectations, and expectation for metamemory sophistication, or what
individual students know about memory and memory processes (Levine & Reed,
1992). Given the complexity of memory systems, there exist a range of memory
dysfunctions that predispose to academic difficulty. We will describe what we
believe to be four common adolescent disorders of memory.

<p><b>Inadequate Entry Into Short-Term Memory</b><br>
There are students who endure discrete weaknesses of short-term memory. Some
have difficulty &quot;recoding&quot; input by paraphrasing or abbreviating information
in lectures and textbooks to allow complex messages to &quot;fit&quot; within the very
limited capacity of short-term storage. Others have highly specific deficits
with the registration of specific modalities of data into short-term memory.
Thus, an adolescent may have problems entering visual-spatial information
(e.g., from a map), sequential data (e.g., the steps in a math process) or
verbal information (e.g., oral directions from the teacher). Still others fail
to employ effective rehearsal strategies (visual-imaging, sub-vocalization,
and self testing) to facilitate and strengthen entry of information into
short-term memory. These students may have trouble studying for tests and
acquiring new information or skills during class sessions.

<p><b>Active Working Memory Dysfunction</b><br>
Active working memory enables a student to &quot;hold on to&quot; different components
or procedures within a task while working on that task. Students with
dysfunctions of active working memory are likely to forget what they are doing
while they are doing it. Active working memory is vital during extended
periods of writing, while performing mathematics computations, and while
reading. An affected adolescent may lose the essence of the beginning of a
chapter while reading the subsequent sections. He or she may lose track of a
process amid a mathematics problem. The student may forget an idea while
trying to recall a specific spelling word or punctuation rule. Students with
active working memory dysfunctions become understandably discouraged and
anxious in school. They often have serious problems with test-taking and seem
more competent than their performance would indicate.

<p><b>Slow And/Or Imprecise Retrieval Memory</b><br>
Much of the secondary school curriculum demands rapid and exact recall of
facts and processes. When a student is called on in class, he or she generally
has three seconds to retrieve a response approximating the answer the teacher
requires. During tests, be it an essay test or a multiple choice/true false 
test, there is a steady need for the rapid recall of previously learned
material. While writing, when time does not allow for substantive revision
(e.g., timed exam), students must engage in simultaneous retrieval of content
knowledge and rules governing written expressions (i.e., they must quickly
recall spelling, punctuation, capitalization, vocabulary, facts, ideas and
letter formations). Some students simply cannot meet this chaUenge and exhibit
a chronic abhorrence of writing (Levine, Oberklaid, & Meltzer, 1981). Others
are delayed in mathematics because of slow or imprecise recall of the facts or
algorithms (i.e., procedures, such as how to reduce a fraction); especially
when they must recall facts and maintain the flow of the algorithms nearly
simultaneously (Levine, Lindsay, & Reed, 1992).

<p>The ultimate attainment for retrieval memory is automatization, the capacity
to recall facts or procedure: instantaneously with virtually no expenditure of
mental effort. Some secondary school students are simply poorly automated;
nothing at all is automatically accessible from memory. If reading decoding is
not automatic for a secondary school student his comprehension suffers badly.
When math facts or computational rules are not automatic, it is hard to
succeed in algebra.

<p><b>Poor Pattern Recognition</b><br>
There are some students who have trouble recognizing the patters that keep
recurring within a subject area. They have trouble identifying themes or
processes that keep re-appearing over an academic year, or within a particular
subject domain. To them, information and class work appears fragmented and
lacking in cohesion. For example, in mathematics it may be hard for them to
read a word problem and recognize a pattern within the language of the problem
that should cue a particular process. In reading, these students fail to
recognize a theme, image, or character trait that emerges repeatedly in
various guises or contexts. Such weaknesses of pattern recognition memory
ultimately take their toll on academic performance at the same time that they
diminish significantly the likelihood that a student will find the content of
school particularly interesting.

<p>Embedded within the dysfunctions of memory is the ever present role of
attention. At any age, but possibly more so in adolescence, attention and
memory can interact to potentiate more insidious forms of learning disorders.
Are the learning problems manifested in class attributable only to attention
deficits? To only memory deficits? Or are the attention deficits undermining a
student's memory capacity or vice versa?

<h3><a name="5"></a>The Phenomena Associated With Superficial Understanding</h3>

<p>Adolescents with learning disorders may proceed through secondary education in
a state of mild to moderate, and sometimes even severe, confusion. These are
students who have trouble grasping and building cognitive bridges between the
facts, ideas, concepts, an procedures learned within and across content areas.
Those who appear to gain only a surface level Understanding of information may
possess hidden language deficits, poor higher-order cognitive skills,
including weak formation of concepts and an over reliance on top-down
processing, or they may be passive in their approach to learning.

<p><b>Adolescents With Poor Language Processing</b><br>
The academic demands for verbal comprehension, verbal reasoning, and verbal
expression explode in volume, density, complexity, and abstractness during
students' transition from early adolescence to adolescence (Montgomery, 1992).
Teenagers with language deficits can manifest gaps in a number of processes
and abilities assumed to be in place by secondary school.

<p>Adolescents with poor language processing may have difficulty following
complex instructions and interpreting extended verbal explanations (i.e.,
lectures). They commonly harbor basic weaknesses in semantics, sentence
processing, and/or the capacity to deal with large chunks of language
discourse. These students may reveal delays in their reading comprehension,
major difficulties in foreign language acquisition, problems as well in the
verbal aspects of mathematics, including the deciphering of word problems and
the mastery of technical vocabulary (Levine et al., 1992). They are prone to
serious problems in courses that rely heavily on reading for content (such as
history).

<p>There are some adolescents who can process language adequately but at a slow
pace; they have trouble &quot;keeping up&quot; with the rapid constant onslaught of
verbal communication in the classroom. Additionally, many of these students
have a weak metalinguistic sense, an incomplete understanding of how language
works. They are apt to be confused over parts of speech, grammatical
construction, and other formal features of language. In secondary schools
there is a heightened need for students to be able to process abstract
figurative language, to comprehend textbooks containing densely packed
verbally encoded ideas, m use verbal reasoning skills, and to learn a foreign
language (Levine & Reed 1992). The critical role of language progression
during adolescence is poorly appreciated. There exists a dearth of appropriate
diagnostic tools and a lack of well trained professionals with a background in
adolescent language development (both normal and dysfunctional). Moreover,
research into the language disabilities of secondary school students has been
sparse.

<p><b>Adolescents With Incomplete Conceptualization</b><br>
Concepts are broad ideas that categorize the phenomena that keep recurring in
any subject area. Examples include: &quot;balanced equation&quot; in mathematics;
&quot;photosynthesis&quot; in science; &quot;right wing&quot; in a social studies class;
&quot;conjugation&quot; in a foreign language; and &quot;sonata form&quot; in a music class. Some
students struggle in vain with the concepts in one or more secondary school
subject areas. In particular, they are likely to have trouble with the
ever-growing array of abstract concepts, those concepts that do not contain
any direct sensory references. Such students are often described by their
teachers as overly &quot;concrete.&quot; Their conceptual understanding is incomplete or
tenuous - They may over-rely on prototypes, believing (or hoping) that if they
can cite an example, they must understand the concept. A student might know
that the United States is a democracy without really grasping the components
of government that constitute the concept of &quot;democracy.&quot; In mathematics, a
student may over-rely on rote memory, deploying a so-called &quot;algorithmic
approach&quot; to problem solving. She or he may be able to solve equations without
really knowing what equations are. Such tenuous grasping inevitably leads to
academic deterioration.

<p><b>Adolescents With Extreme Top-Down Processing</b><br>
Students who are extreme in their top-down processing are often very creative
and imaginative. However, they have difficulty focusing on relevant details.
They keep imposing or superimposing their own ideas, rich associations, and
values over what they are hearing, observing, reading, or discussing.
Adolescents who over rely on top-down processing are likely to have difficulty
in highly convergent subject domains, those courses where there tends to be
only one correct answer to a question or only a single acceptable
interpretation of a situation. These adolescents often do poorly on multiple
choice tests and can be very distressed when they receive their SAT scores.

<p><b>Adolescents With Passive Learning Approaches</b><br>
Some adolescents are conspicuously inactive in their approach to learning.
Within the classroom their minds seem to be inert. They fail to associate new
information with what they already know. They tend to be non-elaborative in
their thinking and speaking in school. Very little intellectual content is of
any interest to them. Their understanding is constricted, and they tend to
equate learning with memorization. Some of these students with passive
learning approaches may show attentional dysfunction as well; that is, they
seem to have too little mental energy to partake actively in the learning
process.

<hr width="75%">


<h3><a name="6"></a>The Phenomena Associated With Reduced Or Inefficient Output</h3>

<p>The expectations of secondary school curriculum demand ever increasing
quantities of self-directed academic productivity. Adolescents must not only
learn to learn, they must also work and learn to work! The demands of output
include increasing amounts of a wide-range of writing genres, such as
argumentative/persuasive essays, compare and contrast formats, original works
of fiction and non-fiction, each emphasizing students' ability to analyze,
synthesize, and evaluate differing perspectives about history, literature, and
culture. These important higher-order cognitive functions can stress the still
developing or yet-to-be developed systems, that comprise students' attentional
strength, memory capacity, comprehension level, problem-solving facility,
organizational function abilities, etc. This section will describe these
common developmental output demands placed on adolescents.

<p><b>Written Output Failure</b><br>
There may be no more complex school-related activity than writing (Levine,
1987). The myriad of interdependent and recursive cognitive processes and
sub-processes required to represent knowledge on paper (see Flower & Hayes,
1981; Hayes & Flower, 1986; Levine et al., 1993; Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1986)
may make it the most cognitively expensive performance-based task; yet it is
the single most commonly used activity to evaluate competence in secondary
schools, if not at all grade levels. Presently, schools are adopting
performance based assessment tests comprised of open-ended items that students
respond to by &quot;thinking on paper,&quot; where generating a product (correct answer)
is not weighed as heavily as the process (procedures, thought processes) used
to arrive at the product. Such forms of evaluation will no doubt discriminate
against students with &quot;output problems&quot;' by underestimating their competency.
These adolescents often can partake of activities requiring high-order
thinking skills, but they may need to express these skills through
non-traditional means, such as producing a piece of art work that captures the
essence of a poem instead of a written essay that reflects an interpretation
of the poem.

<p>Developmental written output failure can be associated with various underlying
dysfunctions. Students whose writing is labored, slow, and poorly legible may
have graphomotor dysfunction which manifests itself in various forms of fine
motor incoordination during writing that make it difficult for their fingers
to keep pace with the flow of their ideas (Levine, et al, 1981). The effort of
transcribing thoughts to paper can functionally undermine thinking and the use
of sophisticated language during the writing process (Levine et al., 1993).
Written output failures are also exhibited by students with memory
dysfunctions (see above), language difficulties (see below), and
organizational problems (see below). In addition, the higher-order deficits,
such as in problem-solving ability, social cognition, planning and revising
strategies, can make it difficult for students to select topics and produce
coherent and cohesive text (Hayes & Flower, 1986). Disorders of written output
can have a profound psychological effect on an adolescent who is prone to
become discouraged and anxious about performance in school - perhaps so
anxious about school performance as to cease being productive at all.

<p><b>Expressive Language Dysfunction</b><br>
There are many students who have difficulty meeting the high expectations for
expressive language fluency (of which written output is one form). Many
language processing activities require the apportionment of capacity from
different cognitive processes (Montgomery, 1992). Classroom teachers can
recognize adolescents who may have expressive language dysfunction by
observing students who have difficulty communicating their ideas during class
discussions, on paper, or both. These adolescents are at-risk for academic and
social problems (Montgomery, 1992). Montgomery (1992) stated that research
results are mixed as to delineating causal mechanisms underlying language
impairments in adolescents. Deficits in expressive language have been
associated with difficulties in social conversational abilities, word
retrieval during conversation and written expression, and the cohesiveness and
coherence of narrative text. Affected students may live in constant
apprehension over the prospect of being called upon in class!

<p><b>Organizational Problems</b><br>
Secondary schools require adolescents to be extremely efficient and effective
organizers of time and  materials; textbooks, homework, pencils, papers, pens
must all arrive at 6-7 different classrooms at the appointed times to be used
in classes led by teachers with different expectations for performance and
behavior. Adolescents can have temporal-sequential deficits, or an inability
to estimate, allocate, stage, and monitor progress towards completion of
activities, that undermine efficient management of time. Many adolescents with
temporal sequential deficits have trouble making use of stepwise approaches to
task completion; they try to think of what to do as they are in the process of
completing a task. Instead, students need to plan or preview what the final
product may look like, generate multiple alternative strategies that could be
used to complete the task, select one strategy, start the task, monitor
progress and quality of the product, and modify the strategy or select another
when it is no longer facilitating goal attainment. Adolescents can often
benefit from an adult or a peer who will provide &quot;expert scaffolding,&quot; or the
provision of help, for the purpose of structuring the timing and sequencing of
activities (see Palinscar & Brown, 1984). The goal should be to model these
covert cognitive processes as approached for the student to utilize
him/herself during problem-solving tasks.

<p>Other students will experience problems organizing materials for school.
Notebooks, desks at home, lockers, assignment journals, and other &quot;props&quot; are
simply difficult to manage. These students &quot;lose&quot; many possessions, have
difficulty knowing and/or organizing materials to take home or bring back to
school, and surround themselves with hopelessly disorganized work areas and
lockers.

<h3><a name="7"></a>Summary</h3>

<p>Some phenomena that impair learning and attention in adolescents have been
presented in a compartmentalized, linear fashion. In reality these phenomena
associated with negative school-related outcomes never operate in isolation.
Importantly from a developmental perspective, all cognitive processes are
highly interdependent and can influence each other's development and
refinement. For example, an early adolescent may possess attentional strengths
but weak memory capacity during middle school that over time functionally
undermines existent attentional strength. This student's inability to continue
to use developed attentional processes during middle school may result in weak
attentional strength and reduced memory capacity in high school. In fact, by
the time students reach secondary school-age it may be very difficult, if not
futile, to identify single dimensions of cognition that cause learning
problems. That is, is a student's negative performance related only to
deficits in attention, memory, language, or a combination of two, or a
combination of these? Furthermore, a unitary explanation for learning and
attention deficits implies a single treatment strategy.

<p><b>Management</b><br>
What are teachers, parents, and adolescents left to do regarding the
management of the phenomena underlying underachievement given the complexity
of these learning and attentional disorders and the limitations of
standardized tests for illuminating subtle and sometimes hidden learning
problems? First, the phenomenological approach to learning disorders requires
teachers to be well-educated in adolescent cognitive and social development.
Teachers need to be keen developmentalists especially about the phenomena
relating to areas such as attention, memory, language, higher-order cognition,
and output. Second, well-educated teachers should apply this knowledge using
observational tools to record prospectively relevant dimensions of
performance. Additionally, teachers should engage their knowledge in skillful
analyses of students' error patterns. Teachers can gather their evidence,
including reports from the parent(s) and the student, and draw inferences
regarding the functional status of a struggling adolescent. Third, teacher(s),
parents and students need to collaborate in a process of formulating,
monitoring, and evaluating the effectiveness of educational management
techniques that lead to academic achievement, social skill development, and
enhanced self-concept. Optimal management must include &quot;demystification&quot; of
the phenomena associated with negative school-related outcomes and may include
use of accommodations that &quot;by-pass&quot; the problematic areas and/or direct
cognitive interventions that instruct students about the covert processes
underlying school-related outcomes.

<p><B>Demystification Of The Phenomena</b><br>
Educating students about their learning strengths, weaknesses, and affinities
is based on the premise that students must begin to understand the mysterious
processes underlying learning and the nature of their differences as a
precondition of intervention. Students' inclusion in the process of management
grows in importance as they grow older; it is futile to attempt to intervene
in this age range if adolescents do not have a firm grasp on the nature of
their cognitive assets and shortcomings (Levine, 1993).
The purpose of demystification is to educate students about their own unique
patterns of ability using non-threatening, non-moralistic, and jargon-free
vocabulary and examples. It is hoped that such teaching can relieve students
of negative attributions for their success and failure in the classroom and
fantasies (&quot;I'm dumb!&quot;) about themselves commonly associated with low self-
esteem, feelings of hopelessness, and loss of motivation in children and
adolescents with learning and attentional disorders (Borkowski, Weyhing, &
Carr, 1988; Sabatino, 1982; Swartz, Purdy, & Fullingim, 1983).

<p><b>Accommodating To The Phenomena</b><br>
One component of the educational management plan may be the 
formulation of &quot;by-pass&quot; techniques. The purpose of using 
by-pass techniques is to change the nature of tasks to minimize the 
negative impact of inadequately developed cognitive processes 
underlying school-related outcomes (i.e., long division, writing). 
Such techniques demand flexibility and compassion on the part of
teachers. Generally, accommodations take the following forms: 
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 
<dd>rate adjustment, or modifying the speed in which information is 
taken in and the speed in which output is expected to be produced; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<dd>volume adjustment. or modifying the ideational density of 
information taken in or amount expected to be produced; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<dd>complexity adjustment, or modifying the number of steps to be 
remembered within a procedure, reducing the linguistic demands of 
instruction; and 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
<dd>devices, or the use of props (i.e., calculators, word processors).
</dl>
Instructional decisions regarding the use of accommodations, individually or
in combination with others, is a function of the student's profile of
neurodevelopmental strengths and weaknesses and the teacher's understanding of
their interactions with components of specific tasks.

<p>An adolescent who produces very little written output on paper, but who is
very eloquent and sophisticated in her verbal output during discussions, may
benefit from &quot;writing her paper&quot; on a tape recorder and then transcribing it
to paper. If this by-pass technique is not possible, the teacher can reduce
the complexity of the writing task by encouraging the student to write the
initial draft of her paper without regard to spelling, punctuation, and
grammatical structure of the sentences and paragraphs. The teacher will then
evaluate only the quality of the ideas contained in the initial draft; the
teacher will evaluate other mechanical aspects of the essay in later drafts.
This process may require the teacher to make adjustments in her expectations
for when the student will turn in the final paper. But, the teacher will be
evaluating an essay that more closely approximates this student's competence.

<p><b>Interventions To Strengthen Weaknesses</b><br>
Intervention research with children and adolescents with learning and
attentional disorders has had a mixed history. Kavale (1990, 1993) laments the
past shortcomings of intervention research because &quot;... little agreement has
emerged about the value of an intervention much less insight in how and why it
works&quot; (p.6 [Kavale, 1990]). Teachers do not know which students will benefit
from participation in intensive intervention programs. This problem is
primarily due to researchers who provide inadequate descriptions of the
samples of students they are studying and the lack of well-controlled
experimental settings. The former limits generalizability of findings to
individual students while the latter limits transferability of teaching
strategies to classrooms.

<p>Regardless of such a less than optimistic perspective on the effectiveness of
direct interventions and intervention research, a growing empirical knowledge
base suggests that students with learning and attentional disorders can
benefit from direct instruction in the covert cognitive processes (such as
strategy use) underlying many school-related outcomes (i.e. , reading
comprehension, narrative story writing). The purpose of direct interventions
is to improve students' self-regulation of information processing, behavior,
and personal relationships. For example, a student with developmental written
output failure may possess relatively intact attention, memory, language
skills, and higher-order cognition based on his teacher's classroom
observations, analyses of error patterns, and student self-reports. The
student's weakness may lie in his tenuous understanding of the writing process
(planning, translating, reviewing) and/or how his unique neurodevelopmental
profile of strengths and weaknesses interacts with writing tasks (e. g. ,
interaction between active working memory and transcribing ideas at the same
time he is trying to use rules of syntax).

<p>The adolescent student may benefit from direct instruction in the writing
process through a cognitive behavioral writing intervention. The purpose of
the intervention is to improve the student's knowledge and skillful use of
planning strategies (idea generation and organization), decisions about the
time line for translating ideas into sentences and paragraphs (initially
attending to meaning then attending to other text features such as
punctuation, spelling and grammar), and reviewing strategies (evaluating the
cohesiveness and coherence of the text, comprehensibility of the text, and
revision strategies that improve the quality of the essay).

<p>First, the teacher needs to demystify the student about his profile of
strengths and weaknesses and then introduce the writing strategy. Second, the
teacher should make covert thought processes underlying the writing process
overt by verbalizing his thoughts and decisions during his modeling of how to
write an essay. Initially, the student is likely to overtly verbalize his
thoughts and decisions and over time subvocalize his writing strategies.
Finally, the student should self-regulate the writing process with no overt
behavior. Depending on the status of the student, this process may take weeks,
months, or the whole school year.

<p><b>Conservation Of Adolescents</b><br>
A byproduct of a phenomenological perspective for recognizing and managing
adolescent underachievement has at the core of its philosophy the conservation
of individual variation among students. It assumes that all adolescents want
to succeed in high school and that they want to be successful adults. It is
important to recognize that the abilities needed for success as an adult
differ markedly from those functions that are requisites for accomplished
performance in secondary school. Moreover, the adult world values and needs
diverse kinds of minds. We must overcome the irrational drive to homogenize
young people. Teachers, parents, clinicians and policy makers must strive to
preserve developmental differences rather than to punish or discriminate
against them by imposing needlessly rigid expectations during a critical
period when maturing nervous systems are working overtime to define their
individuality.

<h2 align=center>Support Groups for Adolescents with Learning Disabilities</h2>

<h3>by Harrison Sylvester</h3>

<p>My name is Harry Sylvester. The reason I do support groups for people
with learning disabilities is that I am very learning disabled myself.
My disability is in written language. My reading is at the 30th percentile
and my written expression is virtually zero. Because of these conditions,
I have lots of school failure experience. The kids that I work with can
identify with that very nicely. I have been doing this work for about 7
or 8 years and I have done all kinds of different groups. I've done substance
abuse, correctional institutions, and school groups. I have also done adolescent
and adult groups for people with learning disabilities. These ideas are
some of the things that have worked for me and I hope they will be helpful
to others. This paper is an edited transcript of a tape I made. The tape
is also available. </p>

<p>The purpose of this discussion is not how to run a support group. There
is lots of literature available with basic information on support groups.
I see this as information on how support groups can work for people with
learning disabilities, their specific needs, and things to talk about.
Everybody has the same problems with learning disabilities and the learning
disability is the same whether you're an adult, an adolescent, or a child.
The focus of this discussion is adolescents, although many of the needs
and suggestions are right for children and adults with learning disabilities
as well. Adolescents are having problems getting their education and they
are having social problems. 

<hr width="50%">

<h3 align=center>Getting Started</h3>

<p>One of the things that we all need to do is to discover that we are
not alone in having learning disabilities. I think one thing that happens
is all of us with learning disabilities haven't met other people with learning
disabilities so we feel quite alone. It's a wonderful experience when we're
in a room full of people and everybody is learning disabled and they're
talking about the same things you've had trouble with and experiences you've
had. It's quite different to learn about other people with learning disabilities
from this kind of experience than it is to have somebody tell you that
10% of the population is learning disabled. There's lots of people out
there and it's hard for us to relate to the fact that, yes indeed, there
are people with learning disabilities, and a lot of them. We can't begin
to really understand that until we start talking with other people who
have learning disabilities.

<p>When I meet with a group of adolescents the first thing I like to do
is have the group members tell what their names are, where they're from,
and what grade they're in. It's nice for them to do something that, is
very non-threatening and it starts them talking and participating in the
group.

<p>It is important to establish confidentiality at the beginning. By that
I mean that we can talk about a lot of things in the group, we can learn
from them, but we just can't take people's names away from the group. The
intent is that everybody learns that we do not put names to any of the
information we hear. With adolescents, one of the things we want to do
is to make sure that the parents are involved. My suggestion is that the
first meeting be conducted for both the adolescents and the parents. It
is a good way for the parents to know who the facilitators are and what
the adolescents are expected to do. This will make the parents less nervous
about who their children are working with and what they will be doing.

<h3 align=center>Suggested Topics and Comments</h3>

<p>These ideas of things to talk about in a support group are good, but
the very best ideas are things that the group itself might like to talk
about, so the facilitator should always be exploring, &quot;Is there anything
that you'd like to talk about or any particular subject that you might
be interested in?&quot;

<p>Comment: I find it interesting that when you have a group of learning
disabled people together, there is all kinds of knowledge about learning
disabilities in that group. I think it is the facilitator's job to get
that information from the group and get everybody participating in discussing
it. On a particular subject you may find a little bit of information from
one person and something else from somebody else and as everybody talks
about it, you'll find that there's an awful lot of information right in
the group. As a matter of fact, I feel that it's a group of people that
are learning disabled who are really the experts on the subject. With a
little bit of help it is amazing the kind of information that will come
out of a group. I think I have learned more about learning disabilities
from groups than I have from other sources. 

<p><b>Special Education Services
<br></b>Most of the adolescents are receiving some type of special education
and they need to talk about this. You can have them say if they're getting
special ed services and talk about whether they think the services are
helping.

<p>Comment: With these kinds of things you can get everybody to participate.
The kids will also talk about what it's like to receive special education
services. They will tell you that there are all kinds of things involved
with the resource room; whether they like to go to the resource room, what
the other kids think about it, whether they're called dummies because they
go to a different kind of class, if they're thought of as being retarded,
how it feels to get these kinds of services, and if it helps. It's kind
of surprising sometimes the kinds of things that they'll tell you. Some
of them will be very satisfied and think they are getting somewhere and
others will have some real doubts and some very serious feelings about
the special ed services.

<p><b>Diagnostic Evaluations
<br></b>Another thing to talk about is whether they've been evaluated.

<p>Comment: Many of them will have been evaluated and they won't realize
it. Most of them, even if they have been evaluated, don't understand what
the evaluation shows and what it might mean. This is an area that I think
they need to have some help with. This can be arranged by having them get
someone to go over their evaluation with them like the school counselor
or maybe a parent or somebody from LDA who is knowledgeable about evaluations.
By the time they're in junior high school and high school these kids need
to know what their specific learning disabilities are, how they affect
their education, and what might be some good coping strategies to help
with the difficulties they have. It's kind of nice for them to talk about
this together because they begin to see that all of the kids have similar
types of problems and they don't feel quite so alone. By talking with each
other, they're going to help each other cope with some of these things.

<p><b>Types of Learning Disabilities - Academic Problems
<br>Small Motor Problems or Dysgraphia.</b> The kids don't usually understand
about small motor problems or dysgraphia. This is really something that
they need to talk about, and quite extensively, because it does bother
a high percentage of them. They often think that the reason that they can't
write well is because they're messy, they don't pay attention, and they
don't try. It's kind of a different concept to them that they have small
motor problems and they can't get their hands to do the writing the way
they want them to or writing gets to be a very cognitive process for them,
very time consuming and hard.

<p>Comment: Just this one subject is something that could go for a whole
meeting because it's very involved and they will have enough experience
with it that they can share. Have each one of them say if they have these
kinds of problems, what they're like, and what the ways are that they have
found to cope with these kinds difficulties. I find that not only the kids
don't understand about dysgraphia, but most adults don't either. Teachers
don't understand and this comes as a surprise to the kids. It's kind of
a relief to them to know what these kinds of difficulties are, that they
are not because they aren't trying, that there is a reason for them, and
it has a name. It is also a relief to know that there are lots of people
who have the same kinds of troubles.

<p><b>Executive Function Problems.</b> These kids have what we call executive
function difficulties. That means keeping their lives organized, getting
their work done, and making school come out right. One of the first things
that I do when I start to talk about this is I'll ask all of the kids if
they have a locker. Of course all their hands go up because everyone does
have a locker. The next question is, &quot;Do any of you have a mess in
your locker right now?&quot; They'll all start to laugh and everybody's
hands go back up again because most of us who have learning disabilities
have red trouble keeping things organized and getting things done. I'll
describe how the locker looks; most of them will have 6 to 8 inches of
paper crammed in the bottom with a bunch of books and stuff thrown in on
top, everything will be accumulating and nothing will be taken care of.
There'll be homework papers that are lost in the heap, assignments that
never got home to be done, and papers that never got passed in because
they got lost. All these same thing also usually apply to bookbags.

<p>Another part of the same kind of thing is that kids have real problems
with time schedules at school - getting to the right class at the right
time. They will sometimes get it all figured out so they can get around
right , but they still will have troubles having the right books and homework
with them. One of the things they will often do is carry every single one
of their books in their bookbags at all times and never go near a locker
because they can't really handle shifting things around and making sure
things work out right. With time problems, what happens is that they'll
finally get a schedule worked out so that they know where they're supposed
to be and get it working all right and then all of a sudden school might
run on a different schedule because of an assembly or something. This throws
them all off and they get lost and don't know where they're supposed to
be and they can't figure it out.

<p>Comment: The kids will start to talk about these kinds of things and
then you can get them to start talking about ways that they can help eliminate
some of these problems. It's important that they think up the ways to do
it themselves. We can't give them a recipe for organizing their school
work. They need to work out a way that's going to work for them individually
and they will start thinking about ways that they can keep their assignments
organized, make sure they get home and that they get their work done and
get it back to school the next day, and that they get it to the right class
and passed in. They will think about ways to get the right books to the
right class at the right time. All of these things are real problems for
them and they are often surprised to find that other kids are having the
same trouble. It's very good for them to start talking to each other about
these kinds of things. It makes a good topic because most everybody is
involved and they all realize that they need to do something about it,
and they are quite willing to talk about it.

<p><b>Language Problems, Academic.</b> There are many things that need
to be talked about associated with language. Questions to be asked include:
What kinds of trouble did you have learning to read? What is your reading
level? Are you making any gains? How is your spelling? I find that the
spelling seems to be a common denominator. Everybody that has language
problems, I think, has problems with spelling.

<p>Another thing that needs to be talked about is the math part of it.
I've been noticing that those who have trouble with language are apt to
have problems with early math or arithmetic. They seem to go hand in hand
so it looks to me like you have to have the same skills to learn language
as you do to learn early math. For instance, learning multiplication tables
and addition facts is a kind of short term memory work. To add, subtract,
multiply and divide, you need sequencing skills and these are somehow related
to language difficulties.

<p>I see that a big change happens in math when you get to Algebra I. Many
people who have had real difficulties in arithmetic and can't seem to do
accurate work, and can't seem to learn, when they get to algebra they will
be very successful. It might turn out to be an area that they're very strong
in. Sometimes those who can do algebra can do geometry and trigonometry
and do very well in math. So people have to be looking for these kinds
of things. I also notice that sometimes those who have been very successful
in arithmetic, get into high school and all of a sudden they are failing
algebra I and they don't have the faintest idea what's happened to them.
Everybody around them is saying, &quot;Well, you are a real, good, smart
person, if you paid attention you could do the algebra. You can do everything
else.&quot; It's the same story that we were told about language - if we
tried and paid attention we'd be able to do it. People sometimes don't
have as much understanding about the fact that we can have as much difficulty
in advanced math as we do language.

<p>I have seen a lot of people who have had a lot of difficulty with their
education when they got in high school because they couldn't do the math.
This has sometimes interrupted their high school education and prevented
a lot of people from going on to college, simply because they don't understand
what happened to them. They have a weakness in math and don't get good
instruction to help them learn. They don't understand that it's not their
fault.

<p>Comment: I try to tell the kids that it isn't their fault and that they
haven't gotten the kind of instruction needed to help them learn. It' s
sometimes a different concept for them that the difficulties that they
have had in school really aren't their fault. They are having these difficulties
because of the way they are &quot;set up&quot;. It might be that they haven't
had appropriate instruction and maybe the failure isn't theirs, maybe it's
someone else's. Sometimes these kids haven't thought about that before.

<p>These are some issues that relate to academics and some ideas about
getting started talking about them.

<p><b>Types of Learning Disabilities - Social Problems
<br></b>The other kinds of things that I work with the adolescents on are
social issues. I think that sometimes the social issues may be as important
as the academic, or even more important. The kinds of things that we start
talking about are things like: &quot;How do you make out having friends?
Do you have a lot of friends and do you have a lot of things that you do
socially?&quot; Do you think that you could do better in this area?&quot;

<p><b>Language and Social Problems.</b> Those of us having language difficulty
are apt to have difficulty making friends or maintaining friendships. I
think that one of the things that we need to talk about is the ability
to express ourselves and use language. For those of us that have difficulties,
I see them falling into several areas. One is that we are slow in processing
language so it is difficult for us to keep up with other people's language.
This makes it hard for us to keep a good conversation going. Some of us
have difficulty thinking of words and what we want to say, also making
it hard for us to keep a conversation going. Others have no problem getting
language out. It seems to run out of them forever and it's very fast and
it goes and goes and goes and sometimes it doesn't very much.

<p>Comment: These problems have to be dealt with. I think it is important
for a facilitator to recognize these problems and not be at all bashful
about addressing them in the group situation. For instance, if somebody
is running on and on and on and it's something they do all the time, they
may not be aware that they are doing it. The facilitator can be of a big
help to people to stop the whole thing and point out exactly what is happening
so they will know. The facilitator can also help those who have problems
in speaking. They have to be given plenty of time and people have to be
patient and listen. Everybody has to have a chance to speak. No matter
what their difficulty is everybody has to be patient so everybody has a
good chance.

<p>As a group we can look at our expressive language difficulties and start
to understand them better. Some of the things we can look at are: how we
make out one on one; can we talk in a small group where everybody is talking
a little bit slower; do we have difficulty in a larger group where there
are a lot of people talking. The group itself is a good place for people
to practice. This is what we need to do. We need to talk, learn to talk,
and talk about talking. The group is a good safe place to do this. Everybody
in the group can talk about their particular difficulties and maybe even
have suggestions about things that help.

<p>I find that almost everybody who has expressive language difficulties
gets a lot worse if they are stressed. Of course as we try these kinds
of things and we're in situations where we're talking about things that
we have a lots of feelings about, stress is running very high. As we begin
to understand that this is happening to us, we can get those stress levels
down. This helps us a lot.

<p><b>Eye Contact.</b> Many of us have difficulty with eye contact. It
kind of drives people crazy when we don't look at them when we're talking
to them, What is happening to some of us is that we're struggling so hard
with the language that we don't have enough capacity to look at someone's
face or it's so distracting to look at their face that we can't do both
at the same time. It's very difficult sometimes to get our language up
and out and look at somebody while we're doing it, but we can do a lot
about these things when we start to understand them and work on them.

<p><b>Executive Function and Social Problems.</b> Problems with executive
function skills are another thing that bothers us in social situations.
These are the same executive function skills that are necessary for us
to succeed in school. One of the problems is that we have a poor concept
of time. Because of this we don't do a good job of meeting people when
we say we're going to and we don't do a good job of getting things done
that we say we'll do. This causes us all kinds of problems. Another part
of the executive function problems is that our rooms tend to be a mess
and our things are not taken care of, All of these kinds of things tend
to drive other people crazy. I recently asked a young man if he had a steady
girl friend and the answer was &quot;no&quot; because he couldn't handle
the hassle of doing all of the things like calling her. He would forget
to call her and wouldn't meet her when he was supposed to. He hadn't figured
out how to do all of these things yet. I think one good thing about it
was that he did recognize that he had these problems. Now he needs to find
ways to compensate for them.

<p><b>Other Social Issues.</b> Another thing that we have trouble with
is that we don't know what is proper to wear. We have trouble picking an
outfit that looks right together and we also have problems knowing what
to wear to a particular function. A lot of the kids tell me that they can't
figure out what the latest styles are at school and if they try something
different they get made fun of or laughed at. They can't figure that whole
system out. One of the things they say is that they just wear jeans and
a sweatshirt because that's always acceptable. That's not what they'd like
to do but they can't figure out what is happening with the styles.

<p>Comment: Always keep in mind that the group will have some ideas or
some things they would like to talk about. It also might be very appropriate
for the group to do some social things together such as having a pizza
party, going on an outing, or something else, that lets them socialize
together and not just work all the time.

<p><b>Looking at Positives
<br></b>Comment: Up to this point I've talked about things that don't work
right or that we have difficulty with. We also need to spend time looking
at things that do work and things that we do succeed at. I like to spend
about as much time looking at positive things as things that we have difficulty
with. One of the things that's nice to do every meeting is to have people
identify some things that have gone real well for them. Maybe they have
done something that they have never been able to do for themselves before,
they have been able to take a stand, or they have been able to explain
something to somebody that they hadn't been able to do. Just look for the
positive things that are happening.

<p>Outside of that I also like to spend a lot of time looking at what the
gifts or the abilities are. By definition, people with learning disabilities
have to be of average intelligence or higher. If this is so, and we have
deficits in language, for example, it's a given that we have areas that
we're better than average in. A lot of time the kids have not even thought
about these areas. People haven't helped them think about these things.
People are very apt to point out the things we have difficulty with and
sometimes we don't get much positive reinforcement for the things that
we can do.

<p>I use Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences to discuss gifts and
abilities, but there are other systems to use. The important thing is that
we start looking at areas that we can succeed in and develop some knowledge
in these areas.

<p><b>Howard Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences.</b> The first
intelligence that we talk about is &quot;linguistic&quot; or language.
This includes the ability to read, write, spell, speak and all of the language
kinds of things that most of us who have learning disabilities have a great
deal of trouble with. As I mentioned, I have found that the kids who are
good in language also do very well in early math, arithmetic. Many times
those of us who have language troubles also have trouble in arithmetic.

<p>The second intelligence is <b>&quot;mathematical, logical&quot;.</b>
I find that the mathematics we are talking about here is are advanced and
I'm not sure just where it starts, but when people get to Algebra I they
are there. Sometimes when students with this ability get to Algebra I,
they have their first success in school. This was true for me. The first
time I had any success in school at all was when I got to algebra.

<p>Another area is <b>&quot;spatial abilities&quot;.</b> This is the ability
to picture things in your mind as they really are. Kids with this ability
ran do very well with blueprints and they can visualize things and put
them together and make things work. They do very well with lego sets. They
like construction toys. They can draw. They just generally just like to
make things.

<p>Another area is <b>&quot;musical ability&quot;.</b> Some of the kids
that I work with will have a terrible time in language, but they can hear
a song on the radio just once and pick it out on their guitar or play it
on a piano. They retain all of that and it works very well for them.

<p>Another ability is <b>&quot;body kinesthetics&quot;.</b> That is the
ability to do things physically. All of our athletes have good body kinesthetics,
as do dancers and anybody who does things physically. Sometimes those who
are having difficulty with language will excel in some sport. These things
can be talked about and people can begin to see what they can really excel
at.

<p>The next ability is <b>&quot;interpersonal abilities&quot;.</b> This
means that a person likes to work in groups and do things with other people.
They can talk with people and have a good feel for what other people need
and feel. They work well with others. Sometimes that is a real strength
for our kids.

<p>The last one is what Gardner calls <b>&quot;intrapersonal intelligence&quot;.</b>
This is the ability to understand yourself, take care of yourself, and
do the things you need to do to prosper and have good health. I think it
is very interesting that an awful lot of the kids that I work with who
have severe language problems or math problems have very poor ability to
take care of themselves and in understanding themselves. This is a very
good thing to talk about to start the kids thinking about it.

<p>Comment: This is an awful lot of information to give a group at one
time and they probably can't retain it all. What I do is go around the
group and have each person try to identify a couple of areas that they
do very well in, things that they like to do, or things that really click
for them. The facilitator will have to help sometimes to get this started
because people aren't sure what groups they fall into. You can question
a bit about the things that they like to do. Can they play a musical instrument?
Are they good in sports? What kinds of things did they like to do when
they were young? What kind of toys did they play with? You can usually
find out a couple of areas that each one is doing some things in and doing
them successfully. Then I try to have each one identify a couple of areas
that they have difficulty with, such as language maybe. Did they have trouble
learning to read and write in school? Do they still have these kinds of
troubles? How is their math? After a little discussion each person will
have some ideas about things that really work for them. One of the interesting
things is that oftentimes they have more trouble finding the things that
do work for them the things that are good, because people aren't too apt
to point out the things that we're successful at. They really prefer to
tell us the things that we have trouble with. So, usually they have a pretty
good idea of things they don't do well. After you've done two or three
people in the room, the whole group begins to understand more how it's
going to work and they participate very well. When you get done, everybody
can see that they do have some things that they can do and that they may
be very talented in. This helps people understand that they may have real
difficulties in language, but that's not the only thing in the world that
we can be smart in. There are all kinds of things that we can succeed in.

<p>This whole procedure takes a lot of time because you have to spend quite
a bit of time with each person. If the group is small, this works a lot
better because after a little while people start getting uneasy and it
drags on for a long time. What I do if I've got a big group I'm working
with, I'll ask these questions and have a show of hands. For instance,
if I am inquiring about music, I'll ask all of those who play a musical
instrument, like to sing, or enjoy music to raise their hands. Right afterwards,
I'll ask all of those who don't care for music, or they like to listen
to it, but have never had a desire to play an instrument to show their
hands. That begins to show the group that indeed there are some who are
very good in that area and there are some who have difficulties in that
area. A lot of people feel that there isn't any area that they have abilities
in and I think it is important to spend some time with those folks. They
really do have something, but they haven't had much success and it takes
a little while to discover where they might be successful.

<p>We spend an awful lot of time, energy, and money on discovering exactly
what it is that we can't do. Sometimes I think we should spend a little
more time discovering what it is that we can excel at. Sometimes these
things seem to get lost. So, I think we really do need to spend time with
these kids looking in that area. 
<hr width="50%">

<h3 align=center>Other Things to Consider</h3>

<p>I suggest that after a while, whenever the adolescents are ready, to
have another parent open house. At this meeting I would have the adolescents
explain what their learning disability is and how it has affected them.
They could also share what their abilities are and how they can use those
to help them in school. 

<p>Another topic to discuss is compensatory things we can do to help ourselves.
For instance, we can take notes with a tape recorder, use talking books,
sometimes get extra time on tests, and use word processing. Facilitators
can develop a list of compensatory things. On the other hand, there are
remedial things that can be done. For instance, with appropriate reading
programs, many of us can learn to read, spell and write a lot better. These
things need to be talked about.

<p>There are many other topics that can be discussed. For instance, a lot
of times we talk about specific types of learning disability and go in
to the real details of each one. People can learn and share that way. It
is always important to remember that the people in the group will have
topics to discuss.

<p>Another point is that a facilitator can't help people solve their problems.
The job of a facilitator is to teach people what their disability is, what
their specific learning disabilities are, and what their strengths are.
These folks will then be able to figure out what it is they need to do
and help themselves. We can't really help them directly, buy we can sure
help them help themselves.

<p>Another thing that I have found is that two facilitators can be very
effective, preferably, a man and a woman. While one is talking, the other
has a good chance to observe and come up with some other ideas. If necessary,
the two can work together for modeling and that kind of thing.

<p>These are some of the things that I have found that worked for me. I
hope you will be able to use them in some of your work.

<h1>To Tell or Not to Tell</h1>

<h2><i>Self-identification, Self-advocacy, and Civil 
Rights in Employment and Postsecondary 
Education</i></h2>

<p><b>
Glenn Young<br>
Advocacy Committee<br>
LDA <i>Newsbriefs</i>, July-August 1996</b>

<p>Having a learning disability means you <i>have a 
disability.</i> This simple concept is one that is often missed 
by many of those involved in the learning disability field, 
including those with learning disabilities themselves This lack 
of connection to the concept of disability as part of the 
learning disability condition leads to the failure of many to 
access those key elements that allow persons with learning 
disabilities to succeed - civil rights protection and the right 
to reasonable accommodations. However. even if persons are 
knowledgeable about their disabilities and are knowledgeable 
about their rights, the issues of <i>when</i> and <i>how</i> - 
and even <i>whether or not</i> to use the civil rights 
protections offered by the law are an ongoing debate. It often 
comes down to the question of <i>to tell or not to tell</i>, and 
if you do tell, <i>when</i> is the right time.    

<p>Every major civil rights law concerning persons with 
disabilities, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), recognizes 
individuals with learning disabilities as persons entitled to 
those unique civil rights protections given to persons with all 
other disabilities. IDEA insures a free, appropriate, public 
education (FAPE) in grades K-12.

<p>There are certification and qualification obstacles to gaining 
access to civil rights as persons with disabilities. Because 
disability laws are civil rights laws, they do not require 
substantial changes in standards for either educational or 
employment settings. The laws state that a <i>qualified 
individual with a disability</i> is someone who, with or without 
a <i>reasonable accommodation</i>, can do the work or perform 
<i>the essential function of the employment position</i>. To be 
covered by civil rights protection, an individual with learning 
disabilities must be able to perform the work required for the 
particular job or position. If a person cannot perform the 
<i>essential functions</i> of the job, even with reasonable 
accommodations, there is no discrimination in either failing to 
hire or in firing a person.

Disability laws forbid employers or educational institutions from 
asking, as part of their interview process, if a person has a 
disability. It is therefore up to the person to <i>self-
identify</i> in order to be guaranteed protection under the law. 
No program, educational setting, or employer is required to 
provide accommodations unless the persons with disabilities state 
that they have a disability and provide documentation to verify 
that declaration. Persons with disabilities should also be able 
to identify the accommodations necessary for them to perform the 
tasks required for that job or educational program.  

Because individuals with learning disabilities and/or their 
parents are responsible for self-identification in order to be 
protected under civil rights laws, they must:
<ul>
  <li>know that they have learning disabilities and have 
written documentation of their disability
  <li>be knowledgeable of the laws
  <li>know that they qualify for protection under the laws
  <li>know what accommodations they will need
  <li>take the risk to self-identify, and
  <li>face a wide range of uncertainties.
</ul>

<p>For many individuals with learning disabilities, the 
identification issue becomes a life-long concern and debate. The 
debate focuses on whether it is worthwhile to identity oneself as 
a person with a learning disability or to try to do the best one 
can without accommodations.

<p>Central to the debate, <i>to tell or not to tell</i>, is the 
lack of knowledge and understanding of learning disabilities by 
the general public. The terms <i>learning disabilities</i> and 
<i>mental retardation</i> are too often interchanged. The 
continuing disagreement within the learning disability community 
itself concerning the causes, identification, impact, effects, 
etc. of learning disabilities further impedes understanding by 
the general public.

<p>Perhaps the more important question an individual with 
learning disabilities must ask is not whether <i>to tell or not 
to tell</i>, but rather the consequences of <i>not</i> telling. 
Can the person with learning disabilities do the job or derive 
benefit from a postsecondary educational program without 
accommodations? If the answer is no, the individual with learning 
disabilities (the parent, advocate, etc.) needs to consider the 
following:
<ul>
  <li>How severe is the learning disability?
  <li>How much does the nature or manifestation of the 
disability conflict with the needs of the job or educational 
program?
  <li>How open is the employer or educational program to 
recognizing and accommodating individuals with learning 
disabilities?
  <li>If there is a union in the workplace, what is its 
position toward and willingness to support members with 
learning disabilities?
</ul>

<p>Persons with learning disabilities need to be informed 
consumers and effective self-advocates. The skills of consumerism 
and advocacy need to be incorporated into the high school 
curriculum. Organizations such as LDA can serve as resources for 
students and adults with learning disabilities, their parents, 
and advocates and for schools and employers as well.

<p>IDEA, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and ADA can open doors 
to persons with learning disabilities. Civil rights laws make 
discrimination illegal; however, individuals must ask for 
protection under the laws through self-identification. With 
self-disclosure, one seeks implementation of the laws. Without 
implementation, civil rights laws are meaningless.

                 A Guide for Parents</h2>

<H3>Does your child have these behaviors?</H3>

<ul>
  <li>Fidgets with hands or feet  
  <li>Squirms in seat      
  <li>Difficulty remaining seated  
  <li>Easily distracted  
  <li>Difficulty awaiting turn in games or group situations
  <li>Gives answers to questions before they are completed         
  <li>Difficulty following instructions from others 
  <li>Difficulty sustaining attention in tasks or play activities
  <li>Shifts from one uncompleted task to another
  <li>Difficulty playing quietly
   <li>Talks excessively
  <li>Interrupts others
  <li>Does not seem to listen  
   <li>Loses things
  <li>Engages in physically dangerous activities without
      considering the possible consequences
</ul>

<blockquote>
<b>If so, he/she might have ADHD.</b>
</blockquote>

<H3>What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?</H3>

<blockquote>
  <p>ADHD is a disorder characterized by three behaviors:
  <UL>
    <LI><b>Hyperactivity</b>
    <LI><b>Distractibility</b> 
    <LI><b>Impulsivity</b> 
  </UL>

  <p>You may see one or more of these behaviors. It is not necessary to
     have all three to have ADHD: e.g., one does not have to be hyperactive.
  <p>ADHD is related, to but different than, learning disabilities (LD).
     Some people only have learning disabilities. Some have ADHD only. 
     Some have both. A number of professionals  believe that as many as
     50-80% of those with ADHD will have LD. There is an overlap. It is
     important to remember each disorder requires different treatment.
</blockquote>

<H3>What are these three behaviors?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Hyperactivity:</b>
     The child exhibits an unusual degree of activity. Most are fidgety;
     something is always in motion -- fingers, pencil, feet. They squirm
     in their seat, or cannot remain seated, etc.
  <p><b>Distractibility:</b> The child has difficulty blocking out
     unnecessary input from the environment.
    <blockquote>
    <p><b>Auditorily Distractible</b> means paying attention to all sounds,
       not just appropriate ones, e.g., voices in  halls, ringing of
       telephone.
    <p><b>Visually  Distractible</b> means paying attention to all things
       seen rather than the appropriate items, e.g., clouds, rug, pictures.
    </blockquote>
  <p><b>Impulsivity:</b>
     The child does not think before acting or talking and does not consider the 
     impact of his/her actions on others. Thus, they do not learn from experience. 
     This child may be accident prone because of impulsive behavior combined with poor judgment.
</blockquote>

<H3>Who makes the diagnosis?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Parents, teachers, and professionals may find evidence suggesting ADHD. However a physician usually confirms the diagnosis.
</blockquote>
<H3>How is the diagnosis made?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>ADHD is the least common reason for hyperactivity, distractibility
     or impulsivity. The most common causes for these behaviors are 
     anxiety or depression.
  <p>The history of the problem is the best indication. If the behaviors 
     have been chronic, that is, present almost since birth, and pervasive, 
     present all day, every day, it is probably ADHD.
  <p>Check lists and rating scales can be of assistance. However, the history 
     of the behavior combined with clinical observations remain the best 
     procedure for establishing the diagnosis of ADHD.
</blockquote>

<H3>What causes ADHD?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The final answer is not known. Current research strongly suggests that 
     ADHD is due to a deficiency in a specific neurotransmitter in the lower
     area of the brain. Research should lead to a greater understanding of 
     this disorder in coming years.
</blockquote>

<H3>How long does it last?</H3>
<blockquote>
<P>Current information suggests about 50% of children with ADHD will no longer have ADHD by puberty. The  remainder will continue into adolescence and possibly into adulthood.</P>
</blockquote>
<H3>How is ADHD treated?</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Behavioral approaches can be attempted to help the child concentrate
     on sitting still, staying on task or thinking before acting. Most of
     these are effective for short periods of time.
  <p>Several nutritional approaches have been proposed. The Feingold Diet
     appears to work at best for 1-2% of children with ADHD. Too much 
     refined sugar can increase hyperactivity in some children.
  <p>The generally accepted treatment in this country is the use of
     medications.
</blockquote>
<H3>Treatment with medication</H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Each medication has its own characteristics, effects and possible
     side effects. Thus, the physician should review these issues with
     the parents before beginning any medication. The goal is to 
     decrease or stop the behavior without side effects.
  <p>Medications have been used since 1937 and are considered to be
     safe and effective. These medications do not "drug" or "alter the 
     mind" of the child.  Rather, research suggests that each medication
     increases the amount of the chemical that is deficient in the
     brain, allowing the brain to function normally; therefore, the
     behaviors are diminished. Thus, the child becomes less active,
     less distractible and more able to think before acting.
  <p>The current approach is to use one of three groups of medications.
     The physician will generally begin with Group One progressing to 
     the others if no improvement is seen or side effects occur.
  <p>Since ADHD can interfere with classroom work, peer interactions 
     and family life, it is recommended that the child be on medication
     throughout each day, not just during school hours.

  <H4>Group One medications (stimulants) are:</H4>

  <ul>
    <li>Ritalin (methylpenidate)
    <li>Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine)
    <li>Cylert (pemoline)    
  </ul>

  <H4> Group Two medications (antidepressants) are:</H4>
  <ul>
    <li>Tofranil (imipramine)
    <li>Norpramine (desipramine)
  </ul>

  <H4>Group Three medications are:</H4>
  <ul>
    <li>Mellaril (thioridazine), an antipsychotic       
    <li>Tegretol (carbamazepine), an anticonvulsant also effective for
        manic-depressive (bipolar) disease
  </ul>

  <p>Catapres (clonidine) may be used with Group One or Two medications to increase
     their effectiveness.
</blockquote>

<H3>Remember the total child: </H3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Many children with ADHD also have learning  disabilities. Treating
     the ADHD will not treat the learning disabilities. Each must be
     treated if the child is to make sufficient progress.
  <p>If children have ADHD and learning disabilities they may develop
     emotional, social and family  problems. Each must be recognized
     and helped. Unless the total child, in his or her total environment
     is considered, neither the child nor the family will make as much
     improvement as necessary.
</blockquote>

<title>Newsbriefs 5/96 - Asperger Syndrome</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1>Asperger Syndrome</h1>

<h2>Toward an understanding of the
condition and improvement of service provision</h2>

<p><i>The following is a synopsis by Audrey McMahon of
Dr. Ami Klin's presentation at the 1996 LDA Conference <br>
(<b>Newsbriefs,</b> May-June 96)</i>

<p>Interest in Asperger Syndrome and knowledge about the disorder 
has increased significantly in United States over the past decade.
This is partly due to articles published in the May, 1991 and
July/August, 1994 issues of <b><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>, which
invited parents and professionals working with individuals with an
Asperger <i>footprint</i> to contact LDA. The response to this
request by LDA members was overwhelming. At the 1995 LDA
Conference a session on Asperger Syndrome was so well attended
that this year a full day symposium was held. Dr. Ami Klin of the
Yale Child Study Center was the featured speaker. He made the
following points:

<p>The current definition of Asperger Syndrome is considered
provisional and will probably become obsolete, but the disability
will, of course, remain. The upsurge in interest in the concept of
Asperger Syndrome over the past decade, without consensus on
the definition led to inclusion in the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) under Autism.

<p>The Yale Child Study Center's interest in Asperger Syndrome and
the overwhelmingly positive response from LDA members led to a
federally funded project on social learning disabilities. The project
focuses on an array of tests and procedures developed to advance
the understanding of social mechanisms from a neurobehavioral
perspective.

<p>Since the nature of and needs associated with the social disability
encountered in Asperger Syndrome appears to differ from those 
found in autism, the Yale Child Study Center made a priority
of investigating new diagnostic instruments with a view to
standardize the assessment and diagnosis of newly recognized
types of social learning disabilities.

<p>The objectives of the project include:
<ul>
<li>documenting a range of social behaviors which can provide for
quantification of relevant social phenomena

<li>quantifying conversational skills

<li> utilizing relevant diagnostic interviews that can provide
quantification of past and present symptoms

<li>creating experimental tools that investigate information
processing, both neurobehaviorally (through computer and
video-administered tasks) and neurophysiolocally (documenting
differences in brain activation to social stimuli).
</ul>

<p>Ongoing research at Yale is seeking to determine whether the
nonverbal learning disabilities profile can be seen as a
neurobiological model of Asperger Syndrome, but not of autism,
thus differentiating the two syndromes at the neurobehavioral level.
Neuroimaging studies carry this hypothesis to the neuroatomic
(structural MRI) and the neurophysiological (functional MRI) levels.

<p>Recent genetic studies have shown the recurrence of autism in
families to be about 200 times the risk in the general population.
From the preliminary data collected, it appears that the recurrence
risk factor of a social learning disability in a family of a person with
Asperger Syndrome to be even higher.

<p>As part of the presentation, Dr. Klin reviewed the contents of the
new LDA brochure <a href="../../Asperger.html"><b><i>Asperger Syndrome:
Guidelines for treatment and Intervention</i></b></a>, a sequel to the
earlier LDA publication 
<a href="http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism/ldabro.html"><b><i>
Asperger Syndrome: Guidelines for Parents</i></b></a>. 
Both of these brochures can be obtained from
LDA, 4156 Library Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15234. 

<p>Dr Klin stated, "For people working within the context of an academic
clinical environment, it is often frustrating that we do not have the
resources to mobilize the people, agencies, and institutions that
could help us make a significant dent into the service provision
infrastructure that affects our clients. The news that LDA has
established a Task Force on Asperger Syndrome was enormously
gratifying. I would like to state the willingness of the members of 
the Yale Child Study Center to be of help every way we can.
Yale Child Study Center has a Web site <a
href="http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism">
http://info.med.yale.edu/chldstdy/autism</a> and is planning to issue
a quarterly newsletter relating to information about the project to
participating families. One of our dreams is to create a list of
resources, nationwide, to families of individuals with social learning
disabilities. The goals and Yale and LDA converge a great deal
and I hope that the partnership between LDA and Yale is only beginning."

<title>A Judge's Story</title>

<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<H1>A Judge's Story</H1>

<p><i>This article is from the  <b>Learning Disabilities and Juvenile Justice</b> 
      special supplement to <b>Newsbriefs</b> (1996).</i>

<p>by Jeffrey  H. Gallet, Judge in Family Court, State of New York

<p>My mother was a trained teacher but even she did not understand learning
disabilities. The term was almost unknown when I was a child. She was convinced I
was bright, and she knew I was working hard at learning, but she could not understand
why my achievement was so low. She shared my frustrations.

<p>Everyone at school said that I was lazy or stupid or both. After a while I began to
believe them. Sometimes, I just gave up. I couldn't write, spell, or read, or answer
questions quickly. I didn't even know which hand to put over my heart when we
recited the Pledge of Allegiance.

<p>Once my parents were called to school and told that I had scored first in my class
on an I.Q. test. That score they were told was evidence that I had cheated on the test.
My father, a lawyer, argued that I must have been bright, indeed, for I had copied
only the correct answers. My parents never gave up on me although it must have been
a great disappointment to those two scholarly people that their first born could barely
graduate from high school.

<p>They encouraged me to go to college and I did, graduating last in my class. I
wanted to go to law school against the best advice of my school counselors. Again
they encouraged and supported me, this time along with one of my professors, Dr.
Hugo Mailey.

<p><b> Law School - No Longer Last in Class</b><br>
Brooklyn Law School took a chance on me. I responded with the best academic
performance of my career þ I graduated in the middle of my class. By law school I
had begun to learn how to compensate for my problems. I also had the good fortune
of meeting Steve Lusthaus, another student, who was willing to spend many hours
discussing legal concepts with me. Law school was easier than college because there
was more emphasis on concepts and less on rote learning, my greatest weakness.

<p>Steve, now a successful lawyer, and I still joke about the time he tutored me for a
torts examination on which I scored an "A" and he only a "B". I also remember the
night I decided to drop out of law school because of the seemingly endless pressure
and Steve argued with me all night, refusing to let me go to sleep until I agreed to
stay in school.

<p><b>Life Finally Comes Together</b><br>
I was a lucky one. Loving parents, a college professor and a law school roommate
supported me, encouraged me and refused to let me fall victim to my frustrations and
give up. They knew that I was neither stupid nor lazy, even though there were times I
was not so sure myself. By the time I was, by chance, diagnosed as learning disabled
at the age of thirty-five, I had already learned to deal with my learning  disabilities.
By the age of thirty-seven, I was a judge.


<p>I take special pride in one accomplishment. Having failed English courses 
in both high school and college, I finally learned how to write. But, today, 
with five books and over thirty articles to my credit, I still suffer from 
terrible writer's block and an irrational fear that I am about to make a
fool of myself every time I sit down to write. The fear and the frustration 
have left such a lasting mark on me that I can never forget how it was. I can 
never fully believe it will not be that way again.

<p><b>Some Thoughts about the Juvenile Justice System</b><br>
I agreed to write this article, after first refusing, because I think my
story may help parents deal with their LD children. Almost every week I see a 
learning disabled child who, undiagnosed or untreated, is venting his or
her frustrations in anti-social ways. I could have stood in that same spot. If
not for loving, caring, involved parents, my frustrations at not being able to
keep up in class, and to some extent in the play yard, could have burst forth 
in the same self-destructive way.

<p>The schools and the courts have not met their responsibilities to LD children.
When I was young, they simply did not recognize the problem. Now, they can
diagnose and deal with LD but have not allocated the resources to do what must be
done.

<p>I expect the FCLD benchbook to make a major impact on the juvenile courts.
Juvenile court judges will for the first time have an authoritative work to help them
deal with the LD youth-at-risk. Hopefully, it will lead to treatment programs to halt
the escalating conflict between the frustrated, angry, impatient LD youngster and his
or her overburdened, impotent-feeling parents who are unable to socialize their
children and integrate them into their peer groups. Too often in the past, the solution
has been to place the child in foster care, an unsatisfactory, non cost-effective solution
which may very well do more damage than good.

<p>It is the schools which hold the key to avoiding the type of conflict we see in the
family courts. An early diagnosis of the problem and an integrated treatment plan,
including not only help for the child, but, also, counseling for the parents, would save
many children now going astray. Unfortunately, too many schools have not focused
their attention and resources on the problem and research proposals to find methods
for early diagnoses of LD are going unfunded.

<p>There is improvement. As education programs such as the FCLD grants for
handbooks for lawyers and judges make more and more people aware of the problem
and the terrible waste it creates, more LD children are being identified and helped.
Unfortunately, the process is painfully slow.

<h3><a name="intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>Depression is a leading cause of failure in school and in life for young people (children, adolescents, and young adults) with learning disabilities. The depressed state can be primary (familial-genetic 
disorder) or secondary (symptomatic depression) to medical conditions or learning disability. 

<p>Depression is feeling sad, lonely, unloved, dumb, and worthless, along
with guilt feelings and beliefs of being mistreated. Depression is having
trouble falling asleep (initial insomnia), restless sleep with 
recurrent awakenings (interval insomnia), or waking early in the morning
unable to fall back to sleep (terminal insomnia). Depression often is
also awakening in the morning anxious, tired, sad, or mad. 
Depression is a loss of interest in friends, hobbies, and school or work.
Depression causes a loss of concentration, poor memory, forgetfulness,
and inattention. Depression is having headaches, 
stomachaches, and other physical symptoms. Depression is feeling angry,
picked on, grouchy, and irritable. Sometimes depression is feeling
hopeless and helpless, and wishing to die. Depression is the 
leading cause of suicide. A clinical depression is a combination of these
symptoms which persist for longer than three weeks and cause failure in
the person's environments of home, work (school), or play. 
Depression has been demonstrated in many studies to be associated with
and the possible cause of school failure, conduct disorder and
delinquency, anorexia and bulimia, school phobia, and panic attacks.

was first prepared by Emil Kraepelin in the early 1900s. For the first
half of the twentieth century, most clinicians did not accept the 
concept that primary depression (or manic-depressive disease: affective
illness) occurred in children and adolescents. However, by the early
1970s, criteria for the recognition of depression in children and
adolescents had been established (<a href="table
1.html">Table 1,  "The Weinberg Criteria"</a>). These criteria were based
upon those used to diagnose depression and mania in adults as formulated
in the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for adult psychiatric disorders
by the Department of Psychiatry of the Washington University School of
Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri. The Weinberg Criteria for depression in
children and adolescents was published in 1973 and the criteria for mania
in 1976 by Weinberg and Brumback (<a href="table2.html">Table 2</a>). In
1980, the American Psychiatric Association published the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Third Edition (DSM-III) [revised
in 1988 as DSM-IIIR and in 1994 as DSM-IV] which contained guidelines for
the diagnosis of depression and mania in individuals of all ages. In the
DSM-III, diagnostic criteria were added for the various temporal patterns
of affective illness. These patterns are characterized by chronic,
long-standing ebbs and flows, "good" and "bad" periods per day, mixed
with  "good" and "bad" days, but without prolonged well (stable) states.
Patterns of affective illness with prominent manic symptomatology
(chronic hypomania, cyclo-thymia, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder
and dysthymia with the manic feature of hostile  anger) are most
prevalent in pre-school years and continue through young adult age.     

<p>Depression and other forms of affective illness are probably genetic
disorders based upon studies of familial clusterings, evaluation of
offspring of both depressed and manic-depressive adults, and studies of 
siblings and twins reared apart. Research is now underway to determine
whether the various patterns of affective illness represent a unitary
genetic disorder modified by other traits or are the result of multiple 
and varied genetic and psychosocial causes. It is possible that even
genetically-based affective illness could remain dormant throughout an
individual's life if inappropriate environmental stressors are not 
present. 

<h3><a name="YoungPeople"></a>Criteria For Depression In Young People</h3>

The "Weinberg Criteria" for depression (<a href="table1.html">Table
1</a>) include 10 major symptom categories: dysphoric mood,
self-deprecatory ideation, agitation, sleep disturbance, change in school
performance, diminished socialization, change in attitude towards school,
somatic complaints, loss of usual energy, and unusual change in appetite
or weight. The individual must manifest: 1) <u>dysphoric moods and
affect</u> and 2) <u>self-deprecatory ideation</u>. We use the term
<u>mood</u> to describe the young person's emotional feelings, while the
term <u>affect</u> indicates the individual's appearance in relation to 
feelings. Symptoms of dysphoric mood and affect are sadness, loneliness,
unhappiness, hopelessness, pessimism, mood swings, moodiness,
irritability, easily annoyed, hypersensitivity, tearfulness and crying, 
negativity, and difficulty being pleased. Generally, a child manifesting
dysphoric moods will have a multitude of these symptoms. Sadness and
hopelessness can be so severe that the young person will withdraw to a
room to sit and cry (melancholy). Self-deprecation is the feeling of
being worthless, useless, dumb, stupid, and guilty, or beliefs of
persecution. Death wishes occur in 35% of pre-pubertal children 
manifesting depression, suicidal ideation (thoughts and plans) in 15%,
and suicidal attempts in 5%.

<p>In addition to  dysphoric moods and  self-deprecation, the child must
have four or more of the following eight symptoms: 

<ul>
<li>agitation
<li>sleep disturbance
<li>change in school performance
<li>diminished socialization
<li>change in attitude toward school (work)
<li>somatic complaints
<li>loss of usual energy 
<li>unusual change in appetite or weight
</ul>
Most young people fulfilling this criteria will have seven or eight of
the ten major symptoms. 

<p>The <u>agitation of depression</u> is irritability, grouchy feelings
and actions, inappropriate sudden anger or fighting, quarrelsomeness,
lack of respect for authority, and difficulty getting along with others. 
The most common <u>sleep disturbance</u> is trouble falling asleep
(initial insomnia). The young child will often manifest restless sleep
with frequent awakenings (interval insomnia) and enter the parents bed 
for comfort. Awakening too early in the morning (terminal insomnia)
strongly correlates with thoughts of suicide. Common to the depressed
adolescent is difficulty awakening in the morning with excessive 
morning sleep. <u>Change in school performance</u> is characterized by
frequent complaints from the teachers of: daydreaming, poor concentration
and memory, and inattentiveness; loss of usual work effort 
in school subjects with a drop in grades; loss of usual interest in
extra-scholastic activities; incomplete classroom assignments; much
incomplete homework; avoidance of homework activity; and disruptive 
behavior.

<p>The depressed young person will often <u>lose interest</u> in friends
and social activities. Occasionally the young person loses the ability to
anticipate or experience pleasure (<u>anhedonia</u>). Commonly, the
individual must be forced or coerced to participate in what previously
were usual, fun activities, but the enjoyment is lessened and the
participation does not restore interest (dyshedonia). <u>School
avoidance</u>, <u>school resistance</u>, <u>discomfort in school</u>, and
<u>school phobia</u>  are symptomatic of depression. <u>Somatic
complaints</u> (physical complaints) of headaches, stomachaches, joint
and muscle aches and pains, and visual disturbances without any physical
cause is depression until proven otherwise. The depressed young person
complains of  <u>poor energy</u> and <u>tiredness</u>. A <u>change in
appetite</u> (either a loss in appetite or excessive desire to eat)   
associated with change in weight is less common in children than adults,
but is still symptomatic of depression. It is important to understand
that depression, as a disease or illness, is a group of symptoms
associated with maladaptation or worsening in usual performance in either
the home, school, or play environments. Most depressed young people will
be failing in school, will be difficult to live with at home, and will
drop out of usual extra-scholastic pursuits. The depressed individual's
judgment deteriorates, interests wane, and failure occurs.

<p>Minor depressions are identical to major depressive episodes in
duration but involve fewer symptoms and less impairment. The Weinberg
Criteria for depression defines severity of a depressive episode in 
relation to death wishes and suicidal ideation: mild (no death wishes),
moderate (positive for death wishes or suicidal thoughts), and severe
(positive for suicidal plans or suicidal attempts).

<h3><a name="diagnosis"></a>Diagnosis of Depression</h3>

<p>Using the Weinberg Criteria, the diagnosis of depression is
established through interview of the individual and the primary
caretaker. The criteria symptoms for depression must represent a change
from the individual's usual self or a worsening of the usual self, be
present for more than three weeks, and be associated with poor
performance and a worsening of adaptation (or failure) in one, two, or
three environments - home, school (work), or play. A symptom is accepted
as positive when at least one of the characteristic behaviors listed for
that symptom category is present (Table 1). Dysphoric moods and self 
deprecation (deteriorated self-esteem) must be reported by the young
person for these symptoms to be considered positive. The other eight
symptom categories can be reported by either the individual or the 
primary caretaker.

<p> Petti (1978; 1985) developed the Bellevue Index of Depression (BID)
from the Weinberg Criteria. The BID offers a systematic interview
approach to both the young patient and the caretaker and can be 
used for diagnosis of depression and assessment of the severity of the
depressed state. The Diagnostic Inventory for Children and Adolescents
(DICA) developed by Herjanic and Reich (1982) is a structured 
interview based upon DSM-III criteria for depression and other
psychiatric disorders. It is administered to both the patient and the caretaker. The Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-P) developed by Puig Antich and Chambers 
(1978) is a structured interview modified for children based upon the
Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) for depression and other psychiatric
disorders in adults. The Children's Depression Rating Scale - Revised
(CDRS-R) was developed by Poznanski and colleagues, in 1985, and modeled
after the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression for adults. It correlates 
with global ratings for depression. 

<p><b>Depression By Self-Report</b><br>
It is possible to recognize young people at risk for depression through
self-report instruments. The Weinberg Screening Affective Scale (WSAS) is
a 56 item self-administered form requiring fourth grade 
reading ability (Appendix A) that takes less than five minutes to
complete. The WSAS correlates with depressive illness in both outpatient
and hospitalized depressed children and adolescents.

<p>Two large populations of high school students have been studied for
depression by self-report using the WSAS. The first study group consisted
of 3,292 students in a large metropolitan urban school district, and the
second population had 1,298 students 
from a rural middle-size college community school district. These two
population studies (in which 96% of the students participated)
demonstrated that about 14% of high school students manifest depression
by self-report. Gender and ethnic group differences were evident.
Hispanic females had the highest percentage of depression by self-report
(22%), while white males (8%) had the lowest. Black students, white
females, and Hispanic males were intermediate in the prevalence of
depression. Three percent (3%) of the students related suicidal thoughts
("I think a lot about killing myself") These studies concluded that
depressive sympto-matology is prominent in adolescents, large numbers of
young people are actively depressed, and a significant number are at risk
for suicide. The WSAS can be used for the screening of depression in
young people and is a strong confirmation instrument in the clinical
setting. Two other widely used self-report forms for depression are the
Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) which has been used in adolescents and
young adults and the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) developed by
Kovacs in 1987 for ages 7-17 years. 

<p><b>Dysthymia: Chronic or Long-standing Depressive
Symptomatology</b><br>
Dysthymia is characterized by chronic long-standing depressive
symptomatology with ebbs and flows in severity, periods each day of
depressive moods (mixed days), occasional fully-depressed days, and an 
occasional depression-free day; but no prolonged well states. Periods of
major depression are common in individuals with dysthymic disorder.
Dysthymia limits functioning, performance, and enjoyment, but is 
not associated with the same degree of impairment that characterizes
minor or major depressive episodes.

<p>The onset of the dysthymic pattern is usually during the pre-school
years (ages 2-5 years), with major or minor depressive episodes occurring
later in elementary and secondary school years. School phobia 
with the start of school can be the presenting symptoms of a major
depressive episode in the anxious dysthymic young child. The learning
disabled dysthymic child will often develop a major depressive 
episode during the third or fourth grade school years associated with the
increased stress of school tasks. 

<h3><a name="mania"></a>Criteria for Mania in Young People</h3>
<p> The hallmarks of mania (<a href="table2.html">Table 2</a>) are
euphoria and hostile anger. Euphoria has two presentations: a) an elated
mood with inappropriate feelings of well being, cheerfulness, giddiness,
and silliness. However, it can also be b) 
the inappropriate denial of problems or symptoms despite behavior that is
obvious to observers as inappropriate, disruptive, and destructive. The
manic young person can be hyperactive, intrusive, destructive, or
agitated, or display hostile anger, while at the same time reporting, "I
have no problems or concerns."

<p>The irritability of mania is hostile anger, with ranting rages, driven
 impulsive destructiveness, or uncon-trollable antisocial behavior. The
hostile anger of mania can lead to homicidal wishes, thoughts, threats,
or attempts.

<p>Utilizing the criteria established by Weinberg and Brumback (1976) for
the recognition of mania in children and adolescents, the individual must
manifest either euphoria or hostile anger with three or more of the
following six symptoms: 

<ul>
<li>hyperactivity (mental, motor, or sexual), motor drivenness,
intrusiveness;
<li>push of speech;
<li>flight of ideas, racing thoughts, the inability to maintain thinking
on one idea; 
<li>grandiosity with heightened self-worth, self-power, and
self-influence which can be delusional; 
<li>sleep disturbance with decreased need for sleep and nighttime
hyperwakefulness (night-owl insomnia); 
<li>shortened attention span, inability to concentrate, and
distractibility. 
</ul>

Each symptom must be a discrete change from the individual's usual self,
either a new behavior or a worsening of an old behavior. Although the
original criteria stated that this symptom complex must be present for
more than one month, further studies indicate that a duration of only one
week is necessary. 

<p>Diagnosis of mania is established by interview and observation of the
young person and interview with the primary caretaker utilizing a
semi-structured, closed-end interview technique. A symptom is accepted as
positive when at least one of the characteristic behaviors listed for the
category is present. 

<u>Euphoria</u> (most commonly denial of any problems) must be reported
by the individual, but the other symptoms are observational and can be
reported by the individual, the caretaker, or knowledgeable others.

<p>The course of childhood <u>onset classic manic-depressive disease</u>
is exemplified by the child with no previous disturbance of mood and
affect who begins to manifest the symptom complex of depression. On a
rare occasion, a manic episode will precede the first period of
depression. Subsequently there are discrete periods of depression usually
lasting six to eighteen months and mania persisting for 
one to six weeks, with interspersed prolonged well states. Although
classic manic-depressive disease is uncommon in pre-pubertal child-ren,
the patterns of dysthymia, hypomania, cyclothymia, and juvenile 
rapid cycling bipolar disorder often begin during pre-school years, and
are mislabeled as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
conduct or oppositional defiant disorder, and over-anxious disorder. As 
the child ages, classic manic-depressive disease becomes evident. 

<p><b>Hypomania, Cyclothymia, And Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder
(See <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>)</b><br>
One of the confusing problems in the recognition and appropriate
management of mania in children and adolescents is the observation that
hypomania is chronic with a very early onset. Hypomania can present 
in utero as a hyperactive fetus; as overly alert, irritable, colicky
infant with poor sleep habits; or as a "supermarket toddler" requiring
restriction in the gro-cery store cart. The hypomanic child progresses 
through preschool years with significant hyperactivity, excessive
cheerfulness, frequent sexual naughtiness, inappropriate silliness,
giddiness, and elation, and nightowl insomnia. As the child ages, 
periodic rants, rages, hostile anger (mania), and even homicidal threats
limit the hypomanic child's ability to function. Hypomania is a common
cause of attention deficit disorder with persistent hyperactivity 
(ADHD): "hypomanic/hyperactivity." Increasing manic moods and classic
manic-depressive disease become apparent as the child ages. 

<p><b>Cyclothymia (See <a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>)</b><br>
Cyclothymia is long-standing (chronic) hypomania with moments per day of
both depressive moods and "mini" moments of significant anger. Most of
the days are "mixed days" with an occasional all "bad" day, but rarely an
"all good day." The cyclothymic disorder begins in the toddler or early
pre-school years and progresses during late childhood and young
adolescent years to discrete periods of major depression or 
manic episodes. 

<p><b>Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder (JRCBD) (See
<a href="glossary.html">Glossary</a>)</b><br>
The term juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder (JRCBD) is applied to a
group of manic-depressive young people who are free of continuous
hypomanic/hyperactivity but manifest moment-to-moment, day-to-day 
("all mixed days") of depressive moods, actions, and feelings
interspersed with hostile anger, ranting, or rages. Juvenile rapid
cycling bipolar disorder most often is evident during preschool years and
worsens with aging to major depressive or manic episodes during the
adolescent years. 

<h3><a name="history"></a>Family History</h3>

<p>The pattern of affective illness in the young person predicts family
history. If the pattern in the young person is discrete cycles of
depression with or without a manic episode and with prolonged well
states, the family history will only be positive for typical depression
or classic manic-depressive disease. Dysthymia or cyclothymia in the
young person predicts a family history of depression or manic-depressive
disease along with alcoholism.     

<p>Depressed children, who are oppositional and defiant or have a conduct
disorder, have a positive family history of sociopathy, or alcoholism,
along with depression or manic-depressive disease. 
Hallucinations during depression indicate a family member with
schizophrenia. Depressed children with prominent somatic complaints
frequently have a female family member with Briquet's syndrome (a 
disorder characterized by severe hypochondriasis and often multiple
operations without recognizable underlying medical disease). Inherited
traits of these other disorders become apparent as additional 
symptoms during the depressive episodes in young people. When that young
person is free of depression or manic-depressive episodes, those traits
become inapparent. Thus, it is important to try to identify an 
underlying depression or manic-depressive state in any children
presenting with an apparent conduct disorder, somatic complaints, or
other behavior complexes.

<p>It is also noteworthy that 30-40% of affectively ill children will
have a biologic parent who is also affectively ill (most commonly
depression) at the time the young person presents for initial evaluation. 

<h3><a name="neurology">The Neurology and Biology of Affective Illness in
Young People</a></h3>

<p>The neurologic examination is very important in both establishing and
understanding the localization of depression in the brain and the
influence of this metabolic (chemical) disorder of the brain on other 
brain functions. During a depressive episode the young person will often
manifest neurologic abnormalities of tone, posture, or reflexes in the
left arm and leg indicating dysfunction of the right side of the brain
(right cerebral hemisphere). The manic young person will have similar
neurologic abnormalities that involve the right arm and leg indicating
dysfunction of the left side of the brain (left cerebral hemisphere).
Depressed young people have a variety of problems that indicate
disturbances in right parietal lobe functions: they have impaired
coordination and are clumsy (dyspraxias); handwriting deteriorates
(dysgraphia); they have language skills ("math"), wit, and humor suffer.
In mania, the individual demonstrates errors indicative of left cerebral
hemisphere dysfunction: specific word finding (naming) difficulties,
problems with clarity of speech, and abnormal verbalizations. During well
states, these motor findings and disturbances of higher brain
communicative-cognitive functions improve to the individual's more usual
abilities. An important concept is that affective illness can cause a
learning disability or worsen an underlying learning disability.

<p>The right posterior parietotemporal cortex appears to be involved in
the production of the dysphoric and vegetative symptoms of depression.
The left mesial temporal and entorhinal cortex appears to be 
responsible for the key symptoms of mania: euphoria (denial) and hostile
anger. It is likely that obsessions, compulsions, and oppositional
defiant behavior are minor manifestations of the hostile anger 
of mania. It is prudent to mention that some research concerning adult
stroke patients has implicated left frontal lobe lesions in depression
and right frontotemporal lesions in mania. However, studies by Freeman 
and colleagues (1985) and the preponderance of studies reviewed by
Brumback (1985: 1993), indicate that the right parietotemporal area plays
a major role in the genesis of depression. Our ongoing observations of
children and adolescents confirm this brain localization for depression.

<p>Biological correlates for depression in young people are similar to
those reported in adults (<a href="table3.html">Table 3</a>). The most
reproducible have been abnormalities of sleep and disturbances in
hypothalamic-pituitary hormonal activity (abnormal dexamethasone
suppression test and blunted growth hormone and thyrotropin releasing
hormone). The strongest biological correlate is the proven successful
treatment of depression with certain specific medications. Originally,
the monoamine (MAO) inhibitors, and for the past twenty five years, the
tricyclic antidepressant medications (TCAs) have provided beneficial therapy. 

Both these agents augment the activities of the neurotransmitters
norepinephrine and serotonin. Serotonin is produced by neurons in the
raphe nuclei of the brain stem and travels up the axons of these neurons
to the cerebral hemispheres, more right than left, where it is released
into the synaptic clefts. Norepinephrine is produced by another group of
nerve cells, the locus ceruleus, of the brain stem and also travels up
axons to the cerebral hemispheres. In depressed states, there is a
relative deficiency of these two neurotransmitters. The tricyclic
antidepressants, amitriptyline (Elavil) and doxepin (Sinequan), block the
inactivation of serotonin thus allowing this neurotransmitter to be
available for needed use by cerebral cortical nerve cells (<a
href="table4.html">Table 4</a>). Desipramine (Norpramin) and
protriptyline (Vivactil) block the inactivation of norepinephrine, while
nortriptyline (Pamelor) and imipramine (Tofranil) prevent inactivation of
both serotonin and norepinephrine. The second generation antidepressant
trazodone (Desyrel) prevents inactivation of serotonin and maprotiline
(Ludiomil) prevents inactivation of norepinephrine. The new third
generation antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft), fluoxetine (Prozac), and
paroxetine (Paxil) are very specific in preventing inactivation of
serotonin. The underlying mechanisms leading to this relative deficiency
of serotonin and norepinephrine in the cerebral cortex is unknown, but we
believe that a dysfunction of modulating control from the right posterior
emporoparietal cortex initiates a cascade of events causing altered
activity of the key brain stem neurons and consequent deficiency of
norepinephrine and serotonin release by their axons in the cerebral cortex. 

<p>The biology of mania (<a href="table3.html">Table 3</a>) is less well
understood and cannot be explained by any available bioamine
(neurotransmitter) theory. The major tranquilizers widely used to treat
mania in adults block the effect of the neurotransmitter dopamine.
However, the disorder of absent dopamine, e.g., Parkinson's disease, is
not characterized by mania. due to the severe progressive motor problems
associated with the major tranquilizers, we actively avoid their use in
young people). The two most successful drugs in the treatment and
prevention of manic episodes, lithium carbonate and carba-mazepine
(Tegretol), have many different biological actions, none of which are
unique to mania. Although, right limb motor abnormalities, suggesting
left brain dysfunction, is a reproducible observation, various brain
imaging studies have been inconclusive, possibly due to heterogeneous
study populations. 

<h3><a name="concurrent"></a>Concurrent Diagnoses</h3>

<p> Concurrent diagnoses (a combination of two or more diagnoses
occurring in the same individual at the same point in time) are common in
young people with affective illness. There is a high prevalence of 
specific learning disabilities, overanxious disorder, school phobia, and
anorexia in depressed young people. Conduct disorder and oppositional
defiant disorder are common in children with hypomania, cyclothymia, or
juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder.


<p>It has been reported (and we concur) that 35-45% of delinquent
adolescents have affective illness prior to their incarceration for
delinquent activity. In this same context, drug-abusing,
learning-disabled adolescents frequently have had major depressive
episodes, chronic minor depression (dysthymia), or long-standing
cyclothymia prior to initiating drug abusing behavior in adolescence. It
has also been reported (and we concur) that at least 50% of the older
adolescent and young adults committing suicide, with a prior history of
drug abuse, had evidence of depression predating the abuse of drugs and
suicide.

<p>Nearly twenty years ago (1977), we reported that hyperactivity
beginning after age two years was most often symptomatic of an underlying
depression. Fifty-five percent (55%) of hyperactive pre-pubertal children
were only hyperactive when in a state of depression (<a
href="table5.html">Table 5</a>). The so-called "rebound" side effects and
vegetative symptoms (loss of appetite, insomnia) attributed to stimulant
medications used to treat hyperactive children are actually the result of
an underlying depression.

<p> The terms "hyperkinetic impulse disorder" (1950s), "minimal brain
dysfunction" (MBD;1960s), "hyper-active child syndrome" (1970s),
"attention deficit disorder with or without hyperactivity" (ADD 
with or without H; 1980s) and now "attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder" (ADHD;1990s) have successively been applied to a heterogeneous
(mixed) group of children, adolescents, and young adults whose 
clinical problem can be more correctly explained by one or more of the
following disorders: affective illness, learning disabilities, and
primary disorder of vigilance (<a href="table6.html">Table 6</a>). ADHD
is just a group of symptoms that demands more accurate evaluation and
correct diagnosis (<a href="figure1.html"><b>Figure 1</b></a>).

<p>The recently described primary disorder of vigilance (PDV) (<a
href="table7.html">Table 7</a>) is the proper diagnosis of a large group
of young people fulfilling criteria for ADHD without hyperactivity or
with only minimal hyper-activity. These young people are busy,
inattentive, and daydream while trying to stay awake due to difficulties
remaining alert (hypovigilance). The individual with primary disorder of
vigilance, when depressed, becomes excessively sleepy and can "sleep the
depres-sion off." Such individuals can go to bed for weeks, months, or
until the depression lifts. Interestingly, during a manic episode, the
individual with primary disorder of vigilance continues to have vigilance
problems ("sleepy") when trying to concentrate. 

<h3><a name="ld"></a>Learning Disabilities, Depression, and School
Failure</h3>

<p>Children, adolescents, and young adults with specific learning
disorders have a high prevalence of depression. Sixty to eighty percent
(60-80%) of learning disabled children failing in school will fulfill 
criteria for depression at the time of initial clinical evaluation.
Evaluation of individuals failing in school necessitates careful
assessment of emotions and cognition and communication skills (higher
brain functions; (<a href="table8.html">Table 8</a>), along with standard
neurologic and physical examinations. This total evaluation, including
history of the present problem, developmental, health and family
histories should take less than 90-120 minutes to complete. Too often an
evaluator takes the short-cut of only evaluating part of the young person
rather than the whole person: the evaluation for learning disability will
be omitted; affective illness will be excluded; none of the young
person's brain functions will be examined (with only a motor examination
performed); or without any examination, the determination will be made
that the environment (home or school) is the sole cause of the
difficulties; or the label ADHD suggested and a prescription of stimulant
medication offered. It is important to undertake a complete systematic
evaluation to establish correct diagnosis and develop a successful
clinical management program.

<p>For children, adolescents, and young adults with learning
disabilities, school can be an unpleasant, noxious, and highly
frustrating environment. Young people with various specific learning
disabilities often manifest poor attention, restlessness, daydreaming,
and limited diligence when asked to do tasks that they are unable to do.
It is postulated that continuous stimulation of a genetically
maldeveloped area of the cerebral hemisphere makes that area, surrounding
cerebral cortex, and homologous cerebral cortex in the opposite
hemisphere all work less well. For example, language-impaired and
dyslexic children (left hemisphere learning disability) often become
moody, irritable, and angry when asked to speak, read, or 
recall words. Poor spellers (left hemisphere learning disability),
practicing spelling for the spelling test, become increasingly dysphoric,
anxious, irritable, and dysattentive as the school year progresses. Some
will cry, show poor self-esteem and express death wishes. The repeated
attempts to perform language functions by these children stimulates
poorly functioning left cerebral hemisphere which leads to dysfunction of
the opposite right hemisphere areas with resultant depressive
symptomatology. These examples represent the interaction between
environmental stress and cerebral dysfunction.     
Right hemisphere learning-communication disorders (RHD) are characterized
by difficulties with social communication including social discomfort,
social dysemotionality, dysprosody (difficulties understanding the
gestures or speech tones of others, difficulties expressing appropriate
gesture or speech tones, or both), ordering problems (difficulties with
sequencing, timing, and context), motor and social dyspraxias
(clumsiness), disturbed attention (both hypovigilance and neglect),
difficulties with calculation  (dyscalculia for the sequencing of
numbers), and poor graphic skills (Table 8). Young people with right
hemisphere learning communication disorders, during adolescence and
adulthood, are at high risk for major depressive disorder often
exacerbated by the inappropriate stress promoted by education directed at their communication difficulties. This population can be divided into an under-expressive group (hypoprosodic; developmental expressive hypodysprosod
ia) and an over-expressive group (Asperger's Syndrome; developmental
expressive hyperdysprosodia). 

<p>In contrast, it is uncommon to see on a referred basis a pure left
hemisphere learning disability (<a hef="table8.html">Table 8</a>). Most,
if not all, children, adolescents, and young adults referred because of
school failure have evidence of bihemispheral (right and left cerebral
hemisphere) learning disorder. With sixty percent (60%) or greater of
these bihemispheral learning disabled children manifesting affective
illness, it is often the exacerbation of the affective illness that tips
the balance from marginal passing to failure. Within this context, there
are several major questions: "Why is this young person now depressed? Can
depression be induced or promoted by asking the right cerebral hemisphere
to do repetitively what it is unable to do? Is it likely that pure left
hemisphere disorders (pure 'classic' dyslexia; pure 'classic' dysphasia)
(Table 8), with no genetic basis for depression, will struggle in the
school setting but be free of depression? (Population studies of
non-referred young people suggest this interpretation). Does asking the
learning disabled individual to work repetitively at tasks he or she is
unable to do cause depression? Is there a biological basis for a
'reactive' depression?" 

<p>The multiple threshold theorem best explains induction of affective
illness. For those individuals with a high genetic load for depression
little or no environmental stressors are needed. These individuals will 
have spontaneous episodes of affective illness throughout their lives. In
contrast, for those individuals with a low genetic load, external factors
are important in the induction of a depressive or manic episode. Such
episodes can be induced by head trauma, viral encephalitis, medical
illnesses (including hyper-thyroidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
infectious mononucleosis), and various drugs and medications 
(including minor and major tranquilizers, anti-hypertensives, and
anti-convulsants). Inappropriate educational stress (as indicated above)
can also induce depression. Young people with specific learning 
disabilities who are failing in school and functioning poorly outside of
school must be considered to have depression until proven otherwise. The
treatment of specific learning disabilities should avoid induction of 
depression or worsening of other patterns of affective illness by
providing an appropriate educational environment. If manic or depressive
episodes occur, specific medical management should be undertaken 
(<a href="table9.html">Table 9</a>). 

<h3><a name="treatment"></a>Treatment of Depression, other Patterns<br>
of Affective Illness, and Specific Learning Disabilities </h3>

<p>Depression and other patterns of manic-depressive disease are chemical
disorders of the brain that can occur spontaneously or be promoted or
induced by other medical illnesses, drugs and medications, and
environmental events. Often the school environment is a major stressor
for the learning disabled individual. Treatment strategies for learning
disabled young people should address appropriate educational input/output
systems assuring success in school, including college preparatory and
college classes. The goal of formal education must be the acquisition and
utilization of meaningful information and the pursuit of the individual's
assets, talents, and creativity. The educator provides a structured and
disciplined environment to accomplish these goals. Reading, spelling,
numeric language, graphic skills, vocabulary, and word usage improve with
aging and maturation of the nervous system, something that cannot be
accelerated by remediation or other programs. Young people with specific
learning disabilities are willing, able, capable, and competent learners
if appropriate input/output systems are used. <a
href="table10.html">Table 10</a> summarizes the bypass/ compensatory
strategies and assistive technologies that must be implemented for the
learning disabled person to prevent the induction of affective illness
episodes.

<p>The management of children, adolescents, and young adults with
affective illness is multimodal (<a href="table9.html">Table 9</a>). They
must be informed about the nature, course, and treatment of this disease.
The environments must be supportive and r eassuring. There must be an
emphasis on positive interaction, and the individual must be assisted
with appropriate decision making. The depressed young person should not be allowed to "drop out" of usual pursuits.     

<p>Cognitive coaching on a "mini" daily basis should be offered by
parents and significant others (teachers, coaches, employers, or
friends). Cognitive coaching involves recognizing that actions should 
dictate feelings and intelligence should overrule emotions: "It is not
how one feels but it is how one acts"; "act positive-feel better"; "feel
sad and act sad, then you will be sad"; "feel sad and act happy, then you
will feel better"; "feel mad and act 
with anger, trouble!"; "feel mad and act civil, then good things can
happen". Clinical cognitive psychological counseling may be indicated for
both the individual and the primary caretakers (Wilkes and colleagues,
1994). The emphasis is for all concerned 
parties to act using intelligence and not emotions, with such interaction
being positive, rewarding, reassuring, and supportive, while
intelligently ignoring the disturbing mood or emotion. 

<p>The hallmark of successful treatment is for the brain to be free of
the "chemical imbalance" of affective illness. For this to occur, the
treatment should include appropriate medication management. Prior to
instituting antidepressant medication, it has become standard to obtain
an electrocardiogram (EKG). Complete blood count with differential, blood
chemistry profile, and thyroid profile are also often indicated
(particularly before use of antimanic drugs). An electroencephalogram
(EEG) is obtained if the person has had a seizure in the past, if there
is a positive family history for epilepsy, or prior to the use of 
antimanic drugs. Sometimes an EEG, CT scan, or MRI is indicated as a
result of abnormal neurologic findings.

<p>The drug management of depression, dysthymia, and cyclothymia with
prominent dysphoria continues to be with the first generation
antidepressants (tricyclic antidepressants) in children and young 
adolescents. The choice of drug is dependent upon the body type of the
individual and prior treatment response in family members. Amitriptyline
(Elavil) is the first choice in young people who are not overweight. If
not effective, this is followed by doxepin (Sinequan). These two
medications increase appetite and can increase weight. Imipramine
(Tofranil) followed by desipramine (Norpramin), the metabolite of
imipramine, are the first drugs in overweight young people. Nortriptyline
(Pamelor), the metabolite of amitriptyline (Elavil), is sometimes the
third choice but can also cause excessive weight gain. If the depressed
child or young adolescent does not respond to the above medications, the
third generation antidepressants are then offered. For most, we
use fluoxetine (Prozac) first, followed by sertraline (Zoloft).

<p> In mature adolescents and young adults with depression, dysthymia,
and cyclothymia with prominent dysphoria, the third generation
antidepressants are becoming the first choice rather than the tricyclic 
antidepressants. For those free of prominent hypomania or manic moods, we
prefer fluoxetine (Prozac), followed by sertaline (Zoloft) and then
either imipramine (Tofranil) (a first generation antidepressant), or 
paroxetine (Paxil). Adolescents manifesting dysthymia with bipolar
features, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar disorder, or cyclothymia are
initially offered imipramine (Tofranil) followed by sertaline (Zoloft), 
prior to antimanic medication.

<p>For successful management of depression and dysthymia in adolescents
and young adults, a combination of a third generation antidepressant and
a tricyclic is often needed. The third generation antidepressant is taken
in the morning and the tricyclic at bedtime.<p><a
href="table11.html">Table 11</a> lists the antidepressant medications,
the dosage range, serum levels, indications, contraindications, and
potential adverse effects. These medications are not approved by the FDA
for use in children less than 12 years of age, except for the use of
imipramine for bedwetting. However, they are successful in the treatment
of depression in all ages and their use has become a standard of practice.     

<p>There is a group of depressed learning disabled young people who also
have inherited the primary disorder of vigilance (<a
href="table7.html">Table 7</a>). If this group fails with the above
approach to drug management, protriptyline (Vivactil) is some
times successful. Occasionally a combination of protriptyline during
daytime hours with another tricyclic antidepressant at bedtime proves
beneficial.

<p>The treatment of mania in classic manic-depressive disease, juvenile
rapid cycling bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia will often require
antimanic drugs <a href="table12.html">(Table 12)</a>. However, we
continue to offer individuals 
with these patterns of affective illness an initial trial of
antidepressant medication. If manic symptomatology is promoted then
antimanic medication must be started. The antimanic drugs primarily 
used are carbamazepine (Tegretol) and lithium carbonate. If the manic
state is characterized primarily by hypomania and elated moods, then
lithium is the first choice. If the mania is manifested as hostile anger 
without elation, the first antirnanic drug is carbamazepine. Most
individuals whose mania is successfully controlled with lithium (or
carbamazepine) will require the addition of an antidepressant medication
to be free of depression.

<p>All the antidepressants can promote or induce mania Likewise, the
antimanic drugs can promote depression. For most depressed individuals,
an antidepressant medication will be successful. For some the 
addition of lithium or carbamazepine with the antidepressant will be
needed to achieve stable moods and good functioning.

<p>Serum medication levels are obtained during the course of treatment.
Repeat EKG, blood chemistries profile, and thyroid profile are performed
at appropriate intervals depending upon the medication being 
used and age of the patient. Frequently the young patient (and parents)
will ask: "Do I have to take medicine forever?" Our answer is 
"No." Once a well state is established for a period of 6-9 months,
medication can be tapered on a trial basis. Although affective illness is
a cyclic disorder, recurrent cycles can be expected but not anticipated
or predicted. Sometimes recurrence will be seasonal and on other
occasions associated with stressful events. If, with aging through
adolescence, the dysthymia, hypomania, cyclothymia, or rapid cycling 
bipolar disorder patterns do not stabilize, then appropriate medication
will be needed for a long period of time: "But nothing is forever."
However, individuals requiring and benefiting from lithium can anticipate
long term use of the medication.

<p>A complex issue is the treatment of attentional symptoms with the two
stimulant medications: methyl-phenidate (Ritalin) and pemoline (Cylert).
These two agents heighten vigilance and can be successfully used in the
management of the primary disorder of vigilance. They also lower the
hyperactivity of hypomania (<a href="table12.html">Table 12</a>). However,
these drugs can promote
depression. The mood disturbance ("rebound"), insomnia, and loss of
appetite associated with these two medications are symptomatic of an
underlying depression. Rarely are these two agents helpful in the
management of affectively-ill, learning-disabled young people. With aging
and freedom from depression, those with the primary disorder of vigilance
will stay busy to be alert, to learn, and to perform. If depression
occurs, appropriate antidepressant medication should lift the depression
thus restoring normal vigilance which was worsened by the depression. 

<h3><a name="summary"></a>Summary</h3>
<p>A common cause of school failure in learning disabled young people is
affective illness. Depression is generated by the right cerebral
hemisphere and manic symptoms by the left hemisphere. Affective illness
is a  genetic disorder that can present in several patterns: depression,
dysthymia, mania, hypomania, cyclothymia, juvenile rapid cycling bipolar
disorder, and classic manic-depressive disease. The treatment is
multimodal involving the use of appropriate medication in addition to
appropriate environmental (home and school) communication systems,
cognitive coaching, and counseling. Affective illness is recognizable, 
treatable, and should have a good prognosis.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER> How to  Participate Effectively in the IEP Process </h2><p>

<p>As the parent of a child with special education needs, you should
learn how to use the IEP (Individual Education Plan) process as an
effective tool to obtain appropriate special education and related
services for your child. 

<h3>You Should Know: </h3>
<ol>
<li>What an IEP is 
<li>How to prepare for an IEP meeting 
<li>What an IEP must include 
<li>How to write your own IEP input statement 
<li>How to participate effectively in an IEP meeting 
<li>How to use positive communication skills to build a cooperative
home/school relationship 
<li>How to obtain appropriate special education and related services for
your child through the IEP 
</ol>

<h3>What is an IEP? </h3>
<p>An IEP is a written document which is developed at an IEP meeting.
Federal Law requires that a written individual education plan (IEP) be
developed and reviewed annually. (121a. 344 PL 94-142) 

<h3>Preparation for the IEP Meeting</h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Obtain your  child's  school  records.</b>  The Family Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA) insures your right to examine school records, receive
an explanation of the contents,  challenge the contents, and obtain
copies of all records.  <b>Before</b> any IEP meeting, <b>all</b> records
maintained  by the school must be made available to you. [Access  Rights
(121a.502, 121a. 562)]
<br>
<li><b>Prepare a file of your child's evaluations. </b> Review the
school's diagnostic/eligibility written report. This report must contain
the nature of your child's disability, eligibility status,
classification, written observation reports, signatures of the school
team. (Review evaluation purpose 121a.500; 121a.530-532; SLD Regulations
of 12/29/77, 121a. 540-543) 
<br>
<li><b>List skills you believe your child is ready to learn or should
have learned. </b> This is especially important if you believe your child
has greater abilities than those stated by the school team. 
<br>
<li><b>Make an outline of what you believe your child's IEP should
contain </b>based upon your child's evaluations and consultation with
appropriate professionals. Remember to bring this file to the meeting. 
<br>
<li><b>Talk to other parents of children with specific learning
disabilities. </b> Learn as much as you can from them about their IEP
experiences. Contact your local LDA Unit. 
<br>
<li><b>The school must send you written notice of the IEP meeting.
</b>The time and place must be mutually convenient. The school must
indicate who will be in attendance. (121a.504-505; 121a.344-345) A copy
of  your  legal rights should be included in the written notice.
<br>
<li><b>Bring a friend, another parent, a relative or advocate  for
support.</b> Some parents feel overwhelmed at an IEP meeting. It may be
helpful to obtain a copy of the Federal Regulations to the Education of
the Handicapped Act,  PL 94-142, and your State Rules and guidelines for
Special Education. Also very helpful is a copy of <CITE>Interpretation of
the Individualized Education Program</CITE>, published by the U.S.
Department of Education in the  Federal Register. January 19, 1981. The
Federal sources are available through your Congressional representatives.
Your State Department of Education can provide you with state
information. You may also want to contact  your local LDA unit. 
</ol>

<h3>The IEP Meeting</h3>
<p>Participate in the IEP meeting confidently. It is your right and
obligation.
<ol> 
<li>The IEP meeting must include:
<ul>
<li>A representative of the school, other than the child's teacher, who
is qualified to provide, or supervise the  provision of special
education. The representative must have the capacity to commit the agency
resources so that whatever services are set out in the IEP will not be
vetoed at a higher administrative level within the agency. (Federal
Register 1/19/81, #13) 
<br>
<li>The child's (student's) teacher 
<br>
<li>One or both of the student's parent(s) or guardian 
<br>
<li>The student, where appropriate, as determined by the parent(s)
(Federal Register 1/19/81 #13) 
<br>
<li>For a handicapped student who has been evaluated for the first time,
the school must include someone who is knowledgeable about the evaluation
procedure used with the child and is familiar with the results of the
evaluation. [121a.344 (b)(2)] 
<br>
<li>Other individuals at the discretion of the parent or agency.
<br> 
</ul>
<li>Parents have a right to clear explanations in everyday language. Do
not hesitate to ask for clarifications if needed. 
<br>
<li>Parents may tape IEP meetings (Federal Register 1/19/81 #12)
<br>
<li>An IEP must be agreed upon (and short term instructional objectives
written) before special education and related services are provided to a
handicapped child. The extent and duration of both regular and special
education and related services must be written at the initial meeting. 
<br>
<li>An IEP must be in effect within 30 days of determination of
eligibility and thereafter at the beginning of each school year.<br>
<li>Special education also includes access to vocational education with
appropriate modifications, accommodations and remedial services. (121a.
143; Federal Register 1/19/81 #50) <br>
<li>Ask for a copy of the IEP. <br>
<li>An IEP can be revised if you feel it is not working.<br>
<li>IEP meetings can be called at the request of the parent or the
school.<br>
<li>Federal regulations do not require parental signature on the IEP.
</ol>
<h3>Your Child's IEP Should Consist of: </h3>
<ul>
<li>A statement of your child's present educational  performance level<br>
<li>A statement of annual goals, including short term instructional
objectives<br>
<li>Specific special education and related services to be provided and a
statement of the extent to which your child will participate in regular
education programs<br>
<li>The dates for initiation of services and the anticipated duration of
services<br>
<li>Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and
schedules for determining at least annually, whether instructional
objectives are being achieved <br>
<li>All accommodations and modifications necessary for participation in
regular education programs (Federal Register 1/19/81 #48)<br>
<li>A statement of the least restrictive environment (LRE) 
</ul>
<p>An <b>annual goal</b> is a general statement of desired changes and
progress through the year. Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"To increase ______'s word analysis skills from 2.1 to 3.4 as measured by
the  ______test(s)"
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>A <b>short term instructional objective</b> is a measurable,
intermediate step between a child's present level of performance and the
annual goal established. The objectives are based upon the logical
breakdown of the major components of the annual goals and serve as
milestones for measuring progress towards  meeting the  goals. They
describe what the child is to accomplish in a particular area within a
time specified period (Federal Register 1/19/81 #39)
<p>These objectives direct the sequential efforts for closing the gap
between the child's indicated ability and his functioning.
<p>Examples:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>"________ will be able to discriminate between the short 'i' and short
'e' sounds. By mid-October, orally given 20 new words containing the
short 'e' and short 'i' sounds, _____will respond with 85% accuracy."
<p>"________ will be able to analyze the syllables in multisyllabic words.
By November 15, ________ will be able to identify the number of syllables
in a list of 25 new mullisyllabic words presented visually with 90%
accuracy."
<p>"________ will continue work on basic subtraction concepts, fractions
(understanding equivalent), and addition facts through 20. By January,  
________ will be able to define and explain the terms numerator and 
denominator and will add fractions with 
like denominators with 90% accuracy."
<p>"By mid November, ________ will show increased ability to attend in
group work settings as determined by both  ________'s self monitoring
records and teachers independent probes as demonstrated by a 40% increase
in attending behavior."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<h3>Your Child's IEP can be implemented through:</h3>
<ul>
<li>A regular class in a public school, with appropriate supportive
related services
<br>
<li>A special class in a public school, with appropriate supportive
related services, as necessary
<br>
<li>A special public high school
<br>
<li>A special education program in private day or residential school
which meets state standards
<br>
<li>A home or hospital program
<br>
<li>A special education program in a residential facility
</ul>
<p><B>Appropriately related/supportive services must be provided to meet
your child's needs as indicated in the IEP.</b>
<p><b>These include, but are not limited to:</b> (121a.13)
<ul>
<li>Speech and language services<br>
<li>Psychological services, social work services, counseling services<br>
<li>Special readers, braillists, typists, and interpreters <br>
<li>Physical and occupational therapy, adaptive physical education, and
other necessary therapeutic services <br>
<li>Consultative services <br>
<li>Supportive institutional services <br>
<li>Medical services for evaluation and diagnostic purposes, and school health nurses <br>
<li>Parent counseling and training <br>
<li>Resource Centers <br>
<li>Transportation services <br>
<li>Vocational Education
</ul>

<p>The need for related services is determined by an appropriate
evaluation of the child's needs. If you feel your child is in need of a
specific related service, and it is not included, you should request an
evaluation in that specific area.
<p>The IEP should state each needed related service, the <b>date</b> of
the initiation or the service, prescribed time(s) per week (days(s)).
person(s) to render service, and the anticipated duration. The IEP should
state whether the service  will be  provided on a one-to-one basis, in a
group, or only by consultation with the classroom teacher. Example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Speech and language remediation for 15 minutes daily on a one-to-one
basis and 25 minutes three times per week in a group of no more than
three children with similar language needs with the Speech and Language
Pathologist.
</blockquote>
<p>When requesting related services, you should base your request on the
premise that your child needs a given service in order to benefit from
his/her special educational program.
<p><b>Your child should receive appropriate non-academic and extracurricular
services</b> (Federal Register 1/19/81 #48, 49, 50)
<ul>
<li>Adaptive physical education (OT/PT) <br>
<li>Music, art, home economics, shop <br>
<li>Other non-academic subjects that other children in your school are
receiving <br>
<li>Recreational opportunities that other children in your school are
receiving
</ul>

<h3>Parents and Professionals May Disagree</h3>
<p>The law insures a process for resolving differences. It you cannot
come to an agreement you may request another meeting. Do not feel
pressured  to make a decision immediately. You might wish to initial
those areas with which you agree and request a 30 day interim IEP.
(Federal Register 1/19/81 #35) 
<p><b>Independent Evaluations</b><br>
Parents may obtain an independent evaluation and request another meeting
based on the new evaluation. Consult PL 94-142 section 121a.503 and page
52511 for additional information. Independent evaluations that seek a
diagnosis of the disability can frequently be financed through third
party (insurance) carriers if the evaluations are obtained through
professionals such as clinics, psychologists, pediatricians, neurologists
etc. Specific Learning Disabilities are recognized medical conditions. 
<p><b>Complaints</b><br>
If needed services are not provided in the IEP or recommendations from an
independent evaluation are not considered you may file a complaint with
your State Department of Education (seeking mediation) (121a.602 and
EDGAR) or file for a Due Process Hearing. (121a.506-513)*

<title>Secondary Education &amp; beyond - Writing IEPs: Part I</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="F0F0F0">
<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>
<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>Writing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) For Success - Part I</h3>
<p><b>Barbara D. Bateman,  Ph.D., J.D.</b>
<p><em>Due to the length, this paper is presented in three parts:</em>
<dl>
 <dd><em>Part I (this part)</em>
 <dd><em><A href="bateman2.html">Part II</a></em>
 <dd><em><A href="bateman3.html">Part III</a></em>
</dl>

The post-school success rates of students who have learning 
disabilities, as a group, have not been what we would all hope even 
though many individuals have been highly successful. A recent focus 
on greater school responsibility for the post-school life of students 
who have disabilities has resulted in new transition requirements. 
The purpose of this discussion is to present a different approach to 
writing IEPs, with special attention to the transition component This 
approach results in IEPs which, unlike most IEPs, are both 
educationally useful and legally correct.
<h4>THE PROMISE</h4>
<p>
After nearly seventeen years of life the Individual Education Program 
(IEP)-- the heart and soul of the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act (IDEA) -- is still in it's infancy, it's great 
potential unrealized and unappreciated. The IEP process and product 
frequently have been distorted beyond recognition. The purpose of this 
discussion is to show how the IEP process can work to produce IEPs 
that are both educationally useful and legally correct. The essence 
of legal correctness is that the IEP is tailored precisely to all the
unique needs of the individual student. The core of educational 
utility is that the IEP spells out precisely how the school district 
will address each and every unique need and how it will determine 
whether and when a change in strategy or service is required. The IEP 
process must determine: 
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 
  <dd>which needs or characteristics of the
      student require special education, i.e., individualization of 
      services; 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
  <dd>Precisely how the district will address each need, i.e., "what 
      special education, related services or modifications it will 
      provide; and 
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
  <dd>how and when the efficacy of those services will be evaluated. 
</dl>
The IEP process must include the parent (or parent/student) as a full 
and equal partner, and a student whose IEP addresses "transition" 
must be invited to participate in the IEP process and must have her 
or his preferences and interests considered. These transition concerns 
and processes are a special focus of this discussion.
<h4>THE PRACTICE</h4>
<p>
Most IEPs are useless or slightly worse, and too many teachers experience the
IEP process as always time consuming, sometimes threatening, and, too often, a
pointless bureaucratic requirement. The result is a quasi-legal document to be
filed away with the expectation it won't be seen again except, heaven forbid,
by a monitor or compliance officer. The point of the IEP exercise seems to be
to complete the given form in a way that commit the district to as little as
possible, and which precludes, as much as possible, any meaningful discussion
or evaluation of the student's real progress.
<p>
Parents too often experience, the IEP process as an overgrown parent-teacher
conference in which the school personnel present some previously prepared
papers and request a signature. They may be told a few things about some
"rights." Parents who attempt to participate as equals are often intimidated
into acquiescence. They are frequently given false and outrageous distortions
such as, "We (the district) don't provide individual tutoring"; or "Speech
therapy is always done by the regular classroom teacher and the speech
therapist provides consultation services to her"; or "We are a full inclusion
school and have no special classes or resource rooms because we don't believe
in pull-out programs." When such limiting and blatantly illegal practices are
presented as if they are simple fact few parents are adequately prepared to
challenge the district.
<h4>A BETTER WAY</h4>
<p>
The IEP process and product can be both educationally useful and legally
correct. The first step toward that end is for the district to provide an
appropriate time and place for the IEP meeting, The place should be physically
comfortable and the meeting time and length appropriate. The law requires the
meeting be at a mutually agreed on time and place. Too often parents are not
aware they have any say in either. Districts must also be careful to avoid
unrealistically short meetings, especially for initial, complex or disputed
IEPs.
<p>
The only legitimate focus of an IEP meeting is on the special needs of the
student and how those are to be addressed. There may be a temptation for
district personnel to sidestep into policy explanations or justifications or
into what the parents have done or not done. If the student is not present at
the IEP meeting a strategically placed photo of the youngster can serve to
help all participants stay focused on the needs of that student. Many IEP
meetings lose this essential focus and wander, becoming inefficient and
frustrating for all.
<p>
The single most important principle of the IEP process is that the school must
appropriately address all the student's unique needs <em>without regard to the
availability of needed services</em>. Prior to the passage of IDEA (then P.L.
94-142) in 1975, schools were legally free to offer only the programs or
services, if any, they had available. Parents were supposed to be grateful for
anything at all that was provided. The primary purpose of the law was to turn
that squarely around and <em>entitle</em> the student who has a disability to
a free appropriate education individually designed to meet her or his unique
needs. Educators who have entered the field in the last twenty years lack this
historical perspective and too easily revert to the pre-IDEA mentality of
trying to stretch existing programs and services to fit the students. Instead
they must start with the student and design services to fit the student's
needs, however unique they may be.
<h4>THE PARTICIPANTS</h4>
<p>
Sometimes parents report that only a teacher was at the IEP meeting; other
times a seeming army of district personnel confront them. The law specifies
that in addition to the parent and student (if the parent so wishes) a teacher
of the student and a district representative must be present. The IDEA
regulations allow the district substantial discretion in determining which
teacher will be at the IEP meeting. Since, in theory, the IEP team is
addressing the student's needs above all, it would seem reasonable to select a
teacher who knows the student well. In addition, at least one team member
<em>must</em> be qualified (by state standards) in the area of the student's
disability. If this is not the teacher, it must be the district representative
(<em>Mcintire, 16 EHLR 163, (OSEP, 1990)</em>). Students at middle school or
high school most often have several teachers. The law does not require that
they all attend, but good special education practice suggests their input
should be sought and they most certainly should be informed of the IEP's
provisions.
<p>
The district representative must provide or be qualified to supervise special
education, have the authority to allocate district resources, and be able to
guarantee no administrative veto) of the IEP team's decisions (34 CFR Part 300
Appendix C, 13). These qualifications are the law's way of insuring that the
IEP team, and it alone, has the power to determine what services the student
needs and, therefore, will receive. The evaluation team, often called the
multi-disciplinary team, determines eligibility, but only recommends services.
<p>
All members of the IEP team should remember the enormous power and
responsibility that is theirs. When the IEP specifies a service is needed, the
district must provide it. Too often parents are given a very different
impression, i.e., that only what is already available can be provided and
often in smaller than needed amounts. This critical difference between the law
and practice is typified by the common situation, e.g., where the parent
believes the student who has a learning disability needs intensive,
individual, daily language therapy and is told by the speech therapist that
since the therapist is only in that building on Mondays and Wednesdays the
student will be included in an ongoing 20 minute speech therapy group on those
two days.
<p>
In addition to the parent (and perhaps student), teacher, and the district
representative, the first IEP meeting for a given student must be attended by
a member of the evaluation team or someone familiar with the evaluation. In
addition, either the district or the parent may invite anyone else. The
district must, however, inform the parent ahead of time of all district
invited persons who will be at the IEP meeting. There is no similar
requirement for parents to inform the district of anyone they may invite.
<p>
The fact the law does not require related services personnel to be present may
be highly significant. The IDEA regulations (34 CFR Part 300 Appendix C,
Question 23) advise that related service personnel provide written
recommendations to the IEP team about the nature, frequency and amount of
service to be provided. Arguably, there is no requirement that goals and
objectives are necessary for related services. If related service goals and
objectives are required they may be of the sort a teacher and parent could
write. Since related services include only those necessary to enable the
student to benefit from special education it stands to reason that the goals
and objectives to be accomplished by the related services would appear as
goals for the special education services. The focus on the related services
components of the IEP is on specifying the amount of service and the outcome
is reflected in the goals and objectives for special education. The related
services are not ends in themselves, but rather enablers.
<h4>CONTENTS OF THE IEP</h4>
<p>
The federal requirements for the contents of the IEP are straightforward. The
individualized education program for each child must include:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)
<dd>A statement of the student's present levels of education performance;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)
<dd>A statement of annual goals, including short term instructional
objectives;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)
<dd>A statement of the specific special education and related services to
be provided to the student, and the extent to which the student will be able
to participate in regular educational programs;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)
<dd>A statement of the needed transition services for students beginning
no later than age 16 and annually thereafter (and if determined appropriate
for an individual student, beginning at age 14, or younger), including, if
appropriate, a statement of each public agency's and each participating
agency's responsibilities or linkages, or both, before the student leaves the
school setting;
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)
<dd>The projected dates for initiation of services and the anticipated
duration of the services; and
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)
<dd>Appropriate objective criteria and evaluation procedures and schedules
for determining, on at least an annual basis, whether the short term
instructional objectives are being achieved. (34-CFR 300.346).
</dl>
<h4>LEGAL RULINGS ON IEPS</h4>
<p>
These five general principles, among others, emerge clearly from a review of
the hundreds of past IEP rulings from agencies and courts:
<dl COMPACT>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)
<dd><em>All</em> of a student's unique needs must be addressed, not just her
or his academic needs, e.g., <em>Russell v. Jefferson Sch. Dist.</em>, 609 F.
Supp. 605,
(N.D. CA 1985); <em>Abrahamson v. Hershman</em>, 701 F.2nd 223, (1st Cir.
1983). Arguably, no "non-unique" needs have to be addressed.
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
<dd>The availability of services may not be considered in writing the IEP. If
a service is needed it must be written on the IEP and if the district does not
have it available, it must be provided by another agency. One of the earliest
of all the agency rulings mandated that availability of services be
disregarded in writing the IEP (<em>Leconte</em>, EHLR 211:146, OSEP, 1979).
This principle has been reiterated repeatedly by the Office of Special
Education and Rehabilitative Services (OSERS) and the Office of Special
Education Programs (OSEP) and virtually ignored by the field.
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3)
<dd>The IEP is a firm, legally binding "commitment of resources." The district
must provide the services listed or the IEP must be amended (<em>Beck</em>,
EHLR 211:145 (OSEP 1979)).
<br>
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)
<dd>IEPs must be individualized. The same goals, same content areas, same
discipline or the same amounts of therapy on many IEPs (e.g., every student
who receives speech therapy in a particular building receives 30 minutes
daily) reveals a violation of this individualization requirement (<em>Tucson,
AZ Unified Sch. Dist. #1</em>, EHLR 352.547 (OCR 1987)).
<dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<dd>(5) All of the components of the IEP required by law
(e.g., goals and objectives, specific special education and related services)
must be present.

Children And Youth<br> 
With Learning Disabilities<br>
Achieve Independence</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<h2>Self-Esteem</h2>

<p>Treat your child as a whole person. Do not dwell on the problem. Help
them develop the same behaviors that you expect from other children.

<p>Help your child understand his or her disability and put it in perspective.
The more you accept that L.D. is just part of the individual, the more
the person can accept him or herself.

<p>Never let the disability become an excuse for not trying. Allow your
child to try, and even fail sometimes, since that's what life is also like.

<p>Involve your children in decision making. This can be anything from
deciding which watermelon to pick to choosing a vacation route. Allow them
to make the small decisions so they will be ready for the big ones. 
<br>

<h2>Social/Emotional</h2>

<p>Teach your child the rules of polite behavior, such as a good
handshake, the importance of eye contact, to wait until another has
stopped before speaking. 

<p>Share your own feelings with your children. Telling them, &quot;I am
angry.&quot; &quot;I am worried&quot;, &quot;I am happy&quot;, helps him/
her understand how faces and bodies look when someone is feeling a certain
way.

<p>Help your children participate in clubs or activities so they can
develop skills in areas along with others. Avoid too many extra-curricular
activities that create undue competition. Choose activities that will
help build self esteem and that may someday help with career choices. 

<br>

<h2>Self-Help</h2>

<p>Teach good grooming. Pick a hair style that is easy to comb; choose
color coordinated clothes, and then teach how to take care of clothes and
personal items.

<p>Help your child learn organizational skills. Start early with sorting
objects such as silverware. Plan for the next day the night before. Make
daily lists and plans. As skill increases, teach how a calendar is used
for planning ahead.

<p>Teach time management so he/she can learn to determine how long it will
take to get ready for class or a date. Help with developing a weekly schedule.
Color code different times, i.e. Green - study time, Blue - T.V., Red -
classes etc.

<p>Teach or find someone to teach such skills as telling time, how to prepare
food, basic car maintenance, to answer the phone, take messages, balance
a checkbook. Think of things you have to be able to do. Pick one skill
and teach it. Then pick another. In other words, teach your child the skills
needed to live independently. 

<p>Subscribe to appropriate magazines and publications that will keep him
or her updated on current clothing, movies, music, etc. 

<br>

<h2>Academic</h2>

<p>Keep copies of all school and psychological reports. You may need them
later to get services for your child.

<p>Don't become overly involved in the child's homework. Guidance and support
is needed but it is difficult to be both parent and teacher.

<p>If your child wants a college education start to investigate college
programs in his/her freshman year. It will take time and good programs
fill early. Help him/her ask good questions about the programs provided.

<p>Encourage students to volunteer at a nursing home, your church or  
synagogue, or with an environmental group. Such places are non-threatening
and help develop social skills.

<p>If he or she has chosen a vocation instead, consider having a career
counselor help with the decisions. There are also programs to help the
student in on the job training. 

<p>Never limit your children. Don't tell them they can't enter an occupation
because of the disability. There are more and more opportunities developing
for people with learning disabilities.

<p>Involve yourself. Find out about local, state and national conferences.
They are good sources of information and literature. So is the library.
Find support groups such as LDA. The more you know, the more effectively
you can help your child.

<title>Glossary of Learning Disabilities Terms</title>
</head>
<body  bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<h1>Glossary of some learning disabilities terms</h1>

<p><b>ACCOMMODATIONS.</b> Techniques and materials that allow individuals
with LD to complete school or work tasks with greater ease and
effectiveness. Examples include spellcheckers, tape recorders,
and expanded time for completing assignments.

<p><b>ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY.</b> Equipment that enhances the ability of
students and employees to be more efficient and successful. For
individuals with LD, computer grammar checkers, an overhead
projector used by a teacher, or the audiovisual information
delivered through a CD-ROM would be typical examples.

<p><b>ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER (ADD).</b> A severe difficulty in focusing
and maintaining attention. Often leads to learning and behavior
problems at home, school, and work. Also called Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

<p><b>BRAIN IMAGING TECHNIQUES.</b> Recently developed, noninvasive
techniques for studying the activity of living brains. Includes
brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM), computerized axial
tomography (CAT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

<p><b>BRAIN INJURY.</b> The physical damage to brain tissue or structure
that occurs before, during, or after birth that is verified by
EEG, MRI, CAT, or a similar examination, rather than by
observation of performance. When caused by an accident, the
damage may be called Traumatic Brain Injury  (TBI).

<p><b>COLLABORATION.</b> A program model in which the LD teacher
demonstrates for or team teaches with the general classroom
teacher to help a student with LD be successful in a regular
classroom.

<p><b>DEVELOPMENTAL APHASIA.</b> A severe language disorder that is
presumed to be due to brain injury rather than because of a
developmental delay in the normal acquisition of language.

<p><b>DIRECT INSTRUCTION.</b> An instructional approach to academic
subjects that emphasizes the use of carefully sequenced steps
that include demonstration, modeling, guided practice, and
independent application.

<p><b>DYSCALCULIA.</b> A severe difficulty in understanding and using
symbols or functions needed for success in mathematics.

<p><b>DYSGRAPHIA.</b> A severe difficulty in producing handwriting that is
legible and written at an age-appropriate speed.

<p><b>DYSLEXIA.</b> A severe difficulty in understanding or using one or
more areas of language, including listening, speaking, reading,
writing, and spelling.

<p><b>DYSNOMIA.</b> A marked difficulty in remembering names or recalling
words needed for oral or written language.

<p><b>DYSPRAXIA.</b> A severe difficulty in performing drawing, writing,
buttoning, and other tasks requiring fine motor skill, or in
sequencing the necessary movements.

<p><b>LEARNED HELPLESSNESS.</b> A tendency to be a passive learner who
depends on others for decisions and guidance. In individuals with
LD, continued struggle and failure can heighten this lack of
self-confidence.

<p><b>LEARNING MODALITIES.</b> Approaches to assessment or instruction
stressing the auditory, visual, or tactile avenues for learning
that are dependent upon the individual.

<p><b>LEARNING STRATEGY APPROACHES.</b> Instructional approaches that focus
on efficient ways to learn, rather than on curriculum. Includes
specific techniques for organizing, actively interacting with
material, memorizing, and monitoring any content or subject.

<p><b>LEARNING STYLES.</b> Approaches to assessment or instruction
emphasizing the variations in temperament, attitude, and
preferred manner of tackling a task. Typically considered are
styles along the active/passive, reflective/impulsive, or
verbal/spatial dimensions. 

<p><b>LOCUS OF CONTROL.</b> The tendency to attribute success and
difficulties either to internal factors such as effort or to
external factors such as chance. Individuals with learning
disabilities tend to blame failure on themselves and achievement
on luck, leading to frustration and passivity.

<p><b>METACOGNITIVE LEARNING.</b> Instructional approaches emphasizing
awareness of the cognitive processes that facilitate one's own
learning and its application to academic and work assignments.
Typical metacognitive techniques include systematic rehearsal of
steps or conscious selection among strategies for completing a
task.

<p><b>MINIMAL BRAIN DYSFUNCTION (MBD).</b> A medical and psychological term
originally used to refer to the learning difficulties that seemed
to result from identified or presumed damage to the brain.
Reflects a medical, rather than educational or vocational
orientation.

<p><b>MULTISENSORY LEARNING.</b> An instructional approach that combines
auditory, visual, and tactile elements into a learning task.
Tracing sandpaper numbers while saying a number fact aloud would
be a multisensory learning activity.

<p><b>NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL EXAMINATION.</b> A series of tasks that allow
observation of performance that is presumed to be related to the
intactness of brain function.

<p><b>PERCEPTUAL HANDICAP.</b> Difficulty in accurately processing,
organizing, and discriminating among visual, auditory, or tactile
information. A person with a perceptual handicap may say that
"cap/cup" sound the same or that "b" and "d" look the same.
However, glasses or hearing aids do not necessarily indicate a
perceptual handicap.

<p><b>PREREFERRAL PROCESS.</b> A procedure in which special and regular
teachers develop trial strategies to help a student showing
difficulty in learning remain in the regular classroom.

<p><b>RESOURCE PROGRAM.</b> A program model in which a student with LD is
in a regular classroom for most of each day, but also receives
regularly scheduled individual services in a specialized LD
resource classroom.

<p><b>SELF-ADVOCACY.</b> The development of specific skills and
understandings that enable children and adults to explain their
specific learning disabilities to others and cope positively with
the attitudes of peers, parents, teachers, and employers.

<p><b>SPECIFIC LANGUAGE DISABILITY (SLD).</b> A severe difficulty in some
aspect of listening, speaking, reading, writing, or spelling,
while skills in the other areas are age-appropriate. Also called
Specific Language Learning Disability  (SLLD).

<p><b>SPECIFIC LEARNING DISABILITY (SLD).</b> The official term used in
federal legislation to refer to difficulty in certain areas of
learning, rather than in all areas of learning. Synonymous with
learning disabilities.

<p><b>SUBTYPE RESEARCH.</b> A recently developed research method that seeks
to identify characteristics that are common to specific groups
within the larger population of individuals identified as having
learning disabilities.

<p><b>TRANSITION.</b> Commonly used to refer to the change from secondary
school to postsecondary programs, work, and independent living
typical of young adults. Also used to describe other periods of
major change such as from early childhood to school or from more
specialized to mainstreamed settings.

Does <i>your</i> child have a problem?<br>
Perhaps we can help</p>

<hr width="75%">

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="1">Who has learning disabilities?</a></h2>

<p>Your chances of knowing him are very good: people like him may make up
at least 10% of the population, cutting across every segment of the
population. Can we afford the loss of the talents and contributions of
this proportion of the population? Of even one person?

<p>This is the bright little boy who started first grade expecting to
learn to read, but he didn't. <b>He couldn't. He has one kind of learning
disability.</b> His very serious problem is dyslexia - impairment of the
ability to read - which can damage his performance in every other
academic area. Fortunately, there is hope. He can be taught to
compensate. He can reach his potential, if only someone will understand
and do something.

<p>Through no fault of his own, a child like this is handicapped. He
needs special help, but because his handicap cannot be seen, he often
does not receive assistance. The pressure on him to perform like other
normal children is tremendous. He wants to understand and tries to, but
he fails. He cannot solve his perplexing problem: that takes a trained
professional. It is urgent to get that professional and this child
together, before the child gives up.

<p>Once the problem has been identified, remediation has begun and
compensation is implemented in the classroom, the person can begin to
help himself to rebuild his fading self esteem.

<h4>How to identify a person with learning disabilities:</h4>

<blockquote>
<b>Any unexplained, persistent problem in learning a basic skill
necessary for survival as an independent adult may be a clue to learning
disabilities in a person of normal to superior intelligence.</b>
</blockquote>

<p>Learning disabilities should be considered as a possible cause if a
child has trouble with one or more of the following:
<ul>
  <li>thinking clearly
  <li>writing legibly
  <li>spelling accurately
  <li>learning to read
  <li>learning to compute
  <li>copying forms
  <li>remembering facts
  <li>following directions
  <li>putting things in sequence
</ul>

<p>or, if he is often confused, clumsy, impulsive, hyperactive, or
disoriented, becoming frustrated and rebellious, depressed, withdrawn, or
aggressive.

<p><b>A learning disability (LD)</b> is  a lifelong disorder which
affects the manner in which individuals with normal or above average
intelligence select, retain, and express information.  Incoming or
outgoing information may become scrambled as it travels
between the senses and the brain.

<p>In adults, learning disabilities are commonly recognized as deficits
in one or more of the following academic areas: 

<ul>
  <li>comprehension
  <li>spelling
  <li>written expression
  <li>problem solving
  <li>math computation
</ul>

<p>Less frequent, but no less troublesome, are problems in organizational
skill, time management, and social skills. Many adults with learning
disabilities may also have language based and/or perceptual processing problems.

<p align=center><a href="#TOP">top</a>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="3">Educating Persons  with Learning Disabilities</a></h2>

<h3>How much does it cost to educate a person with learning
disabilities?</h3>

<p>It costs very little compared to the cost of <b><i>not</i></b>
educating him. In every community offering appropriate services, examples
of successful remediation can be found, some in college and some in the
adult world.  

<p><b>The Schools</b><br> 
Public schools are required by law to provide persons with learning
disabilities with a free, appropriate education. Good school systems are
working in compliance with the law. Good professionals are dedicated to
careful diagnosis and quality remediation. Programs and services for
persons with learning disabilities are mandated through high school age and beyond, and should be available. 

<p><b>Finding the Right Educational Program </b>
<ul>
<li>Become involved in your child's school program. Meet with the
classroom teacher and request a student study team meeting.  Write a
letter to the school principal stating that your child may have a
specific learning disability, and requesting a comprehensive evaluation,
to be followed by an Individualized Educational Program (IEP) meeting.
<b>Keep copies of all correspondence with the school and a record of the
dates and contents of all telephone conversations.</b> You legally have
access to your child's file at the school and may request copies of his
records.<br>

<li>Contact a local LDA chapter, state office, or the national office for
specific learning disabilities and procedural information.<br>

<li>Pinpoint the problem. Arrange for a thorough physical evaluation,
including vision and hearing. Consider the need for assessment of
receptive and/or expressive language problems, and visual perception
difficulties.
</ul>

<p><b>Parent Advocates</b><br> 
Local LDA chapters usually have experienced volunteers who know the
special education laws, professional language, appropriate tests for
specific learning disabilities, the types of special education programs,
and the schools and school systems. Individuals like these are ready to
serve as resource persons and can provide information to parents about
advocacy resources.

<h3>The high school, college, and vocational student with learning
disabilities</h3>

<p>The student with learning disabilities may require a variety of
services which can include: tutorial services, special academic
advisement, basic skill remediation, assistance in organization and
development of adequate study skills, and additional program
accommodation, or modification. Some students with learning disabilities
may not require extensive use of personnel, extra funds, or assistance
from professors, but may need appropriate program modifications and use
of auxiliary aids. These include readers, scribes, note takers, extended
time policies for assigned papers, projects, or tests, and taped books or
lectures. 

<p>However, it must be noted that these services are designed to
<b>equalize</b> opportunities, not to lower the academic standards for
these students or to alter the essential nature of the degree
requirements. There are, however, instances where a student is unable to
master a particular course because of his disability. In those cases,
course substitutions may be in order if the course in question is not
essential to the degree program or related to a licensing requirement.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="4">Through A Child’s Eyes</a></h2>

<h3><i>A candid look at</i><br>A Family of Children with Learning
Disabilities</H3>

<p><i>Twelve year old Bobby would be glad to write or tell this true
story if he could, but the words wouldn't come out right for him even if
he tried. Let's look at this frankly through his eyes, though:</i>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I'm in the sixth grade now and am doing O.K., I think. I'm the lucky
one of the family for two of my three older brothers had a pretty rough
time in school. I'd like to talk about me first. I can remember when I
was little I used to say to my folks, "I hear you but I don't understand
you." Even now, I have to listen "hard" in school and at home I just plain
don't "dig" the T.V. stories sometimes. It's kind of funny though as my
oldest brother who is twenty eight often has to ask his wife what happened 
on the T.V. show even yet. When I hear him still ask questions I don't
feel so dumb because I know he isn't dumb.

<p>My mother tells me I am really doing great now in what I think of
"Me".  I used to always say "I'm stupid." Seems like I just couldn't get
 along with the kids either. They used to call me dumb lots of times. I
could get along with grown-ups a lot easier, now I'm doing better with
the kids since I'm older.

<p>I do O.K. with my teachers. They know I really try. I can 
still remember way back in the first grade when I used to "scrub"
my pencil across the paper. Sometimes I did it all day; I just couldn't 
do anything the other kids did and that really made me mad. I couldn't 
read either.

<p>In the second grade I started getting lots of extra help. 
I began to find I really could learn but it just took a lot longer 
for me. I had a very special kind of help in reading. I have trouble 
even yet, but I'm coming along slowly. My twenty-one year old brother 
still has lots of problems with reading and spelling, yet he is really 
sharp in lots of ways. He understands everything very quickly that 
he hears; he's just a lot better "listener" than I am.

<p>My writing is something else. I asked my teacher one day 
whether she wanted me to write fast and sloppy or slow and neat. She 
is great though as she told me to just do the best I can. I took private 
typing lessons all last year and that has really helped me out in 
my school work.

<p>I do try hard and when I have a nice teacher like I have 
now, somehow I seem to plug right along. I still need lots of help 
at home though. I can read better now but I just can't keep up with 
the books in my grade. All my books except math and grammar are on 
tapes. My mother is a special teacher, herself, and has helped me 
all these years. If we ever get so we can't work together we agreed 
we'd find someone else to help me.

<p>We are an unusual family. Even though three of us four 
boys have problems in learning, all my older brothers are making it 
OK in college. Some of them started kind of late, but they are still 
at it.

<p>They do one of the things I'm doing already, like listening to books
on tapes. Of course I'm one ahead of them since I can type already. One
of my brothers has some pretty girl in his college class taking notes for
him on what is said in class for he spells so bad he can't read his own
notes. Then in the subjects that he has a lot of reading to do, my mother types out notes for him to study. All my brothers use the tape recorder in their classes sometimes, but they say it takes so long to listen to the
tapes again that they sometimes run out of time. I'll probably do that
when I get older,but right now I don't want to as I'm afraid the kids
will tease me. I don't like to be too different than the other kids.

<p>Little by little I'm beginning to think "I'm OK" and I already know my
brothers are "OK". We just laugh like when one of my brothers puts the new
house numbers on in the wrong order. Another brother turns the valves on
our swimming pool the wrong direction. Then my oldest brother gets lost a
lot when he is driving someplace. He acts just like my mother does behind
the wheel. We kid a lot about the funny things we do sometimes. It helps
me to laugh at my own goofs. We are all sort of like fish in the water,
but you should see us on dry land. Football, basketball, tennis  --  you
name it -- they just aren't our bag. Our family sort of pulls together; I
guess that is the main thing.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="5">Parent’s Creed</a></h2>

<p><b>THE PARENTS</b><br>
They told them she would <B><i>"grow out of it"</i></B> so they waited
another year.

<p>Baffled by their problems, parents seek advice but often in the wrong
places. Even if they have raised other children who were academically
successful and even if they are convinced that parents are
<b><i>experts</i></b> in knowing their own children, 
their self confidence vanishes. They feel helpless as they suffer with,
for, or because of these youngsters.

<p>Another year of failure goes by, leaving its scars on a sensitive
mind.

<p><b>Identification... from infancy to adulthood.</b><br>
From infancy, parents should be checking the child's progress against the
norms for his age group, using any good reference on child development. If there are continuing deviations, 
they should discuss them with a trusted professional. Most school
districts have pre primary diagnostic clinics and special education programs, if needed. Early remediation is best, but 
later is better than none -- even much later. LDA can provide information
for adults with learning disabilities.

<p><b>Not one person of normal intelligence should be sent into today's
job market without basic academic survival skills.</b>

<p>Yesterday's person with a learning disability entered a simpler adult
society, often at a younger age. Some who were unusually gifted and
talented became famous:

<p>We do not hear about the rest, whose talents and intelligence may have
been lost to the world, but who could nevertheless make a living with
their hands.

<p>Today's person with learning disabilities enters a highly lingual,
educated society. Credentials that he may not be able to obtain stop him
at the threshold of the career of his choice, and his second choice, and
on down the line. How many are we losing, and what will happen to them in
an increasingly technological job market?

<p ALIGN=CENTER><b>A PARENT'S CREED</b><br><font size=-1>(written by an
LDA mother)</font>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<b>I BELIEVE</b> that being the parent of a child with a hidden
handicap is the most important and challenging job I will ever have. In
the few years I have to help him mature, I will always attempt to instill
in him a deep knowledge of his innate worth as an individual and never
measure his behavior or scholastic achievement by any other child.

<p><b>I WILL</b> strive to always remember that this child is operating
under great pressure and much frustration; therefore, I will not reject
his outbursts as being abnormal or unrestrained misbehavior. I will
recall the many times he has been loving and kind and try to overlook the incidences when there is overt hostility. And then I will try to help structure his world so that frustrations might be lessened and he will feel more secure.

<p><b>I WILL</b> have endless patience when directions are not followed
at the first command, and when some rule or concept is forgotten or
misunderstood.  I will not expect perfection. I will be aware of and
grateful for every small improvement he makes.

<p><b>THROUGH</b> the trials which I may face each day, I will always
remember that this child did not choose to be different and that he would, if possible, gladly be “normal”.  However, since he is different, he deserves special understanding, patience,
acceptance, and love. He's my child, and it is my right and my duty to
guide him in finding fulfillment in life.

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><a name="6">Compensatory Techniques and Curriculum
Adaptations</a></h2>

<p>While the majority of the student's program should be as closely
aligned with the school and classroom core curriculum, some modifications
and accommodations might be necessary.  Listed below are some suggested
compensatory techniques, curriculum adaptations, and educational aids for
students with specific learning disabilities (SLD):

<ol>
<li>For students with difficulty reading, or the very slow reader, the
"read along technique" with taped textbooks and workbooks might be used in
the classroom,  at home, and in the resource room. <br>

<li>For students with memory problems, or unable to take notes in
classroom, a fellow student might share notes by using carbon paper, or
the teacher could provide a copy of the class lesson or allow the student
to tape record lessons. <br>

<li>Educational film strips and videos are available on most subjects and
most grade levels for general information not acquired from the printed
page. Talking books may be acquired from the library. <br>

<li>For students with short term memory problems -- i.e., do not remember
mathematical facts, but understand the computation process -- a table of
math facts and other visual aids, and a <b>printing</b> calculator could
be provided. <br>

<li>For the student who has difficulty writing, a battery cassette
recorder could be provided for the student to dictate answers to tests or
written lessons. <br>

<li>For the student who cannot write legibly, reverses letters, numbers
or symbols  (e.g., <b>+</b> for <b>x</b>), typing could be taught as
early as possible. Each typing lesson is also a lesson in punctuation,
spelling and vocabulary. <br>

<li>Handouts should be typed, not handwritten. Some students may benefit
from large print, or colored plastic overlays thought by some to enhance
symbols and to give depth to printed page. <br>

<li>To train memory and listening skills, the use of poetry, rhymes,
songs, and spelling tapes, beginning with the early grades, is thought to
be helpful. <br>

<li>Teaching spelling  should be started with a multisensory approach --
say the word, spell the word orally, then write the word. <br>

<li><b>Reading:</b> Test the student for ability to learn and use
phonics. Students who can't profit from phonics might be taught by
alternate methods. A need for individual evaluation is indicated. The
teacher should explore different methods until a technique is found that
benefits the student. Assessment should be made for instructional level
as well as comprehension level. In some cases the use of high interest
materials, a couple of grades below the student's grade level, may be
beneficial. Concrete words such as nouns, verbs and certain adjectives
and adverbs might be taught with flash cards -- both the word and
illustration of the word. Abstract words that cannot be illustrated
(e.g., <i>of, is, if, to,</i> etc.) could be taught as part of a phrase
or sentence on flash cards. These abstract words should be
<b>highlighted</b> in the  textbook. <br>

<li>Vocabulary enrichment of content material:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The student can prepare files of vocabulary words 
  used in a story or textbook, add definitions, write new sentences 
  using the words, and keep them in alphabetical order.  

  <P>Large print-picture dictionaries are available for 
  different reading levels. "Concept Picto-Cards" are an excellent 
  tool for vocabulary, spelling and reading comprehension.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<LI>Supplemental educational materials include
<ul>
<p>Large type copies of <B><I>Readers Digest</i></b> magazine 
and Condensed Books (many  are already on tape  -- e.g., "Talking 
Tapes"). 

<p>Picture magazines: <B><I>Life, People</i></b>, etc.  

<p>Maps in dark outline, color coded, large lettering. <br><br>
</ul>

<li><b>Writing:</b> For problems in copying, worksheets which leave space
under each word, phrase or sentence for copying provide support for
additional practice. Put list of words on right margin for left handed
students, or those with mixed  dominance (switch hitters). Have hand outs
at desk for those who can't copy from blackboard or take dictation.  For
students who use <b>large</b> written symbols, enlarge space allowed for
"fill in the blank" tests or work sheets. <br>

<li>For students who have difficulty with processing auditory input,
(fully understanding questions asked, recalling or forming an appropriate
answer), be patient -- wait for the answer or present the question in
written form. <br>

<li>Oral language should be taught simultaneously with written language.
Illustrations in the reading book should be used to generate conversation
that duplicates what is to be read in the printed text. Television
viewing at home could serve the same purpose. <br>

<li>Use video tapes to supplement instruction in subject matter (e.g.,
reading, social studies, science, mathematics). Computers, captioned TV
programs, video tapes and workbooks used in preparing for GED testdirs
are the newest and most effective ways to supplement instruction for
students with <b>specific learning disabilities</b> (SLD).<br>

<li>A multidisciplinary team is essential for proper evaluation of SLD. A
multisensory approach is needed to make classroom instruction meaningful
and available.

<h3>Teaching Mathematics to Students with Learning Disabilities</h3>

<p>Learning disabilities in mathematics have received relatively little
attention, yet the learning of mathematics is viewed as a crucial part 
of one's education -- mathematical abilities are listed as a separate 
category in the generic term "learning disabilities" by the 
National Joint Committee for Learning Disabilities and by Public Law 
94-142 (listening, speaking, reading, writing, <b>mathematical abilities</b>,
reasoning).

<p>Theories on mathematics disabilities view spatial visualization and 
verbal skills as critical. These two categories have a great deal to do
with anyone learning mathematics and are merely magnified for students 
with learning disabilities. These two areas should receive much attention 
in one's mathematics education and should be heavily emphasized in the 
teaching and remediation of mathematical concepts and skills. Concepts 
should be introduced with "hands on" concrete materials. Calculations 
should be done with calculators if memory is a problem (skill in using 
a calculator is necessary). Estimation strategies should be taught as 
mental computational skills are developed. Students should draw 
illustrations and representations whenever possible. Students should 
consistently discuss, read, and write mathematics. 

<p>Knowing one digit facts is important, but work with paper and pencil 
algorithms should not be emphasized. An individual educational program 
in mathematics should concentrate on developing concepts and skills 
within these strands: numeration, geometry, measurement, collecting and 
interpreting data, estimation/mental computation, patterns and relations, 
word problems/applications. For some students with learning disabilities,
the focus of the requirements should be on "hands on" and practical and 
daily living experiences, writing and discussing applications of mathematics.

<h1 align=center>Critical  Discoveries in Learning  Disabilities</h1>

<h2 align=center>A Summary of Findings  by NIH Research
Programs  in Learning Disabilities</h2>

<h3  align=center>Research Centers  Report  at  the  LDA  1996 Conference</h3>

<p><b>Barbara  McElgunn<br>
Research Committee</b>

<p>Close to 300 registrants were present on March 6th to hear from research centers supported by the 
National Institutes of Health. Lynne Cannon of the LDA Research Committee outlined the history of the 
Centers which began in the early 1980s. Through the ongoing efforts of the Research Committee, 
Congress mandated an Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities in 1982 which included 11 federal 
agencies. Following a comprehensive review of the existing research and information on learning 
disabilities, the Interagency Committee concluded that ... <i>Collaborative, integrated and coordinated 
multi-disciplinary approaches to research questions... a classification system... delineation of 
homogeneous subgroups.... and of more precise and reliable strategies for treatment, remediation, and 
prevention...</i> were critical to the field. 

<p>Dr. Reid Lyon, Director of the Learning Disabilities Research programs at the National Institute of 
Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) outlined the research projects that began under the first 
appropriations of $7,250,000 in 1989. These were located at the University of Colorado, Yale; and at 
Johns Hopkins (Dr. Martha Denckla). These projects have expanded to five, adding Bowman Gray School 
of Medicine and Harvard/Beth Israel. The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke funds 
the Johns Hopkins program. The total expenditure this year will be $21,000.000. He noted that this has 
provided the field with 2,200 journal articles and 26 books on learning disabilities over these past years.    
Dr. Lyon explained that the decision to focus on dyslexia or reading disability was taken because this is 
the most common neurobehavioral disorder affecting children. All the Centers use common diagnostic 
criteria, and all now have an intervention research component, and noted that this is the most difficult 
type of research to do well, requiring a high degree of intensity and hard work.

<p> Dr. Shaywitz (Yale Research Center) reported that dyslexia, a disorder of the language system 
(phonological awareness) cannot be separated from reading disability and is the most common 
neurobehavioral disorder affecting children, about one child in five. Following large groups of children 
prospectively, about three-fourths have a persistent deficit, though all improve, there is still a gap. In 
random samples, nearly as many girls as boys are affected. A central issue in reading disability is 
phonological awareness-that words are composed of sounds. This must be taught to 20-30% of the 
population and is the most important predictor of reading success in children and young adults. Other 
research at Yale, using imaging techniques (functional MRI), is investigating the underlying neurobiology 
of learning disabilities, correlating brain areas with various processes in reading.

<p>Dr. John DeFries (Colorado) said that the Institute of Behavioral Genetics at Boulder began in 1973 
with a family study-followed by a twin study, still in progress. Many investigators are responsible for 
various studies under this program, which include projects on ADHD and executive function.

<p>The Colorado Reading Project found evidence of a genetic linkage to chromosome 15 in 1983 and 
more recently to chromosome 6 with five DNA markers. There is evidence for both shared and 
independent etiologies for different components of reading, e.g., visual/orthographic analysis and 
phonological awareness. There is evidence for a genetic etiology for reading disabilities from two large 
independent samples, and it is interesting that the affected region on chromosome 6 also influences the 
human immune system.

<p>Dr. Michele Mazzacco (Johns Hopkins) described four research projects at the Learning Disabilities 
Research Center at over the past seven years, designed to study specific social and academic learning 
disabilities in children with known syndromes wherein various types of learning disabilities are a part: 
neurofibromatosis, Turner's, and Fragile X.

<p>A comparative core battery of tests are conducted on all children in the program and on some family 
members. Brain imaging studies, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow the identification of 
anatomical correlates of these cognitive and social deficits. Comparing the non-verbal learning disabilities 
of girls with Fragile X and Turner's syndrome allowed ways to study social learning disabilities in depth. 
The goal of these studies is to show how specific genes can impact specific aspects of the bran 
development and how these brain differences lead to different behavioral and cognitive phenotypes and 
symptoms that we need to understand in evaluating learning disabilities and their subtypes.

<p>Dr. Frank Wood (Bowman Gray) described their program, which for over seven years has been 
studying many processes that show how a dyslexic child learns to read and some important genetic 
findings from their study. The genetic and neuroimaging aspects of this project have important 
contributions for teaching approaches also. David Pauls reported on new genetic linkage studies in four 
samples of dyslexics and their families, based on four phenotypes: phonological segmentation, non-word 
reading, rapid naming, and single word reading. Phonological segmentation showed linkage to the HLA 
region of chromosome 6, very close to the Colorado findings. The region on chromosome 15, located in 
1983 by the Colorado group, was found to correspond to word identification. The component processes of 
reading may involve different genes. Dr. Wood said they can image these phenotypes and pinpoint which 
areas of the brain arc working at a specific task. Excessive activity in some areas is related to lowered task 
performance. The left thalamus, related to decoding and phonological segmentation, is underactivated in 
the dyslexics studied.

<p>All of this has meaning for intervention. They have shown that code instruction  <i>(stainless steel 
phonics approach)</i> delivered in the first and  second grades improves reading performance in the 
third and eighth grades and produces stronger outcomes in math, an active frontal-type process.

<p>Dr. Albert Galaburda (Beth Israel/ Harvard) presented a segment of their nine-year project studying 
the neurobiology of dyslexia, which is looking at mechanisms behind developmental disorders of 
language. He said that debate has occurred on whether this involves the processing of sounds (low level 
processing), or is at the cognitive level (high level processing). His lab is exploring whether both low and 
high level processing are affected by the structure of the brain and whether small malformations are 
substrates for developmental language disorders.

<p>The transfer of low to high level processing, or the reverse, is important to decoding. An early lesion 
in one area of the brain will propagate to other levels of processing at the functional and anatomical 
levels, e.g., a lesion in the thalamus will affect the frontal lobe. Abnormal neuronal migration to the 
cortex, found in nine autopsied dyslexic brains would have occurred during prenatal life and might reflect 
a genetic defect in the cellular programming of neuronal migration. Such malformations and subsequent 
changes in the sizes of neurons in the thalamus can be reproduced in animal models with subsequent 
effects on their ability to discriminate fast sounds. Other, but not all, pathways may also be   affected  by 
these changes.

<p>Dr. Lyon introduced the programs on treatment interventions as a research target. He said that 
IQ/discrepancy criteria for services are not very valid for many children with learning disabilities. This 
may not be such a refractory disorder if identified early and attention given to the nature of the treatment 
itself. Dr. Barbara Foorman of the University of Houston and Dr. Joseph Torgesen of Florida State 
University described NICHD-funded studies on the effectiveness of various interventions for reading 
disabilities.

<p>The Houston intervention research program is about halfway through a five year grant. All the studies 
involve teacher training, teacher inservice and feedback. The children are from a mix of the four main 
ethnic groups. This prevention program is designed to help kindergarten children with pre-reading 
activities using listening games, rhymes, and phonemic segmentation and transition activities for 20 
minutes a day. Analysis showed mid-year benefits from this program when compared to a matched control 
group in another school.

<p>The second program involves 114 children in the first and second grades who are poor readers and 
compares different types of instructional interventions used in a resource room program for one and a half 
to two hours a day.

<p>The third study involved designing a program and developing materials for a large school district that 
was moving from a whole language approach to reading to a phonics-based approach.    

<p>Dr. Torgesen described two interdisciplinary projects of prevention and intervention. Four 
assumptions were used to guide this program: phonologically based reading disabilities are common; 
approaches must be affective in word-reading ability; the importance of letter-sound correspondences in 
deciphering the code; a method of stimulating phonological awareness must be included. 

<p>One longitudinal study compared 1500 children, screened in kindergarten for poor phonological 
awareness and assigned to three different treatment groups, with a control group. All experimental groups 
showed good gains by mid-second grade and one group was above average in some reading skills. Other 
research from this program at Florida State University is investigating whether intensive interventions 
make a difference for the poorest ten year old readers.

<p>At the end of the day, members of the LDA research committee remarked that these research 
programs are providing valuable information for parents, teachers, and policy makers and scientific 
evidence for the possible etiologies and mechanisms of this real and most prevalent syndrome. The work 
on treatment, interventions, and in studying known genetic syndromes that involve social and cognitive 
learning disabilities will add to progress in this large and complicated field. This is a summary

<h3><a name="Intro"></a>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The purpose of this booklet is to provide literacy instructors and tutors with 
pertinent and concise information on adults with learning disabilities and 
their needs within literacy programs. Thousands of literacy programs across 
the country, including Adult Basic Education/GED programs, 
workplace literacy programs, and the many other public or private efforts, are 
giving an estimated 17 to 65 million illiterate persons in this country new 
opportunities not only to learn but also to increase their earning
potential and achieve  their goals.
<p>
The relationship between reading difficulties and the high incidence of 
learning disabilities among participants in literacy programs has been 
recognized frequently in recent practice and research. Persons with
learning disabilities appear in literacy programs at all levels of 
proficiency. Some are functionally literate, reading at the 8th grade level. 
Others have attained only basic skills, reading and writing at the 5th grade 
level. Still others can read and comprehend very little or not at all. Many 
individuals are identified as having learning disabilities as youngsters, 
some are identified as adults, but a significant percentage of individuals 
who have difficulty in learning never suspect their learning problems to be 
the result of a specific condition that can be identified and addressed. They
may not understand that this condition is widely recognized and is shared by 
a variety of successful and notable people such as Greg Louganis, Nelson
Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Bruce Jenner, Cher, Tom Cruise, and Whoopie 
Goldberg. 
<p>
Since 1976, Public Law 94-142 has supported the provision of appropriate 
individualized education programs in public schools at the elementary and 
secondary levels. Students who went through the educational system before 1976,
however, may not have had the benefit of support programs in the schools. The 
lack of such programs have significantly impacted on the way those students 
view themselves and on their skill levels. Remediation, instruction on how to 
learn, training in learning strategy techniques, and the implementation of 
classroom modifications, along with support and encouragement from parents and 
teachers, have helped many students become more efficient and effective in the 
classroom and in other aspects of life. 
<p>
Although a significant number of adults with learning disabilities go quietly 
about their lives, all will not necessarily be well. For students who either 
were not identified or for some reason did not receive appropriate 
intervention struggles with academics, drugs, alcohol, the law, and staying in 
school all reflect poor self-esteem and can be precursors of a lifelong 
pattern of difficulties. We now know that children with learning disabilities 
become adults with learning disabilities. Because some of these individuals 
re-enter the educational system as adults, instructors, particularly in 
literacy programs, must recognize that these students' educational needs may 
require a variety of responsive techniques For those individuals who did not 
learn adequate coping strategies and did not learn the necessary academic 
skills in their school years, literacy programs offer a viable opportunity to 
acquire what they missed. Remedial instruction, combined with
modifications according to learning strengths and weaknesses, can enable 
persons with learning disabilities to see positive effects from their efforts
in the workplace and at home.

<hr width="75%">
<h3><a name="WhatAre"></a>What Are Learning Disabilities?</h3>
<p>
Although individuals with learning disabilities usually have average to above 
average intelligence and the potential for achieving in a wide variety of areas
of adult life, they may be characterized as lazy, irresponsible and unmotivated. 
Generally the term "learning disabilities" refers to a broad spectrum of 
processing disorders that arise from inaccurate information received through 
the senses, an inability to remember or integrate information, or difficulty 
with oral, written, and nonverbal expression. The description used by the 
Learning Disabilities Association of America (1986) is as follows: 

<blockquote>
  "Specific learning disabilities is a chronic condition of presumed
   neurological origin which selectively interferes with the development, 
   integration, and/or demonstration of verbal and/or nonverbal abilities.
   Specific learning disabilities exists as a distinct handicapping
   condition which varies in its manifestations and in degree of severity.
   Throughout life the condition can affect self-esteem, education,
   vocation socialization, and/or daily living activities." 
</blockquote>
<p>This description points out that learning disabilities are naturally part of
the individual and not a set of behaviors that have been acquired. It also 
points out that no specific area will be affected in every individual; in 
other words, each individual with learning disabilities has a unique set of 
learning difficulties and those difficulties will always be present. 
Individuals, however, can learn to cope with those difficulties. As indicated,
learning disabilities affect all aspects of life and can cause problems with 
self-esteem, interpersonal relationships, and independent living skills. As 
mentioned earlier, a learning disability is indicated by problems in taking in,
storing, retrieving or expressing information. As research and experience have 
shown, learning disabilities are not related to mental retardation in any way. 
Rather, learning disabilities reflect a discrepancy between an individual's 
ability and performance levels and the assumption is usually that the 
individual has at least average intelligence. The measurement of ability and 
performance, either in formal testing or in the instructional setting, can be 
particularly frustrating in that results will most likely be inconsistent. 
That is, in one area, the student will demonstrate high to very high
aptitude and achievement, while, in another area, results will indicate below 
average to very low performance.

<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="Characteristics"></a>Characteristics (Indicators) of Adults with Learning Disabilities</h3>

<p>Not all individuals who encounter problems learning to read have specific
learning disabilities; however, various researchers (Travis, 1979)
document that anywhere from 30% to 80% of those involved in literacy programs 
display characteristics typical of individuals with learning disabilities. 
<b>For tutors, the issue is how to determine whether the problems 
demonstrated by the student come from a lack of instruction or from 
identifiable learning disabilities.</b> In addition, tutors must consider 
how best to proceed to encourage development in literacy. 

<p>Since most instruction in literacy programs is one-on-one or in small group,
literacy teachers have a good opportunity to observe behavior and to assess the
effectiveness of the student's learning efforts. The first indicator that the 
problem may be more complex than a simple lack of instruction is the level of 
frustration felt by both the instructor and the student. When the 
instructor has used all of the resources readily available and has been 
creative in developing new approaches, yet the student still does not make 
good progress, it is fair to assume that the problem may involve the student's 
learning processes. 

<p>Some behaviors initially apparent to instructors of adults identified
as learning disabled, and usually sustained over time, appear as listed below. 
It must be noted that not all incidents of these behaviors necessarily 
indicate a learning disability; neither will all the listed behaviors be 
apparent in any one individual. 

<h4><em>Hyperactivity</em></h4>

<ul>
<li>moves constantly/restless
<li>talks a lot, frequently with incomplete thoughts
<li>appears to be unable to relax
<li>displays poor motor coordination
<li>appears to be moody
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>Hypoactivity</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>reacts slowly
<li>works slowly, sometimes sits and does nothing
<li>does not look people in the eye
<li>seems unemotional
<li>perseverates (stays with a task, even when finished)
<li>seems accepting of all situations
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>Attention Problems</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>daydreams
<li>seems confused
<li>has difficulty concentrating
<li>seems bored/uninterested
<li>fails to finish lessons/projects
<li>makes careless mistakes
<li>uses poor work habits/is disorganized
<li>is easily distracted by others, by noises, by any activity
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>Impulsivity</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>acts without thinking and is unconcerned about consequences
<li>speaks at inappropriate times
<li>says one thing and means another
<li>does not work well independently
<li>does not stay with a task
<br>
</ul>

<h4><em>General</em></h4>
<ul>
<li>does not interpret correctly what others say
<li>is clumsy
<li>misunderstands social cues and nonverbal communication (stands too close to people during conversation, does not know when or how to end a conversation, etc.)
<li>exhibits memory problems
<li>displays poor decision-making skills
<li>displays poor fine motor skills (handwriting, needlework, for example)
<li>uses poor social skills (has difficulty relating to others)
<li>may confuse left/right, up/down, East/West, etc.
</ul>

href="../store/LD_MH.html">book store</a>.</font></i>
<p>Also in the behavioral area are issues related to time management. Many 
individuals with learning disabilities have difficulty with being late for 
work or appointments, procrastinating, and generally just not being aware
of the passage of time. These problems can cause a variety of complications 
on the job as well as in educational settings. 
<p align=CENTER><a href="#TOP">Top of article</a>

<h3><a name="Assessment"></a>Assessment</h3>

<p>For the student to gain maximum benefit from literacy efforts and to give 
tutors more comprehensive information on how to work with each student, 
assessment for possible learning disabilities may be appropriate. Such 
assessment can provide full information about the student's school 
experience, learning and cognitive styles (how a person processes 
information), and academic strengths and needs. 

<p><b>Types of Assessment:</b><br>
Assessment can take many forms. In working with adult literacy students,
different types of assessment should be considered. Tutors and literacy 
directors will need to decide whether formal or informal assessments are
appropriate. The student's academic and personal goals should be given 
careful consideration and purposes for assessment should be clarified before 
the process is undertaken. Some literacy students want to learn to read for 
personal satisfaction while others need the skills for career or educational 
advancement. 

<p><i>Formal Assessments</i><br>
Formal assessments, administered by professionals, such as the
Woodcock-Johnson Psychoeducational Battery-Revised and the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale-Revised, (WAIS-R) can provide information about cognitive
styles and academic strengths and needs. 

Information gathered from these tests give the instructor a comprehensive view
of how the student learns, which academic skills are strong, and which are 
weak. For example, information about slow visual-perceptual speed can indicate
that the student will need extra time to perform reading tasks. 

<p><i>School Records</i><br>
School records may be available to provide information and insight to 
facilitate current efforts. To obtain school records, a request must be in 
writing from the student. Special education folders may contain past 
psychological and educational evaluation in addition to Individualized 
Education Plans, while regular cumulative folders usually have information 
supplied by former teachers and results from routine standardized testing. 
These materials should be beneficial to the literacy program staff persons
in developing appropriate instructional approaches. 

<p><i>Informal Assessments</i><br>
For some students a simple instrument such as the <a href="#App1">Academic
Assessment Instrument for Literacy Students</a> (see Appendix 1) may be 
helpful in providing anecdotal information (personal accounts) directly 
from the student. Observations also are part of an informal assessment. 
The literacy instructor's impressions of how a student works are valuable in 
designing appropriate instruction and in choosing materials to meet the 
student's needs. 

<p><i>Learning Strengths and Needs</i><br>
In addition to school records, anecdotal information, observations, and
formal psychoeducational evaluations, information about learning
modalities can provide direction in choosing instructional techniques and 
materials. Teachers need to be cautious in selecting instructional
methods to assure that those chosen reflect the student's strengths and
needs and not the teacher's own preferences and strengths. The
information gathered about how the student learns must be taken in its
entirety to develop appropriate techniques. In addition to facilitating 
the current educational process, this may be helpful to the client in
understanding past successes or failures in school. Teaching methods
which fail to capitalize on students' strengths may also fail to be
effective. For example, the use of a phonetic approach for reading
instruction with a student who has difficulty with auditory 
learning and who does not comprehend sounds appropriately or in the
correct sequence will prove frustrating to both the tutor and the
student. Greater success might be achieved by using more multi-sensory
methods such as language experience. 

<p><i>General Assessment Information</i><br>
The objective of assessment is to find out how a person learns and how
instruction can be tailored to meet individual needs. An assessment can also
formally identify someone as having a learning disability. Information about
Formal assessment can be obtained from resources listed in the 
<a href="#Resources">Resources section</a>. Those include state 
Learning Disabilities Association offices, public school systems, state and 
local Vocational Rehabilitation offices, local colleges and universities, 
mental health centers, and private psychologists trained in learning 
disabilities. Some students will need formal assessments as part of their 
preparation process for General Education Development (GED) testing for a 
high school equivalency diploma. Documentation of an existing disability will
allow the student to obtain testing accommodations such as extended time.
Other students may ultimately be interested in attending a postsecondary
institution and will need documentation to access services. Having learning 
disabilities documentation will entitle the student to support services and
academic accommodations under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and to
employment accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990. Regardless of the final diagnosis, however, helpful information can be
garnered from the assessment process.

<p align=CENTER><a href="#TOP">Top of article</a>
<hr width="75%">

<h3><a name="LearningStyles"></a>Learning Styles or Preferences</h3>

<p>Individual preferences in various ways of learning have been recognized by 
educators in all types of educational settings. Just as in formal school 
situations students reflect diverse academic strengths, literacy students 
also reflect those same variations. Learning styles can be assessed by 
looking at cognitive factors (how things are perceived and dealt with), 
environmental factors (what the instructional area is like in terms of 
light, temperature, furnishings, etc.), affective factors (who is involved 
in the learning process and how the student feels about those involved), or 
by looking at a combination of all three. Assessment can be implemented with
formal instruments available through test publishers or with informal, 
tutor-designed instruments and methods. 

<p>A less formal assessment may simply consist of asking a student how they 
would go about memorizing a long list of number or words. Those who prefer 
and work better with auditory learning will repeat the list to themselves or
ask to have the list read to them, sometimes repeatedly. Those who find 
visual cues more helpful may study the list simply by looking at it and 
memorizing either the items or the pattern of the numbers or words. 
Others may want to copy the list, rearranging the items in some particular 
way that makes more sense to them. 

<p>Information gathered about learning styles actually has broader 
implications for tutors than for students since tutors can manage the 
learning environment to provide the best learning situation possible. 
Learning styles concepts and instruments such as the 4MAT System* 
(McCarthy, 1980) or the C.l.T.E.** (Wisconsin Vocational Studies Center) 
combine information from the cognitive, environmental, and/or affective 
areas to provide the specifics that the tutor can use in designing 
instruction that will meet the needs of the individual student. Student 
involvement in selecting relevant goals is strongly recommended. Students 
involved in setting their educational goals and knowledgeable about how they
learn tend to stay in literacy programs long enough to achieve significant 
progress and tend to maintain more positive outlooks. 

<p>*Information about 4MAT is available from EXCEL, Inc., 200 W. Station
Street, Barrington, IL 60010.<br>
**Information about the C.I.T.E. is available in the 
<a href="#References1">Wisconsin Vocational
Studies Center publication</a> listed in the references.

<h3><a name="Tips"></a>Tips for Literacy Providers - Instructional
Accommodations</h3>

<p>Using all available information, literacy tutors can experiment with a 
variety of techniques, modifications, and accommodations for each student 
that capitalize on identified strengths and compensate for weaknesses. 
Although the following ideas have proven helpful for some students, they 
may not succeed with a particular student. Realistic, short term goals can 
keep the student involved and motivated. As the student reaches each goal, 
positive reinforcement is particularly important. Tutors are urged to be 
creative and to explore their own ideas in developing instruction for their 
students.

<h3><A name="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Individuals who choose to attend literacy programs are to be commended. 
For some reason, school did not provide the needed skills, yet they now 
are willing to re-enter an academic setting to learn to read and write. 
Literacy program staff persons and volunteers are in a unique position to 
provide support and to facilitate the learning process. Perseverance on the 
part of the student, positive reinforcement from the tutor, and patience on 
the parts of both are major factors in making the literacy effort successful. 

<p>The critical factor, however, is the literacy tutor. The expertise, 
enthusiasm, dedication, and patience demonstrated by literacy tutors 
are invaluable. Whether the expertise be from formal training or from 
innate skills and a desire to work with others, literacy tutors are making 
the difference for an increasing number of adults all over the country. 
Increasing literacy levels for Americans is a reasonable goal  and literacy
tutors are well on the way to achieving that goal.

List of Common Approaches to Teaching Reading in Literacy Programs</h3>

<p>This list of instructional approaches for teaching reading should
serve only as a guide in choosing a teaching process for adults with
learning disabilities in literacy programs. It is strongly recommended
that literacy program personnel consult with reading professionals to
choose instructional approaches that will meet the needs of the students. 

<blockquote>
Diagnostic/Prescriptive Approach - 
involves doing diagnostic testing to determine specific areas of need and 
then teaching  directly to address those needs. 

<p>Eclectic Approach - 
describes choices made among a variety of programs and
approaches combined to provide a rich, varied instructional design. 

<p>Individualized Reading Approach - 
allows the reader to select reading materials and to proceed at an individual 
pace. 

<p>Language Experience - utilizes the language that the student is already
using to develop reading, writing and speaking skills

<p>Laubach Method - relies heavily on phonetic language. 

<p>Whole Language Methods - focuses on learning language through all the
senses.

<title>Rights and Responsibilities of Parents</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<h2>Rights and Responsibilities of Parents of Children with
Disabilities</h2>

<h3>What are your rights, as a parent, in the special education
process?</h3>

<p>Public Law 101-476 (IDEA) clearly defines the rights of children
with disabilities and their parents. A fundamental provision of the
law is the right of parents to participate in the educational
decision-making process. This includes the right to:
<ul>

<li>Free appropriate public education for your child. Free
     means at no cost to you as parents. Appropriate means meeting
     the unique educational needs of your child.

<li>Be notified whenever the school wishes to evaluate your
     child, wants to change your child's educational placement, or
     refuses your request for an evaluation or a change in
     placement.

<li>Initiate an evaluation if you think your child needs special
     education or related services.

<li>Informed consent. Informed consent means you understand and
     agree in writing to the evaluation and educational program
     decisions for your child.  Your consent is voluntary and may
     be withdrawn at any time.

<li>Obtain an independent evaluation if you disagree with the
     outcome of the school's evaluation.

<li>Request a reevaluation if you suspect your child's present
     educational placement is no longer appropriate. The school
     must reevaluate your child at least every 3 years, but your
     child's educational program must be reviewed at least once
     during each calendar year.

<li>Have your child tested in the language he or she knows best.
     For example, if your child's primary language is Spanish, this
     is the language in which he or she must be tested. Also,
     students who are deaf have the right to an interpreter during
     the testing.

<li>Review all of your child's records. You may obtain copies of
     these records, but the school may charge you a reasonable fee
     for making copies. Only you, as parents, and those persons
     directly involved in the education of your child will be
     permitted access to personal records. If you feel that any of
     the information in your child's records is inaccurate or
     misleading or violates the privacy or other rights of your
     child, you may request that the information be changed. If the
     school refuses your request, you then have the right to
     request a hearing in order to challenge the questionable
     information in your child's records.

<li>Be fully informed by the school of all rights that are
     provided to you under the law.

<li>Participate in the development of your child's
     individualized education program (IEP), or, in the case of a
     child under school age, the development of an Individualized
     Family Service Plan (IFSP). The school must make every
     possible effort to notify you of the IEP or IFSP meeting and
     then arrange it at a time and a place that is convenient for
     you. Remember, your child's IEP or IFSP cannot be implemented
     without your written consent.

<li>Have your child educated in the least restrictive school
     setting possible. Every effort should be made to develop an
     educational program that will provide the greatest amount of
     contact with children who are not disabled.

<li>Request a due process hearing to resolve differences with
     the school that could not be resolved informally.
</ul>
<p><b>
What are your responsibilities, as a parent, in the special
Education process?</b>
<p>
Parental responsibilities to ensure that a child's rights are being
protected are less clearly defined than are parental rights. These
responsibilities vary considerably depending on the nature of the
child's disabling condition and other factors.  In accepting these
responsibilities, some of the following suggestions may be helpful:
<ul>
<li>
Develop a partnership with the school or agency. You are now
     an important member of the team. Share relevant information
     about your child's education and development. Your
     observations and suggestions can be a valuable resource to aid
     your child's progress.

<li>Ask for clarification of any aspect of the program that is
     unclear to you. Educational and medical terms can be
     confusing, so do not hesitate to ask. 

<li>Make sure you understand the program specified on the IEP or
     IFSP before agreeing to it or signing it. Ask yourself if what
     is planned corresponds with your knowledge of your child's
     needs.

<li>Make sure your child is included in the regular school
     activities program. Do not forget nonacademic areas such as
     lunch and recess and other areas such as art, music, and
     physical education.

<li>Learn as much as you can about your rights and the rights of
     your child. Ask the school to explain these rights as well as
     the policies and regulations in effect in your district and
     state before you agree to a special education program for your
     child.

<li>Monitor your child's progress. If your child is not
     progressing, discuss it with the teacher and determine whether
     the program should be modified. As a parent, you can initiate
     changes in your child's educational program.

<li>Discuss with the school or agency any problems that may
     occur with your child's assessment, placement, or educational
     program. It is best to try to resolve these problems directly
     with the agency, school, or district. In some situations, you
     may be uncertain as to which direction you should take to
     resolve a problem. Most states have protection and advocacy
     agencies that can provide you with the guidance you need to
     pursue your case.
<li>Keep records. There may be many questions and comments about
     your child that you will want to discuss, as well as meetings
     and phone conversations you will want to remember. It is easy
     to forget information useful to your child's development and
     education if it is not written down.
<li>Join a parent organization. In addition to the opportunity
     to share knowledge, experiences, and support, a parent group
     can be an effective force on behalf of your child. Many times
     parents find that as a group they have the power to bring
     about needed changes to strengthen and broaden special
     services.
</ul>

<h3>As the parent of a child with a disability, what can you offer the
IEP or IFSP process?</h3>
<p>
In the final analysis, parents of children with disabilities should
be involved in the process as much as they want to be and as much
as they can be. Varying degrees of involvement are possible. The
following are suggestions for ways that parents can become
involved:
<ul>
<li>Before attending an IEP or IFSP meeting, make a list of
     things you want your child to learn. Discuss any differences
     between your list and the school's or agency's list. Take
     notes about aspects of your child's behavior that could
     interfere with the learning process. Describe the methods you
     have found to be successful in dealing with these behaviors.
<li>
    Bring any information the school or agency may not already
     have to the IEP or IFSP meeting. Examples include copies of
     medical records, past school records, or test or medical
     evaluation results. Remember, reports do not say all there is
     to say about a child. You can add real-life examples to 
     demonstrate your child's ability in certain areas. 
<li>
    Find out what related services are being provided. Besides
    your child's teacher, many other specialists and professionals
    may have contact with your child through provision of related
    services. Ask each professional to describe the kind of
    service he or she will be providing and what growth you might
    expect to see as a result of these services.
<li>
    Ask what you can do at home to support the program. Many
    skills the child learns at school can also be used at home.
    Ask to meet with the teacher when your child is learning a new
    skill that could be practiced at home. 
<li>
    Make sure the goals and objectives on the IEP or IFSP are
    specific. This will ensure that everyone teaching your child
    is working toward the same goals.  Ask questions to make sure
    that you understand and agree with each of the goals and
    objectives before signing the IEP or IFSP. 
<li>
    Periodically, ask for a report on your child's progress.
    After the meeting is over, your job as a parent is not
    finished. You should follow your child's progress throughout
    the year.
<li>
    Regard your child's education as a cooperative effort. If at
     any point you and the school cannot reach an agreement over
     your child's educational and developmental needs, ask to have
     another meeting. This would allow time for you and the school
     or agency to gather more information and data. If after a
     second meeting there is still a conflict over your child's
     program, you should ask for a state mediator or a due process
     hearing.
</ul>

<h3>
What resources are available to help you?</h3>
<p>
Local and state education agencies have information to help guide
you through the special education process. Since the specific
criteria and procedures used by school districts vary, it is
important to familiarize yourself with the information they
provide. You will find your local director of special education and
his or her staff helpful in accessing such information and guiding
you through the process. 
<p>
Additional resources are available from national organizations.
Some of them will also be able to direct you to local and state
chapters that can provide more locally based support. Almost all of
the states now have federally supported parent information and
training centers. Any of the contacts cited here may be able to
help you locate such a center in your state:

</head>
<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<h1 align=center>Principles for Learning to Read</h1>

<h2 align=center><i>Helping Children with Learning Disabilities to 
Succeed</i></h2>

<p><b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</b><br>
Long before children are able to engage in reading themselves, they must
feel that reading is something they would like to do. They must develop an 
appreciation of the pleasures of written language and of the many ways 
language is useful. 

<p><b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language</b><br>
Children need to develop a basic sense of what print looks like and how it 
works. They must learn how to handle a book, which way to turn the pages, and 
that the printed words -- not the pictures -- tells the story when you read. 
Children should be taught that words are all around them-in newspapers, mail, 
billboards, signs, and labels -- and have many different and valuable purposes. 

<p><b>Learn the Alphabet</b><br>
Comfortable and early familiarity with letters is critical for learning to 
read. Children should learn the names of letters and to recognize and form 
their corresponding shapes. 

<p><b>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words</b><br>
Children need to learn that printed words are made up of ordered strings of 
letters, left to right. They should be helped to understand that when the 
combination or order of letters is changed, the word that is spelled also 
changes. 

<p><b>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and
Phonemes</b><br>
The ability to think about words as a sequence of phonemes is essential to 
learning to read an alphabetic language. Children should become aware of the 
building blocks of spoken language. They need to understand that sentences are 
made up of strings of separate words. They should become comfortable in hearing
and creating rhymes. They should be led to play with the sounds of language 
until they can pull words apart into syllables, and pull syllables into 
individual phonemes.* 

<p><b>Learn Letter Sounds</b><br>
Given a comfortable familiarity with letters and an awareness of the sounds of 
phonemes, children are ready to learn about letter-sound correspondence. The 
most important goal at this first stage is to help children understand that 
the logic of the alphabetic writing system is built on these correspondences. 

<p><b>Sound Out New Words</b><br>
As children learn specific letter-sound correspondences, they should be 
challenged to use this knowledge to sound out new words in reading and writing.
Making a habit of sounding out unfamiliar words contributes strongly to reading
growth, not just for beginners, but for all readers. Children need to 
understand that sounding out new words can actually be a strategy for helping 
them unlock pronunciations of words they have never seen before, and can make 
what they are reading understandable.

<p><b>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily</b><br>
The ability to read with fluency and comprehension depends on recognizing most 
words almost instantly and effortlessly. Once the framework for a new word or 
spelling has been laid, through sounding and blending, the key to recognizing 
it quickly and easily is practice. The most useful practice is reading and 
rereading of meaningful text made up of words the child has been taught to 
sound out. For beginners, such reading helps most if it is relatively easy. As 
a rule of thumb, no more than one in 20 words should cause trouble. 

<p><b>Know Spelling Patterns</b><br>
As children become reasonably capable of sounding out words in reading and 
spelling, it is important that they notice the similarities in their spellings.
Awareness of spelling patterns that recur across words hastens progress in 
reading and writing, and weak knowledge of spelling is an impediment to mature 
readers. 

<p><b>Learn to Read Reflectively</b><br>
Although the ability to sound out words is essential for learning to read, it 
is not enough. Written language is not just speech written down. Instead, text 
brings new vocabulary, new language patterns, new thoughts, and new modes of 
thinking. To enjoy and profit from reading, children must also learn to take 
the time to reflect on these aspects of text. 

<p>_______________________<br>
*A phoneme is the smallest functional unit of speech. (The word "cat"
contains three phonemes: the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds. Letters often
represent more than one phoneme -- the <i>a</i> in "cat" is a different
sound than the <i>a</i> in "cake" -- and sometimes a single letter will
contain more than one phoneme. For example, the word "ox" has two letters
but three phonemes, /o/, /k/ and /s/). 
Fluent readers learn to recognize these discrete sounds of spoken words 
quickly, accurately, and automatically. Phonemic awareness is the foundation 
on which all other reading skills are built. <br>

<h1 align=center>Learning to Read -- Reading to  Learn<br>
Tips for Parents</h1>

<h2 align=center><i>Ways to help your child  with learning disabilities
become a better reader</i></h2>

<p>Parents can have a strong positive influence on their child's reading. 
Research has shown that enjoying books with a child for even a few minutes
a day can make a measurable difference in the acquisition of basic reading 
skills, and that everyday activities--such as a trip to the grocery store--can 
be turned into enjoyable learning experiences.

<p>Following is a list of ways in which parents can encourage the development 
of the skills needed by children in order for them to become good readers.

<h3>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</h3>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Find time to read aloud with your child every day.</b> Typically,
parents play an important role in developing this skill by reading to children 
and showing how important reading is to their daily life. Lap time with
picture books and stories can strongly motivate your child to enjoy reading. 
Try to make these books available for your children to explore and enjoy
on their own as well.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Develop Awareness of Printed Language</h3>

<ul>

<li><b>Teach about books.</b> When reading aloud to your child, let your
child open the book and turn the pages. Point to the words as you read.
Draw attention to repeated phrases, inviting your child to join in each time 
they occur.<br>

<li><b>Point out letters and words that you run across in daily life.</b> 
Make an obvious effort to read aloud traffic signs, billboards, notices,
labels on packages, maps, and phone numbers. Make outings a way to encourage 
reading by showing your child how printed words relate to daily living.
</ul>

<h3>Learn the Alphabet</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Play alphabet games.</b> Sing the alphabet song to help your child
learn letters as you play with alphabet books, blocks, and magnetic letters. 
Recite letters as you go up and down stairs or give pushes on a swing.
A-B-C, dot-to-dot and letter-play workbooks, games, and puzzles are available 
at most toy stores. Many engaging computer games are designed for teaching
children letters. Make sure these toys are available even when you are unable to
play along.<br>

<li><b>Watch "Sesame Street" with your child.</b> Show the child how to
sing along, answer the riddles, and engage actively in its fun.<br>

<li><b>Make writing materials available to your child and encourage their
use.</b> Help your child learn to write his/her name and other important words 
or phrases. Gradually, help the child learn to write more and more
letters. At first, most children find it easier to write uppercase letters.
</ul>

<h3>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>
Teach your child to spell a few special words,</b> such as his/her name,
"stop", or "exit."
Challenge the child to read these words every place they are seen. Draw 
attention to these and other frequently occurring words as you read books
with your child. Challenge the child to read these words as they arise or
to search them out on a page. Play word-building games with letter tiles
or magnetic letters. Have the child build strings of letters for you to
read.
</ul>

<h3>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables and Phonemes</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Sing songs and read rhyming books.</b> Sing the alphabet with your
child, and teach your child songs that emphasize rhyme and alliteration, such 
as "Willaby Wallaby Woo" and "Down By the Sea." Emphasize the sounds as
you sing. Play rhyming games and clap out names. Jumble the
wording or word order of familiar poems and challenge your child to detect the 
error. Talk like a robot, syllable by syllable.<br>

<li><b>Play word games.</b> Challenge your child to play with words. For
example, ask your child to think of words that rhyme with "bat" or begin with
/m/. What would be left if you took the /k/ sound out of ''cat"? What would
you have if you put these sounds together: /p/ and ickle; /m/ and ilk;
and /s/, /a/, and /t/. Which of these words starts with a different sound
-- "bag", "candy", "bike"? Do "boat" and "baby" start with the same sound?
</ul>

<h3>Learn Letter Sounds</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Sound out letters.</b>
Point out other words that begin with the same letter as your child's
name, drawing attention to the similarities of the beginning sound. Use 
alphabet books, computer games, or car games such as, "I'm thinking of
something that starts with /b/" to engage the child in alliterative and
letter-sound play. If you have a book that lends itself to alliteration
and rhyme, such as a Dr. Seuss book, sound out rhyming words as you read
or  challenge the child to do so for you. Play word games that connect
sounds with syllables and words. For example: If this spells "cat, how do you 
spell "hat"?
</ul>

<h3>Sound Out New Words</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>Point out new words.</b> As you encounter them, say the sound while
touching each letter in a new word. For example, say "s-u-n" and then blend
sounds to create the word. In practicing new words, use predictable words with
common sounds and spellings, like "fun" or "sat" instead of "night" or "saw."
<br><br>

If you encounter words with unknown meanings or with complex spellings,
encourage your child to try to sound out the words. However, if too many words
require this kind of attention and effort, it is best to find an easier book.

<li><b>Play spelling games with your child</b>
After your child begins pronouncing words, encourage spelling by saying each
sound in the words and then writing the letter that goes with the sound.
<br>

<li><b>Encourage your child to spell.</b> After your child has learned to
pronounce words, have the child say each sound.
<br>

<li><b>Independent writing</b>
Encourage your child to use inventive or independent spelling. At this stage, 
the child will tend to omit letters and confuse letter names with letter
sounds, producing such spellings as LFNT for elephant, BN for bean, and
FARE for fairy. Use correction wisely. You should be most concerned about
is the child's sensitivity to the sounds that need to be represented.
</ul>

<h3>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>
Help your children to read easy, enjoyable stories as often as possible.</b>
It is likely that your child will enjoy reading more and learn more from
reading if you sit together, taking turns reading and encouraging discussion.
In the beginning invite the child to read well-chosen words. Gradually, as the
child becomes able, take turns with sentences, speakers, paragraphs, and pages.
At the end of each section or story revisit those words that caused trouble.
Rereading the entire story over several days, and again weeks later, is
a powerful way to reinforce this learning.
</ul>

<h3>Know Spelling Patterns</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>
Now it becomes useful to point out the similarities between words</b> such
as will, fall, and hill or light, night, and sight. This is also the time to
help your child learn the correct spelling of the words he/she writes.
</ul>

<h3>Learn to Read Reflectively</h3>
<ul>

<li><b>
Pause for discussions as you read.</b> As you read stories to and with
your child, stop frequently to discuss their language, content, and
relevance to real life and other knowledge Pause to explore the meanings of 
new words, using them in other sentences and contrasting what they mean
with words that have similar meanings. Make an effort to revisit new words 
and concepts later, when the book has been put aside. When reading stories, 
pause to discuss the various characters, problems, events in the story,
and invite your child to think about how the problems might be solved or
to wonder about what might happen next. When resuming a story, ask your
child to review what has happened so hr, drawing attention to looming 
mysteries and unresolved conflicts In reading expository text, invite the 
child to marvel at the creatures or events described and to wonder about
details or connections not mentioned by the text.<br>

<li><b>Above  all: Read,  read, and re-read.</b>
</ul>

<h2 align=center>Glossary</h2>

<p><b>Alphabetic awareness -</b> Knowledge of the letters of the alphabet 
coupled with the understanding that the alphabet represents the sounds of
the spoken language.

<p><b>Alphabetic understanding -</b>  The understanding that, in principle, the
left-to-right spelling of printed words represents their phonemes from first 
to last.

<p><b>Background knowledge -</b>  All children bring some level of
background knowledge to beginning reading (e.g., how to hold a book, knowledge 
of words, knowledge of the world). Priming this background
knowledge--relating new knowledge so that which is already
known--helps children draw on their experiences as a means of understanding 
new information. When sufficient background knowledge does not exist, it
will be necessary to adjust instruction accordingly.

<p><b>Fluency -</b> The ease with which students translate print to speech.

<p><b>Phonemes -</b>  The elementary speech sounds represented by the letters 
of a perfect alphabet. In the English alphabet, which is not perfect, some
phonemes are represented by combinations of letters (e.g., /th/, /sh/),
and some letters represent more than one phoneme (e.g., c, g, a, e, i, o, u).

<p><b>Phonemic awareness -</b> The awareness that spoken words or syllables 
can be thought of as a sequence of phonemes. Phonemic awareness is a
sub-category of phonological awareness.

<p><b>Phonological awareness -</b> The ability to attend to the phonological 
or sound structure of language as distinct from its meaning. Types of
phonological awareness include word awareness, syllable awareness, rhyme 
awareness, and phonemic awareness.

<h1 align=center>Learning to Read -- Reading to Learn<br>
Tips for Teachers</h1>

<h2 ALIGN=CENTER><i>Teaching Reading to Students with Learning
Disabilities</i></h2>

<p>Reading is the single most important educational skill your students
will learn. Understanding the organization and meaning of text and
instruction in both phonics and literature is essential to helping
young children read. By understanding the prerequisite skills for
reading, teachers can build a solid foundation for their students to
learn and succeed in school. 

<h3>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</h3>

<ul>
<li>Share stories with children and invite them to explore a story's
magic.<br>

<li>Share informational texts and invite children to wonder about the new
ideas presented.<br>

<li>Take every opportunity to point out the ways in which reading is
essential to the communications of everyday life (e.g., on labels,
instructions, and signs). 
</ul>

<h3>Develop Awareness of Printed Language and the Writing System</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make sure students know how books are organized. They should be 
taught the basics about books-that they are read from left to right and 
top to bottom, that print may be accompanied by pictures or graphics, 
that the pages are numbered, and that the purpose of reading is to gain 
meaning from the text and understand ideas that words convey. <br>

<li>Read to children from books with easy-to-read large print. Use 
stories that have predictable words in the text. <br>

<li>Use "big books" to help children notice and learn to recognize 
words that occur frequently, such as a, the, is, was, and you. 
</ul>

<h3>Teach the Alphabet</h3>

<ul>
<li>A strong predictor of the ease with which a child learns to read is 
his or her farniliarity with letters of the alphabet. This familiarity 
is a critical building block for learning to read.<br>

<li>It is important to go beyond knowing the names of letters. Students
must also develop a sense of the purpose of letters. Help them notice
the letters in the print that surrounds them and that you share with
them every day. <br>

<li>Engage the students in activities that will help them learn to
recognize letters visually. <br>

<li>Help students learn to form the letters and encourage them to
embellish their work with their names and with other first attempts at
writing. 
</ul>

<h3>Develop the Students' Phonological Awareness</h3>
<ul>
<li>In listening and speaking, we pay attention to the meaning of
language rather than to its sound. To learn to read, however, students
must be taught to attend to the sounds, or phonology, of language. This
is necessary for them to understand how speech is represented by print.
Children with learning disabilities need special help in learning to
develop such phonological awareness. <br>

<li>Model and demonstrate how to break short sentences into individual
words. For example, use the sentence "Frogs eat bugs," and demonstrate
with chips, cards, or other manipulatives how the sentence is made up
of three words and how the order of the words matters. Using
manipulatives to make sentences, play with each word and put it in
order.<br>

<li>Develop students awareness of the sounds of individual words by
asking them to clap out syllables and to listen for and generate
rhymes. <br>

<li>Once children are comfortable in playing games with words,
syllables, and rhymes, move onto phonemic awareness.
</ul>

<h3>Develop Phonemic Awareness</h3>

<ul>
<li>Phonemic awareness refers to a understanding that words and
syllables are comprised of a sequence of elementary speech sounds This
understanding is essential to learning to read an alphabetic language.
The majority of children with reading disabilities fail to grasp this
idea. <br>

<li>In teaching phonemic awareness, the focus of all activities should
be on the sounds of words, not on letters or spellings. <br>

<li>Use strategies that make phonemes prominent in children's attention
and perception. For example, model specific sounds, such as /s/ in the
word sat, and ask children to produce each sound in isolation and in
many different words until they are comfortable with the sound and
understand its nature.<br>

<li>Begin with simple words and simple challenges, e.g., listen for
initial /s/ in sat, sit, sip, and sad ... or for long /e/ in me, see,
bee... <br>

<li>Teach students to blend phonemes into words. Begin by identifying
just one phoneme, e.g., /m/-ilk, /s/-at, working gradually toward
blending all the phonemes in words, e.g., /s/-/a/-/t/. <br>

<li>Teach students to identify the separate phonemes within words,
e.g., what is the first sound of soup? What is the last sound of kiss?
Beginning phonemes are easier to identify than final phonemes.<br>

<li>Once students are comfortable listening for individual phonemes,
teach them to break up words, into component sounds, e.g.,
/m/-/oo/-/sl= "moose".<br>

<li>Create a sequence of segmenting and blending activities to help
students develop an understanding of the relationship between sounds in
words. <br>

<li>Provide children with more support when first teaching a task. For
example, model a sound or strategy for making the sound, and have the
children use the strategy to produce the sound. Model and practice
several examples. Prompt the children to use the strategy during guided
practice, and gradually add more examples. As the students master these
skills, provide less teacher-directed instruction and more practice and
challenge. <br>

<li>Make teaching phonological awareness a top priority. Opportunities
to engage in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful,
frequent, brief, and fun. <br>

<li>Phonemic awareness is essential for learning to read, but it is not
enough by itself. It must be coupled with instruction and practice in
learning the relationship between letters and sounds.
</ul>

<h3>Teach the Relation of Sounds and Letters</h3>

<ul>
<li>Students should learn the letters of the alphabet and discriminate
each letter from the other, because each stands for one or more of the
sounds that occur in spoken words. <br>

<li>When presenting each letter, model its corresponding sound and have
children produce the sound themselves. For children with learning
disabilities, the teaching activities must be explicit and unambiguous.<br>

<li>At first, teach and work with only a few letter-sound
correspondences that have high utility in many words (e.g., /m/ in man,
mad, him, and ham). Postpone teaching less frequently occurring letters
until students have a firm understanding of how left-to-right spellings
represent first-to-last sounds (alphabetic understanding).
</ul>

<h3>Teach Children How to Sound Out Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>After students have mastered a few letter-sound correspondences,
teach them to decode words or sound them out. Begin with small,
familiar words Teach the children to sound out the letters, left to
right, and blend them together, searching for the word in memory.<br>

<li>Model sounding out the word, blending the sounds together and
saying the word The ability to sound out new words allows children to
identify and learn new words on their own. <br>

<li>Give children stories containing words that reflect the
letter-sound patterns that have been taught, and encourage them to
sound out words whenever they are uncertain.<br>

<li>Help children learn spelling conventions, such as the use of final
/e/'s to mark long vowels, by comparing and contrasting lots of
examples.
</ul>

<h3>Teach Children to Spell Words</h3>

<ul>
<li>Teach children to spell words by sounding their letters one by one.
Model the sounding and spelling process for children as they spell.<br>

<li>Begin with short words children can sound out, because these words
follow regular spelling conventions, e.g., cap, bat, and sit instead of
cape, bait or sight.<br>

<li>Begin with simple words that do not contain consonant blends, e.g., 
ham and pan instead of slam and plan. 
<br>
<li>Encourage students to use spelling knowledge and strategies
regularly in their own writing. <br>

<li>Introduce spelling conventions systematically. Begin with words
that exemplify the most frequent and basic conventions, and provide
support and practice to help students generalize from these words to
others. The goal is to help them see the spelling conventions in the
words. <br>

<li>Use words in which letter-sound correspondence represent their most
common sounds (e.g., get instead of gem). <br>

<li>Develop a sequence and schedule of opportunities that allow
children to apply and develop facility with sounds and words at their
own pace. Specify what skills to assess and when to assess them so that
you will know when to move on. Take into account each student's
background knowledge and pace in moving from sounding out to blending
words to reading connected text. 
</ul>

<h3>Help Children Develop Fluent, Reflective Reading</h3>

<ul>
<li>Help children learn to read fluently by requiring them to read new
stories and reread old stories every day. <br>

<li>Help children extend their experience with the words, language, and
ideas in books by interactively reading harder texts with them and to
them every day. <br>

<li>Relate information in books to other events of interest to
children, such as holidays, pets, siblings, and games. Engage children
in discussion of the topics. <br>

<li>In both stories and informational texts, encourage wondering. For
example, "I wonder what Pooh will do now?" "How do you think the father
feels ?" or "I wonder what frogs do in the winter? Do you think that's
a problem? Why?"<br>

<li>Model comprehension strategies and provide students with guided
assistance. <br>

<li>Point out how titles and headings tell what a book is about.<br>

<li>Help students identify the main ideas presented in the text, as
well as the supporting detail. Graphics help to reveal main ideas, and
the relationship between text and graphics helps students understand
what they are reading. <br>

<li>Point out unfamiliar words and explore their meaning. Revisit these
words frequently and encourage students to use them in their own
conversations. <br>

<li>Show children how to analyze contextual dues to figure out the
meaning of an unfamiliar word. Research shows that most vocabulary
growth comes from learning new words in reading.

<p><i>
Marianne waited for her parents outside the school building. She had just
completed her first IEP meeting as the "meeting facilitator." All that
practice on the Self-Advocacy Strategy[1] with Mr. Hart and the other
students in her class had really paid off. She had been really scared in
practice during her turn as the facilitator but watching the other students
as each one took turns as facilitator had helped. The videotapes of the
practice sessions had been fun to watch. Everyone had laughed at Jeffrey 
when he put on glasses and carried Mr. Hart's briefcase for his role as the
school psychologist.
</i>
<p><i>
Being in charge of the meeting for "real" had been REALLY scary at first.
Marianne felt better having her folder and notes with her so she could follow
the agenda and share what she thought everyone needed to know about her goals
and how she learns best. To begin the meeting, Mr. Hart asked Marianne if she
would share information from the inventory she had completed. Marianne had
shared what she had written down about her reading and writing skills, what
worked for her and what didn't, and the learning strategies she wanted to
learn during the year. Since she had learned the Sentence Writing Strategy
last year, she said she wanted to learn the Paragraph Writing Strategy this
year. Marianne shared how well the Sentence Writing Strategy had worked for
her in English and how excited she was to begin learning more strategies. She
also said she wanted to learn the FIRST-Letter Mnemonic and Test Taking
Strategies this year. Mr. Bergman asked Marianne to describe the Sentence
Writing Strategy, and, when she had done that, suggested she use it in
writing the reports required for his science class.
</i>

<p><i>
Marianne thought Mrs. Hazelwood, the school counselor, had been really nice
when she reminded the psychologist that "the team needed to hear from
Marianne about her career interests first" and not just  from her parents.
Marianne thought she was going to die when her mother started to talk about
all the  family's relatives who were in health occupations when Marianne said
that was her long term career goal, but the "eye contact" Marianne made with 
her mother seemed to help cut that short.
</i>
<p><i>
Marianne was glad when the meeting was finally  over, but was surprised that
so much time had gone by. It seemed to be over very quickly. Everyone seemed
to be excited about the plan they had made for the year. Marianne was a
little embarrassed that her mother had tears in her eyes when she shook hands
with the teachers and the principal at the end of the meeting, but she guessed
that her mother was proud that it had gone so well, at least that was what
both her mother and father kept saying. Mr. Emerson, the principal, said
he was "really impressed" with how well Marianne had done as facilitator. 
Being facilitator was usually his job, and he said that Marianne had done 
"as well as he had ever done" even though this was her first time in that 
role. She had been concerned before the meeting that the adults would ignore 
what she had to say and pretend that she wasn't there like they did when she 
went to the IEP meeting in fifth grade, but that didn't happen, and she was 
glad. In fact, Mr. Hart had written down almost everything she said just the 
way she said it on the plan which made her feel good. Mr. Bergman, the science
teacher, had winked at her when he shook her hand after the meeting and
whispered, "Nice job, Marianne!"

<h3><a name="Purposes"</a>The Purposes of Learning Strategies Instruction</h3>

<p>For students with learning disabilities, like Marianne, participating in 
planning their own educational experiences can be a critical element in their 
journey to become independent learners. Another critical element is the
learning strategy instruction they receive since such instruction offers new 
ways to succeeding in general education courses. First, it provides them with
a validated means of being efficient, effective, and ultimately 
independent as learners. Second, it offers long-term benefits of learning
to think and act "strategically'' that can continue through post secondary
training experiences and on into adulthood as individuals are faced with new
and ever more complex problems to solve. Third, it offers students a growing
sense of independence and control over their own learning processes. Related
to this last factor is the increased emphasis that a learning strategy 
instructional approach places on students to assume greater amounts of 
personal responsibility during the middle and junior high school years. This 
is seen as especially important given that many students with learning 
disabilities possess poor organizational skills and thus they often arrive at
middle junior high) school ill-prepared to act responsibly. Acting responsibly 
covers not only getting to school class on time, keeping track of books and 
assignments, knowing the dates of upcoming assignments and tests, and taking 
home the necessary materials for information to enable them to complete 
assignments properly. In short, when the instructional emphasis shifts to 
teaching students how to approach tasks strategically, changes can be noted
in the degree to which students act responsibly. 
<p>
If you think this sounds too good to be true, think again. Thousands of
students with learning disabilities have been successfully learning to use
learning strategies and to become independent learners in schools all across
the country. In the sections that follow, what strategies are, the rationale
behind strategy instruction, how strategies are taught, types of learning
strategies, an example of a student's journey with regard to learning
strategies over several years time. the evidence that supports use of
strategies with students who have learning disabilities or those who are
at-risk for school failure, and suggestions for putting strategy instruction
in place will be described.  

<p>By now, you are probably wanting a description of what learning strategies
are. Strategies are tools that students can use to approach tasks in content
classes or other learning situations. They aren't tools in the sense that a
wrench or a hammer are tools, but they are helpful tools for learning and
solving problems. A strategy is the way a person thinks and acts when
completing a learning task like getting information out of a textbook
chapter or studying for a test. The significance to the student of having a
set of learning tools for fulfilling the demands of a classroom situation
cannot be overstated. With learning strategies, students can utilize skills to
master the information that is being taught in science or social studies or
language arts classes, and, most importantly, to do this on their own. When
students use the skills they have learned in a strategic manner, they become
independent as learners. An example of a student's use of a learning strategy
in the general education setting may be helpful. 

<p><i>
Dana read the question printed in her social studies book, "What are the two
major industries in our state?" She knew the answer to this question. Dana's
seventh grade teacher, Mrs. Peterson, had reminded the class to use complete
sentences in writing their answers. Dana closed her eyes and thought through
the steps in the Sentence Writing Strategy. "PENS" is the memory device she
used to recall the steps because each of the letters in "PENS" stands for a
step in the strategy. She said to herself, "'P' stands for 'Pick  a formula,'"
and looked at her card and chose the second simple sentence option of the four
listed on the card: "S S V." She thought to herself, "That would be the best
choice since the answer to this question has two subjects." Quietly to
herself she said the second step in the strategy, "E stands for explore words
to fit the formula. " She thought to herself, "I want to write this sentence
about the two most important industries in this state, so I should use the
words 'manufacturing and agriculture' as my subjects. I want to use 'are' as
the verb. 'Are' is not an action verb, but a linking verb," she reminded
herself. "The rest of the sentence will be words from the question," she
thought. "That will be easy!" Next, Dana instructed herself to do the third
step in the strategy, "Note the words." Dana wrote the words she had chosen
for the sentence on her paper: "Manufacturing and agriculture are the two 
most important industries in our state." She thought about step four in the
strategy: the "S" step in "PENS," called "Search for the Verbs and Subjects."
Dana knew that she was improving in her ability to identify subjects and
verbs. She read her sentence again to make sure she knew which word was the
verb and to check whether her sentence fit the formula she had chosen.
</i>

<p><i>
Mrs. Peterson stopped by Dana's desk to ask "How is the strategy working for
you, Dana?"</i>

<p><i> "Great," was Dana's reply as she showed Mrs. Peterson the four
answers she had written on her paper.</i>

<p><i>
"Those are very good sentences, Dana. You are doing an excellent Job using
'PENS!' The strategy seems to be working well for you," Mrs. Peterson stated
and moved on to answer another student's question.</i>

<p>Many people ask, "How is learning strategy instruction different from other
interventions that may be used for students with disabilities?" One difference
is that each strategy includes a very explicit set of steps for completing a
classroom task. Thus, students are taught how to complete particular tasks in successful ways. Instruction in the use of learning strategies also requires intense practice sessions until students have mastered the strategy. Students need to become highly 


engaged in the task (e.g., reading a section of a chapter in science) to the extent that they are not only thinking about the task, but also about how they are responding to it. This requires a higher level of thinking than students are often asked to eng


age in and will seem strange to them at first. It also requires some
balancing or shifting of focus back and forth on the students' part
because thinking about both the task and how one is thinking about it at
the same time is almost impossible. 

<p>This process of shifting focus, called "strategic thinking," gives students
an important problem-solving skill that can be adapted to lots of different
uses. An example may be helpful. If you've ever been in a situation and found
yourself getting frustrated, then a little angry, and have stopped to tell
yourself, "Hold it. Take a deep breath and count to ten! How can I think
about what is happening here in another way? Instead of getting angry, maybe
I should...," in an effort to control yourself from getting angrier and to
get yourself to proceed productively, in that moment you were using strategic
thinking. Strategic thinking is thinking about the situation you find yourself
in, looking at your options for dealing with the demands in the situation, and
making a decision about what may be your best option. In learning situations,
strategic learners think about what they've been asked to do, think about the
different ways they might do the task at hand, and select what they consider
to be the best approach. In work or social situations, the same kinds of
strategic thinking apply. Learning strategy instruction gives the student a
process for strategic thinking AND a set of options, the strategies, from
which to choose the best approach given the demands of the situation.
Students who master learning strategies have a whole box of "tools" at their
command as they approach new tasks.

<p>As you may be able to imagine by now, the process of learning to use
strategies does not happen overnight. Another dimension that characterizes
strategy instruction is that it may take longer than other interventions. The
disadvantage is the amount of time required; the advantage is that
strategic thinking skills are lifetime skills. They are not a "quick fix" to
get through a test on Friday. Instead, strategies require a longer time
investment with a much bigger pay-off down the road. Strategic thinkers 
are better students, better workers, and better decision makers.

<p>While strategies aren't the solution to every learning problem, they do
provide an important solution to a problem that is common to many adolescents
with learning disabilities: these students typically will have difficulties
succeeding in general education courses. Any student may benefit from use of
strategies, but students with learning disabilities or other at-risk learners
benefit especially from using them. These students, like the ones in the
following examples, typically have inefficient learning patterns.

<p><i>
Greg has a great deal of difficulty keeping himself and his assignments
organized. Though his eighth grade teachers and his parents remind him often,
he can't seem to stay organized for more than about three hours at a time. He
often loses something important that he really needs for a particular class.
He rarely remembers what he needs to do for homework or when the next test is
coming up. To this point, both Greg and the adults in his life have spent
amazing amounts of time trying to keep him organized, though nothing seems to
have worked for more than a day or two.</i>

<p><i>
Sarah spends long hours preparing for tests. Sarah and her mother often spend
four or five hours preparing the night before a test, and Sarah and Mrs.
Shanley, the resource room teacher, usually spend a couple of hours studying
the day before. Nevertheless, Sarah often receives a poor grade on the test,
not because she doesn't know the information, but because she becomes anxious
in the testing situation in the classroom and sometimes puts her answers in
the wrong places, doesn't write an answer, or doesn't finish the test.</i>

<p><i>
Jose struggles with writing tasks. He writes very slowly, and the poorly
organized paragraphs that result are not what he had in mind to  say. His
ideas become all jumbled as he attempts to write them down, and sometimes the
paragraphs do not make sense when he is finished.</i>

<p>
Learning strategy instruction might be an appropriate solution for each of
these student's learning difficulties. Their use of learning strategies may
enable them to be more efficient and effective learners. Strategies may also
assist students in becoming  independent learners. Independence is important
for success as an adult. For example, in the case of Greg, the teacher might
want to teach him The PROJECT Strategy (Hughes, Ruhl, Deshler, & Schumaker,
in press) This strategy was designed to improve student organizational skills
relative to completing assignments. Each of the letters in the mnemonic
"PROJECT" prompts the student to do certain things (i.e., P = Prepare [get
forms ready; listen for assignments]; R = Record and ask [record assignment
using abbreviations; ask teacher for clarifications]; O = Organize [break
assignment into parts]; J = Jump to it! [tell yourself to get going; say
affirmations]; E = Engage in the work [review requirements of the assignment;
do the work; ask for help if needed]; C = Check your work [check work against
the requirements; check for quality; reward yourself; store it and remember
to bring it to school]; T = Turn it in and evaluate [check your grade; figure
out how to do better; store the assignment]. When students with LD are taught
this strategy, both the quantity of assignments they complete and the quality
of their work improve dramatically.

<p>The instructional services that students with learning disabilities
receive for their learning problems often have the effect of making them more 
dependent than independent. The "quick fix'' solutions that get students
through immediate demands in general education classes exemplify such
services. Each new demand becomes a crisis for the student who lacks the
skills to deal effectively with learning challenges. The instructional
services these students receive often become a cycle of crisis-to-crisis
interventions that never address the students' long-term needs for
independence, but instead encourage students to rely more and more on adults.
As they grow older, some students respond to the desire to become more
independent by choosing to refuse support services, no matter what. Others
continue to be dependent on adults to "bail them out" and abdicate the desire
for greater independence. The real hazard in the dependency cycle option is
that students may miss important opportunities to learn independent
problem-solving skills that will have life-long benefits and may carry the
paradigm of dependency into adult life.

<p>
There are several other reasons for involving students in learning strategy
instruction. In addition to  making coursework easier, learning more
efficient, and increasing independence, strategies are aids to students'
organization and management of learning tasks. First, strategies can aid
students' organization and management of learning tasks because they promote
a systematic, orderly approach to learning. Second, because strategies are
"portable, adaptable and combinable," they may be used in a wide variety of
situations: in school, on the job, in post secondary training, in social
settings, and in daily-living situations. In daily-living situations, for
example, students may use strategies to paraphrase directions for completing
a tax form, write a rationale for why they are qualified for a particular job
on an application form, or recall the steps in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
Once students learn to use learning strategies well and become "strategic
thinkers," they are in a much better position to respond to the broad array
of problems that will come their way throughout life.

<p>Finally, strategies can be used any time a student determines they are
appropriate to use. Strategic instruction initially allows for others to
prompt or cue students that a task requires the use of a particular strategy,
but these reminders are faded as students grow more capable of making
decisions about when strategies should be used. Family members can also
provide these cues and prompts for the use of strategies in daily life and
social situations, again fading their reminders as the student demonstrates
personal capacity in using the strategies. The desired goal is student
independence in use of strategies any time they are needed. 

<h3><a name="HowTaught"></a>How Strategies are Taught</h3>

While each learning strategy is designed to address a different setting
demand in general education such as reading a passage or taking a test, all
strategies are taught using a similar set of procedures. This similarity
across the instructional process allows for more efficiency in learning on
the part of the student.

<p>The process for learning the strategies is divided into two phases: a
learning phase and an applying phase. During the learning phase, the student
<STRONG><EM>learns</EM></STRONG> about the strategy and
<STRONG><EM>practices</EM></STRONG> using the strategy under both easy and
more difficult conditions. Within the learning phase are seven stages. In the
applying phase, the student <STRONG><EM>uses</EM></STRONG> the strategy to
succeed in classroom and other situations. The applying phase has four parts
which facilitate gradual growth in the student's competence as the strategy
is used in more settings.

<p>During the first stage of instruction, the Pretest Stage, students are
tested to determine current strategies they use effectively and what
strategies/learning habits should be modified or changed altogether. The
deficits identified during pretesting relate to specific setting demands in
the general education classroom. Once students have completed the pretest
process, the teacher shares observations with students regarding both
strengths and areas needing improvement. The teacher describes an alternative
strategy that will help students meet the demands of the general education
setting and also explains how the strategy might be applied beyond the school
setting at work, home, or in other situations The teacher talks about what is
required to learn the strategy and the results that other students have
achieved using the strategy. The students are then asked whether they would
like to commit to learning the strategy in light of this information. If
students are interested in learning the strategy, the teacher describes
his/her own role and commitment to effectively teach the strategy to the
students. The students set goals for learning the strategy and are made aware
of the criterion for how well the strategy must be performed before it is
considered to have been mastered.

<p>The second instructional stage is the Describe Stage. Here, the
teacher describes the rationales for use of the strategy, the
characteristics of the strategy, and engages the students in a discussion
of where and when the strategy might be used in school situations as well
as in work and community settings. The discussion also focuses on current
learning patterns of the students and how the strategy may improve their
success. The teacher describes the steps in the strategy and presents a
memory device to make remembering the steps easy. A final part of the
Describe Stage involves the students in setting personal goals for the
pace at which the strategy will be learned.

<p>The third stage is Modeling. This is a particularly important stage
for at-risk students who tend not to talk themselves through the learning
process as effective learners do. For this reason, the teacher's task
becomes twofold: visually showing how the strategy is used and "thinking
aloud" to demonstrate the mental parts of the strategy. Students observe
as the teacher demonstrates how to do self instruction, how to problem
solve, how to monitor one's own learning, and how to put all of these
elements together in performing the whole strategy to complete a task.
Also during this stage, the teacher begins to draw the students into the
"thinking aloud process." This guided process may seem strange first to
students who have not used "self talk" in their learning; however, the
procedure becomes more comfortable as students practice being reflective. 

<p>The fourth stage is Verbal Practice. This stage maximizes use of the
thinking aloud/self-talk process in consolidating students' knowledge
about the strategy and their own learning processes. This stage requires
the students to relate what they are learning to previous learning
through the use of their own words. This "verbal elaboration" process
engages students in thinking about the strategy, what the steps of the
strategy mean to them, and why each is important. The elaboration
increases the students' knowledge of the strategy and builds on students'
commitment and motivation to learn the strategy. In addition, students
verbally rehearse naming the strategy steps. As they gain facility in
naming the steps and provide evidence that they understand them, they are
ready to begin practicing the strategy.

<p>The fifth stage of strategy instruction is Controlled Practice and
Feedback. The practice portion of this stage focuses initially on
students' knowledge of the strategy steps through use of materials that
are relatively easy. At first, students' concentration needs to be on
learning the strategy and not the content of the materials, hence the use
of easy materials. As students master using the strategy in easy
materials, the focus shifts to increasing the difficulty level of the
materials gradually until they begin to approximate the difficulty
students would experience in the general education classroom. For each
session of controlled practice, there is a corresponding individual
feedback session. Instruction in this stage begins with the teacher
taking major responsibility for noting the student's strengths and areas
needing improvement in each feedback session and gradually shifts such
that the student assumes more and more responsibility for evaluating a
previous performance.

<p>In stage six, Advanced Practice and Feedback, students use the
strategy on tasks and materials similar to those assigned in the general
education classroom. This offers an opportunity for fine tuning any
skills before application in the "real" classroom learning setting. This
stage may necessitate that students problem solve how to apply the
strategy in poorly designed materials or materials that do not fit the
norm of the classroom (as may be the case in doing library research for a
term paper, for example). This problemsolving experience is important in
giving students alternative ways to meet varied learning demands and a
sense of confidence in their own abilities to adapt. As in the previous
practice stage, emphasis is placed on students taking on greater
responsibility for self evaluation as more and more efficiency is
demonstrated in use of the strategy.

<p>The seventh stage is to Posttest and Make commitments. The posttest is
a confirmation that reflect on what has been learned about the strategy
and about each of the student's own learning patterns. This stage
completes the learning phase and serves as a transition to application of
the strategy. As students get closure on what has happened with their
learning up to this point, they prepare for generalization into the
classroom and other situations by making commitments and setting goals
for Stage Eight, the applying stage.

<p>While the stages up to this point will have taken several weeks to
complete, Stage Eight, the Generalization Stage, has no time frame. It
could potentially go on throughout the individual's lifetime as the
strategy is applied or adapted across a wide variety of school and life
situations. The "early" part of application, however, occurs in the
general education classroom as students
begin to apply the strategy in that setting. Dana's use of the Sentence
Writing Strategy (Schumaker & Sheldon, 1985) in her seventh-grade social
studies class described earlier is an example of the early stages of
application. This can be a rather precarious phase for the student who is
without the reliable support of the strategy instructor or peers who are
familiar with the strategy. Though the general education teacher will have
knowledge of the strategy and how to prompt students' use of it, there will
be differences in teachers' styles and attention to an individual student's
needs in the general education classroom. For these reasons, the strategy
instructor will work closely with the general education teacher and the
student to problem solve ways around any concerns that may arise.
Acknowledging this "touch and go" period is important for everyone involved
and especially for the student who may tend to revert to less effective
practices unless prompted to use the strategy for specific tasks.

<p>As the students begin to use the strategy appropriately and more
independently within the general education setting, the strategy
instructor and the students may begin to work on self-reflective
(strategic thinking) skills again, but with the focus on modification of
the strategy or parts of the strategy to a wider range of settings: other
classes or settings outside the school such as social situations or work.
As the students demonstrate mastery of the strategy in the general
education setting and adapt its use to a broader  range of situations,
planning occurs on long-term use of the strategy. The students and the
teacher may think ahead to potential applications and set goals for how
use of the strategy will be monitored.
They also will conduct regular reviews of the strategy in order to ensure
that the strategy continues to be used at criterion levels.

<p>
As more strategies are introduced, students are participating in a "larger
lesson" (or meta-lesson) about how they learn beyond the actual strategies
themselves. Within this larger lesson, students begin to understand the
process of their own learning so that, through several instances of mastering
first one and then other strategies, students learn a great deal about how to
learn efficiently, which learning tasks are easiest or most difficult for
them as individuals, how to make adjustments that will increase learning,
when to use strategies and when not to use them, and what is required to
create a reliable system for dealing with changing educational demands.
The knowledge gained from the larger lesson about their own learning patterns
that they accumulate from learning and using strategies allows students to
take on more responsibility for learning and problem solving in general
education and life situations. Built into the instruction on each learning
strategy is the gradual turning over of responsibility for guiding the
students' learning from the teacher to the students as the students gain
confidence and skill in using each strategy. As a result, students are armed
with both confidence and skills to meet the general education classroom's
demands. The success that students achieve in the general education setting,
in turn, reinforces the students' growing sense of independence and control
over the process of learning. This activates a success cycle which is very
different from the failure and dependency cycle described previously.

<h3><a name="Strategy_Types"></a>Types Of Strategies</h3>

<p>
By now you would probably like to know more about the types of strategies that
have been created for students to learn. There are several groups of learning
strategies.[2] One group that includes several strategies helps <EM>students
acquire information from written materials.</EM> An example strategy from this
group is the Paraphrasing Strategy (Schumaker, Denton, & Deshler, 1984). While
using this strategy, students read a passage from a general education
assignment, identify the main idea and details in the passage, and put the
information in their own words. The strategy requires that students become
engaged in the author's message and activate self-talk about what the author
is saying. The purpose of the Paraphrasing Strategy is that the students will
increase their understanding of what is being read by transforming the
authors' words into their own words.

<p>Another strategy in this group is the Visual Imagery Strategy (Schumaker,
Deshler, Zemitzsch, & Warner, 1993). It is used to gain knowledge of and
remember new information by forming mental images of the content. Students
are encouraged to create these images through the use of previously acquired
knowledge. Students read a passage while simultaneously creating and
describing a mental picture story or "movie" with accurate details. This
engagement in visualizing events and in describing stories in their own words
assists students in understanding and recalling what has been read.

<p>
A second group of learning strategies are those that <EM>enable students to
identify, organize, and store important information.</EM> An example strategy
in this group is the FIRST-Letter Mnemonic Strategy (Nagel, Schumaker, &
Deshler, 1986). This strategy is designed to help students identify the key
information to be learned, to organize the information in list form, and
remember the list of items through development of a memory device with the
first letters of the words that make up the list. Other strategies in this
group include the LINCS Strategy (Ellis, 1992), a strategy for learning the
meaning of new vocabulary words and the Paired Associates Strategy (Bulgren,
Schumaker, & Deshler, in press), a strategy for learning information that is
related (e.g., the significant contributions of a certain historical figure). 

<p>
A third group of learning strategies are those that <EM>facilitate written
expression and demonstration of competence</EM>. An example in this group of
strategies is the Paragraph Writing Strategy (Schumaker & Lyerla, 1991).
Instruction in the Paragraph Writing Strategy enables students to plan and
write different types of paragraphs based on typical demands in the general
education Setting. Other strategies within this group include the Test Taking
Strategy (Hughes. Schumaker, Deshler, & Mercer, 1988) which enables students
to most effectively express their knowledge in testing situations and the
Error Monitoring Strategy (Schumaker, Nolan, & Deshler, 1985) which enables
students to identify errors and edit their own writing.

<p>
Another group of learning strategies are those that <EM>enhance student
performance in solving mathematics problems</EM>. The Strategic Math Series
(Mercer & Miller, 1993) consists of a series of seven math strategies that
have been designed to enable students to quickly solve computation problems
involving basic facts and how to use these strategies in solving story
problems.

<p>Students can learn these strategies across the grades in a variety of
sequences depending on the demands they are facing in their general education
classes and their individual strengths and weaknesses. In some school
districts across the nation, strategy instruction begins in the elementary
grades and continues through the high school grades as needed by a given
student. A case study example might be instructive in understanding the
progression of the instruction.

<p><i>
Mike entered sixth grade at Jefferson Middle School after his family moved
from Arizona during the summer. He had been receiving services in a learning
disabilities program since he was in third grade for problems with both
reading and writing. During his sixth-grade year at Jefferson, he received
instruction from Ms. Cartwright, a support class teacher, on the Paraphrasing,
Word Identification and Sentence Writing Strategies. He used the strategies
some in the sixth grade classroom, but not as consistently as Ms. Cartwright
would have liked, and his sixth-grade teachers, Mr. Just and Mrs. Winters,
had to remind him often to use the strategies in science and social studies.
At the end of the year, Ms. Cartwright recommended that Mike continue to work
on these strategies in seventh grade.</i>

<p><i>
During the seventh and eighth grades at Jefferson, Mike improved his use of
the Word Identification, Paraphrasing and Sentence Writing Strategies. Through
additional practice, he learned to use them automatically and fluently. In
addition, he learned the Paragraph Writing Strategy, the Error Monitoring
Strategy, Visual Imagery and the FIRST-Letter Mnemonic Strategies. Soon, he
began using the strategies in his general education classes and elsewhere
whenever possible. For example, Mike developed a memory device for learning
the safety rules in shop class that Mr. Stevens, the shop teacher, liked so
much that Mr. Stevens shared it with his other classes. Mike used the Sentence
Writing and Paragraph Writing Strategies to write letters to a girl met at
summer camp. Mike was especially pleased with his success in writing
assignments in English classes, and his teachers commented on his excellent
improvement. Additionally, as he learned more strategies, Mike began to
isolate parts of the strategic thinking processes he was using into simple
strategies and to use these simple strategies in other situations a variety
of combinations on his own. He was becoming a lot more confident in his
ability to succeed in his coursework, and his grades improved.</i>
<p><i>
During his ninth-grade year, Mike learned the LINCS and Test-Taking Strategies
and easily applied them in his courses. He had become very adept at "learning
to learn" and was quite good at explaining strategy use to other students.
</i>
<p><i>
In grades 10 through 12, Mike grew a lot in size and maturity. This was
evident in his needing less and less time in the support class with Mrs.
Miller who said he had "matured into using strategic thinking at a deeper
level." At one of their scheduled monitoring sessions to see how Mike was
doing at the end of eleventh grade, Mike had told Mrs. Miller that he was not
using the strategies at all any more. When they talked about this more, and
Mrs. Miller checked with Mike's English and History teachers, Mike was
surprised to find that he was using the strategies, but he did not have to
think about using them any longer-they were part of what he always did;
"they had become automatic."
</i>
<p><i>
As part of planning for his transition from high school, Mike decided he
wanted "a regular job with regular hours" after having the experience of
working in a restaurant for awhile and made plans to enter vocational
training to learn architectural drafting. He knew his math skills were pretty
good, but he would have to "invent" some strategies for the kinds of writing
and spelling that need to be done on architectural blueprints. His aunt who
is an architect, really encouraged him and said she would help him find a job
when he finished the program. He had enjoyed working with computers and
thought he would be able to succeed at the technical college in a nearby city
the fall after he graduated from high school. He took a summer job as a
lumber yard so he could get "a feel for building materials."
</i>
<p><i>
Mike knew there were support services available to him at the technical
college when he started classes in the fall, but he thought he would try to
succeed without them for the first part of the semester, at least. After his
first test in the introductory drafting course, he decided he had better  
check in on the program right away. He was surprised to learn that the tutor
for the drafting program was aware of learning strategies. She shared some of
the strategies other students had used for the introductory course he was
taking. He showed the tutor his old notebook containing notes about the
learning strategies he had learned at North High School. Mrs. Miller had told
him he might need his notebook in college, although he really had not believed
her. Mike was eager to find out more about the learning strategies for
introductory drafting and to use the computerized study materials that were
available for that class from the support services program. He set up an
appointment to attend the study group for the drafting class.
</i>

<h3><a name="Arguments"></a>Arguments that Explain and Evaluate Strategies Instruction</h3>
<p>
By now you may be wondering why learning strategies instruction is the way it
is and how effective it is. About seventeen years ago, researchers at the
University of Kansas set out to learn more about secondary students with
learning disabilities. One of the researchers' tasks was to discover the
kinds of problems that these students encountered in school, and, particularly
in general education classes. The results of their studies indicated that
students with learning disabilities were struggling with understanding what
was read from textbooks, writing sentences, paragraphs, and themes, taking
tests, listening and taking notes, to name a few of the concerns. The
researchers also learned that the methods being used at the time to provide
support services for these students seemed to be having no real lasting
effects at improving students' skills, and the students with learning
disabilities were becoming increasingly more dependent on support personnel
for assistance while continuing to perform poorly in their classes.

<p>
To address these problems, the researchers set about developing methods for
strategy instruction that would help these students succeed in general
education classes and become more independent as learners. A "learning how to
learn" focus was applied in developing a wide range of strategies specifically
designed to meet the types of demands that students were experiencing in
secondary school classrooms. This "learning how to learn" focus comes from
cognitive theory, a theory of how learning occurs. Research on this theory
has provided a great deal of practical information about what can be done to
enhance learning. Strategies instruction is based on cognitive theory and
research related to it.

<p>The process of developing each of the strategies included validating the
instructional methods associated with the strategy as effective means for
students with learning disabilities to learn to succeed at classroom tasks.
The instructional methods described in the third section of this chapter,
"How Strategies are Taught," were found to be effective if students with
learning disabilities had certain prerequisite skills. A total of fifteen
research studies have been conducted (see Deshler and Schumaker, 1988, and
Schumaker and Deshler 1992 for reviews). Each study has demonstrated that
learning strategy instruction allows students with learning disabilities to
succeed on tasks like those they might encounter in general education classes and to do so on an
independent basis.

<p>While no formal studies have been conducted on the long-term effects of
learning strategy instruction, the levels of independence achieved, or just
how students become strategic thinkers and apply these skill to post-secondary
education, daily living, and employment situations, case examples are very
encouraging. Senior high school teachers report that students with learning
disabilities who have received strategies instruction from middle school
onward require little, if any, support services by the time  they are in the
eleventh grade. Many of these students become very capable of meeting learning
demands without assistance from support services personnel. They also
demonstrate abilities to creatively apply strategic thinking to a wide range
of situations.

<h3><a name="Making_Happen"></a>Making It Happen in Schools</h3>

Putting together middle or secondary school services for at-risk learners is
not a simple task. Assuring that these services emphasize independence and
long-term skill development is even more complex. Developing services that
enable students to learn strategic thinking skills that can be applied in
school and life situations requires collaboration among educators, students,
families, and community members.

<p>This collaboration needs to occur at several levels. The first of
these levels is collaboration within the school district. The role of
central office administrators is important in making the school
district's commitment to life-focused outcomes and to removing barriers
that may stand in the way of implementing strategic instruction.
Administrators must look at students' experiences throughout the entire
school program and across buildings. For example, because reading is a
skill that requires several years to master, a good deal of coordination
is necessary to assure that reading programs emphasize a continuous
progression in terms of reading skills development.
This ongoing progression in skill development is necessitated by the
complexity of the tasks involved in reading well. No one would consider not
teaching reading in grades 4 and 5, for example. Central office administrators
are responsible for assuring that skill development in reading occurs in
elementary and middle school buildings, and as needed at the high school
level, and that programs are of high quality and build on prior learning.
Administrators must ensure that support programs, such as those emphasizing
strategic instruction, are carried out across buildings so that they will be
maximally beneficial to students and focused on the long-term outcomes that
are so important for young people with disabilities. These administrative
personnel are in the best position to provide opportunities for district-wide
planning and remove scheduling barriers and other limitations to development
of programs that span across buildings within the district.

<p>Building administrators carry out much the same role at the level of the
individual school. They are involved in arranging planning time for teachers,
working with families and students within their buildings, and affirming the
school's commitment to provide quality services for all its students including
at-risk learners across the grades within a given school.

<p>
Teachers across the school district, including those in general education and
support services roles, need to plan collaboratively to provide for unique
learning needs of students. In some districts, this planning occurs as part
of curriculum planning or school accreditation activities. In others,
collaborative planning for at-risk students is carried out as a targeted
activity in its own right. In either case, planning for implementation of
learning strategies instruction and methods of communicating progress of
individual students is an appropriate task for such educator groups. Doing
this type of planning across the whole school district will help to assure
that services are well coordinated and encourage long-term outcomes. Plans
developed for the entire school district need to be considered within
individual buildings as well. Building personnel will need to develop more
detailed plans for how student needs will be addressed at each school site.

<p>
A second level of collaborative activity occurs among the students and their
families and educators. At this level, educators provide information about 
learning strategy instruction to students and their families, and engage in
discussions about what this means to students' long-term success and to the
families' role in the educational process. This provides families an
opportunity to discuss concerns they might have about learning strategies
instruction, to see how this method of serving young people with disabilities
fits into the total school program, and to learn about the process of planning
for post-school outcomes.

<p>The third level of collaborative activity is more individualized to each
student. At this level, collaboration might occur between any number of
people and would typically facilitate students' generalization of strategies
in non-school situations. For example, collaboration might occur between a
student and his employer. In such a situation, the student might ask his/her
employer to assist him/her in developing some strategies for carrying out
work-related tasks. In another case, a support services teacher, the student,
and a post-secondary training program instructor might meet to plan for use of
Strategies in the post-secondary setting. A third example might include a
parent, the student, and a youth program leader (e.g. Boy Scouts, YMCA, or a
church program) planning for the student's use of strategies in giving a
speech or presentation to the youth group.

<p>Clearly, making strategy instruction work successfully for students with
learning disabilities requires commitment, collaboration, and effort on the
part of administrators, teachers, parents, students, and others in the
students' lives. Fortunately, strategy instruction is one case where efforts
yield positive outcomes in terms of student grades, feelings of competence,
self- esteem, and overall attitude toward learning.

[1] The Self-Advocacy Strategy is a motivation strategy tended to involve
students in key aspects of the learning process and is intended to increase
the students' commitment to their educational program. The memory device,
"I PLAN," is used to help the students recall the five steps in the strategy:
"I" which stands for "Inventory your strengths, weaknesses, goals, and choices
for learning;" 'P" is for "Provide your inventory information;" "L" is for
"Listen and respond;" "A" is for "Ask questions;" and 'N" is for "Name your
goals" (Van Reusen, Bos, Schumaker, and Deshler, 1994).

<h1>Knowledge of
Self:<br>
The Key to Self-Esteem and Self Advocacy</h1>
<p><b>Larry B. Silver M.D.</b>
 
<p>At the time a student is diagnosed as having a learning disability, there are
certain givens. Two of these are the areas of learning disabilities and the
intellectual potential of the individual. There are also other factors that
greatly influence the progression and outcome of this student's educational
experiences: how early the disabilities are identified; how comprehensive the
special education interventions provided are; and whether these interventions
are provided, as needed, throughout the student's education. There is yet
another factor that is less easy to identify and measure but critical: the
student's personality. Does he or she take on the disabilities as a challenge,
understand the need to work at overcoming the disabilities and to work at
developing coping strategies? Does she or he relate in a way that makes people
want to reach out and help or in a way that pushes people away?

<p>We know what is needed to help a student with a learning disability succeed.
Efforts must be made to recognize students with academic difficulties and to
identify if they have a learning disability as early as possible. Once
diagnosed, individualized, appropriate, and comprehensive services are
essential throughout each year such services are needed. Educational systems
all too often fail because such known concepts are not practiced. Children and
adolescents are not identified and diagnosed early. Some are not identified
until middle school or high school or are missed completely. Services might be
provided in grade school then, whether needed or not, they are decreased or
stopped in middle school or high school.

<p>Other chapters (of this book) will emphasize the need for early identification
and comprehensive interventions. In this chapter, I would like to address an
equally critical issue if the student with a learning disability is to succeed
though high school and is prepared to move successfully into his or her
post-secondary world. <b>I refer to the student's feelings about himself or
herself and to the student's ability to learn to advocate for his or her
special needs</b>. Critical to the development of a positive self-image and a
good feeling of self-esteem and to the ability to learn to be one's own
advocate is the knowledge of self. Knowledge of self is the key to acceptance
of self, self esteem, and self advocacy. Only with a sense of positive
self-esteem can an individual see himself or herself as a human among humans,
as an equal among equals.

<p><b>THE OTHER SIDE OF SPECIAL EDUCATION: TEACHING KNOWLEDGE OF
SELF</b><br>
Students finishing high school need self-esteem and self-confidence to feel
comfortable and safe when moving out into their post secondary world. Once in
this world, they will need social confidence and social skills to adapt and to
fit in. Of equal importance, individuals will need the knowledge and skills to
both qualify for and to succeed in this next phase of their life, whether it
is to be as a partner in a relationship or in the job market, a trade school,
the military, or college.

<p>What about students with learning disabilities? Are their needs any different?
<b>We know that learning disabilities are <i>life</i> disabilities</b>. They
not only impact on reading, writing, math, and other academic areas, they
impact on all aspects of life, within the family, with peers, in sports and in
activities. Thus, they impact on an individual's success in school. within the
family, and with peers. <b>We also know that learning disabilities are <i>life
time disabilities</i></b>. That is, the child with a learning disability will
become the adolescent with a learning disability will become the adult with a
learning disability. All efforts to help must be provided throughout grade
school, middle school, high school, and into their post secondary world.

<p>Thus, for the student with a learning disability, the need for self-esteem and
self-confidence, the need for social confidence and social skills, and the
need for understanding of self are of even greater importance. Key to
competence with these traits and skills is the individual's total
understanding of his or her learning disabilities and learning abilities as
well as the best strategies for success when with peers, in a work setting, or
in the classroom. With this knowledge, he or she can build a healthy, positive
self esteem. With this knowledge, she or he can become successful self
advocates.

<p>Ideally, students with learning disabilities are identified early in their
school experiences. Each receives the needed special education and related
services throughout their education. Thus, each succeeds in mastering basic
academic skills or in learning to accommodate for any difficulties and each
learns their own unique set of strategies for learning. In addition, each
student learns his or her areas of learning disabilities and learning
abilities. Further, as each student moves from grade school to middle school,
he or she has learned to understand what special accommodations are necessary
and how to advocate for these accommodations both in school and out of school.
By high school, each student not only knows what is needed, but learns to be
assertive as a self advocate.

<p>Ideally, each family of a student with a learning disability is educated about
their son's or daughter's learning disabilities and learning abilities. They,
too, learn what is needed and how to be an informed and assertive advocate for
their child. As this child becomes older, they learn to help him or her begin
to take over some of the advocacy roles so that by high school he or she can
comfortably accept the role of advocate. This family, with knowledge of their
son's or daughter's strengths and weaknesses, knows how to select home
activities, peer activities, sports, and other important experiences for this
son or daughter that build on the strengths while compensating for and
minimizing the effect of the weaknesses. Ideally, therefore, each student has
had successful experiences in the family and with peers. Each individual has
had a happy and successful childhood and adolescence.
Under these ideal conditions, this student would leave high school with
comprehensive self knowledge, good self-esteem, and the ability to self
advocate. He or she would feel good about self and feel both confident and
capable of peer relationships. This student would move into any post secondary
world with the maximum chance for success.

<p>Unfortunately, most school systems do not provide this ideal world. Most
families are not fortunate enough to be taught what they need to how to be
successful parents and siblings. All too many high school graduates do not
have adequate knowledge of self with a resulting low self-esteem and limited
self advocacy skills. Too many high school students give up and either drop
out of school or enter their post secondary world neither psychologically,
socially, nor academically prepared. They are forced to pay the price of a
lifetime of underachievement often along with few personal or social
successes.

<p>Let me illustrate these important concepts by reviewing the stories of a
student with learning disabilities who succeeded and one who did not. 

<p>Marie was first identified as having a learning disability in tenth grade.
prior to this time she had been told by teachers and parents that she was just
lazy and unmotivated. She often was punished for not getting good school
grades or for lying about her school work. Marie was quiet and shy in school
and appeared to avoid relationships. At home, she let out her frustration by
being angry and by fighting with her two siblings.

<p>She was referred for psychiatric treatment because of her aggressive behavior
at home and her "unwillingness" to try in school. During the initial
evaluation, the evidence of a probable learning disability was noted.
Comprehensive psycho-educational testing showed her to be very bright but with
significant learning disabilities, primarily in the visual perception,
sequencing, organization, visual short-term memory, fine motor, and written
language areas. She had excellent strengths in all receptive and expressive
language areas. The initial interventions with Marie focused on explaining her
learning disabilities and learning abilities as well as on what would be
needed for her to succeed. The same information was reviewed later in sessions
with her parents followed by sessions with her family. She started special
education tutoring. Her regular education teachers were informed of the needed
classroom and curriculum accommodations.

<p>Once these efforts were in place, Marie shifted to individual psychotherapy.
She was depressed, had a poor self image and low self esteem. In addition, she
was angry that she had had to struggle and suffer for so many years before
someone found out what was wrong. Once she was able to work through these
issues, she became free to learn more about herself and her disabilities. She
began to see herself as bright and capable and gained self-confidence. With
this new confidence, she became more involved with her friends. Marie learned
when it was safe to disclose her problems and when it might be best not to do
so. Her family benefitted from their new knowledge of Marie and changed their
image of her as well as their behaviors toward her. Her parents became Marie's
allies in dealing with her disabilities.

<p>In her junior year of high school, Marie returned to me for help. She had
covered up her low reading level with her friends; however, doing this was
getting harder. They would go to a restaurant and she could not read the menu.
They would pass notes to each other and she could not write or spell well.
Covering up was a major challenge. We discussed her need to trust one friend
with information about her disabilities. Marie was afraid that this friend
would then think of her as dumb and reject her. Finally, she did tell this one
friend who then became her helper. At a restaurant, this friend would turn to
Marie and say, "I don't know if I want ..." then read the menu to her. Later,
with more confidence, she shared her problems with all of her friends. They
did not reject her, but, instead, became closer and helped her whenever she
had difficulty. These experiences were valuable for Marie and served her well
later in life.

<p>Through counseling, role playing, and insistence that she act on her own
behalf, she learned to be her own advocate. By the time she entered her senior
year of high school she knew how to select the teachers who taught in a style
most helpful to her. She, not her mother or the special education
professional, met with each teacher to review her areas of strength and
weakness and the needed accommodations in curriculum and in the classroom. If
a teacher was not understanding or cooperative, she discussed the problem with
someone at the school and went back to deal with the teacher directly.

<p>When it was time to select a college, she interacted actively with the
counselor helping the family select colleges. During college interviews, she
spoke of her special needs and asked if the college could provide for these
needs. When it was time to leave for college, she felt confident that she had
the environment and professionals in place to maximize her chances for
success. And she was successful. Midway through college, Marie called me. She 
had to declare a major and "pick" a career. All of her old fears of inadequacy
and of "being dumb" surfaced. Could she ever be "an adult" or be successful in
a job? Could she support herself? We met over that summer and worked on her
self-esteem. She met with a consultant who helped her sort out her strengths
and interest vs. her weaknesses in order to decide on a major as well as a
possible future career. Interestingly, she chose education with the thought of
someday going into special education.

<p>Marie successfully completed college and started working as a first grade
teacher. She joked that she did not want to teach anyone who needed to know
skills at a higher level than hers. I did not hear from her for several years.

<p>Then, at age 24, she called again. "Help. I have this serious boyfriend and I
have serious problems." We met. She discussed her difficulty covering up her
learning disabilities. "He hands me the movie list or TV Guide and asks me to
decide." Or, he would give her a letter with directions while driving and ask
her to read where they should turn. Occasionally, he would hand her a
newspaper article and ask her thoughts. Again, the deep fear that if she told
him she was "disabled" he would no longer like her. We discussed her fears and
how she might approach explaining herself to him. It worked. I was invited to
the engagement party. It was good to see the teamwork starting. He read the
cards while she opened the gifts.

<p>End of story? The story never ends when one has a life time disability. She
called several years later in panic. She was now married and just learned she
was pregnant. "What do I do if my child has a learning disability?" I laughed
but she was frightened. We had to discuss the possibility that she might be
right. However, for her child, the problems would be picked up very early and
the necessary help provided. This child would not have to suffer until tenth
grade before being identified. She relaxed.  

<p>Soon after the baby was born, Marie called asking if I would be willing to do
couples therapy. What became clear was that Marie's ways of compensating for
her disabilities were not known to her husband. He would do something that
"threw her off" and then she would blow up at him. Over a series of sessions,
she was able to understand and explain that in order to work and to take care
of a child and a family, she had to be super organized. Otherwise, her natural
disorganization would result in a disaster. She knew what time she had to be
home. what time the baby needed to be fed, what time to start dinner, and what
time to serve dinner so that she would have enough time after dinner to take
care of the baby and put her to bed. Then, she would have time for lesson
plans, etc. Her life was super organized and almost rigid. If her husband came
home 15 minutes late, maybe because he could not leave work on time, she felt
her whole routine was thrown off and she would explode. He did not know what
hit him and often she did not know why she exploded. As she began to
understand why she needed to be the way she was and he began to understand her
disabilities and how they impacted on her life, they both worked at changes.
They rethought evening and morning responsibilities. With his support and
added effort, she was able to relax more. With his sensitivity to her need for
routine and organization, he made a point of being home on time or of calling.
She learned to not blow up. All benefitted. 

<p>At this time Marie is successful with her career, marriage, and family. Each
phase of her development has presented new challenges. With her knowledge of
herself and her inner drive to solve problems, she has overcome each
challenge. I mention the times she called me. She solved most of her life
crises by herself. Yet, I anticipate hearing from Marie again in the future.

<p>Then there is Bob. He was identified as having a learning disability in first
grade. Bob received special education, speech and language therapy, and
occupational therapy through sixth grade. His parents were pleased that he was
learning. <b>No one ever explained his learning disabilities to them or taught
them what role they needed to play to help him</b>. Because of his
visual-motor disabilities, he did poorly in the sports his friends played and
gradually lost what friends he had. He spent more and more time at home.

<p>When he entered middle school, the school system decided that he no longer
needed intensive help. He was placed in lower-functioning regular classes with
teachers who were to accommodate to his needs. Bob went to a "resource room"
each day for one period with 15 other students. Bob got through middle school
with passing grades. However, he did not learn as much as other students
because of the level of expectation in the lower-level basic classes as well
as the school's approach which focused only on accommodating for his
disabilities. No efforts were made to continuing to work on improving the
areas of disability while helping him to develop compensatory skills. During
middle school he related poorly to classmates and had, at best, casual
friends. He stayed at home and participated in no activities.

<p>High school was a disaster. The school had few services for high school
students with learning disabilities. He was in lower-functioning basic classes
with students who were not interested in school and he was provided no special
education services. By the middle of 11th grade he gave up and quit school.
Initially, Bob got a job at a fast food restaurant and appeared to be happy.
He spoke of going to night school to finish high school. By now, he was
isolated with no peer contacts.

<p>Over the next two years, Bob moved from job to job because he was either fired
for not being on time or he quit. He found a group of adolescents who were in
a similar situation and began to hang around with them. His parents were angry
and frustrated with Bob and feared that he would "never grow up." Yet, they
did not know what to do.

<p>They contacted me when Bob was 24. He was sleeping all day and going out with
his friends at night. They were concerned that he might be an alcoholic. He
had not held a job for over a year. They felt helpless and had allowed him to
live at home while they supported him. When I obtained a history and
questioned about his learning disabilities, they wondered why I did so. "Those
were only problems when he was a child. He learned to read."

<p>My evaluation of Bob showed him to have academic skills at about the eighth
grade level with significant evidence of learning disabilities. He was
depressed with a very poor self-image and very low self-esteem. Bob had no
positive concept of himself, did not feel that he belonged anywhere, and had
no sense of a future. He was alcohol dependent. Bob spoke of his helplessness
and hopelessness and described himself as someone so dumb he could not even
finish high school.
<p>
<b>If only</b> his school had realized that learning disabilities are life
time disabilities and that they could not stop services after grade school.
<b>If only</b> his parents had been provided the knowledge about learning
disabilities so that they would have been able to advocate for better help
during middle school and high school. <b>If only</b> Bob had received
psychological help before he became a casualty. <b>If only... We see too many
"if onlys" with our adolescents and young adults. We acknowledge that they
have learning disabilities and then fail to do what is necessary to help them.
We do not educate the parents. School professionals and families fail and the
individual fails</b>. The future for Bob is not good. He now has his learning
disabilities along with significant emotional, social, and family problems and
a substance abuse problem.

<p>We see too few Maries and too many Bobs. How do we change this? What is needed
to develop the level of self knowledge that results in a positive self esteem
and the ability to learn to be a self advocate? We know the answers. We have
not yet learned to practice what we know. The answers are clear:

<ul>
<li>School systems must identify students with learning disabilities early and
provide the necessary help throughout their education.

<li>Individuals must be educated about their disabilities and special needs
early and throughout their education. They must first have advocates, then be
shown how to be an advocate, and then allowed to practice being their own
advocate.

<li>Parents must learn about their son's or daughter's learning disabilities and
learning abilities and how they can build on strengths while addressing the
weaknesses in all family and social situations.

<li>Parents must have the knowledge of their son's or daughter's needs and be
taught how to be informed and assertive advocates. They need to understand the
needs for each phase of their son's or daughter's life.
</ul>

<p>The individual with a learning disability must finish high school with the
academic knowledge and skills needed to move into the post secondary world.
This individual must have a positive sense of self, resulting in a high level
of self-esteem. He or she must be knowledgeable about his or her disabilities,
abilities, and special needs and be able to advocate for these special needs.
With these successes, each has a chance to make it in the post secondary world
and in adult life. Without these successes, their disability may become a
handicap and their chances for success become greatly restricted.

<h3>BUILDING THROUGH KNOWLEDGE</h3>

<p>Until the diagnosis of a learning disability is made, the child or adolescent
is as confused as are parents or teachers. This student has only had one brain
and does not know that it is "wired" differently. She or he tries as hard as
everyone else to learn and to succeed but does not. He or she does not want to
be bad yet everyone seems to be angry. The child often feels no control over
life. How they are perceived and how they perceive themselves appears to be
based on people or events outside of themselves. They often feel frustrated
with their school and peer difficulties yet do not know what to do. They feel 
helpless.

<p>Until the diagnosis is made, teachers become frustrated.The teacher is trying
and the child is not learning. Further, this student may be misbehaving and
disrupting the class. The teacher might let the student know of his or her
frustration. In addition, this teacher might let the parents know. Parents get
calls. "You have to make your child do his homework." "Please tell your
daughter to get her work done in class and to write neater." "You must punish
your son for clowning in class." Parents, already frustrated, now react to the
teacher's frustration. The teacher also feels helpless.

<p>Because learning disabilities are life disabilities, the child who is not
doing well in school may also not be doing well within the family or with
peers. Parents, worried and frustrated, begin to feel inadequate. They feel
helpless.

<p>Once the diagnosis is made, all must change. It is critical that the family be
educated about learning disabilities and specifically about their son's or
daughter's learning disabilities. The educational diagnostician, special
education tutor or another professional must accept the responsibility for
providing this information to parents. Classroom teachers must learn of this
student's learning disabilities and what accommodations will be needed in each
classroom. The coordinator of special education services for this student must
accept the responsibility for educating the classroom teachers.

<p>Of equal importance, the child or adolescent must learn of his or her learning
disabilities. Without such knowledge, nothing makes sense. With this
knowledge, they can begin to understand and to regain control over their
lives. They can stop blaming themselves. As they learn about themselves and
their needs, they can become active rather than passive. They can take control
and begin to feel empowered to have a positive impact on their life.

<p><b>BUILDING THE PARENT'S KNOWLEDGE OF THE CHILD:</b><br>
Because learning disabilities are life disabilities, interfering with
functioning in school, in the family, and with peers, it is critical that the
parents understand their child's areas of disabilities and abilities to the
same extent as the professionals who are to work with this child. They must
know the areas of learning abilities so that they can build on them. They must
know the areas of learning disabilities so that they can advocate for
necessary school services and can accommodate to these disabilities during
non-school activities. They can learn to help their son or daughter compensate
for the disabilities when necessary.

<p>With this knowledge, parents can select family activities, chores, sports and
other activities, and peer interactions that maximize the strengths while
minimizing or adjusting to the weaknesses. With this knowledge they can be
informed and assertive advocates with the school system as well as with
activities outside of school. With this knowledge, they can begin to help
their daughter or son accept and understand the problems. They can demonstrate
how to be an advocate and then teach this child or adolescent to become his or
her own advocate. 

<p>The learning disabilities will be apparent at home. Parents must let this
child or adolescent and the other family members know that they understand.
They understand and they accept. They can reassure this child that the
necessary help is there. They can point out when the disabilities interfere
with family or peer activities and begin to talk about resolutions.

<p>What about household chores? Parents do not want to excuse this child from
such activities. First, they will be giving a clear nonverbal message that
they agree he or she is inadequate. Second, they will create sibling anger at
the double standards. With knowledge, parents can begin to select chores that
build on strengths rather than magnify weaknesses. The child with visual
perception and fine motor disabilities might do poorly loading or unloading
the dishwasher. But, he or she might do well with tasks that require minimal
eye-hand coordination and that build on gross motor skills. He or she could
walk the dog or take out the trash or bring in the newspaper. Suppose this
child has a sequencing problem (i.e., getting the steps of a task in the right
order). He or she might need more help with homework or with getting dressed.
Knowing this, parent can adapt the ways they help. Knowing this, they can
teach this individual to compensate. Suppose a mother says to her child,
"Look, I know it is hard for you to set the table because you are confused
about where to put the fork, knife, spoon, and glass. So, I just drew a
picture of a typical place setting. I will put it in this drawer in the
kitchen. Whenever it is your turn to set the table, feel free to take it out
and use it." What is this parent saying? "You have a disability. I cannot make
it go away; but, I can teach you how to compensate." This child or adolescent
will not be excused from life but will be helped to learn how to succeed in
life.

<p>Success in peer activities is critical to a positive self image and to
building the social skills needed as an adult. With knowledge of their son's
or daughter"s learning disabilities and learning abilities, parents can
maximize the possibility of successes with these activities. How do they
select sports, clubs, and other programs that are most likely to be
successful? They need to select events that build on strengths and then work
with the activity leader and others to maximize accommodations.

<p>Each sport requires different strengths. The child or adolescent with visual
perception and visual motor disabilities might have difficulty with sports
that require quick eye-hand coordination, doing such tasks as hitting,
throwing, or catching a ball. Baseball or basketball might be poorly played
and avoided. A parent can look for sports that require more gross motor
abilities with minimal eye-hand skills such as swimming, soccer, bowling,
horseback riding, sailing, canoeing, and certain field and track events. The
child who refuses to play baseball might excel at swimming. Let swimming be
his or her area of success. Some may find all sports difficult. It might be
possible to improve some of the required skills through practice. If he or she
has difficulty following directions or doing activities in the proper
sequence, parents might practice or provide additional time to learn such
tasks.

<p>What about activities? With knowledge, parents can maximize successes in the
same way as with sports. Suppose a son or daughter in a scout group has visual
perception and visual motor problems but strengths in receptive and expressive
language. He or she goes to a meeting and everyone is working on a project,
e.g., cutting out pumpkins or drawing turkeys. This child does not draw,
color, or cut well and everyone laughs. End of scouts and another failure.
But, if the parents spoke to the scout leader about building on strengths and
minimizing weaknesses, the ending could be very different. He or she might
have been given the job of handing out the paper, squirting the glue, smearing
the paste while others did the drawing and coloring. Or, this child might have
been given the assignment in advance of learning why the turkey is the symbol
of Thanksgiving. While the others did the arts and crafts activities, this
child told the group the history of Thanksgiving. Building on strengths rather
than exposing weaknesses can lead to successes rather than failures. Parent
knowledge and appropriate interventions are essential to accomplish this.

<p>The same strategy is used in selecting day camps or sleep-away camps. If the
child described above was a boy and went to a camp with a major focus on
competitive sports, the outcome might be disastrous. This child would not play
well. His team would not do well and, everyone would get angry with him. But,
suppose the parents thought ahead, using their knowledge of strengths. What
camps would build on his strengths? Perhaps he would do well at a
water-activities camp. Swimming, sailing, canoeing, rowing are all gross motor
sports with minimal need for eye-hand coordination. There, the parents could
think of other problems. Perhaps the camp director needs to tell everyone that
this child might not understand directions the first time told. Or, that he
has a reading and writing problem. Thus, parents will mail tapes for him to
listen to. He will then erase the tape and dictate a letter to be mailed.
Counselors will appreciate such knowledge and, with such knowledge, can make
the camp experience a happy and successful one.

<p><b>BUILDING THE CHILD'S KNOWLEDGE OF SELF:</b><br>
<b>Once the diagnosis of a learning disability is established, it is critical
that the child learns as much as possible about the disabilities</b>. Someone,
probably the diagnostician or special education professional working with him
or her must share this information. The only difference between explaining to
a five year old or to a 15 year old is the style of communicating. For the
younger child, the information might be very general. "You learn better when
you hear things than when you see things." As he or she gets older, more
details can be added. When explaining the learning disabilities, it is
essential that the learning abilities be stressed as well. It us also
important to stress who will be helping the child or adolescent overcome these
problems. 

<p>The special education tutor or other professional working with the child or
adolescent with a learning disability is critical to this educational process.
The traditional model for tutoring or for providing speech and language
therapy, occupational therapy, or other intervention is a passive model. "Sit
down and start to work on the pages I marked in this workbook." or "Today I am
going to say a group of words and ask you to tell me what they mean." The
child or adolescent has no idea why he or she is doing the exercise and has no
opportunity to learn about himself or herself. What a difference if the tutor
were to say, "You know that you have a visual figure-ground problem and that
because of this you might skip words or lines when you read. I want you to
work with me on this exercise that will help you become more aware of this
problem so that you can learn to correct yourself." Or, "I have been working
on helping you improve your auditory perception skills. Today I am going to
say a group of words that sound similar so that we can practice helping you to
minimize this problem area." The passive model makes the student dependent and
often ignorant of the reason for the work. The active model helps the student
learn more about his or her disabilities and abilities.

<p>By middle school or high school, the tutor or other professional working with
the student must shift to the role of consultant and helper. thus forcing the
student to clarify his or her needs. The usual model is for the tutor to say,
"Today I want to show you a way of sequencing and organizing materials before
you begin to outline and then write a paper." Suppose the tutor went over
previous work, gradually helping the student see how his or her problem with
sequencing and organization interfered with writing papers. Then, the tutor
said, "It looks as if you will need to learn how to compensate for your
sequencing and organization problems if you are to put all of your excellent
thoughts down in a paper. I need to help you learn how to compensate. Let me
suggest an approach." By high school, the student needs to be in control and
to see the tutor or other professional as an assistant, helping him or her
succeed. The student should come in and say, "This teacher lectures a lot. If
I just listen to her I understand. But, then I go home with no notes and have
to trust my memory. If I try to take notes, my written language problem messes
me up and I end up with poor and incomplete notes. Worse. I am so busy trying
to take notes, I cannot pay attention and listen. What do I do?"

<p>With knowledge comes understanding and a sense of control. Parents, teachers,
and members of the special education team must increasingly push the
individual to problem solve. It would be easier if the special education
professional spoke to the classroom teacher. But, by high school the student
must understand what needs to be done. If students do not learn to be their
own advocate in high school, they will not be able to be their own advocate
after high school.

<p>How do parents and professionals teach an adolescent to take on the
responsibilities of being their own advocate? This must be done in a
step-by-step process. First, the parent or professional must become
knowledgeable and become the assertive advocate. Next, this adult must model
through their actions and later through role playing how to be a successful
advocate. After modeling, it is essential that the responsibility be
relinquished to the adolescent. The parent or professional must trust that the
adolescent can do the task. Unless the adolescent feels that he or she did
what was needed, he or she cannot take ownership for the outcome or accept the
success as belonging to him or her. Finally, the parent or professional must
be there to cheer and praise the adolescent for his or her success.

<p>First comes knowledge of self. This knowledge improves self-esteem. Then the
student sees parents and professionals advocating. Next comes demonstrations
on how to advocate as they watch how the adults do it. Finally, the student
must learn to be his or her own advocate.

<p><b>Building the Child's Self-esteem</b><br>
Self-esteem is usually defined along two themes. It is based in part on
outside feedback and in part on internal feedback. That is, it is based on
perceived appraisals of significant others and based on the individual's
feelings of performance and competence. The outside feedback represents
inferred social approval while the internal feedback represents self approval.

<p>If a child or adolescent is unsuccessful in school, his or her self-concept,
self-image, self-confidence, and self-respect can only be low. He or she
cannot be talked out of this assessment because these impressions are a
collection of real experiences. When this child or adolescent senses
dissatisfaction with his or her efforts and hears the suggestion that he or
she is not working up to potential, self-doubt moves in. When the best efforts
are met with criticism, failure, and frustration, self-doubt increases as does
a sense of inadequacy. 

<p>The poor self-esteem of the child with a disability will be compounded if he
or she is also unsuccessful with peers and/or within the family. It appears
that he or she is inadequate every place. Gradually, a cycle may begin. Low
self esteem impacts on academic work and on the individual's personality,
resulting in even less successful experiences in school and out of school.
These failures lead to a greater loss of self esteem.

<p>As discussed throughout this chapter, it is critical for the individual with a
learning disability to be identified early and for all of the essential
services to be made available throughout his or her education. It is equally
critical that the family understand the learning disabilities and the
essential role parents must play in helping to maximize success with peers and
in home-based and other activities. With the help of the school system and the
family and with an opportunity to learn about self, the individual with a
learning disability will feel good about himself or herself and build a good
sense of self-esteem. Only with this knowledge and self-esteem can any child
or adolescent move toward self advocacy

<p>I can do no better job of illustrating the concept of self-esteem and the
impact of a learning disability than to let Jill explain for herself. She
wrote this essay (copied exactly as she wrote it) as a college English
assignment and sent it to me shortly after starting college. We had worked
together since she entered middle school and she understood her learning
disabilities and special needs. It was this knowledge of herself that helped
her describe her life.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>I think that when I was born I was put in a rocket ship and taken to another
planet - earth. I never felt that I was like anyone else here. From the time I
was five, I can recall feeling like an outsider. I first remember feeling like
an alien when I tried to communicate. People would raise their eyebrows and
make other facial expressions of confusion when I tried to express myself. I
was aware of starting a sentence in my head but only the last half came out of
my mouth. I know how E.T. must have felt. It was like I was speaking another
language and thinking on another wave length. Constant rejection created
feelings of isolation and isolation created anger and anger creates self
defeat. I could not judge time and was anxious about being late. I never got a
joke (no matter how simple) because it was abstract, and I could never get
myself or my work in order because of my sequencing problems. Printing was
murder because of my perceptual problems and my spacing was the worst. I could
never remember anything but the first part of a direction and the noise level
of the then popular "open classroom" drove me crazy. I always wondered why
everyone got everything the teacher did but me. Definitely wrong planet!

<p>I found one accepting person to be friends with and stuck to her like glue.
Most of my anger at my environment and my inability to control it or even make
sense out of it was directed at my parents and brother because I knew they
couldn't leave me like the others, no matter what I did. Once I kicked a hole
in the wall because I couldn't find my shoes and that proved how dumb I really
was. Only a moron could lose their shoes - I wanted to kick myself but was at
least smart enough to choose the wall instead. It was so hard getting through
everyday life; things that other people automatically did required constant
thought and concern for me. To protect myself, I built a wall around myself.

<p>I could only handle myself and my needs. No one else mattered, not my family
or friends. My family was angry at my self-centered ways. I was the black
sheep - the alien - the different one. I never understood why everyone was so
angry with me. Why didn't they understand that I was just surviving? My
daydreams were of me in a rough and choppy ocean where a storm was raging. I
was all alone in the middle of a great black sea. It took all of my strength
just to stay above the water. I had no energy left to call for help or even
notice if anyone else was around. That's how my life was. I had to be
self-centered to survive.

<p>School was no haven. The teachers said I was unmotivated and not paying
attention. Some even yelled at me and physically shook me. One teacher
who really thought she understood learning disabilities would say "does
everyone understand?" And then she turned to me, as the class followed her
gaze, and said, "and do you, Jill?" I suddenly felt my antenne's
sprouting from my head. Everyone knew I was different when I was taken from
the room for tutoring and later I had to lie about special teachers and the
"resource room" (a place for the "slower kids") In school, it's every
teenagers nightmare to be different.

<p>By high school my conversations had improved to the point where I was accepted
as an "airhead" but I still had to keep my special "help room" a secret. With
careful planning I could sneak into the resource room just as the bell rang
and everyone was out of the halls. Talk about being different - when someone
asked who my English teacher was, no one knew her because only "SPEDS"
(Special Education students) had her and normal kids didn't know she existed.
High school was a turning point. I started noticing things. Dr. Silver, a
psychiatrist who really understands how to explain learning disabilities, made
me aware of ways to compensate for my shortcomings. I began to read people
from their faces and body language. If their faces looked confused, I would
say, "Did I say something wrong?" Or, I would make a joke. Sometimes I would
just start over. Dr. Silver showed me how to use little tricks to get around
my disabilities like leaning forward to concentrate on a professor's lecture
and this trick also helped force out disturbing background noises. Dr. Silver
explained that with my auditory discrimination problems, bars with large
crowds would become very difficult social meeting places for me. I feel like
I'm there, people are there. Music is there but I'm in a plastic bubble
separated from everyone. All the noises, the conversation, the band, the
glasses clinking - all are amplified and blended together like a senseless
drone. I can't hear anyone's conversation because I only hear parts of what
they say and none of it makes sense. I try to fill in the missing parts but my
answers must be off the wall from the reactions I got. I keep thinking in the
middle of everyone having fun. "Scotty, beam me up. Get me out of here!!"

<p>At college, there is a wonderful learning disabilities program. The term L.D.
has come to mean learning desirable to me. I have found my planet! People like
me do exist and they aren't crazy. We even joke about being L.D. Its like a
private club and its not impopular. At dinner, if someone forgets their
silverware there is a chorus of L.D., L.D., L.D. and a knowing smile of
acceptance. (Once, four of us got lost driving to a dance and my friend, the
driver, said, "Oh, no! Four L.D.s and not one has a pencil." She quickly
assigned one part of the directions to each of us. "You remember the first
part, you the second, and you the third." We all laughed at ourselves. At this
college I cannot use L.D. as an excuse. I found that in real life no one cares
if I'm L.D. They only care if I don't try. Its results that count, not
excuses. I really wanted to be a radio d.j., but I knew that with my
disabilities it would be impossible. How could I "cue"" records, answer phone
requests, and check scripts all at the same time. But, guess what? The girl
voted "Biggest Airhead - Class of 1984" just got her F.M. license. Everyone
from professors to students had quizzed me whenever they saw me. No one let me
quit.

<p>Life is still not a breeze. My friends, who say they understand, still get mad
when I say I can't listen to the radio, talk, and hear directions at the same
time. They still can't believe it when I go left when they say right.
Actually, I have more trouble understanding why I do the exact opposite, but I
know I'm not dumb or an airhead. That's how my brain works or doesn't work.
That's me. I'm not different. I'm special! No one is more sensitive to others
than I am. I am my own friend and I have recently begun to feel better about
myself and to like myself. I am having success. I will be an L.D. forever. It
will never go away, but each day I learn to handle another thing or work
something out and things get better for me. How many people can say that??

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><b>BUILDING THE ADOLESCENT'S ABILITY TO DO SELF ADVOCACY</b><br>
For a person with a learning disability to be successful in any post secondary
experiences, he or she must understand his or her needs and know how to be an
informed and assertive advocate. Parents can no longer play this role. As
discussed earlier, parents are the advocates for the child. By middle school
parents and teachers must teach the young adolescent the role of being an
advocate. By high school, the older adolescent must become his or her own
advocate.

<p>Let me illustrate. John was in twelfth grade. He requested to meet with his
English teacher, Mr. Bratten, during the time in August when teachers reported
to work but school had not yet started for the students. John introduced
himself and explained that he had personally selected him as his English
teacher. He then went on to say that he had a reading disability and could not
read very fast. But, the teacher did not have to worry. John had visited the
teacher in June and gotten the list of books to read during the course. He had
read the first four over the summer to get a head start. He knew he would have
a lot of difficulty with one book and had ordered it on audiotape. Thus, he
did not ask for accommodations for reading time. However, he explained that he
did not read well out loud, often mispronouncing words. He asked if the
teacher would mind not calling on him in class to read. He went on to explain
that he had a written language problem and could not write as fast as he
wanted to. He also made spelling and grammar errors. He asked for more time on
tests so that he could finish and that the teacher not grade him down for
spelling. He commented that he would do all home assignments on his computer
and did not need special consideration then. Mr. Bratten thanked him for
coming in and agreed to help in every way possible.

<p>Let's go over John's conversation to see how well he knew himself and his
special needs and how he had learned to be his own advocate. He did not say
that he personally picked this teacher to impress the teacher. He knew how he
learned and what style of teacher was best for him. During the end of his
junior year, he asked all of his friends in the senior class to describe their
English teacher. He picked the one who taught in the way that he learned best.
His special education teacher made sure he got that teacher.

<p>We often tell children and adolescents with learning disabilities that they
"just learn differently" and that with special help they can do well by
working just as hard as everyone else. John knew this was not true. If you
have a disability and want to succeed, you have to work harder than the
average student and you have to plan ahead. He was willing to use part of his
summer preparing for the course because he wanted to succeed.

<p>John knew something else, If his mother had met with the teacher and read off
the list of accommodations, the teacher would have probably said, "Look, I
have 30 kids per class and five classes a day. If your son cannot make it in a
regular class, he should not be in my class." He knew that the teacher would
be more willing to listen to him, especially if he sounded responsible and
more than willing to do his share of the work. Think of the knowledge John had
of himself.

<p>Think of the self-confidence and self-esteem needed to meet with his teacher
in this way. Think of how successful he was as an advocate. Since he did it
all himself, he could claim ownership and could claim the success. None of
this could have happened if the education and modeling work had not started
when he was a child.

<p>To be a successful advocate for oneself, then, requires first of all a full
knowledge of one's learning disabilities, learning abilities, and special
needs. With this knowledge, the person can look ar new subjects, new teachers,
new experiences and project what will go well and what will require special
time, help, or accommodations. He or she can then plan ahead and advocate for
these needs. With this knowledge and advocacy role, the adolescent and young
adult feels in control of life and not helpless. There is confidence gained
when a student knows what he or she needs and how to fight for these needs.

<p>Advocacy takes place with friends as well. If she or he has a receptive or
expressive language problem, communicating with friends might be a major
problem. If he or she has visual perception or visual motor problems, certain
activities or sports might be difficult. He or she needs to assess situations
and decide how to compensate and cope. Perhaps it means selecting certain
activities over others. Perhaps it means meeting with key people in advance
and learning what to expect. Perhaps it means disclosing to a friend so that
friend will understand and hopefully help. As with the earlier example of
Marie, the adolescent might need to learn how to be a self-advocate by
discussing the issues with an adult and, possibly, by modeling the necessary
actions with this adult before trying with the real person.

<h3>IN SUMMARY</h3>

<p>Whether as a parent or a professional, helping the child or adolescent with a
learning disability requires a full understanding of the total person in his
or her total world for each stage of psycho-social development. It is clear
that more is needed than appropriate special education interventions. School
time represents about half of the total world for the child or adolescent. The
role of the family in helping i$ critical as is the help that can be provided
by the leaders of outside of school activities.

<p>The special education team must understand the child's or adolescent's
learning disabilities and abilities in order to develop the best
individualized education plan and interventions. This knowledge is critical
for the regular classroom teachers if they are to be able to accommodate and
adapt the curriculum, teaching style, and classroom.

<p>This knowledge is essential for the parents. They must know their son's or
daughter's areas of learning disability and learning ability if they are to
accommodate and adapt the family to provide the supportive and nurturing home
needed by the child or adolescent with a learning disability. Only with this
knowledge can they intelligently select chores, home activities, sports, and
other peer activities that build on strengths while minimizing, accommodating,
or compensating for the weaknesses.

<p>This knowledge is equally essential to the child or adolescent who has
learning disabilities. She or he must understand fully their learning
disabilities and learning abilities if they are to understand themselves and
if they are to learn to accept and develop a positive image of self. Only with
this knowledge can they understand their special needs and learn to self
advocate to get these needs met.

<p>With this knowledge, school programs can be designed to help the student with
a learning disability fit in and succeed. With this knowledge, parents can
provide the proper family and can maximize social and peer successes. With
this knowledge, the individual can accept, understand, and like himself or
herself. This knowledge of the needs of a child or adolescent with a learning
disability, when applied to the total world he or she lives in, results in the
development of a positive self-image and a strong feeling of self-esteem. With
such feelings, this student will be available to learn to be a self advocate.
The successes that result from being an informed and assertive advocate will
feed back to increase the feelings of self.

<p><b>First comes knowledge. Knowledge is the key to self-esteem and the ability
to self advocate.</b>

<h4>Beginnings of school-based management</h4>

<p>American schools in the 1950s and decades following searched for
&quot;equality of 
opportunity.&quot; Although living in America became increasingly complex with 
fundamental changes occurring in the American family and society in general, 
schools were made responsible for educating a greater range of students than 
ever before. In special education, for example, in the 1970s, students were 
brought into the public schools who had never been allowed previous 
enrollment.

<p>Between the 1950s and 1980s the focus of public attention gradually began to 
shift from equality to concern for greater productivity from schools. The 
public was bombarded with stories about failures of the public school system. 
Schools found themselves responsible for all children and, at the same time, 
the recipients of an unprecedented demand for &quot;excellence in
education.&quot; During the 1980-81 school year the writer was teaching a
special education class for severe emotionally disturbed children at a
typical elementary school in Fort Worth, Texas. The students were bused
to the school from all over the district because of the severity of their
disabilities.

<p>As part of a district-wide pilot program, this school was involved in an 
effort to get more parental involvement, more parental &quot;say so&quot;
in the school. The principal selected several teachers to work with
parent leaders on a &quot;school management team&quot; which met at least
once a month. The principal invited other faculty members to attend the
meetings to promote awareness. A few teachers elected to attend the
meetings, mostly out of a sense of curiosity to see if some of the rumors
were correct.

<p>Some of the parents began to take pads and pencils into classrooms, making 
notes about strategies and methods being used by individual teachers in 
instruction, discipline, and other aspects of daily routine. Some of the 
parents took rather vocal exception to a few of the things they reported. A 
number of the meetings, especially in the beginning, were hostile, divisive, 
and marked by defensive stances on the part of school personnel. Attendance at 
those meetings was the very first exposure for some of us to the latest fad 
coming down from on high -- parental involvement and participatory management. 
I remember retreating to the safety of my self-contained special education 
class, grateful that no members of the management team were selected from my 
classroom.

<p>Reform received impetus in April, 1983, with the release of <cite>A
Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform</cite>. This
document, prepared by the National Commission on Excellence in Education,
represented a &quot;report card&quot; on educational quality in America.
Created because of the public outcry for reform, <cite>A
Nation at Risk</cite> codified the status of American education:

<ul>
  <li>American students fared poorly when compared with students from
other nations,
  <li>millions of American were functionally illiterate,
  <li>standardized test scores were lower,
  <li>achievement of gifted students was not commensurate with expectancy,
  <li>Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT) scores were declining overall,
  <li>highest SAT scores were lower,
  <li>students were unable to demonstrate &quot;high level thinking
skills,&quot;
  <li>scores on measures of science and math were lower,
  <li>achievement scores of college graduates were lower, and
  <li>business and the military complained they were having to spend
millions of dollars to remediate their employees or recruits.
</ul>
<p>
Recommendations to improve the sorry state of American education included 
increased graduation requirements, stringent and more demanding assessments, 
more instructional time devoted to the &quot;basics,&quot; and far more
rigorous teacher training. The final recommendation was one of
accountability--educators and elected officials were made responsible for
educational improvement and reform.

<p>The prevailing popular thought during this time was that excellence could be 
achieved by a series of top-down mandates including implementation of merit 
pay, career ladders, mentoring programs, more stringent graduation 
requirements, restrictions of extracurricular activities for poor academic 
performance, denial of  driver's licenses for school dropouts, exit tests, 
etc. Research suggested, however, that excellence in teaching and learning 
proved to be elusive. Reforms left teaching and learning either unaffected or 
negatively affected by these efforts (cited by Midgley and Wood, 1993).
In 1985 the writer was named principal at a school which served two distinct 
minority populations - Hispanic and southeast Asian. Each group made up 
approximately one-quarter of the total population of students. The school had 
a history of high achievement which had fallen in recent times.

<p>Texas had responded to the reform movement with a vast array of edicts and 
mandates covering everything from the numbers of minutes of instruction for 
various subjects taught in school to site-adopted frameworks and curricula, 
instructional strategies, student grouping, methodology, and the like. 
Achievement was to be measured by statistics on dropouts, attendance, and 
state-wide tests whose results were published in the newspapers and were to be 
used to compare schools and their efforts at &quot;excellence.&quot;

<p>Site-based management was also being mandated in the district. From the 
beginning, management teams were composed of both teachers and parents. Both 
were now to be elected from their constituent groups. The success or failure 
of the teams appeared to be contingent on the make-up of the team, and, most 
importantly, upon the willingness of the principal to share decision-making. 
There was little training provided. Principals were guided by a written report 
which included how the members were to be selected, etc.

<p>My first management teams were used as advisory boards to help make
decisions which would affect the entire school. I had begun my
administration by implementing collaborative decision-making with the
teachers. It made sense that if you wanted teachers to do something, and
to do it well, you had to give teachers not only the responsibility but
also the need to make it succeed. Teachers would have to &quot;buy
in&quot; to what they were doing if they were to really devote themselves,
their time and energy to success! It also made sense that parents would
have to have some &quot;buy in.&quot; We had little parental  involvement
at their school in terms of numbers, but those who became involved were
dedicated and insightful in their recognition of problems and search for 
solutions.

<p>With strong support from the teachers and management team we began such 
innovations at the school as a volunteer program to teach English to parents 
(&quot;hooking&quot; the parents into coming under the guise of teaching
them to help their children with homework). The students actually began
to tutor their parents in speaking and reading English. Written
communications were sent from the school, whenever possible, in Lao as
well as English and Spanish. All teachers were required to obtain
endorsements in instruction of English as Second Language (ESL).

<p>Our program for limited English proficient (LEP) students was total English 
immersion--non-English speakers were placed in their age-level peer classrooms 
regardless of their English-speaking ability. A modified Joplin plan was 
followed whereby students went all over the school to have their reading and 
math instruction. It was not uncommon for students from a fourth grade 
homeroom to have reading in a first or second grade room with mathematics at 
the fourth grade level. Older students in younger classrooms were called 
&quot;assistants,&quot; and they were allowed to progress as slowly or as
quickly as they needed to master components of the curriculum. While
other schools in the district were doing away with reading levels and
reading level assessments, we were using them to measure relative
strengths and weaknesses, to advance students, and to reteach until
mastery was attained.

<p>As a result of changes supported by the management team, gains in English 
acquisition and scores on state-wide tests were documented. The school 
received recognition from the National Council of Teachers of English as a 
&quot;site of excellence in language arts instruction&quot; as a result
of the writing process implementation and concomitant achievement.

<p>In 1986 the Carnegie Forum published a report, <cite>A Nation
Prepared</cite>. This report called for &quot;restructuring&quot; schools
in order to provide a professional environment for teachers (cited in
O'Neil, 1990). With the advent of this publication, nay-sayers were
already dooming  recommendations put into place as a result of the
earlier A Nation at Risk. In 1990 the National Governors Association
issued a report, Results in Education: 1989 which provided a   
&quot;framework&quot; for &quot;restructuring&quot; (cited in O'Neil,
1990). Included in the framework were the following:
<ul>
   <li>Curriculum and instruction. More instruction in higher-order
thinking skills, flexible time usage, challenging and engaging
instructional activities, grouping promoting student
interaction and cooperation.

   <li>Authority and decision making. Decentralization to allow teachers,
parents, and administrators to determine the direction of education at a
school site as well as instructional organization, strategies, and
arrangements.

   <li>New staff roles. Principals to provide vision and leadership to
encourage teachers in taking risk, to reward their efforts; teachers to
work collegially to improve instruction, plan/develop new curriculum, 
design/implement professional development.

   <li>Accountability systems. Building-level consequences for student
performance, schools develop measures to assess performance outcomes.
</ul>

<p>With the two-pronged thrust for change and reform, a strange
&quot;wash&quot; occurred in education. School-based management became
intertwined almost irrevocably with &quot;restructuring.&quot; One way to
demonstrate what happened is perhaps to visualize restructuring as a
great canopied tree in midsummer into which a vine, school-based
management, has proved so invasive that an observer looking 
at the tree cannot differentiate its leaves from those of the vine.

<p>The definition of restructuring became confused. To some,
restructuring implies fundamental reform, changes in curriculum and
instruction, changes in school organization and administration, provision
of supportive work environment for teachers, business-to-school and
school-to-school partnerships and networks, and increased parental
involvement. This, however, is not the prevailing view of restructuring.
For many, restructuring means shared governance, &quot;School-based
management is the reform&quot; (Midgley and Wood, 1993).

<h1 align=center>Teachers and the Law</h1>

<p><b>by Reed Martin
<br><i>Newsbriefs</i></b>, May-June 96 </p>

<p>To afford access to equal protection under the law, as required by the
Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, children with disabilities require
educational modifications. And, to assure that those modifications are
not unduly restrictive, in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment, a written plan must be developed which is based on the unique
needs of that one child with a disability and which will direct the classroom
teacher and other school personnel in dealing with that child for the coming
year. </p>

<p>The IEP meeting is the heart of the special education laws. It is an
analysis of what is going right in a child's education and what is going
wrong. It is the blueprint for next year's program. The teacher is vital
to the development of the IEP, in speaking up about how the program went
this year, what is needed for changes next year, and what problems might
be foreseen for the next teacher. </p>

<p>Laws, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the
Education of All Handicapped Children Act (PL 94-142), now the Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) were passed by Congress more than
20 years ago specifically to make teachers and school districts aware that
they were discriminating against students with disabilities and that such
discrimination hurts. The laws were passed to order school districts and
teachers to change. Twenty years later we are facing much of the same discrimination
and intolerance from school officials and teachers when it comes to ending
discrimination because they often refuse to change. </p>

<p>I always have to point out to teachers that IEP meetings are not a paperwork
burden, which is the usual teacher union and administrator position, but
are the judicially and congressionally required method to end discrimination
against students with disabilities. </p>

<p>It must be upsetting when I remind people that we are completing the
19th school year requiring full compliance with Section 504 and the 19th
year requiring full compliance with the Individuals with Disabilities Act.
When school districts accepted funds under IDEA they had to promise to
comply with it and with Section 504 and promise to train regular classroom
teachers and administrators in the provisions of IDEA. </p>

<p>Apparently, very often in talks, I must explain in too great detail
what the law requires of teachers who deal with students with disabilities.
Teachers seem to get upset when it becomes clear in such presentations
that teachers generally do not know what the law requires, teachers learn
their school is probably far out of compliance with the law, and they do
not like the law because they don't understand it and would prefer to ignore
it. </p>

<p>After a recent speech, a good friend said, &quot;I'm concerned that
you really upset some of our teachers.&quot; However, the usual complaint
that I get is from parents, who report that too many teachers are upsetting
our children with disabilities - refusing to comply with the IEP and making
students with disabilities the subject of repeated disciplinary sanctions.
</p>

<p><i>So what did I sat that leads people to accuse me of upsetting some
teachers?</i> In a discussion with Dr. Ed Martin who was head of the Bureau
of Education for the Handicapped (now called Office of Special Education
Programs) at the time the Education for All Handicapped Children Act was
passed into law, we talked about those early days and Appendix C to the
federal regulations. Ed knew that implementation of the law would require
simple straightforward guidance toward compliance. He created Appendix
C, and asked me among others to help with practical questions and answers
about the IEP process. Appendix C is sixty questions and answers about
the IEP process. Appendix C is as much a part of the law as any of the
regulations that it explains and has been quoted as the law by courts in
all of the federal circuits. </p>

<p>To date, I haven't met a teacher that has read Appendix C even though
Appendix C tells teachers exactly what is expected of them at the IEP meeting.
I am sure that there are a lot of good IEPs out there, but what I hear
when I listen to tapes of IEP meetings are two voices: the parent's and
the administrator's. If there are a teacher's comments on the tape, too
often they are supporting the school district on some policy and explaining
to the parents why their request cannot be accommodated. </p>

<p>Every school district has a booklet that urges the parents to get involved
in their child's education. Many surveys blame the decline in education
on parents not being involved. Yet when a parent makes a request to see
their child's records as a first step in getting involved, the request
may be denied or the acquisition made difficult. </p>

<p>Letters from administrators and even school board members are produced,
which criticize the parents for making such a request. Many parents who
contact me fear retaliation if they ask to see their child's records. </p>

<p>But most disputes arise because teachers will not share their notes
about a child with the parents. In a current (but not the only) case the
teacher comes to the IEP meeting, reads from a folder of notes, then refuses
to allow the parent to see them. The teacher always insists they are private
notes and that the teacher's right to privacy supersedes the parents' rights
that are spelled out in the 1974 Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act and IDEA. Teachers are unhappy to learn for the first time what the
law has been for over 20 years and that they can not choose to play by
different rules. </p>

<p>Continual problems also arise when students with disabilities are in
<i>regular ed</i> where the teacher believes in the status quo: the teacher
runs the classroom and the student must conform or suffer. <i>Inclusion</i>
sets up this controversy wherever there is a failure of educational leadership
to develop appropriate program modifications and acquaint <i>regular</i>
classroom teachers with the requirements of the law. The basic fact is
that the child with a disability has a right to be in the class and the
teacher has to make reasonable accommodations. </p>

<p>As we require the teacher to modify the classroom to meet students'
needs, we may shift our suspicion for the reason for failure in the classroom
from the student, who <i>doesn't try hard enough</i> to the teacher, <i>who
isn't able to reach the student</i>. That concept is difficult for many
teachers. At the IEP meeting, the competency of the teacher to handle a
particular student may well be on the table. The teacher might be directed
to learn a different methodology or employ a different behavior management
approach. </p>

<p>I have been in several cases where a teacher who won last year's Teacher
of the Year Award in that state, and who is wonderful for gifted students,
has shown an inability to teach a student with learning disabilities. When
the law is explained to such a teacher, it must be upsetting. Many teachers
who do not understand the IEP process complain about it taking too much
time. </p>

<p>Many teachers, who never speak up at the IEP, will follow me into the
parking lot and say &quot;I hope you pursue this because our program is
hurting your child.&quot; When I ask, naively, &quot;Aren't you the teacher
who a few minutes ago was sitting in the meeting that was called to discuss
that very problem?&quot;, the teacher will say &quot;Oh, but I couldn't
say anything in front of the administrator.&quot; The law requires the
teacher to speak up. It must surprise teachers and administrators who are
complaining about lawbreaking in the schools when I say the biggest lawbreakers
in the schools are not the students. </p>

<p>I guess I will continue to upset teachers and administrators when I
force them to realize how far they are out of compliance with the law.
Noncompliance is discrimination and discrimination hurts children. I personally
do not think people who hurt children belong in the classroom. And I am
sorry if that upsets anyone. </p>

<P>Jan 2, 1997<BR>
PUBLIC AFFAIRS COMMITTEE </P>

<P>Representative Frank Riggs, Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Early
Childhood, Youth and Families, has announced that a bill reauthorizing
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) will be introduced
when the 105th Congress is sworn in on January 7. Cessation of educational
services will not be mentioned, but proposals to allow cessation will no
doubt be introduced. Hearings - one on discipline and one on funding -
will be held on February 4 and 6, and the full Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee is expected to mark up the final bill in the second
week in March. Senate Labor and Human Services Committee Chairman Jim Jeffords
also expects to act swiftly on the reauthorization. The Subcommittee on
Disability Policy has been eliminated, so, as in the House, there will
be no opportunity for input before the full committees act on the bill.
</P>

<P>Time is short and the need to help Congressmen understand the importance
of IDEA for students with learning disabilities is great. Almost a third
of the 45 members of the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee
are new, as are many of the members of the Senate Labor and Human Services
Committee. However, because of the short time frame, it is vital that ALL
members of Congress hear from their constituents. IDEA is only the first
of the bills affecting individuals with LD which will be reauthorized by
the 105th Congress. Input will be needed as well when bills reauthorizing
the Rehabilitation Act, the Higher Education Act, the Juvenile Justice
Act, and the Vocational Education Act are introduced. </P>

<P>A list of the addresses, phone and fax numbers of members of relevant
committees is attached. Please keep this list for future reference. Remember,
personal contacts are the most effective way of reaching Congressmen. Other
ways of making an impact, in descending order, are personal letters or
postcards, form letters, or phone calls. Letters or faxes have more impact
than e-mail. However, anything is better than nothing. </P>

<P>Please add your personal input to the following sample letter. <A HREF="idea96/IDEA.html">LDA's
position on last year's IDEA bills</A> was sent to all state and local
presidents and to the network. It is posted on the LDA Home Page on the
Internet and was reprinted in the Washington Update section of the Nov./Dec.
1996 Issue of Newsbriefs. Please add your own experiences, - particularly
about the difficulty of determining eligibility for students with learning
disabilities who are performing at grade level only because of their efforts
and the support of their families Stories about the success of students
who benefited from IDEA are also needed.<BR>

<P>Dear Senator (last name) Dear Congressman (woman)(last name)<BR>
I am (an individual with LD, a parent of a child with LD, a professional
working in the field of LD). I am asking you to support the continued federal
commitment to the education of ALL children with disabilities as promised
by IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Despite its flaws,
children with disabilities have greatly benefited from that law. Society
has also benefited as more IDEA graduates have gone on to higher education
and competitive employment. (EXAMPLES HERE) </P>

<P>One of the first acts of the 105th Congress is expected to be the reauthorization
of IDEA. I hope that this reauthorization will make very few changes to
Part B of IDEA Many of the positive changes proposed in the Reauthorization
bills which died at the end of the 105th Congress could be brought about
by regulatory changes. I am afraid that other changes, particularly those
which would deny educational services to certain students with disabilities
or would curtail their rights, would severely limit their opportunity to
obtain an appropriate education. (Attached is LDA's position on the IDEA
bills introduced in the 104th Congress.). </P>

<P>I will let you know of specific concerns when the bills are introduced.
In the meantime, I would be happy to discuss IDEA with you at any time.

<h2>Your child looks perfectly normal but . . .</h2>
<h2>you suspect something is  wrong.</h2>
<h2><i>Why?</i></h2>

<h2>Does your child have an uneven pattern of<br>"Can Do's" and "Can't
Do's"?</h2>


You may worry that your child is not developing like other pre-schoolers
in some ways. Development may be 
<ul>
<li>confusing 
<li>unpredictable 
<li>erratic 
<li>inconsistent 
</ul>

<h3>Consider Your Child's Preschool Skills</h3>

<p>Below are frequent comments describing common characteristics of
preschoolers who might be at risk for being identified as having a
learning disability.
<blockquote>
<p>"He knocks over blocks, bumps into doors, falls out of his chair,
crashes into playmates and catapults himself through space." 
<ul>
<li>poor estimation of space  
<li>poor coordination  
<li>tendency to lurch forward 
<li>double jointed sitting 
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<P>"Her big eyes look up at me and she listens, but I don't seem to get
through."
<ul>
<li>problem understanding what is said 
<li>difficulty remembering what she hears 
<li>problem remembering sequences of sounds
<li>over-sensitivity to noise 
<li>doesn't enjoy being read to 
<li>difficulty following simple directions 
</ul>
<hr width="50%">

<p>"He understands what I say to him but doesn't express himself well." 
<ul>
<li>delayed speech and language
<li>sounds and words out of sequence   (aminals, pasghetti) 
<li>poor vocabulary 
</ul>
<hr width="50%">

<p>"He overreacts or underreacts to everything - it's as though his
emotional thermostat isn't working." 
<ul>
<li>indiscriminate or overreactions
<li>loss of emotional control 
<li>laughter one moment, crying the next 
<li>under or overreaction to touch 
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>"She can talk about topiary trees, but she can't pull up a zipper or
draw a circle." 
<ul>
<li>difficulty using hands to manipulate toys, buttons, etc. 
<li>difficulty, or avoidance of, playing with puzzles and blocks 
<li>clumsiness, knocking over glasses of milk, juice
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>"His vision is good, yet he doesn't seem to perceive things well." 
<ul>
<li>difficulty focusing 
<li>problems distinguishing shapes and colors 
<li>difficulty remembering what he sees 
<li>difficulty remembering the order/sequence of what he sees 
<li>difficulty understanding what he sees 
</ul>

<hr width="50%">

<p>"He never seems to be 'put together' right, yet I spend so much more
time and energy helping him than the other children." 
<ul>
<li>untied shoes, shirt hanging out 
<li>disorganized movement 
<li>difficulty keeping up with his things 
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Often it is the parents who first have concerns when their toddlers are
not "on target" in their development. Sometimes areas of delayed
development are first detected in the doctor's office. It often takes
longer to notice uneven development patterns than to notice overall
delayed development. 

<p><b>Warning signs are just that . . . warnings. </b><br>
They don't necessarily mean there are problems, but they should be
discussed with your pediatrician or family physician at your next visit.
If your toddler is developing normally, your doctor will be able to
reassure you. 

<p>Early intervention with a child who is behind in social, cognitive,
fine motor, gross motor, and/or language development can make a world of
difference. If you see some of these signs in your child, you want to
contact your school district, primary physician, or the local, state or
national LDA office for information. They can guide you on where to start
in determining whether your child has some delays in areas of development. 

<p>Federal law, the Individuals with Disabilities IDEA), provides for a
free and appropriate education for all children with disabilities. This
includes early intervention for preschool children who need special
education services.

<title>Quality Education for Teachers and Special Education Students</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<h1 align=center>Quality Education for Teachers<br> and Special Education Students</h1>

<p><b>by Don Bishop, Secretary, ACLD Foundation</b>

<p>We are often concerned after making  presentations on special
education  law and the rights of persons with disabilities that teachers
in the audience may be  offended. This stems from the similarity of  
parent complaints: the teacher refuses to  comply with the their child’s
IEP, or the teacher subjects our children to unfair and  unnecessary
disciplinary sanctions, and in  some cases the teacher simply does not  
seem to care. So, if we, speaking as lawyers  who represent many parents,
offend teachers it is because our clients demand that we  do so. Our
usual defense, however, is that  it is the law and the requirements of 
the law  that upset teachers and we, lawyers, are  merely the messengers.

<p>Upon calm reflection, one must wonder what it is about lawyers that
upsets teachers and school personnel. Is it the way we present issues,
blaming the problems on the school administration and teachers? Or, is it
the requirements of the law (IEPs, related services, dealing with
parents)? While either of the above reasons would be sufficient to upset
teachers, we really believe that it was neither but was something else.
Presenting the requirements of the law merely contributed to and gave
focus to a sense of frustration and possibly anger that was there before
the presentation. The <i>something else</i>, we believe, are the
restraints keeping the professional teacher from doing a professional job.

<p>We sometimes lose sight of the fact that whether we are lawyers,
teachers, factory workers, entrepreneurs, or public service employees, we
all have some attributes in common. If we are successful, it 
is because we have found a method of doing things that leads to success. 

<p><i>Success</i> as we use the term is adding <i>quality</i> to whatever
we do. To the factory worker success is producing a better, more reliable
product while to the entrepreneur success may be earning higher profits
or capital appreciation. To lawyers, success is making our clients happy
or, at a minimum, reducing their unhappiness to an acceptable level. To
teachers, however, success is feeling that sense of accomplishment when
one sees the incidents of self esteem blossom in a student as it becomes 
clear that the student is learning what the teacher is teaching and
perhaps much more. The teacher's vision and goal is growth and happiness
for their students in the sense of the students' realization of their 
individual potential as reflected by each student's individual abilities.    

<p>Like the rest of us, teachers have developed and honed their skills
over the years by improving on the methods that were successful and
discarding the methods that resulted in failure until reaching a point of 
adopting specific teaching methods which work well for the majority of
students.

<p>It is no wonder that the teacher becomes frustrated to the point of
anger when given a student with learning disabilities, who not only
defies all known teaching methods, but reacts to his or her frustration 
at being unable to learn like the others by disrupting the class. This
student who inherently wants to please the teacher does the opposite, and
it frustrates the teacher, who inherently wants the student to 
learn and be successful.

<p>This is not only a problem today, but it was the situation 20 years
ago which was one of the reasons Congress passed PL 94-142. One would
think that we should have corrected the situation by now. Thus, the real
issue is, <b>why hasn't it been corrected? </b> If a factory worker were
experiencing 7% to 12% rejects in the product being manufactured, that
worker would not only not feel successful, the business would probably be
near bankruptcy. By analogy, is our education program with its 7% to 12% 
failure rate near bankruptcy? If we can use our assets wisely, the answer
is no. If we waste our assets, bankruptcy is inevitable. <i>Our assets
that need to be used wisely are the wisdom and the integrity of the 
professional teacher</i>.    

<p>Let us suggest as an opening premise that any teacher proud of his or
her profession would very much look forward to IEP meetings if the
teacher (1) knew at the time what would be a successful program for a 
student with learning disabilities; (2) were free to prescribe the
program, and (3) the school had the ability and the willingness to
implement the program. In such events, the object of the IEP meeting
would be focused on obtaining the parents' input and the parents' help.
So why do teachers dread IEP meetings?    

<p>Anyone in business will tell you that quality is added at the factory
floor and not from the headquarters. By the same token, educational
quality is added in the classroom -- nowhere else. The federal laws
(IDEA, Section 504) assume this premise by directing the IEP to be
developed on the educational "factory floor", i.e. the classroom. We
suggest that it is time for school administrators to assume that same
premise and let teachers be the professionals that they are trained to be
and they have learned to be. This would remove the first restraint.   

<p>The quality problem in special education is the realization that
either no one knows a prescription that 
will ensure success for students with learning disabilities or, more
probably, those who know are either 
afraid to say or have no incentive to say what would be successful. This
is the second restraint, i.e. silence 
attributable to fear or lack of incentive to develop a successful plan.
Thus the teacher enters the IEP with 
restraints self-imposed or imposed by the school administration and with
little hope of success. The 
teacher feels professionally inadequate as a result. The teacher at the
IEP meeting is in very much in the 
same position that the student with learning disabilities is in when in
the classroom, i.e. an overwhelming 
dread of facing up to his or her own inadequacy in that particular
environment. No matter what the 
outcome in either the IEP meeting or the classroom, there is a very high
probability that both the teacher 
and the student will be frustrated.

<p>One law (the truancy law) makes the student with learning disabilities
attend school and another law 
(IDEA) makes the teacher attend IEP meetings. Simply stated, the law
forces both into an environment 
they both dread and find frustrating. It should not be surprising that
both react in the same manner. 
Frustration leads to anger. The anger of both the student and the teacher
is directed at the nearest 
representative of the frustrating cause -- each other. The normal and
predictable reaction of anger born of 
frustration is either <i>fight</i> or <i>flight</i>. The student
<i>fights</i> with disruptive behavior. The 
teacher fights with stonewalling the IEP. Alternatively, the student
takes <i>flight</i> with depression 
followed by truancy followed by social drop-out. The teacher takes flight
by resorting to alternative 
disciplinary programs or other measures (resource room) to get the cause
of frustration out of sight.

<p>It is a strange paradox that both the teacher and the student are really comrades-in-arms on different 
sides of the same battle. The student suffers with learning disabilities for regular education and the teacher 
suffers with teaching disabilities for special education. Both disabilities result in frustration and anger 
directed at the law or laws which throw them together in an environment that high lights their respective 
disabilities. 

<p>Unfortunately, the law cannot add quality. Only people can add quality. The frustration with the law 
and the anger directed toward its messengers (lawyers) will begin to subside when the teachers with 
teaching disabilities and the students with learning disabilities begin to experience success, i.e. when 
quality is added to the educational process for each. To begin the search for quality, the fight or flight 
reactions can no longer be viable alternatives. Educational bankruptcy will occur as an inevitable 
consequence if there is continual failure to address the underlying problem which prevents quality 
education for persons with disabilities.

<p>Most businesses nowadays address quality problems with a team approach. The IEP team is the team 
approach contemplated by the law. In this sense the law was ahead of its time. The team approach cannot 
function, however, until the frustration, anger, and resentment is addressed and resolved. This will occur 
when the team members (parents and teachers) recognize their own limitations and look to other members 
of the team as people with special expertise that can help. The next barrier to success will be removed 
when the teacher responds as an independent professional and not as a spokesperson for the school 
administration. When professional teachers can put the full force of their cumulative wisdom gained from 
professional training and classroom experience to developing methods to respond to the needs of students 
with learning disabilities, they will find an effective way to add quality to their teaching and to their 
students’ learning.  

<p>We, the parents and the lawyers who have lost faith in the educational system, do have faith in the 
law. But, more importantly, the law still has faith in teachers. By simply following the spirit as well as the 
letter of the law, teachers will be free to be professional. They need not perjure themselves to protect the 
administration's policies. They need not corrupt their professional integrity by remaining silent when their 
professional opinion is sought and needed. They need not undermine their professional authority by 
placating to the outspoken parent with promises and platitudes. They need not diminish their own self-
esteem by disrespect of the parents or the problem student. The laws are designed to free them from 
restraints. When that freedom -- the freedom to be a professional teacher -- is achieved, quality education 
will begin.

<title> Total Quality Management: What’s in it for Schools?</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h1>Total Quality Management:<br> What’s in it for Schools?</h1>

<p><b>Robert "Mick" McNiel</b>
 
<p><font size="-1" face="Arial">Editor’s note: This article gives further
insight into what is meant by "quality education" discussed in the
related article, <a href="bishop.html">"Quality Education for Teachers and 
Special Education Students"</a>.</font>

<p>Many superintendents, teachers, and local business leaders are
studying the concept of total quality and its focus on continuous
improvement within their organizations.

<p>Most school districts are vigorously involved in numerous
transformational efforts, such as site-based management, outcome
assessments, and strategic planning. Is Total Quality Management another 
educational program that needs to be added to the already filled plate of
educators? The answer may lie in the fact that much of what we are
currently doing is part of the concept imbedded in the quality 
movement.

<p>Many might speculate that they are already working long hours, have
been doing an excellent job for years, and, if people would just leave
them alone, they could get on with what they were hired for the 
education of children. 

<p>One might also suggest that everyone in education is doing an
outstanding job, but the threats to public education as we know it might
encourage us to re-evaluate services offered. Today’s educational 
challenges include: 
<ul>
  <li>school choice 
  <li>public funds used for the benefit of   private schools 
  <li>private vendors hired to take over educational school systems
  <li>millions spent by businesses on employee retraining
  <li><i>Channel One</i> programming 
  <li><i>Hooked on Phonics</i> materials 
</ul>
<p><b>The Impact of Total Quality Management (TQM)</b><br>
How can the concepts of Total Quality Management help us? First of all,
we need to understand that TQM is not a program; it is a value-based,
information-driven process for continuous improvement. (Even Dr. 
W. Edwards Deming, one of the originators tied to the quality movement,
responded negatively to the terminology of TQM. He stated, "There is no
such thing as a Total Quality Management program. Our focus should be on
<b>quality enhancement.</b>")  

<p>So what is quality? Quality is perceived by the customer; the job of
the school system is to know customer needs on a daily basis. Educators
have difficulty with the term customer, but basically it refers to 
someone who has benefited from your work both internally and externally.
Internally, customers might refer to the district administration,
faculty, and staff. External customers are the students, parents, 
businesses, community, and even the Board of Education. 

<p><b>Plan, Do, Study, Act</b><br>
Now that your customers are defined, what’s next? In actuality, it comes down to a plan, do, study, act 
cycle that allows individuals to: 

<ol>

<li>Continually plan for improvement. 

<li>Carry out improvement plans. 
 
<li>Utilize measurement tools to study customer needs in relation to
improvement plans.

<li>Continually improve the processes that exceed customer needs. 
</ol>

<p>In other words, what’s good enough for today is not good enough for
tomorrow. Total Quality Management focuses on the processes and
continually improves those processes rather than looking at the 
end result and blaming people for it. It gives people the ability to
break down barriers that prevent them from working well together and
sharing information. It helps them to focus on problems rather than finger 
pointing. 

<p>The hard part of TQM, according to Dr. James Leonard, a consultant in
Deming philosophy, is creating an environment in which students,
teachers, staff, and parents will accept and fulfill their new 
roles correctly, effectively, comfortably, and without fear. 

<p><b>The Deming Philosophy</b><br>
Managers in manufacturing and business organizations receive useful
guidance for creating the environment from 14 principles developed and
taught by Dr. W. Edwards Deming over the past several decades. These
principles are often referred to as The Deming Philosophy. 

<p>We all recognize the problems we face in our schools. we all want to
see changes and improvements. The issue becomes one of how to accomplish
these changes. Total Quality Management may not have all the answers, but
additional study of Dr. Deming’s principles might provide a school
district a sound road map for accomplishing desired changes and
improvements.    

<blockquote>
<b>'The Deming Philosophy': <br>
14 Points Restated for School Boards and Administration: </b>
<ol>

<li>Create constancy of purpose toward improvement of the entire school
system and its services. 

<li>Adopt a new philosophy. We are in a new economic age. 

<li>Cease dependence on tests and grades to measure quality. 

<li>Cease dependence on price when selecting curriculum, texts,
equipment, and supplies for the district. 

<li>Improve constantly and forever every process for planning, teaching,
learning, and service. 

<li>Institute a more thorough, better job related training. 

<li>Drive out fear. 

<li>Break down barriers between groups in the school system. 

<li>Eliminate the use of goals, targets, and slogans to encourage performance. 

<li>Closely examine the impact of teaching standards and the system of
grading student performance. 

<li>Remove barriers that rob staff and administration of pride of workmanship and rob students of the job 
of learning. 

<li>Institute a vigorous program of education and self-improvement for
everyone in the system. 

<li>Plan and take action to accomplish the transformation. 
</ol>

<title>Farewell to Father of Learning Disabilities</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<h2><i>LDA Bids Farewell to</i></h2>
<h1 align=center>Father of Learning Disabilities</h1>

<p>Samuel Alexander Kirk, one of the most influential figures in the
history of special education and especially learning disabilities, died
July 21 at the age of 93. He was often referred to affectionately as the
<i>Father of Learning Disabilities</i>.

<p>Dr. Kirk, who was born in Rugby, North Dakota, in 1904, obtained
bachelors and masters degrees in psychology from the University of Chicago
and a Ph.D. in physiological and clinical psychology from the University
of Michigan in 1935. He began his career in 1929 in Chicago teaching boys
who were mentally retarded and delinquent to read while employed at the
Oaks School. 

<p>Samuel Kirk continued his work on reading during his doctoral studies,
while also working at the Wayne County Training School in Michigan. At
Wayne Country Training School, Kirk collaborated with T. Hegge and W. Kirk
to create the Hegge, Kirk, and Kirk Remedial Reading Drills. These
materials, which were influenced by the work of most of the prominent
figures in remedial reading at that time (M. Monroe, S. Orton, and G.
Fernald) as well as the effects of Kirk's training in <i>functional</i>
(behavioral) psychology at Chicago, are still in use 60 years after they
were developed.

<p>The work with physiological psychology during his doctoral studies led
Kirk to discount biophysical identifications of disability and recommend
more behavioral descriptions (<i>child doesn't read</i>) that could lead
to remedial planning. After completing his Ph.D. in 1935, Kirk worked as
the director of a teacher education program at Milwaukee State Teachers
College (now University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee). Continuing his
interests in reading, in 1940 he published the book, <i>Teaching Reading
to Slow-Learning Children</i>. His early research on remedial methods for
students with mental retardation was interrupted by service in the U. S.
Army during World War II.

<p>In 1947 Dr. Kirk joined the faculty of the University of Illinois to
develop a program in special education for undergraduates and graduates.
Much of Dr. Kirk's pioneering work was done while he was Director of the
Institute for Research on Exceptional Children at the University of
Illinois, which he helped to establish and was its first Director. During
the 1 960s he also served as director of the Division of Handicapped
Children, forerunner to the US Department of Education's Office of Special
Education, in the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.

<p>Later Dr. Kirk devoted considerable effort to developing a means of
measuring specific aspects of linguistic, perceptual, and memory abilities
in young children. The Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Abilities (ITPA)
appeared in an experimental version in 1961 and was revised and published
in 1968 (co-authored with J. McCarthy and W. Kirk). This test, which was
widely used in the 1960s and 70s as a clinical and research tool, provoked
some controversy in special education. Kirk explained that the controversy
was probably because the test  "spawned many illusions and false hopes.
Some people have taken the ITPA as the instrument for diagnosis of all
ills and educational problems. In spite of our warnings, it is used for
junior high school students, even though it is intended for young children
. Many also use it to diagnose problems to which the ITPA does not apply.
Furthermore, many people want to use it without taking the time to learn
how to give it." (Reference Kirk, S. A. ( 1976). In J. M. Kauffman & D. P.
Hallahan (Eds.), <i>Teaching Children with Learning Disabilities</i> (p.
253). Columbus, OH: Merrill.)

<p>Throughout his career, Dr. Kirk contributed regularly to the academic
literature. In addition to the volumes already noted, he also published
other books on mental retardation, reading, and learning disabilities.
Certainly one of the most influential of these was an introductory text in
special education, <i>Educating Exceptional Children</i> (1962), that has
been revised repeatedly and, now co-authored by James J. Gallagher, is in
its 6th edition.

<p>During his tenure in Washington, he contributed to early federal
legislation that ultimately led to contemporary laws on special education.
Perhaps his greatest legacy to the field of special education is the many
students who studied with him, including several who have been highly
influential figures in special education during the last 30 years.

<p>In addition to his scholarly work on mental retardation, Kirk is widely
known for his contributions to the development of the field of learning
disabilities and is often said to have coined the term <i>learning
disabilities</i>.

<p>Dr. Kirk was present when groups of frustrated parents first met to
seek help for their children who today we know had learning disabilities.
He was instrumental in helping those parents form the Association for
Children with Learning Disabilities (ACLD, now the Learning Disabilities
Association of America, LDA) and served as the first Chairman of its
Professional Advisory Board. In honor of his devoted service to the
organization and to the field of learning disabilities, he remained the
Honorary Chairman of the PAB for the remainder of his life.

<p>Much of the progress made in understanding learning disabilities and in
serving persons with learning disabilities is attributable to the
pioneering work of Samuel A. Kirk and his longtime collaborator and wife,
Winifred D . Kirk . We, in LDA, are thankful that we had the privilege of
knowing and working with Dr. Kirk. The insight shared by Dr. Kirk
benefited us all and the accomplishments of many professionals in the
field of learning disabilities are directly attributable to the
foundations he laid.    After more than 20 years at Illinois, Kirk moved
to the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, where he continued to
play an active role in special education.

<p>He is survived by his wife, Winifred D. Kirk, his daughter, Lorraine
and son, Jerry. If you would like to write a note to Mrs. Kirk, her
address is 7500 N. Calle Sin Vidia, Tucson, AZ 85718. If you would prefer
to do something special in Dr. Kirk's honor, the ACLD Foundation has
established a fund in his memory. Contributions can be sent to ACLD
Foundation, 4156 Library Road, Pittsburgh, PA 15234. The Foundation will
acknowledge the gift directly to the family.

<h1 align=center>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>

<h2 align=center>Reauthorization of IDEA</h2>

<p><b>Justine Maloney
<br>June 2, 1996</b></p>

<p>On May 31, the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee passed
its version of the reauthorization of IDEA Despite the arguments of the
Democratic members, the amendment which would remove the provision in the
bill which would allow schools to treat students with disabilities who
bring a weapon or drugs to school and whose behavior is not a manifestation
of their disability as they do students without disabilities failed on
party lines. The Republican response to the argument that a number of states
do not cease educational services to students but rather send them to alternative
education programs was that advocates in states which did not have alternative
education programs should work for legislation at the state level, because
the federal government should not tell states what to do. Fortunately,
the Committee passed the Miller amendments which would require that a hearing
officer review any decision to end educational services and to make it
harder to find that the behavior was NOT a manifestation of the disability.
Amendments to require that the evaluation be multi-disciplinary, to restore
the child count for funding, and to strike restrictions of the Policy Letters
from the Department of Education failed. </p>

<p>Rumor has it that the Senate bill may come to the floor for a vote next
week. The House bill may move to the floor within a couple of weeks. There
are only 20 legislative days left in this session of Congress. If IDEA
is to pass in this Congress, these bills must be passed without amendments
and/or a lengthy floor fight. Moreover, one staffer whose member supported
the removal of the cessation provision warned that if the bill is open
to floor amendments, the final bill could be worse than the one just passed
by the Committee. </p>

<p>Several national organizations, including DLD (the Division for Learning
Disabilities), TASH (The Association for the Severely Handicapped), SAFE
(Schools are for Everyone), and UCPA (the United Cerebral Palsy Association)
have come out in opposition to the bill, willing to give up discretionary
programs in order to keep Part B as it is. The LDA Board must now decide
whether to </p>

<ul>
<li>oppose both bills now because they include cessation of educational
services. </li>

<li>stay silent on both bills because LDA cannot support cessation of services.
</li>

<li>support the bills because the positive changes outweigh the negative
changes. </li>

<li>wait until the final bill comes out of the House Senate conference,
and if it is unacceptable, ask for a Presidential veto. </li>
</ul>

<p>LDA must also take into consideration the facts that </p>

<ul>
<li>the authorization for the discretionary programs (early intervention,
personnel preparation, research and development, and information clearing
houses) will expire, Appropriations committees are reluctant to provide
funding for programs which have no authorization, as shown by this year’s
battle to restore funding for discretionary programs </li>

<li>the 105th Congress, particularly on the Senate side, may be more anti-federal
government than this Congress. Hence, new IDEA bills could be worse than
the current ones. </li>

<li>efforts to reauthorize the discretionary programs could get waylaid
because of the need to reauthorize the higher education act, and </li>

<li>parents and advocates are beginning to burn out. This process has been
going on for 3 years now-. </li>
</ul>

<p>The following information is given to help make that decision. </p>

<p>IMPROVEMENTS OVER CURRENT LAW (General concepts only. Details on demand.)
</p>

<ul>
<li>Parents are to be involved in eligibility and placement decisions for
their child. </li>

<li>Evaluation to consider the emotional and social needs of the child.
</li>

<li>Reevaluation to consider whether the child continues to need special
education, not whether or not he/she has a disability. </li>

<li>The regular education teacher, when appropriate, participates in the
IEP Process. </li>

<li>Accommodations are written into the IEP </li>

<li>the IEP must consider the behavioral and communication needs of the
child, when appropriate </li>

<li>Students with disabilities must be allowed to take standardized assessments,
with accommodations, if necessary. </li>

<li>transition considerations, i.e. course of study, to begin at age 14.
</li>

<li>the IEP team reviews the childs needs and necessary supplementary aids
needed before the child’s placement is changed </li>

<li>mediation must be offered to parents in an effort to settle disputes
</li>
</ul>

<p>PROVISIONS IN ONE BILL AND NOT THE OTHER:TO BE SETTLED BY CONFERENCE
</p>

<ul>
<li>funding based on child count (Senate) or percentage of school population
(House) </li>

<li>the evaluation team must consider whether the students problems may
not be primarily the result of limited English proficiency, cultural, environmental,
or economic disadvantage, or poor instruction (House) </li>

<li>a teacher can call an IEP meeting to consider further strategies for
dealing with a problem child (House) </li>

<li>short term objectives (House) </li>

<li>Policy letters cannot be used in a due process (House) </li>

<li>data collection includes disability category, race, and gender (House)
</li>

<li>parents or persons with disabilities make up the majority of the state
special ed advisory committee (House) </li>

<li>exemptions to the local maintenance of effort and highest professional
standards </li>

<li>Interagency agreements of payment for related services </li>

<li>Federal Interagency Coordinated Council eliminated in House bill </li>
</ul>

<p>CONCERNS WHICH HAVE BEEN SETTLED SATISFACTORILY </p>

<ul>
<li>Waivers for 10 model LEA’s in House Bill eliminated </li>

<li>Waivers to 4 State Model Programs for Part H. House, withdrawn temporarily
</li>

<li>Federal commitment to 40% of excess costs restored to House bill </li>
</ul>

<p>PROVISIONS IN BOTH BILLS TO BE OPPOSED BY LDA </p>

<ul>
<li>Cessation of educational services for students with disabilities </li>

<li>Lowering of highest professional standard </li>

<li>Encouraging (Senate) or requiring (House) parents to use their insurance
money </li>

<li>Reducing attorneys fees if 1) the parent or attorney does not give
a 10 day advance notice of the intention of filing a due process or 2)
the parent does not give a 10-day advance notice of intention of placing

<title>Alert 17: ACIR to  vote on IDEA as an unfunded mandate
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#F0F0F0">
<h1>Alert 17:<br>ACIR to Vote on IDEA as an Unfunded Mandate</h1>
<p>From: Public Affairs Committee<br>
July 18, 1996
<p><b>Background</b><br>
The Advisory Committee on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR), established by 
the Unfunded Mandates Law of 1995, will vote on its final report to Congress 
on Tuesday, July 23, 1996. Despite the fact that civil rights laws and IDEA 
were exempted from the unfunded mandates, ACIR's initial report, which was 
issued in February, had recommended that the private right to legal action 
under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the IDEA be eliminated. Although 
the final report does not mention either the ADA or the private right to action
under IDEA, including the IDEA in a report on unfunded mandates is potentially 
very dangerous, particularly in view of the fact that the chances for a 
reauthorization of IDEA in the current Congress are dim and getting dimmer.

<p>The three recommendations on IDEA are:
<ul>
<li>Increase federal funding for IDEA to 40% of the excess cost
<li>Relieve state and local governments from "prescriptive administrative and 
    recordkeeping requirements".
<li>Increase the use of mediation and other forms of alternative disputes 
    resolution.
</ul>
<p>
LDA President Sandra Britt has written to all members of the Commission urging 
that IDEA be removed from the report because:
<ul>
<li>States clearly have the responsibility to provide an education to all their
children. Children which disabilities are entitled to the same educational 
opportunities as their non-disabled peers. The funding provided by IDEA is 
intended to help the states to provide those opportunities. The "prescriptive 
administrative and recordkeeping requirements" of the law are intended to 
ensure that federal funds are spent wisely for the purposes for which they were 
intended.<br>

<li>The report perpetuates the myth that IDEA is not a litigious law. LDA has 
no objection to the use of mediation as an alternative to due process because 
it benefits both children with learning disabilities and the school systems 
which serve them. However, children with disabilities and their families must 
retain the right to redress wrongs under the law.<br>

<li>Because IDEA is clearly exempt from the Unfunded Mandates LAW and because 
the reauthorization of IDEA now being considered by Congress addresses some of 
the concerns expressed in the ACIR report, LDA urges the Commission to remove 
all references to IDEA in its final report.

July 17, 1996<br>
The Honorable William F. Winter, Chairman<br>
U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations<br>
600 K Street, N W<br>
Suite 450 South Building<br>
Washington, DC 20575<br>
<p>
Dear Governor Winter:
<p>
LDA, the Learning Disabilities Association of America, is a national, 
non-profit volunteer organization whose membership is approximately 60,000. 
Our membership is comprised of individuals with learning disabilities, their 
families and friends, and the professionals who serve them and is dedicated to 
improving the lives of individuals with learning disabilities. Over half of the
children served under IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, 
are identified as learning disabled. The effectiveness of IDEA in preparing 
these children to be productive citizens is demonstrated by the increasing 
number of students with learning disabilities who go on to college or into 
competitive employment.
<p>
LDA is very concerned about the recommendations regarding IDEA which appear in 
the revised draft of the  ACIR (Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental 
Relations) report to Congress for the  following reasons:
<ul>
<li>
The ACIR, which was created by the Unfunded Mandates Law of 1995, has no 
authority to make recommendations about IDEA because that legislation 
specifically pointed out that IDEA is NOT an unfunded mandate.<br>
<li>
States clearly have the responsibility to provide an education to all their 
children. Children with disabilities are entitled to the same educational 
opportunities as their non-disabled peers. The funding provided by IDEA is 
intended to help the states to provide those opportunities. The "prescriptive 
administrative and record keeping requirements" of the law are intended to 
ensure that federal funds are spent wisely for the purposes for which they were 
intended.<br>
<li>
The report perpetuates the myth that IDEA is not a litigious law. LDA has no 
objection to the use of mediation as an alternative to due process because it 
benefits both children with learning disabilities and the school systems which 
serve them. However, children with disabilities and their families must retain 
the right to redress wrongs under the law.
</ul>
<p>
Because IDEA is clearly exempt from the Unfunded Mandates LAW and because the 
reauthorization of IDEA now being considered by Congress addresses some of the 
concerns expressed in the ACIR report, LDA urges you to remove all reference to 
the IDEA in your final report.
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>
Sandra Britt<br>
President, LDA

<h3>IDEA</h3> 
<p>When Congress recessed on August 2 without acting on IDEA, most 
advocates thought that the bill was dead because there was so little 
time left (5 weeks) in this session of Congress. However, on Aug. 15,  
Sen. Bill Frist e-mailed the following message: 
 
<blockquote> 
"September offers last chance for IDEA to pass this year. S.1578, the 
IDEA Amendments of 1996, failed to make it out of the Senate before the 
August recess. I had hoped to get the Senate bill passed on Aug. 2,  
but literally ran out of time. After months of intense negotiations, a 
final package of amendments failed to clear the calendar for debate and 
vote. As of now the Senate stands in recess until September 3. When the  
Senate returns in September, we will continue to negotiate a package of 
amendments that all sides can agree upon and hopefully bring IDEA to the 
floor for a vote. If successful, we will sit down and work out  
the differences (between) the Senate and the House bills. I believe that 
we can all work together to get a bill out of Congress that we are proud 
of and that we can support, and that will continue authorization for  
critical IDEA programs." 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>Reportedly, Senate and House staff or working on the conference 
report to reconcile differences between the two bills. However, in view 
of the short time left, and the number of bills to be considered,  
there still may not be enough time to pass a final bill. However, our 
position remains that of  the position paper adopted by the Board on 
June 6, 1996, which lists provisions that LDA can support, those with  
which LDA has serious concerns and those which LDA is not prepared to 
support. We will keep you posted. 
<pre> 
</pre> 
<hr width="75%"> 
 
<h3>Legislation which has been or is expected to be signed into law</h3> 
<p>The Conference Report for the five year extension of <b>The 
developmental Disabilities Act</b>, which funds the DD Councils and the 
Protection and Advocacy Systems, was signed into law by President  
Clinton. 
 
<p>The Conference Report for <b>The Welfare Reform Act - (HR 3734)</b> 
which denies cash assistance to some low income children with 
disabilities; denies medical assistance, including early  
intervention, to children who no longer qualify for SSI and cannot 
qualify for Medicaid through another eligibility category; and denies 
access to most immigrant with disabilities; and limits access to food 
stamps for people with disabilities - is ready to be sent to the 
President for his signature. Unfortunately, the Simon Specter Literacy 
Provision in the Senate Bill, which would have allowed states to count 
the participation of welfare recipients in adult basic education, 
literacy training, and GED preparation programs as educational 
activities meeting the work requirement of this bill, was dropped in the 
conference report. 
 
<p>The Conference Report for <b>The Kennedy Kassenbaum Health Care 
Bill</b> (HR 3103), which would prohibit the denial of health insurance 
for a pre-existing condition, is expected to be signed by the President. 
<pre> 
</pre> 
<hr width="75%"> 
<h3>Legislation on which further action must be taken</h3> 
<b>The Education Appropriations Bill</b> for fiscal 1997, which includes 
funding for the IDEA discretionary programs, has passed the House (HR 
3755). The Senate is expected to act on it in September. 
 
<p>The Conference Report on <b>The Workforce and Career Development 
Act</b> (HR 1617 - The Job Training Bill) which would replace more than 
80 programs with block grants for at-risk youth programs, 
vocational education, adult literacy, and adult job training was passed 
on July 17. The bill is stalled awaiting House and Senate floor action. 
 
<p><b>The Local Employment and Flexibility Act</b> (S 88, HR 2086) would 
allow states or localities to submit "flexibility or coordination plans" 
for any federal program "under which financial assistance is available". 
Although Civil Rights under Section 504, IDEA, or ADA cannot be waived, 
a state or community could decide to use IDEA funds for general 
education rather than for special education for children with 
disabilities. 
 
<p><b>The Parents Rights and Responsibilities Act</b> (HR 1946, S 984) 
would prohibit any government official from interfering with a parent's 
desires in the areas of medical care, discipline, home schooling and 
religious education. The implications for children with disabilities are 
unclear. 
<pre> 
</pre><hr width="75%"> 
<h3>A victory to savor</h3> 
Remember <b>The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental 
Relations(ACIR)</b>? Thanks to inputs from consumers all around the 
country, the Commission, on a 13 to 7 vote, rejected the controversial 
report, which included recommendations that IDEA be amended to 
"relieve state and local governments from prescriptive and recordkeeping 
requirements." Authorization for ACIR ends in October, so hopefully, 
that crisis is over.

<h1 align=center>GLOSSARY</h1>


<P><b>Affective Illness:</b> Disorder(s) of mood and affect with
associated vegetative symptoms producing discomfort and
maladaptation-malfunction (see below for various patterns).</P>
 
<P><b>Bipolar disorder:</b> Classic manic-depressive disease characterized
by discrete periods of depression and mania interspersed with well states. 
Cyclothymia: Chronic, long-standing (greater than one year) state of
hypomanic/ hyperactivity with moment to moment, day to day (mixed days) of
both manic and depressive moods and feelings with no prolonged, stable
(well) states. 

<P><b>Depression:</b> A discrete period of symptoms persisting for more
than 34 weeks and associated with poor functioning either at work
(school), home, or in play. The two major symptoms are: 1)dysphoric mood
characterized by both statements and appearance of sadness, unhappiness,
pessimism, loneliness with associated moodiness and often being difficult
to please; and 2) low self-worth (self-deprecation/poor self-esteem):
feelings of worthlessness, uselessness, and being dumb, stupid, ugly, or
guilty, along with beliefs of persecution, death wishes, and suicidal
thoughts. Four or more of the following symptoms are usually present
during the depressive episode:
<dl>
<dd>agitation
<dd>insomnia
<dd>lowered school performance
<dd>diminished socialization (or change to an unacceptable social group)
<dd>loss of interest in school, physical complaints
<dd>loss of usual energy and dropping out of usual fun, sport, or
aesthetic activities
<dd>change in appetite or weight. 
</dl>
Depending upon the number of symptoms and severity of malfunctioning,
depression is characterized as either "minor" or "major". 

<P><b>Dysthymia:</b> (chronic minor depression) Chronic. long standing
(greater than one year) depressive moods and feelings (dysphoria) along
with variable vegetative symptoms of insomnia, low energy, and decreased
interest that fluctuates in the pattern of mixed days with occasional "all
bad" days, but with no prolonged, stable (well) states. 

<P><b>Dysthymia With Bipolar Features:</b> Dysthymia with brief, recurrent
"moments" (periods) of hostile anger. 

<P><b>Hypomania:</b> (Chronic hypomanic/hyperactivity) Persistent
hyperactivity with inappropriate cheerfulness, silliness, giddiness,
intrusiveness, and interruptive-disruptive behavior. Racing thoughts with
push of speech, inappropriate, provocative sexual activity, irritable
moods, and decreased need for sleep can become apparent in older children
(ages 3-8 years). 

<P><b>Juvenile Rapid Cycling Bipolar Disorder (JRCBD):</b> Chronic, long
standing (greater than one year) moment to moment or day to day (mixed
days) fluctuations of both manic and depressive moods and feelings with no
prolonged, stable (well) states but without any evidence of chronic
hypomanic/ hyperactivity. 

<P><b>Mania:</b> The hallmark of mania is two symptoms: 1) euphoria (most
commonly a total denial of any problems as one is disrupting the
environment and life of others and/or inappropriate feeling of
well-being); and 2) rages, hostile anger (ire) that can be associated with
homicidal thoughts and statements. An episode of mania is characterized by
these two symptoms persisting for a period greater than 1-2 weeks along
with the symptoms and behaviors of hypomania. Associated with these
symptoms, there must be malfunctioning in three environments of school,
home, and play. (Occasionally the individual will have malfunctioning in
only one or two of the environments.) 

<P><b>Manic-depressive Disease (Classic Bipolar Disorder):</b> Episodes of
depression persisting for more than 2-4 weeks and mania persisting for
more than 1-2 weeks interspersed with long periods (months or years) of
stable (well) states. 

<P><b>Primary Disorder of Vigilance:</b> A dominantly inherited condition
characterized by loss of alertness/wakefulness (vigilance) during
activities requiring continuous mental performance
(attention-concentration) or continuous task performance Individuals with
the Primary Disorder of Vigilance have a unique temperament: kind, caring,
affectionate, compassionate, and the inability to hold a grudge.

Distribution of diagnoses for 100 children consecutively referred to the
outpatient Pediatric Behavioral Neurology Program at the Children’s
Medical Center of Dallas (only 99 children are represented because one
child with affective illness, primary disorder of vigilance, and learning
disability did not fulfill criteria for ADHD). The mean age of the group
was 10.3 years (range, 5 years 5 months to 18 years 9 months), with 73
boys and 27 girls. Racial distribution of the population was 93 white,
six black , and one Oriental, and all were of at least middle-class
socioeconomic status. A large number of the children had more than one
specific diagnosis (comorbidity of disease and all ADHD (inner circle)
could be explained by one or more of the specific entities of affective
disorder, primary disorder of vigilance, and learning disability.

Children<br> and Adolescents with Affective 
Illness</h2>


<p>
<h3>Individual, family, and environmental counseling</h3>
<blockquote>
Remove inappropriate stressors: Use bypass strategies; demands and tasks 
in keeping with the young  person's facilities. 
<p>Informative: Emphasis on genetics, biology, and maturation with 
potential cycles. 
<p>Educative: Emphasis on what is known and not known; avoid 
rationalization and misinformation. 
<p>Supportive: Be a positive advocate. 
<p>Reassuring: A treatable and self-limiting condition with anticipation 
of long periods of well states. 
<p>Assist with order and planning: Toward school, work, play, and pursuit 
of assets and talents. 
<p>Assist with decision making "Continue usual pursuits"; "Do not drop 
out." Cognitive coaching on a  "mini" daily basis: "Learn to think 
positive _ act positive."  "Come to know that actions should dictate  
feelings," "Intelligence should overrule emotions." 
</blockquote>
<p>
<h3>Psychopharmacologic treatment</h3>
<blockquote>
Tricyclic antidepressants: Amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, 
nortriptyline, protriptyline, doxepin, clomipramine 
<p>Newer antidepressants: trazodone, maprotiline, fluoxetine, 
sertraline, paroxetine. 
<p>Thioridazine (and rarely haloperidol - other major tranquilizers are 
not presently being used). 
<p>Carbamazepine.
<p>Lithium.

<body bgcolor="F0F0F0">
<h1 ALIGN=CENTER>Learning Disabilities Association</h1>
<h3 ALIGN=CENTER>Writing Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) For Success - Part II</h3>
<p><b>Barbara D. Bateman,  Ph.D., J.D.</b>
<p><em>Due to the length, this paper is presented in three parts:</em>

<dl>
 <dd><em><A href="bateman1.html">Part I</a></em>
 <dd><em>Part II (this part)</em>
 <dd><em><A href="bateman3.html">Part III</a></em>
</dl>

<h4>DEVELOPING THE IEP</h4>
<p>
The proper team has assembled, the student's photo is prominently placed, the
calming herbal tea has been served, the tape recorder is on and the newsprint
is on the easel. It is time to begin developing the IEP. A three-step IEP
development process is strongly recommended:

(a) List the student's unique characteristics or needs that require
individualization (and which entitle the student to individualized services);

(b) Determine and specify the district-provided services and modifications
that will appropriately address each need; and

(c) Write the goals and objectives that will be accomplished by the student if
the services and modifications are appropriate and effective.
<p>
An IEP "Non-Form" consisting solely of a blank piece of paper oriented
horizontally can accommodate this process far better than existing forms.
Divide the paper into thirds and label the three columns something like: (1)
Student's Needs; (2) Services; and (3) Evaluation of Services. Other headings
that work well are (a) Individualize because.....; (b) What the district will
do; (c) How we'll know it is working. 
<p>
<b>The Student's Unique Characteristics or Needs </b><br>
First, the IEP team must determine the student's unique characteristics or
needs to which the special services will be directed. One helpful way to learn 
to think in terms of these essential characteristics is to imagine that you
are describing the student to a volunteer who has never met the student and is
going to take him or her camping for a week. The IEP is required to address
only the portions or aspects of the student's education that needs to be
individualized. The student should be visible in the IEP. Too many IEPs reveal
only the academic program available in the resource room and show nothing
whatsoever about the student. The primary focus of the IEP is going to be the
specification of services. This initial step is to determine what is
necessitating the services.
<p>
If we complete the statement, "We are individualizing Johnny's program because
"_______" those "because" are his unique needs. The "because" may be such
things as: (a) he is reading several years behind where he should be; (b) he
is unable to organize his assignments, homework; or (c) his attention is too
easily distracted away from work, etc. These are the exact needs to be
addressed in the next column.
<p>
When a legal dispute arises about a student's program, a common concern is
whether the services provided addressed all the student's special needs. Those
special needs are what must be specified in this first stage of IEP
development. It is difficult to imagine how one could either attack or defend
the services offered to meet unique needs unless those needs had been
specified. In addition to the real world knowledge the IEP team members have
about the student's characteristics/needs, it may be helpful to consult any
current evaluations. This is particularly important for the first IEP which
immediately follows the evaluation which found the student to be IDEA
eligible. Some evaluations fail to address a student's special needs; others
can be very helpful.
<p>
Characteristics or needs will often "cluster." The team may well decide in the
next stage that one service will address more than one characteristic or need.
However, at this point it is important to just "brainstorm" and list all the
unique characteristics that require individualized attention. Sometimes the
natural flow seems to be to work "across" the IEP Non-Form, i.e., when a
characteristic has been identified, to then decide what service or
accommodation will address it and finally determine the goals and objectives
for that service that will indicate its appropriateness. Other times it may be
better to list all the characteristics first, then move to services and then
to goals. Either way, or a combination, is perfectly OK.
<p>
Examples of characteristics (not all from the same student) in both academic
and social-emotional-behavioral areas follow. Remember that for each, the next
inquiry will be, "What will the district do about this?" Some examples of
unique characteristics or needs in academic areas are:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) Handwriting that is slow, labored, "drawn," nearly illegible due to
improper size and spacing of letters and words;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) Lacks understanding of place value and regrouping in both addition and
subtraction;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) Attributes literal, concrete meaning to everything he hears and reads;
doesn't get jokes or slang;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) Understands spoken language, decodes words accurately, but does not
comprehend material read independently; oral reading reveals severe lack of
expression and no attention to punctuation;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(e) Works very slowly, becomes upset if he makes a mistake, quits and refuses
to continue if paper is "messy",
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(f) Answers before thinking, both in oral and written work; work is impulsive;
many "careless" errors; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(g) Gets arithmetic problems `"messed up" and copies them incorrectly off
board and out of book. Lines up problems incorrectly and also lines up answers
wrong in multiplication and division.
<p>
The law requires that the Present Level of Performance (PLOP) in these areas
of need be indicated in a way that is readily understandable and is precise
enough to allow us to measure progress. The PLOP can appear either as an
elaboration of the characteristic or need or as the chronological beginning
point in a succession of PLOP, behavioral objectives, and annual goal. The
PLOP is now, the objectives are short-term goals, and the goal is where the
student is headed by the end of a year.
<p>
If the PLOP is treated as a quantification of the characteristic or need, then
a PLOP for the slow, barely legible handwriting in example (a) above might be
"copies 5 words per minute with 1 or 2 of the words illegible."
<p>
Some characteristics or needs are sufficiently descriptive as they are and
need no quantification, e.g., lacks understanding of place value and
regrouping. To say that the student performs zero regrouping problem;
correctly adds little to the description.
<p>
Sometimes a present level of performance can be best described by a work
sample. A picture can speak very loudly, as in a timed handwriting sample
which could be attached to the IEP as a PLOP. Such a sample can reveal both
quality (content) of written expression as well as mechanics of handwriting.
<p>
Some examples of unique characteristics or needs in social-emotional-
behavioral areas would be :
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(a) Shy; no friends; never volunteers in class; never initiates social contact
with other children;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(b) Bully; doesn't know how to play with other children; physically aggressive
with smaller children;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(c) Over-reacts and has temper outbursts; is noncompliant; pouts and whines;
is sullen and negative when suggestions are made; and
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
(d) Short attention span; easily distracted by sounds.
<p>
These characteristics would be treated just the same as academic needs. A PLOP
would be added if necessary and then the team would ask what the district will
do about the bullying or the shyness or short attention span.
<p>
<b>The Special Education, Related Services and Modifications - the District
Will "Do's"</b><br>
The second inquiry the team should make is, "How will the district respond to
each of the student's needs? What will we do about Joe's need for help in
making friends? What will we do about Toni's tendency to work rapidly and
carelessly? What will we do about Manuel's anger problem?" The special
education, related services or modifications the district will provide can be
conveniently thought of as the "district do's." The "do's" are listed in the
middle column of the Non-Form. They may be as creative, flexible, innovative,
and often inexpensive as the team's brainstorming and combined wisdom allow.
This listing of services becomes the "Special Education and Related Services"
which the law requires be on the IEP and which is too often omitted or simply
perverted into a mere check mark or a percentage of time in special education.
The amount of related services such as speech therapy or physical therapy that
is needed must be shown, along with the date the service is to begin and the
anticipated duration of the service.
<p>
One of the interesting issues about services is the question of whether
methodology need be specified. If, for example, the service is remedial
reading, must the method be spelled out? In general the answer is "no".
In 1977, when the IDEA rules were first proposed, they would have mandated
that methodology and instructional materials were to be included in IEPs.
However, when the rules became final that requirement had been dropped, In the
meantime, some states and districts had moved quickly and already had forms
that included methods and materials. It is not unusual to find those forms
still in use. One disadvantage of including method is that so doing means an
IEP meeting would have to be called to change the method. If method isn't on
the IEP it can be changed unilaterally as the teacher sees fit.
<p>
Methodology becomes a source of conflict when parents are convinced their
child will receive benefit from a particular method and will not benefit from
the method the district wants to use. The most frequently sought methods are a
particular method of communication for students who are deaf and direct
instruction and/or phonics based reading programs for students who are
learning disabled. Almost all courts agree that schools may usually select the
method. However, in rare cases parents have been able to show that a
particular method is necessary to allow the IEP to be "reasonably calculated"
to allow benefit, e.g., <em>Hawaii Dept. of Education v. Tara H</em>., Civ.
No. 86-1161, (D.HI 1987). It is extremely important to note, as no court has
yet done, that when the U.S. Supreme Court said methodology should be left to
the state (school) it said so in the context of presuming the school had
expertise in all relevant, effective methods <em>Board of Ed. v. Rowley</em>,
102 S.Ct. 3034, (1982). This is not usually the case.
<p>
A common and interesting question related to these "District Do" services
relates to in-service training for teachers. Rob, e.g., has Tourette's
Syndrome and needs a teacher who is knowledgeable about how his involuntary
vocalizations are affected by stress. The agreed upon service to be provided
by the district is inservice training by the local physician for all the
school staff. Does that "district do" belong on Rob's IEP? Yes, it does. It is
a service to meet his unique need. One concern is that such a service doesn't
lend itself directly to a goal formulated in terms of Rob's behavior. This
concern is easily addressed by looking to what we hope to see in Rob's
behavior as a result of having an informed, sympathetic teacher who assists
him in avoiding unnecessary stress. One obvious answer is improved academic
performance. Other outcomes could be a direct decease in frequency and
severity of his symptoms and an increase in socialization.
<p>
Another issue is that the service is not being provided directly to Rob.
Legally, an important question is whether Rob is receiving some special
education, i.e., some specially designed instruction to meet his unique needs,
which is delivered by qualified special education personnel. If he is not
receiving any special education, as defined in the law, he is either not
eligible under IDEA or he is not receiving the free appropriate education to
which he is entitled. If he is receiving special education then it does not
matter how the in-service training for his teachers is conceptualized.
Logically, in-service staff training is perfectly analogous to parent training
and is, therefore, a related service. If so, it is important to specify, as
for all related services, how much in-service is to be provided and when.
<p>
For many years some districts resisted including on IEPs the modifications
needed in the regular classroom. However, it is well settled law that they
must be included. A checklist of types of modifications (e.g., in grading,
discipline, assignments, texts, tests, etc.) can be helpful to insure all
necessary modifications are addressed.
<p>
<b>The Present Levels of Performance, Goals and Objectives-Evaluating the
District "Do's"</b><br>
The third step, after the needs have been delineated and the services
specified, is to write the required annual goal and behavioral objectives for
each special education service or cluster of services. The clustering of
services can be very efficient as well as conceptually illuminating. For
example, think of a secondary student who has a severe learning disability
affecting his written expression. He might need several services including
keyboarding instruction, tutoring in writing, modifications in test-taking and
length of written assignments, substitution of oral presentations for some
term papers, and modified grading. The entire service cluster could be
reasonably evaluated in terms of his improved rates of successful course
completion and attendance.  Other goals could also be very appropriate. The
point is that just as characteristics or needs can be clustered to provide one
service, so services can be clustered to be assessed by a common, single goal.
<p>
Writing goals and objectives begins with asking, "If the service we are
providing is effective, what will we see in Todd's behavior that tells us so?"
The purpose of the mandated goals and objectives is to evaluate the service.
We need to know when or if to change what we're doing, to change the service
we are providing. As long as  we're on track and the child is making
reasonable progress we just keep going. That's why objectives are to be
statements of <em>how far</em> the student will progress toward the annual
goal (12 month objective) <em>by when</em>.
<p>
One of the common and major problems with goals and objectives is that they
are not taken seriously by their writers who have no intention of actually
checking whether the student has reached them or not. It is as if we never
understood the most basic tenet of the IEP, i.e., that we are going to try the
listed services and see <em>if they work</em> for that student. The goals and
objectives are to be <em>real</em>. They are to be used to evaluate program
effectiveness. They are not just legal requirements to be completed and filed.
The contrast can be seen easily.

<h4>LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSITION COMPONENTS OF IEP</h4>
<p>
Transition services must be included in all IEPs when the student reaches age
16 and may be included for younger students if deemed appropriate by the IEP
team (<em>OSEP Letter to Anonymous</em>, 17 EFLR 842). Preventing school
drop-out is to be a major factor in determining when transition services are
needed (<em>OSEP Letter to Bereuter</em> 20 IDELR 536). Transition services
are a coordinated set of activities that promote movement from school to such
post-school activities as post-secondary education, vocational training,
employment, adult services, independent living and community participation.
They must be based on the individual student's needs, taking into account his
or her preferences and interests. Transition services must include
instruction, community experiences, and development of employment and other
post school adult living objectives. If appropriate, daily living skills and
functional vocational evaluation may also be included.
<p>
<A name="TRef"></a>If the IEP team determines an individual student does not need 
services in one or more of these areas the IEP must contain a statement to that effect 
and the basis upon which the determination is made (<em>OSEP Letter to Cernosia</em>.
19 IDELR 933). See Jim's <a href="#NonformT">Non-Form IEP transition component</a> for 
an example of such a statement regarding employment. Before the student leaves school 
the IEP must also contain, if appropriate, a statement of each public agency's and
each participating agency's responsibilities or linkages (including financial)
for the transition activities (34 CFR 300.346(d) and comment).
<p>
The IEP meeting must include a representative of the public agency providing
and supervising the transition activities and, if appropriate, representatives
of other participating agencies. In almost all situations the familiar
district representative required for all IEP meetings would qualify as this
representative. If appropriate, the student should also be there to ensure her
or his needs, preferences, and interests are addressed. It is difficult to
imagine circumstances where it would not be appropriate for a student who has
a learning disability to be at the meeting. If the student cannot attend,
other methods of participating must be used (34 CFR 300.344(c)(3)).
<p>
The ultimate responsibility for providing transition services rests with the
school district (or state education agency if district fails) and there is no
provision for a waiver of this requirement. Thus it applies to all public
agencies to whom IDEA applies and, if a participating agency defaults on
service provision, it is the school that must find an alternative way to
provide the service. However, nothing in IDEA relieves a participating agency
of any of its responsibility for serving or paying for services for that
student.
<p>
Two 1994 due process hearings against an Iowa district resulted in rulings
that the district's failure to provide appropriate transition planning and
services precluded the district from graduating the student and obligated it
to provide further vocational programs (<em>Mason City Comm. Sch. Dist</em>.
21 IDELR 241 and 21 IDELR 248).

<h4>DEVELOPING THE TRANSITION COMPONENT OF THE IEP</h4>
<p>
The transition component of the IEP is just that, a part of the student's
regular IEP. It is not a parallel document, a separate thing, or a "transition
IEP." All the IEP development requirements and procedures discussed earlier
also apply to the transition component. The legal significance of transition,
being but one aspect of the IEP process, is substantial. A student is entitled
to those transition services which for that student are either special
education or related services necessary to enable the student to benefit from
special education. The period of "benefit" to be considered has arguably been
lengthened beyond school and into adult life, but the substantive entitlement
is still to special education and related services, not to those plus
transition services.
<p>
One logical beginning point for the transition component is with the team
reaching agreement about the individual student's needs with regard to the
three mandated areas of: (a) instruction; (b) community experiences; and (c)
employment and other post-school living objectives. If the team deems it
inappropriate to address an area, presumably because the student presents no
unique needs, the IEP must include the basis for that determination. The
student's needs, taking into account interests and preferences, can be
explored prior to the meeting and substantial input should also be sought from
the parents. Questionnaires are appropriate.
<p>
Zigmond (1990) has studied extensively secondary programs for students with
learning disabilities and suggested four major areas of program need. First,
many of these students need, and too few receive, intensive basic skills
instruction. Too many programs slight basic skills altogether, believing it is
too late while others require students to "do" basic skills activities, but
provide next to no real instruction. What Zigmond calls "Survival Skills"
includes explicit instruction needed by most LD students in behavior control,
teacher-pleasing and study skills including test taking. The third need is for
successful completion of courses required for graduation. As schools suffer
funding cut backs, so-called basic level courses in math and English often
disappear, leaving IEP teams to struggle with issues of granting graduation
credit for resource room courses or for extensively modified regular courses.
One legally correct solution is for the district to establish what the
essential, minimum requirements are for credit toward graduation. Those may be
rigorously adhered to, as long as reasonable modifications are allowed in how
the requirement is met. The IEP should lay out these understandings clearly
and explicitly.
<p>
Transition needs are the last area Zigmond addresses. She points out that
about 12 to 30% of graduating LD students go on to college and they, of
course, have transition needs related to selecting and applying to a school.
She also notes that vocational education programs in high school are not
necessarily a better ticket to job success than are more academic programs. We
are left reaLizing, again, that many secondary programs still need improvement
and that we must truly look, in the IEP process, at the individual needs and
situation of each student.
<p>
One of the most important additional skills needed by many students who have
learning disabilities is self-advocacy. The student's presentation of his or
her needs at the IEP meeting may itself provide one opportunity to assess and
discuss self-advocacy skills. Another concern for some students with learning
disabilities is passing the examinations required to obtain a driver's
license. Using the same basic three-step inquiry process used in the rest of
the IEP and with self-advocacy and obtaining a driver's license as the
student's needs we can illustrate the inclusion of transition services on the
IEP. This Non-Form is nearly identical to that used earlier to show Joe's IEP.
The only difference is that the present level of performance is included in
the first rather than last column. That is just another way of doing it and is
unrelated to the fact we are illustrating transition.
<p>
It is important to note that the Secretary of Education has acknowledged that
not all the IEP content requirements, especially goals and objectives, are
appropriate for all transition services (FR 44847, discussion of 34 CFR
300.346). No IEP team should use time or energy trying to fit transition needs
and services into a format including annual goals and objectives unless it
truly makes sense to do so.

<h4>CONFIDENTIALITY OF IEPS</h4>
<p>
Many secondary teachers report they have no idea which of their students, if
any, are on IEPs and that they never see the IEP even when they are informed a
student has one. This is sad, perhaps sometimes even tragic. By its very
nature a good IEP is always helpful and sometimes essential in providing an
appropriate program for the student. Rarely is a student's disability so mild
or limited that she or he requires no modifications or accommodations in
regular middle school or high school classes.
<p>
When this process of hiding IEPs from teachers is questioned the common answer
suggests a belief that confidentiality would be violated if IEPs were shared.
While it is true IEPs are education records and must be treated as such, the
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) has an exception which is
pertinent. Under Reg. 99.31(a) of the FERPA regulations, an educational agency
may disclose personally identifiable information from the education records of
a student without the written consent of the parent "if the disclosure is to
other school officials, including teachers, within the educational institution
or local education agency who have been determined by the agency or
institution to have legitimate educational interests" in that information.
<p>
Furthermore, even if there were a confidentiality problem under state law or
district policy it could be readily solved by parental permission to share the
IEP with all teachers. Parents should insist teachers have copies of the IEP,
even if it means they themselves must provide them to the teachers. Of course,
it should go without saying that the IEP should not contain any information
beyond what is required. It would not be appropriate, e.g., to include the
category of disability or an intelligence score, etc.

<h4>DISCUSSION</h4>
<p>
We are all new at incorporating transition services into the IEP and into the
broader world. Few rulings are yet available to assist us in understanding new
requirements. Already a few areas of confusion are emerging. Several are in
the direction of an unduly expansive reading of the new regulations.
<p>
First, the transition activities which must be addressed, unless the IEP team
finds it unnecessary, are: (a) instruction; (b) community experiences; and (c)
the development of objectives related to employment and other post-school
areas. There is a tendency to confuse these three requirements with the
post-school activities to which the three are to be directed, i.e.,
post-secondary education, vocational training, employment, adult services,
independent living, etc. Many "lists" are available which can be seen as
suggesting the IEP must address the latter directly rather than the former.
<p>
A second source of confusion is that by erroneously viewing the transition
component of the IEP as a thing unto itself it is easy to forget that IDEA
entitles the student who has a disability only to special education and
related services. The transition services to which a student is entitled must
fit the definition of one or the other. Therefore, each required transition
service must be either specially designed instruction to meet the students'
unique needs (taking into account his preferences and interests) or it must be
required to enable the student to benefit from that instruction. The fact that
transition services must qualify as either special education or related
services may not pose a significant limitation since one could argue that
almost any transition service is necessary to enable the student to reap the
benefits of all the special education she or he has had to date.
<p>
A third overly broad reading is the failure to recognize that "student's
preferences and interests" refers to determining the student's needs, not to
delineating the services to be provided (34 CFR 300.18(b)(1)(2)). One way to
approach the question of student needs is to envision a typical weekday and a
typical weekend after secondary school. Is the student still living in his or
her parents' home? Has she gotten an apartment? Does he know how to find
apartment ads in the classifieds? How to respond to an ad? How to locate the
address?
<p>
The exact process the IEP team goes through in looking into a student's
post-school future and planning for it will differ from student to student, as
it should. The essential elements which will not vary include student and
family participation and the willingness of the IEP team to address all the
areas of need-intensive and effective basic skills instruction (not just
exposure and not just repetitious practice), explicit survival
skills, graduation requirements, and transition.
<p>
Properly used, the IEP can be an extraordinarily useful tool in building the
future we desire for our students who have learning disabilities.

<h4>Forms of school-based management</h4>
What is school-based management? School-based management takes many forms, 
depending upon its shareholders or constituents. Regardless of its component 
parts, however, school-based management has one commonality. It is school 
governance from the bottom-up rather than top-down. (Midgley and Wood, 
1993)
<p>
School-based management was implemented to empower school staff to create 
conditions in schools that would facilitate improvement, innovation, and 
continuing professional growth. Because the prevailing reforms had failed to 
repair the system despite great public focus, teacher morale had diminished; 
and the diminution of morale was accompanied by reduced teacher effort. 
School-based management would delegate more authority and flexibility to 
school staff Along with authority, however, was accountability in the threat 
of parental choice or open enrollment and annual school performance reporting 
(David, 1989).
<p>
The premise of school or site-based decision making is a relatively simple one 
- &quot;restructure&quot; the planning, implementation, and evaluation of educational 
programs by bringing decision making from the central administration to the 
local school. &quot;Site-based decision making is a process for decentralizing 
decision to improve the educational outcomes at every school campus through a 
collaborative effort by which principals, teachers, campus staff, district 
staff, parents, and community representatives assess educational outcomes of 
all students, determine goals and strategies, and ensure that strategies are 
implemented and adjusted to improve student achievement&quot; (Texas Education 
Agency, 1992).
<p>
The rationale for school-based management was learned from industry - the 
school has the primary decision-making role, and its outcome, decisions should 
be made at the lowest possible level (cited in David, 1989). In order to bring 
about change, participants must share ownership both in its definition and in 
the flexibility to adapt that change to individual circumstances. Successful 
change cannot be imposed externally. The notions of lowest-level decisions and 
definitions of change account for the very essence of school-based management, 
increasing school autonomy through some combination of school budgetary 
controL, relief from constraining policies and contracts, and shared authority 
to make decisions (cited in David, 1989).
<p>
The true basis for school-based management is delegation of autonomy from the 
district to the school level. Analysts have described authority, or autonomy, 
as decision-making authority in the three critical areas of <b>budget, staffing, </b>
and <b>curriculum</b> (cited in David, 1989).
<p>
<b>Budgeting</b> authority has been given to schools, if at all, in varying ways. 
Schools may receive lump-sum budgets or some portion of budgets for certain 
expenditures. Autonomy is dependent upon the degree of freedom allowed in 
budgeting at the school site. Typically funds are allocated to schools on the 
basis of per-pupil figures. Many districts require approval of school-based 
budgets by line staff members, while others require only superintendent or 
board approval with oversight by central finance staff (David, 1989).
<p>
In Fort Worth budgets for individual schools are expected to be developed by 
the school-based decision-making team. Funds are placed at the school on a 
per-pupil basis with certain funds marked as &quot;carryover,&quot; while other funds, 
also allocated on a per-pupil basis, are designated as &quot;non carryover.&quot; Each 
year additional monies have been placed in site-based budget by program 
directors, thereby increasing the autonomy of the local school in terms of 
prioritizing expenditures. Costs for all aspects of school management are 
budgeted at the site with the exclusion of basic salaries and benefits for 
allocated staff. Lunchroom monitors, for example, if desired, must be budgeted 
using school-based funds. Custodial overtime must be covered by school-based 
funds.
<p>
<b>Staffing</b> decisions allocated to school-based management councils or teams 
usually are one of two types-- defining positions, and selecting personnel to 
fill those positions. Once the number of certified teachers is determined by 
enrollment, residual dollars are available to many councils for additional 
teachers, part-time specialists, aides, or clerical support. Under 
school-based management, vacancies due to retirement, transfer, or increased 
enrollment may be filled at the local school level, often from a pool of 
applicants screened by the district.
<p>
In 1990 the writer was transferred from the original 450-member school to a 
larger, new school.
<p>
Early on at the new school, hiring staff on recommendation of grade-level 
peers was implemented. Interviews are usually done by several teachers and one 
or both administrators. The teachers and administrator(s) usually reach 
consensus about the applicants before positions are filled. The rationale is 
simple--if a teacher, either new or experienced, is to succeed at a school, 
he/she must have peer support. By being involved in placement decisions , 
teachers are more willing to share their professional expertise and valuable 
time.
<p>
<b>Curriculum</b> decisions made by school-based management teams are usually
made within the framework of goals and core curriculum mandated by the state and/or 
district. Curriculum decisions are impossible, however, in some school sites 
because of highly prescribed curricula, required texts, and mandated testing 
(David, 1989). When curriculum decisions are school-based, coordination is 
required for students who move from school-to-school within a district. 
<p>
Delegation of control over curriculum stimulates creation of new, innovative 
ideas and materials, but it requires new lines of communication and district 
wide committees to coordinate. David (1989) observed that most teachers have 
neither the desire nor the time to create and adapt curriculum beyond what 
they normally do in their own classrooms. Typical participation does not 
require formal school-based management decisions on curriculum; many districts 
have committees of teachers who actively choose texts and define curriculum 
while providing opportunities for input into both from other teachers in the 
field. Most curriculum is written during the summer by teachers who are paid 
stipends for their efforts. Under school-based decision making in the area of 
curriculum, the school staff, instead of district personnel, initiate and lead 
the efforts.
<p>
School-based management is not limited to staff empowerment. Schools where 
staff are empowered, however, are characterized by greater teacher 
collegiality and collaboration, &quot;schools within schools,&quot; ungraded classes, 
and even creative uses of technology and equipment. Under school-based 
management, schools may gain authority to make changes in areas not typically 
designated to them by a waiver process.
<p>
Texas has a system whereby textbook publishers solicit the state board of 
education for adoption. The board typically adopts textbook series from five 
publishers from which the local districts may select one. In 1992-93 Fort 
Worth was in the process of selecting basal reading texts. Committed to &quot;whole 
language,&quot; the texts reflected a wide array of literature-based choices.
<p>
The school-based management team at our school had begun to realize that there 
was a problem with reading at the school. Every year from 10 to 20 percent of 
first graders were unable to read on first grade level. The dilemma was one of 
what to do -- retain the child (which was largely rejected because of negative 
results on the child reported in research), place the child in second grade, 
or work intensively with the child at both first and second grade. 
Combinations of all three solutions were tried, none was totally satisfactory.
<p>
The team began looking for alternatives. Research articles, summaries of 
research studies, etc., everything we found on reading instruction was shared. 
Members of the team visited other schools to see what they were doing in the 
area of reading. Part of the school-based budget funds was used to secure 
substitutes for the teacher members of the team. It was finally decided to 
utilize an entirely different approach to language arts instruction--an 
approach tied to a publisher who was not one of those selected by the state. 
As a result of a waiver, the school was allowed to implement the Open Court 
language arts program. Initial data suggest the change was a productive 
one.
<p>
The waiver process itself was extremely time-consuming. The members of the 
management team had to win the support of their constituents -- nothing would 
have succeeded without the total commitment and agreement of the faculty. They 
&quot;bought into&quot; the program and were enthusiastic in their training by company 
consultants during the spring of 1993. Training opportunities have been 
maintained by company consultants for new and experienced staff.
<p>
Research on school-based management support personal observations. Schools 
with autonomy plus participatory decision making have much higher teacher 
satisfaction, morale and professionalism. Teachers are willing to try 
innovations and risk failure with instructional arrangements and practices in 
the classroom. They are willing to take the time to try new methods, new 
ideas, change. When teachers feel that their time and energy are balanced with 
real authority, they are not only more satisfied, but they also grow 
professionally. They are willing to assume responsibility for success or 
failure of planned change (David, 1989)
<p>
Researchers who studied school-based management councils in three districts, 
Dade County, Florida, Prince William County, Virginia, and Edmonton, Alberta, 
Canada for two years found that transferring power allowed staff to respond to 
students' instructional needs and to redirect school finances accordingly 
(United States General Accounting Office [GAO], 1994). It was difficult, 
however, to ascertain any impact on student performance, in part because of 
the diversity of the quality of reforms adopted by the councils (cited in 
Richardson, 1994).
<p>
Experience in the three districts with school-based management studied ranged 
from four to eighteen years. Most of the schools changed instructional 
programs by extending the school day, adding accelerated courses, and offering 
all-day kindergartens. They also adjusted school budgets, shifting resources 
between staff, supplies, and equipment. Teachers and administrators in some of 
the schools were found by the researchers to be so concerned with school 
governance they were unable to focus on instruction (GAO, 1994).
<p>
Dade County Florida Public Schools was the fourth largest school system in the 
United States in 1989. Some form of school-based management was used by many 
of the schools in the county. Committees consisting of teachers and the 
principal met to develop academic priorities and to draw up school budgets 
based on those priorities. The committees reallocated funds to increase 
teacher stipends, develop lead teacher programs, and, in one school, to 
contract with an outside firm to teach Spanish. Some principals had veto power 
over decisions, but many relinquished that right in favor of persuasion and 
consensus-building (Stover, 1989). Research on Dade County councils, however, 
found no significant change in standardized-test scores over the pilot program 
period. One reason may be that standardized tests may be inappropriate 
measures for assessing the types of educational innovations that school-based 
management is intended to promote, such as greater problem-solving skills and 
the ability to work collaboratively in groups. Such measures may ignore the 
benefits derived from collaborative decision making, such as higher staff 
morale and more positive school climate (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
<p>
By 1992 at least four states, Colorado, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Texas, 
had mandated some form of participatory school decision making. Initial 
enthusiasm in such large systems as Chicago, Illinois; Miami, Florida; Los 
Angeles and San Diego, California; and Rochester, New York had given way to 
intensive reevaluation of its usefulness. Many educators and members of the 
general public agreed that school-based management had provided a mechanism 
for greater parent and community involvement as well as improved teacher 
morale, but anticipated achievement gains as measured by standardized tests 
had not occurred (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
<p>
Priscilla Wohlstetter, director of the School-Based Management Project for the 
Consortium for Policy Research in Education, observed &quot;School-based management
is everywhere, but nowhere&quot; (cited in Bradley and Olson, 1993). School-based 
management evolved into many things, diverse and variant, making evaluation of 
the entire movement difficult, if not impossible.
<p>
Mandated by Governor Roy Romer in 1991 in Denver, Colorado's 112 public 
schools, results of school-based management have been mixed. There was 
criticism that the central administration had not implemented collaborative 
decision making. Critics complained that there were no formal goals and no 
evaluation of effectiveness in place. Spokesmen from the Citizens for Quality 
Schools, a Denver advocacy group supporting reform, complained that the 
district had not &quot;embraced collaborative decision making as a primary reform 
strategy&quot; (cited in Bradley and Olson,1993). After the first year, the 
advocacy group perceived that the administration was reluctant to yield power 
to the schools, and progress toward tangible goals was sluggish. While the 
district had identified major goals for achievement and attendance, they had 
failed to couple these with reform, to focus attention and evaluation of 
school-based management councils on growth in those areas. Denver councils who 
have made progress have done so in the areas of attendance, discipline, and 
tardiness policies (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
<h4>Problems in school-based  management</h4>
<p>
Problems have surfaced in school-based management. There has been a tendency 
to start local school management with inordinate concern over governance. One 
school moved into school-based management with a council composed of faculty 
members elected by peers and the building principal. The faculty council 
requested the school secretary to uke minutes for all teacher meetings. The 
principal voiced objections, pointing out that with all the team, grade-level 
meetings, etc., too much of the secretary's time would be consumed. The 
council persisted. The secretary attended several meetings, generating some 12 
to 15 typed pages of texts which were given to faculty members to edit. 
Another meeting was called, and the vote was reconsidered. Although the entire 
process had taken a great deal of staff time and produced no tangible results, 
the process had in effect been a &quot;reality-test&quot; by the faculty. The principal 
had not vetoed the bad decision, and the faculty had acted responsibly in 
reconsidering (Aronstein, Marlow, and Desilets, 1990).
<p>
Another problem with school-based management is the notion that school 
improvement should come from dominant &quot;values&quot; in each community.
Decisions to 
improve instruction should be based upon research. Local school groups need to 
be involved in goal setting and decision making, but they must have 
information to enable them to accomplish the task. Research has identified the 
kind of learning environment that enhances student motivation, challenges all 
students, accelerates learning, and maximizes potential. Such knowledge and 
research must be shared with teachers and parents who are in a position to 
decide how that knowledge relates to their schools and circumstances (Midgley 
and Wood, 1993).
<p>
Although school-based management teams should attend more to research than to 
community values, management teams must be cognizant of community values. They 
must inform and represent their constituents in order to avoid fire storms of 
controversy. In 1992 Adrian Michigan schools undertook a &quot;whole child&quot; 
approach to school improvement. The school board was challenged by vocal 
protestors who claimed that the program had &quot;New Age&quot; elements and
&quot;promoted 
satanism.&quot; The schools finally had to retreat from their position (Willis, 
1992). Persons in a well informed community where all sides are allowed to 
express their concerns and views before decisions are finalized will not be 
herded into accepting views held by a vocal minority.
<p>
Before effective sustained change can be implemented, there must be a common 
vision for what the education environment will look like once changes are 
made. Pervasive changes in the cultures of schools must occur rather than 
add-on programs, new instructional strategies, or the latest curriculum reform 
(Midgley and Wood, 1993).
<p>
Seymour Sarason (cited in Midgley and Wood, 1993) proposed the notion that 
&quot;schools are cultures.&quot; Cultural change is complex and difficult because it 
involves questioning basic assumptions, challenging the status quo. Reformers 
who call for pervasive change stress that reform in education must be an 
ongoing process rather than a series of attempts to respond to the latest 
educational innovations. School reform, has, unfortunately, largely continued 
to stress one change at a time, without considering specifics of context and 
school culture (Ann Liberman, cited in Midgley and Wood, 1993).
<p>
When schools are given only marginal authority and are asked to form site 
councils which must develop written improvement plans and annual progress 
reports, teachers tend to perceive the entire process as more &quot;top-down 
demands.&quot; This perception is intensified when districts retain tight control 
over accountability. The practice of delegating responsibility without real 
authority leads to staff alienation (David, 1989).
<p>
One reason cited for problems with school-based management is that teachers 
have been given little opportunity to make decisions about &quot;tracking, design 
of report cards, prevalence of gifted and talent program or programs for 
at-risk, use of standardized tests, and structure of the school day&quot; (Sharon 
Conley, cited in Midgley and Wood 1993). Teachers want to be allowed to make 
decisions about issues which are of primary interest to them.
<p>
The Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA) was implemented in that state after 
the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that the state's system of schooling 
was unconstitutional. KERA created a new system of public education supported 
by increased and more equitable funding. In exchange for being held 
accountable for improvement, schools were given authority to make school-level 
policy decisions. Monetary rewards were attached to success with sanctions for 
failure (David, 1994).
<p>
Each school was to form a council with authority to set policy in eight areas: 
curriculum, staff time, student assignment, schedule, school space, 
instructional issues, discipline, and extracurricular activities. Councils 
were also given responsibility for staffing decisions when vacancies occur, 
consulting on other staff hiring, and changing staffing patterns at the 
margins. KERA requires all public schools by the year 1996 to form councils 
composed of three teachers and two parents (elected by peers) and the school 
principal (David, 1994). 
<p>
KERA also included curriculum frameworks that communicate goals, professional 
development in support of their implementation, mandatory ungraded primary 
program, and a set of new assessment instruments forming the basis for 
accountability. The new assessments emphasize direct measures of performance 
and thinking, including portfolios and performance tasks (David, 1994).
<p>
During the first year of KERA, the school management councils were a major 
force in communicating the importance and seriousness of the act. Teachers 
welcomed the opportunity to select principals, and parents were glad to have a 
voice in school policy making. Challenges which had to be overcome that first 
year included shifting from adversarial to partner relationships, focusing 
school decision making on teaching and learning, ensuring ongoing 
opportunities for on-the-job professional development and finding balance 
between state and district requirement and school council discretion (David, 
1994). 
<p>
The second year reflected progress toward the goal. With the ceding of 
budgets, clarification of council authority, release of baseline test scores 
and targets for each school, the state stressed school-based management as a 
significant change in decision-making authority. The Kentucky Court of Appeals 
recently ruled that school councils have &quot;real authority&quot; to run the schools 
while school boards are limited to &quot;oversight&quot; (David, 1994). 
<p>
Researchers have repeatedly identified leadership as a crucial element in 
effectiveness of school-based management. The key to success of local school 
councils lies to a great extent with the principal (Guthrie, 1986). David 
(1994) found that principals determined to a large degree the type of 
operation of the Kentucky councils. &quot;Principals who are accustomed to sharing 
authority are more likely to have effective councils whose members feel that 
they have a real voice. Principals who are traditionally more authoritarian 
are more likely to head councils whose teacher and parent members feel 
powerless&quot; (David, 1994). When the school staffs give background information 
to parents and value their participation, parents become active participants. 
In some cases parents on the council or auxiliary committees are valuable 
sources of information on group-process skills and budgeting (David, 1994).
<p>
Council members cause problems when they come to the council with personal 
agendas. School management councils cannot become forums for dealing with 
problems of individual students, teachers, or parents. Issues need to be 
debated openly if they are to be resolved effectively. Councils must also 
communicate their roles to their constituencies if they are to be successful. 
Councils that see themselves representing the whole school will bring issues 
to the staff and the community for discussion and input, conduct surveys, and 
create clear channels of communication (David, 1994).
<p>
The leadership style of principals plays a major role in determining the type 
of council their school will develop. The role of the principal, however, has 
greatly changed as a result of school-based management. Principals find they 
are no longer the primary decision maker. Their role has shifted from decision 
maker to facilitator (Drury, 1993).
<p>
Effective principals work to spread power throughout the organization and 
increase commitment of all constituents to change. Effective principals and 
councils have vertical and horizontal work groups or subcommittees embracing 
nearly every teacher as well as parents and other community members. These 
work groups or subcommittees focus on certain areas such as assessment, 
curriculum, professional development, offering forums for teachers and others 
to discuss school-specific issues and make recommendations to the school 
management council (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994).
<p>
Members of effective school management councils, received continuous staff 
development in planning instructional and program changes, current knowledge 
about teaching, learning, and curriculum. They received training in teamwork 
processes -- work groups, decision making, attaining consensus, and 
leadership. They received training in budgeting and personnel skills. 
Principals who were associated with successful teams called not only upon 
district staff development personnel but also consultants from private 
industries and universities (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994).
<p>
Successful principals must utilize communication skills to a higher degree. 
Successful principals disseminated information on school activities and 
student performance, not just scores from their own school but their scores 
compared with other schools and districts. They shared information with other 
principals. They informed their staffs and council members about research and 
innovative practices (Wohlstetter and Briggs, 1994).
<p>
Successful principals rewarded staff for assumption of greater 
responsibilities. They provided lighter teaching loads or made it possible for 
staff to attend professional development activities. Principals who increased 
their visibility in the community by becoming more active in public relations 
were often rewarded by financial and in-kind contributions (Wohlstetter and 
Briggs 1994). Successful principals have learned to listen, established 
frameworks for communication, understand styles of others, promote open 
communication, work to build trust, think with new perspectives, empower 
others, and take time for self-reflection (Bergman, 1992).
<p>
One study followed principals who received training in team building with 
their teachers. Principals who trained with teachers were more likely to share 
convictions, strengthen ties between themselves and teachers, and experience a 
narrowing of the gulf between teachers and administrator. When principals were 
insecure or lacked self-confidence, they impaired team effectiveness. Teams 
most likely to bring about change were those where the principal was receptive 
to change and sharing authority (Maeroff, 1993).

<h4>Making School-Based Management Succeed</h4>

<p>What, then, is necessary for school-based management to succeed? What
must be in place?
<ul>
   <li>Central administrators must accept change and not be allowed to sabotage. 
Conflicts in some districts have been resolved by a school-based management 
director who answers directly to the superintendent.
   <li>Members of the school-based management councils must be trained in the 
skills of consensus-building, avoiding resistance, and successful guidance 
(see also Glickman, 1992).
   <li>Principals and management councils must be allowed freedom and time even if 
they make mistakes.
   <li>Where unions and labor contracts place restrictions on principals, 
personnel issues such as hiring, dismissal, or different treatment across 
the system must be resolved.
   <li>The role of central administration must be defined. Principals may be 
accountable for test scores, evaluated by parent, teachers, or student 
surveys, and supervised by line position staff (Neal, 1989).
   <li>Members of the management team must be held accountable for their decisions 
as a group.
   <li>There must be an efficient system for communicating and sharing information 
with shareholders (David, 1994).
   <li>Members of the council must constantly be reminded that their purpose is to 
improve student learning. Instructional improvement is the standard against 
which each decision made by a school-based management council must be 
measured.
   <li>School-based management should be part of broader systemic strategies for 
improving teaching and learning (Bradley and Olson, 1993).
   <li>An information system must be developed to support school-based management 
(Bradley and Olson, 1993).
   <li>Performance of the school-based management council must be constantly 
evaluated.
</ul>
<p>Newmann (1993) identified six valued outcomes against which proposals and 
programs can be evaluated: 
<ul>
   <li><b>Authentic student achievement</b> - what kind of achievement should be
valued?
     <dl>
     <dd><i>Conventional achievement</i> - learning, reproducing specific definitions,
facts, skills<br>
     <dd><i>Authentic achievement</i> - use mind to produce discourse, material
objects, performance tasks with personal. aesthetic, utilitarian value
<br>
     <dd>Problem:Critics claim conventional achievement dominates formal 
educational system and stifles student engagement in learning, suppresses critical and
creative thinking, and minimizes application of school learning to life.
<br>
     </dl>
   <li><b>Equity</b> - to the extent educational opportunities are determined by race, 
social class, gender, cultural background, the system violates the 
democratic principle of equal educational opportunity <br>

   <li><b>Empowerment</b><br> 
        Prominent theme - new decision-making structures raise complex issues of 
        score and authority; increased empowerment
        <br>
        <br>
        Increased empowerment of teachers brings increased responsibilities, 
        school curriculum, hiring, budget, interactions with parents 
        <br>
      
   <li><b>Communities of learning</b>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd> Research suggests society would benefit from efforts to transform 
impersonal, fragmented bureaucratic organizations (such as schools) into 
places where participants share common goals, pursue common agenda of 
activities though collaboration
<br>
<dd>In communities of learning
    <br> 
    Teachers and students relate to each other as whole persons
    <br>
    <br>
    Teachers and students participate in, take responsibility for 
    collective life of the school
    <br>
    <br>
    Three social forces that work against communities of learning include:
<ul>
<li>cultural differentials related to race, ethnicity, class, gender, 
and urbanicity
<li>professionalism
<li>cultural value attached to individual autonomy as most important 
criterion for quality of life 
</ul>
</dl>

<ul>
   <li><b>Reflective dialogue</b>
   <dl>
     <dt>&quot;Belief systems cannot be changed by unilateral imposition or by the 
         simple replacement of an old belief with a new one.&quot; Beliefs change - 
         dialogue stimulating opening questioning, testing of basic assumptions 
         through new experiences
     <br>
     <dt>Reflective dialogue allows teachers, administrators, policy makers, and 
         parents to make decisions about optimal educational practice through 
         study and discussion.
     <br>
     <dt>Reflective dialogue requires access to knowledge.
     <br>
  </dl>
<li><b>Accountability</b>
   <dl>
     <dt>Rather than controlling and regulating the process of education (such as 
         course credits, curriculum content, staffing ratios) schools will be 
         held more accountable for student learning.<br>
     <dt>Accountability means assessment must be gathered whose indicators can be 
         compared across classrooms, schools, and districts.
     <br>       
     <dt>Accountability must make assessment data accessible to the public.
     <br>
     <dt>Allocation of positive, negative consequences for student performance
     <br>
     <dt><em>Issues</em> - what standards should be used to evaluate student
         performance; this is particularly problematic if the point of accountability is to 
         enable the public to compare schools.
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
Cole (1992) wrote that in order to have successful school-based management, 
districts must be ready in terms of support and flexibility. Cole offered 
these questions to measure the readiness of a district with regard to support, 
flexibility:
<ul>
  <li>Are policies, programs, and people sufficiently flexible to ensure the 
capacity to respond to changing conditions?
  <li>Do contracts, board policies, and state laws and regulations permit 
flexible use of time, people, space, knowledge, technology, and physical 
support?

  <li>Are time, people, space, knowledge, technology, and physical support 
assigned in a manner that is responsive to the needs of those with 
responsibility to carry out tasks?
  <li>Do those who carry out tasks for the district feel supported by district 
leaders and by the resources of the district?
</ul>
<p>
Cole (1992) identifies <b>time, people, space, knowledge, technology</b> and <b>physical 
support</b> as six key elements that combine to create the chemistry of a school, 
the building blocks of innovation and improvement. Redefining schools requires 
rethinking of deeply held assumptions about the use of space and time in 
school, for example. Before a new calendar can be adopted must come 
recognition that the use of time is something that can be changed. Before 
change, however, must come a change in vision.
<p>
Cole (1993) states that a shared vision ensures commitment to change and to 
improve; it prevents reform from being a &quot;revolving door.&quot; Visions that 
provide direction must be grounded in a thoroughly articulated set of beliefs 
about the purpose of schools; the ability of students to learn; the factors 
that determine the opportunity to learn; the roles of the family and community 
in relation to students and schools; the kind of society for which children 
are being prepared; the proper focus of school activity; the rules, roles, 
relationships that govern behavior within schools, between schools, and the 
district office, between schools and community; the obligation of the system 
to employees; and the role of the system in encouraging and supporting 
innovation. Cole (1993) said, &quot;A vision of schooling taken for granted and 
thus unshared is not a vision that has the power to compel change.&quot;
<p>
If lasting change is to occur, Cole (1993) states the following questions must 
be asked and answered regularly:
<ul>
  <li>What is the purpose of the school?
  <li>Who are the school's clients, and what are their needs? 
  <li>How well does the school meet its clients' needs?
</ul>
<p>
How, then, does a school-based management council or team begin? Most of the 
articles published on school-based management chronicle what not to do in 
order to be successful. One excellent manual for training facilitators to 
develop and implement school-based management was compiled by James Mitchell, 
superintendent of Adams Twelve Five Star Schools in Colorado(1990).
<p>
Mitchell (1990) suggests that each council meeting begin with a team-building 
activity. Such activities allow members an opportunity to express anxieties, 
establish verbal territory (get contributions going, avoid one person 
domination), begin group bonding and acceptance, and allow practice in 
listening with respect to no side conversations, no walking out, no judgments, 
etc.
<p>
Management teams usually have members with a wide variety of personalities, 
backgrounds, talents, and skills (Mitchell, 1990). Team members have different 
knowledge, motivation, and enthusiasm levels. Each team members comes with an 
agenda peculiar to that individual member.
<p>
There are a number of ways teams may problem-solve together (See Appendix, 
Soffer, 1992). One method utilized for problem-solving by school-based 
management teams is brainstorming. Basic rules which encourage successful 
brainstorming (Mitchell, 1990) include the following:
<ul>
  <li>No criticism. Participants may make no negative comments about any 
contributions.
  <li>All contributions should be listed as stated. Write contributions on a 
chalkboard, flip chart, etc. using a scribe.
  <li>Encourage all team members to contribute.
  <li>Encourage team members to modify ideas suggested to make a new idea or 
combine two or more ideas into another possibility.
  <li>Continue the process until no further contributions are generated.
  <li>Ask the participant who suggested it to clarify any contributions which 
are unclear.
  <li>Contributions may be categorized to assist in clarification.
  <li>If the team has been divided into small groups, allow each group to report 
back to the larger group. Avoid repeating contributions already listed.
  <li>Record contributions made.
</ul>
<p>
Consensus must then be developed. Mitchell (1990) suggests a rather unique 
method to determine if consensus is being reached. He uses a &quot;straw vote&quot; 
procedure which utilizes a show of fingers. Five fingers indicate &quot;Total 
agreement, best solution, complete support,&quot; four fingers indicate &quot;Agreement, 
support, good solution,&quot; three fingers indicate &quot;Willing to support,&quot; two 
fingers indicate &quot;Don't agree, won't support, won't sabotage,&quot; and one finger 
indicates &quot;Will sabotage.&quot;
<p>
One important point which Mitchell (1990) makes is that every organization, 
including schools, has twenty percent who are &quot;blockers.&quot; Blockers can be 
promised double salary, pay for staying home, and other enticements, but they 
will still balk at innovation or change. Because it is extremely difficult to 
get everyone to agree, Mitchell recommends going ahead with seventy to eighty 
percent agreement which he calls &quot;<b>sufficient consensus</b>&quot;.
<p>
At our school we make a conscious effort to get &quot;buy in.&quot; If eighty percent of 
the staff, parents, or community members will &quot;buy in&quot; by giving a proposal
a &quot;six on a scale of ten,&quot; and will <b>agree not to block </b>decisions made by the 
group, we will move forward. While this system acknowledges that some will 
disagree, it values all opinions and has allowed our management team to 
maintain forward thrust.
<p>
Mitchell (1990) notes that in his district, principals do not have power to 
veto the school-based management team. Principals are part of the 
decision-making committee; if they veto, they destroy the process. The group, 
in turn, should be held responsible for a decision.
<p>
According to Mitchell (1990) any planned change should include a plan for 
managing it. School-based decisions can be managed by educating the masses 
(good old fashioned communication to the shareholders), receiving a commitment 
to the decision from the central office, generating union support/evaluation, 
beginning facilitation/team building training, and by providing a support 
system.
<p>
If a school based management team is not working, members should try to 
ascertain the cause (Mitchell, 1990). School-based decision making is hampered 
by misinformation, poor communication, uncertainty that the product is what is 
wanted, an inappropriate purpose for the request, lip service with no follow-
through, lack of support, and no input into the decision-making process, 
&quot;them&quot; vs &quot;us&quot; attitude between parents and principals or parents
and teachers, principal mistrust, lack of central office commitment, 
inconsistency, lack of parameter to define what the team can/cannot do. and no 
support to eliminate incompetent personnel. 
<p>
Mitchell (1990) has also identified blocks to school-based management - 
deadlines, regurgitation of the same information already available through 
technology, lack of response, too much communication, turf wars, innovation 
overload, hidden agenda of individual members, and changes implemented without 
adequate communication.
<p>
Mitchell (1990) warns that it is essential for any group representing a larger 
group to go back to the larger group prior to speaking for them. Such lack of 
feedback gives rise to criticisms of &quot;elitism,&quot; a criticism which can 
effectively kill school-based management. 
</p>
<h4>What can I  do for my learning disabled child in a school with school-based
management?</h4>
<p>
What then is the role of the parents of students with learning disabilities in 
school-based management? What can a parent hope to accomplish for their 
children in the school-based management process? 
<p>
First, the parent must become absolutely knowledgeable about what is happening 
at the school. Make sure you are receiving copies of all written 
communications from the school. If your child has an organization problem, do 
not assume that all written communications are coming to you. Request that 
communications be <b>mailed</b> to you. You may be more successful in this request if 
you take stamps to the school or even self-addressed, stamped envelopes.
Once you learn what is happening in your own school, become involved with 
meetings. Attend meetings of the largest parent group at your school, either 
the Parent Teacher Association (PTA) or Parent Teacher Organization (PTO), 
booster club, or whatever. Usually school-based management team members are 
selected by the largest parent body at the school, although membership in the 
group is not usually a prerequisite for election.
<p>
Attend meetings of the management team. Most schools publish at least the 
meeting time and place for all such team meetings. Our school publishes a 
newsletter giving the minutes of the previous meeting as well as the agenda 
for the coming meeting, the date, place, and time of day of the meeting. If 
this is not being done, request it from whatever entity communicates by 
newsletter from the school.
<p>
Once you are familiar with what is happening at your own school, begin to pay 
close attention to the kinds of shareholders who make up the council or team. 
Are the members only teachers? Are parents members? Are there subcommittees or 
other councils? Who makes up the membership? How and when are members 
selected?
<p>
Does the management team make recommendations for courses? If so, what 
provisions are made for students with learning disabilities? Are all students 
with learning disabilities mainstreamed? Are there resource classes? What 
subjects are taught utilizing special education teachers?
<p>
You may want to become a member of your school-based management team. If you 
learn, for example, that none of the students with learning disabilities are 
being taught in special education classes with qualified, trained teachers, 
you may want to gather information for the council or team in terms of what 
research indicates students with disabilities need. Consult authors such as 
James Kauffman (<em>Exceptional Children</em>, September 1993), the Learning 
Disabilities Association of America position paper on <em>Inclusion</em>, February, 
1993, and Reid Lyon (&quot;Inclusion: Can it work for students with learning 
disabilities,&quot; National Institutes of Health, 1994). You may want to get 
copies of articles or pamphlets to share with members of your school council 
or team.
<p>
What about transition services at your school for students with learning 
disabilities? Who is responsible for transition planning? When must transition 
planning be done? What data are brought to transition planning meetings? With 
what agencies does the school work to ensure smooth transitions from school? 
Questions such as these may be answered by the principal, school counselor, 
vocational counselor, special education counselor (if any), vocational teacher 
or supervisor, special education supervisor or even special education 
director.
<p>
Once you know what is being done, begin to formulate ways to improve the 
situation. Meet with other parents of students with disabilities - do they 
have problems? What has happened to their children? What should happen but is 
not being done? Certainly a local LDA affiliate is a place to begin to contact 
parents representative of your school.
<p>
If you find that little or nothing is being done toward easing the transition 
from school to work or post secondary education, articulate with other parents 
what is needed. Make written recommendations to the school-based management 
council with details as to strategies, resources needed, time lines, etc. 
Brainstorming is an excellent process for defining such recommendations. Ask 
your group how transition should look if it were to meet the needs of all 
students with learning disabilities. What barriers currently exist to the 
ideal? How can these barriers be broken or overcome? What resources are needed 
to effect a positive change?
<p>
It is important at the high school level to think of what comes next for 
students. Students graduating from high school have essentially two options - 
go to post secondary educational settings, colleges or universities, or enter 
the world of work. What skills or knowledge must a student have to be 
successful at either? What is currently in place in the curriculum, accessible 
to the student with learning disabilities, that would prepare him/her for post 
secondary education or for employment? If there is none, there must be a 
beginning.
<p>
If, as in Texas, so-called &quot;basic classes&quot; have been discontinued at the high 
school level, then the curriculum formerly taught in those classes must be 
available in other settings, i.e. resource rooms, for students with learning 
disabilities. If a student is unable to master algebra, is there a course 
where pre-algebra will be taught to mastery? Is algebra the &quot;gate-keeper&quot; 
course at your high school through which Students must pass if they are to go 
on to post secondary education? Can students with disabilities pass algebra at 
your high school?
<p>
The school-based decision making team is a mechanism which can effect changes 
in time, scheduling, tracking, course curricula, assessments, etc. Accessing 
the system requires information, both of the management team and of the 
current system. Creating change requires a vision of how the ideal looks -- 
how will you know you have what is needed in order to facilitate your child's 
entering college successfully or acquiring vocational skills to get at least a 
beginning-level job? How can you translate that vision so it will be shared by 
other members of the school-based management team?
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>
School-based management councils or teams are apparently an accepted, integral 
part of the reform movement in the United States. Whether the needs of 
students with learning disabilities are being met in our educational 
institutions depends on knowledge and interest of shareholders and 
participants. Parents must become informed -- they must learn to access the 
system, to share the power, to be a part of the solution if reform is to 
equate to change and improvement in the system for the learning disabled.
Members of our school-based management teams have at one time or another 
included parents of students with disabilities being served in regular class, 
resource, or other instructional arrangements. In almost every instance, these 
parents have informed the larger group about what is needed in order for 
theirs and similar children to successfully participate in learning. Our 
school-based management teams have decided upon the physical location of 
classes for students with disabilities, sought and provided accessibility to 
classrooms and other areas of the school, and even facilitated inclusion of 
students with disabilities in field trips and extracurricular activities. Your 
willingness to work, to share, and to be a responsible part of the 
decision-making team at your school could well be the difference between 
success or failure, not only of your child but also other students with 
disabilities.

<h3>Who needs to Belong to LDAV?</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Individuals with learning disabilities</b> who need the support of others and their examples to enable them to have 
productive and successful lives.<br>
</li>
<li><b>Parents</b> who need to become active participants in the education of their children in school and their support when 
they become adults.<br>
</li>
<li><b>Professionals</b> who need the support and encouragement of individuals with disabilities and their parents in their efforts

</center></div>
<p>There are new opportunities that are currently unfolding that may required special talents and abilities in just those areas where 
many individuals with learning difficulties often have their greatest strengths, such as visualization for scientific concepts and the 
analysis and manipulation of complex, three-dimensional information graphical displays on personal computers. </p>
<p>Yesterday's person with a learning disability entered a simpler adult society. Today's person with a learning disability enters a 
highly lingual, educated society. There are different kinds of problems and different kinds of tools that require different talents 
and favor different kinds of brains. Some who were learning disabled were: </p>
<dl>
<dd>Albert Einstein	</dd>
<dd>Thomas Edison	</dd>
<dd>Lewis Carroll	</dd>
<dd>Winston Churchill </dd>
<dd>Pablo Picasso	</dd>
<dd>Walt Disney </dd>
<dd>Nelson Rockefeller	</dd>
<dd>Hans Christian Andersen	</dd>
<dd>William Butler Yeats </dd>
</dl>
<p>We do not hear about the rest, whose talents and intelligence may have been lost to the world. Conventional educational 
system may be focusing on the wrong kinds of skills and weeding out many of those who might have the most to give. </p>
<h3>LDAV Membership offers:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hands on support from other individuals with learning disabilities, parents, friends and professionals through local LDA 
affiliates.<br>
</li>
<li>An opportunity to work with an organization on behalf of all people with LD.<br>
</li>
<li>A forum for effecting change through legislative advocacy at the local, state and national level.<br>
</li>
<li>Access to local, state, and national newsletters and publications.<br>
</li>
<li>Linkage with members all over the country.<br>
</li>
<li>Information sheets and position papers from the National Organization.<br>
</li>
<li>Annual state and national conferences with outstanding speakers and workshops.<br>

<li>LDAV, a state affiliate of LDA, supports the goals of the national organization, advocates for services for individuals 
with learning disabilities at the state level and encourages the formation of local chapters to share information and 
provide support to individuals with learning disabilities, parents and friends and professionals who serve them. </li>

<P><B>*MEMBERSHIP ELIGIBILITY</B></P>
<P>Any person who is legally certified as a public school administrator, a CESA administrator or an administrator of a County Handicapped Children's Education Board and who serves as the chief administrator of either a public school district, a CESA Agency or a County Handicapped Children's Education Board in the state of Wisconsin, and who is responsible directly to a board of education, is eligible to become a full voting member of this association.  One additional central public school office administrator designated by the district's chief school administrator may become a voting member providing he/she is certified as a school administrator and is designated to serve the district in that capacity in the absence of the chief school district administrator.</P>
<P><B>*GOVERNSHIP</B></P>
<P>Management of the affairs of this Association shall be vested in a Board of Directors.  Board members shall be elected from within the voting membership in accordance with the provisions of the Bylaws.</P>
<P><B>*OFFICERS</B></P>
<P>The officers of the Association shall be the President-elect, the President and the Past President.  The officers shall serve as an Executive Committee of the Board of Directors.</P>
<P><B>*EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR</B></P>
<P>The Board of Directors shall hire an Executive Director who shall also act as Treasurer of the Association.</P>
<P><B>*SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS ALLIANCE</B></P>
<P>WASDA, the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators and the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials have united in their legislative efforts to promote the improvement of education for the children of Wisconsin.  In these politically volatile times it is essential that all school administrators work together to take a leadership role in educational reform.</P>
<P><B>*LEGAL COUNSEL AND ASSISTANCE</B></P>
<P>The WASDA maintains a policy whereby assistance will be provided to members in order to assure that due process is followed at the local school district level when members find themselves in conflict with the school board.  The assistance is provided both through a visitation team program established with the WASB and the other administrative associations, as well as through direct financial assistance for legal counsel.</P>
<P><B>*COMMITTEES</B></P>
<P>The WASDA operates under the committee structure and looks to the action, activities and recommendations of the committees when developing policies.  The following committees have been established by the WASDA:</P>
<P><U><B>STANDING COMMITTEES</B></U><B>:</B></P>
<P>Awards Committee</P>
<P>Constitution, Policies &amp; Resolutions Committee</P>
<P>Ethics &amp; Administrator-Board Relations Committee</P>
<P>Jt. Convention Booth &amp; Planning Committee</P>
<P>Legislative Committee</P>
<P>Professional Improvement Committee</P>
<P>Retirement Committee</P>
<P>Small Schools Committee</P>
<P>Teacher/Principal of the Year Committee</P>
<P><U><B>AD HOC COMMITTEES</B></U><B>:</B></P>
<P>Administrative Salaries &amp; Fringe Benefit Committee</P>
<P>Child Advocacy Committee</P>
<P>Education for Employment Committee</P>
<P>Gifted &amp; Talented Committee</P>
<P>K-8 Administrator Issues Committee</P>
<P>Liaison With Higher Education Committee</P>
<P>Management Team Committee</P>
<P>School Facilities Committee</P>
<P>Special Education Committee</P>
<P><B>*WASDA IN-SERVICE PROGRAMS</B></P>
<P>The WASDA provides a variety of professional improvement seminars and workshops such as:  New Administrators Workshop, Annual Summer Bill Kahl Seminar, New/Beginning Administrators Conference, Annual Political Seminar, seven Drive-in conferences, a group trip to the Annual AASA National Convention, Annual Small School Conference, and the Annual Educational Conference. </P>
<P><B>*WASDA</B></P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators began as an organization on July 1, 1959. Dr. Miles Turner serves as the Executive Director for the WASDA.</P>
<P><B>*ETHICS</B></P>
<P>The WASDA has established and adopted a Code of Ethics that should be adhered to by all WASDA members.  While space does not permit the inclusion of the entire Code of Ethics in this pamphlet, the general tone can be grasped by printing the first sentence of the WASDA Code:  &quot;The professional school administrator constantly upholds the honor and dignity of the educational profession in all actions and relations with pupils, colleagues, school board members, and the public.&quot;</P>
<P><B>*AASA</B></P>
<P>The WASDA maintains a charter membership in the AASA and also enjoys a close working relationship with the American Association of School Administrators.</P>


<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators--the professional association for Wisconsin's public school superintendents, CESA Administrators, Administrators of Handicapped Children's Education Boards and Assistant Administrators.</P>

<P ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</P>
<H4 ALIGN="left"><B>AASA ELECTION POLICY</B></H4>
<P>(Financial support for candidates)</P>
<P>In order for a candidate running for AASA office to qualify for financial assistance from the WASDA, the candidate first must receive the endorsement of the WASDA Board of Directors.  Any WASDA candidate that receives the endorsement of the WASDA Board of Directors shall receive financial assistance on a matching basis not to exceed $500.  Thus, the candidate would have to spend a minimum of $1,000 of his/her own money in order to receive $500 from the WASDA.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATIVE COMPENSATION</B></P>
<P>A.The association should continue this committee and take the initiative in arranging for a joint meeting with representatives from the various state administrative and supervisory groups in an effort to reach mutual agreement on guidelines for compensation.</P>
<P>B.The guidelines reached through the mutual efforts and agreement of the administrative groups should be presented to the WASB by the WASDA committee at a joint committee meeting.  This joint committee should be charged with the development of administrative compensation guidelines that can be submitted to the various administrative groups for their approval.</P>
<P>C.A document should result from the successful implementation of the above recommendations that will provide uniform guidelines for the compensation of administrators in all Wisconsin public schools.</P>
<P>D.The committee recommends that the association encourage all districts to develop written plans that include the rationale used to compensate the administrative staff.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATIVE EVALUATIONS</B></P>
<P>Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators endorse the concept that written evaluations be provided each member of the administrative team on an annual basis.  The written evaluation would be utilized when the decision process is used regarding the renewal or the nonrenewal of any member of the administrative team's contract with the local school district.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATOR SHORTAGE</B></P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators is concerned with the current and developing shortage of qualified candidates for entry level administrative and middle management positions in the state.  This situation, if not corrected, will create a vacuum of leadership in Wisconsin schools at a time when the challenges facing public education are greater than at any time in our state's history.</P>
<P>The shortage of qualified candidates, it is believed by WASDA, has been caused by a number of factors.  The main contributing forces are:</P>
<P>1.The large number of current administrators nearing retirement age.  This is borne out by studies completed in the state.</P>
<P>The number of retirees will be accelerated by the early retirement window and permanent retirement benefit changes recently enacted.</P>
<P>2.The lack of financial incentive for talented educators to leave the classrooms and move into administrative positions as in the past.  Teacher salaries have increased to the point that many assistant principals, principals, supervisors, and coordinators make less than their counterparts in the classroom.  This is not only the case when comparisons are made on the basis of daily rate of pay, which has been a reality for years, but on an annual salary basis.</P>
<P>3.The increased demands on administrators in the rapidly changing world of education.  The level of training, experience and knowledge necessary to deal with the stresses, decisions, and problems in a modern school system have increased dramatically.  This has led to potentially talented administrators selecting less challenging positions with equal or greater material rewards.</P>
<P>4.The lack of convenient administrative training opportunities for practicing educators.</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators recognizes that a long term solution to the situation cannot be developed and implemented quickly or easily.  However, institutions and organizations concerned with the quality of schools and school leadership need to work together to develop a long range approach to supplying leadership for Wisconsin's schools.</P>
<P>There are some short range solutions to easing the shortage that should be considered pending development of a more permanent resolution of the problem.  They include:</P>
<P>1.The development of incentive grants for local districts or consortiums to provide for administrative training programs for promising educators.  This could be combined with internships to provide a more practical and relevant program.</P>
<P>2.Encouragement of institutions of higher learning to offer more administrative training programs.  Efforts should be made to take the programs to the clients at times and in locations that encourage enrollment.  The advice of practicing administrators should be sought in designing and establishing these programs.  Qualified practitioners could be used as a valuable teaching resource.</P>
<P>3.School boards and district administrators need to recognize and respond to the need to provide greater financial incentives to encourage individuals to enter the administrative field and continue in the field.</P>
<P>The cooperative efforts of the DPI, colleges and universities, local universities, local districts, legislators, and professional education associations will be necessary to develop and implement these recommendations.</P>
<P><B>ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM CONCEPT</B></P>
<P>The administrative team as it is perceived in education is comprised of all members of the school administrative staff.  The team will vary as to size of school districts, as to job description, and as representatives are selected at all levels.</P>
<P>Proper organization to facilitate maximum involvement of all members in decisions relating to school district policy is imperative.  If the community is to benefit, goal setting, evaluation of achieved goals and implementation of positive outcomes, must be an integral part of the administrative team function.</P>
<P>There is no single formula to prescribe procedures and techniques that are mandatory in implementing the administrative team style of operation.  Each school district must consider these problems in the context of local conditions.</P>
<P>Those responsible for the direction of public education are continually responding to pressures and criticisms, both from within and outside the institution itself.  It has become impossible to effectively manage the educational institution without some formalized structure that assures the input of all components of management in the decision making process and a free flow of communication among the board, the administration, the instructional staff, students, parents and the general public.</P>
<P><B>PRINCIPLES FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM</B></P>
<P>A.Administrators responsible for implementing policies should provide input when the policies are developed.</P>
<P>B.Group decision making:</P>
<P> 1.Increases the quality of the decision.</P>
<P> 2.Reduces the usual errors of chance which occur when one person makes the decision.</P>
<P> 3.Increases the security of the risk taken through decision making.</P>
<P> 4.Improves the rationality and consistency of administration.</P>
<P>C. Involvement as a team:</P>
<P> 1.Increases motivation and staff morale.</P>
<P> 2. Improves individual productivity and school district climate.</P>
<P> 3.Strengthens individual administrator's commitment to district goals.</P>
<P>D.The involvement of many individuals provides more creative solutions which enhance the potential of the school district.</P>
<P>E.Group decision making facilitates the implementation of the plans developed.</P>
<P>F.School boards must adopt formal policy statements supporting the concept of the school administrative team.</P>
<P>G.Discussion between administrative team members and school boards in respect to conditions affecting individual welfare and working conditions are not inconsistent with the concept of the administrative team.</P>

<P> B. Requirement:</P>
<P>  1.Must have served as President of the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators.</P>
<P><B>CENSORSHIP AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM</B></P>
<P>WASDA is concerned about indiscriminate, arbitrary, and/or capricious efforts to censor and limit academic freedom. WASDA urges school boards to adopt appropriate policy for the selection, evaluation and removal of instructional materials.</P>
<P><B>COLLECTIVE BARGAINING</B></P>
<P><U>Collective Bargaining</U></P>
<P>The WASDA recognizes collective bargaining as a legal and reasonable method for determining wages, hours and conditions of employment for nonsupervisory school district employees.</P>
<P><U>Impasse Resolution</U></P>
<P>The WASDA recognizes arbitration as a means of resolving bargaining impasses.  The WASDA further declares its opposition to the use of strikes by school district employees as a means of resolving bargaining impasse.</P>
<P>While the association supports binding arbitration and the arbitration &quot;all or none&quot; law, WASDA believes that the current impasse resolution procedures of the municipal collective bargaining law seriously hamper good faith bargaining in Wisconsin's public sector.  In that regard, the WASDA supports these changes to the current law:</P>
<P>1.A specific cut-off date shall be established at the close of the investigation conducted by the mediator prohibiting any further opportunity for either party to change their proposed positions as submitted to the arbitrator.</P>
<P>2.Require that when a petition is filed for binding arbitration, the WERC shall require the petitioning party to submit its final offer on each issue in the dispute with the petition.</P>
<P>3.The second party shall submit its final offer on each issue to the arbitrator within 14 days of the receipt of the petitioning party's final offer.  Once the second party submits its final offer, it can no longer modify the language or add any new issues.</P>
<P>4.The current provision in the statutes whereby a petition for arbitration must include a preliminary final offer shall be deleted.  In essence, it is the position of the WASDA that the offer submitted by the petitioning party and the offer submitted by the second party shall constitute their final offers.</P>
<P>5.The arbitrator shall give consideration to local and/or area economic conditions and indicators such as localemployment levels, local business climate and monetary adjustments in locally negotiated public and private settlements.</P>
<P>6.In addition to the direct economic conditions to be considered by the arbitrator, the arbitrator shall <U>also</U> consider both the immediate and the long range economic impact the language and policy modifications will have upon the educational programs available to the students at the local school district level.</P>
<P>7.Arbitrators shall be required to hold a public hearing with meaningful prior notice given to the citizens of the jurisdiction served by the municipal employer.  Comments by the citizens of the jurisdiction shall be part of the hearing record and shall be given consideration by the arbitrator.</P>
<P>8.The arbitrator shall be required to issue the award within forty-five (45) days of the arbitration hearing.</P>
<P>9.The WERC arbitrators shall be determined by chance rather than by selection by the two parties.  However, this does not prohibit the two parties to jointly select an arbitrator from outside of the WERC appointment.  Also, the WASDA recommends the arbitrators to be selected from the same region, area or congressional district, when possible, of the school district involved in the arbitration process.</P>
<P>10.The WERC shall evaluate arbitrators on a regular basis and shall remove arbitrators it finds unsatisfactory, as well as those who repeatedly fail to issue timely decisions or who do not participate in adequate training programs.</P>
<P>11.The WASDA supports the concept that the arbitrators shall select either the board's or the union's final offer.</P>
<P>    (Adopted as revised April 23, 1987)</P>
<P><B>COMMUNITY EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>1.Whereas, community education is based on the concept that education is a life-long process designed for people of all ages, and</P>
<P>2.Whereas, community education is based on the needs of people in the community and coordinates community resources and facilities.</P>
<P>3.Whereas, communities need effective coordination of services and identification of educational needs for all age groups, in this time of limited funds and inflationary periods; and</P>
<P>4.Whereas, the changing nature of communities, whether it be energy use, larger adult and senior citizen population, or single parent families, call upon education to consider the educational needs of all residents, and</P>
<P>5.Whereas, public schools have resources and buildings which are paid for by the community and generally available for use by the public.</P>
<P>6.Therefore be it resolved, the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators endorse the concept of community education; and</P>
<P>7.Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA urge its members to develop community education programs which will serve a broad cross section of their constituents which are oriented to the unique needs of diverse populations within the school community.</P>
<P><B>CONSTITUTION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, the WASDA represents the educational leadership in the state of Wisconsin with the specific purpose of excellence in education, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the WASDA shall promote educational welfare of Wisconsin youths; professional growth and welfare ofadministrative, teaching and other school district personnel; placing the needs, problems and achievements of public schools to district residents; area meetings of educational leaders for the discussion of common interest; and to cooperate with the professional organizations and other organizations interested in improving education.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA select a Constitution Committee to monitor the association's activities in respect to compliance with the constitution and bylaws of the association, and</P>
<P>Further be it resolved that the committee review the constitution and bylaws on a yearly basis for the purpose of recommending changes made necessary or appropriate because of circumstances or progressive outmoding to the membership.</P>
<P><B>CURRICULUM</B></P>
<P>We support the position that the curriculum of public schools is a local district decision, and legislation mandates to enact curriculum for the public schools be opposed.</P>
<P><B>DATA PROCESSING CENTERS</B></P>
<P>Data processing centers to serve local school systems are a necessity if further procedures of cost accounting, program planning-budgeting, assessment, comprehensive planning, research and evaluation are to take place.</P>
<P>WASDA will support legislation to have date processing centers established with state financing to serve the local school systems and that there be continued DPI leadership in planning for the development of these centers.</P>
<P><B>DISMISSAL OR REHIRING OF TEACHERS</B></P>
<P>WASDA recognizes that negotiations are not completed in most districts before March 15 and State Statute 118.22, Section 2, requires that teachers be notified whether or not they are going to be retained or dismissed on or before this date.  This is approximately four months before the end of the school year and is a detriment to both teachers and students.  WASDA recommends that legislation be introduced to change Wisconsin Statute 118.22, Section 2, to read April 15 instead of March 15 and May 15 instead of April 15.</P>
<P><B>EMPLOYEE RECORDS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</B></P>
<P>The following guidelines are recommended to all school personnel dealing with confidential records and statements concerning past and present employees:</P>
<P>1.Know the liability insurance coverage in the district--coverage for omission and errors is comparable to malpractice insurance carried by medical doctors and dentists.</P>
<P>2.Base comments only on firsthand knowledge which can be documented with records, if necessary.</P>
<P>3.Avoid stating opinions that cannot be substantiated.</P>
<P>4.Limit the response to questions about present and past teachers to the professional qualifications of the person.</P>
<P>5.Never furnish an unsolicited negative recommendation.</P>
<P>6.Make every effort to restrict the communication to proper officials.</P>
<P>7.Avoid telephone evaluations since there is a tendency to speak in broader terms and give opinions without substantiation.</P>
<P>8.Be particularly careful if a personality conflict exists between you and a teacher if that person is involved in areas such as negotiations.</P>
<P>9.Discontinue the practice of making generalizations or subjective opinions relative to a person.</P>
<P><B>ETHICAL EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES</B></P>
<P>1.In situations where a teacher employed in one district seeks employment in another district, it is the responsibility of the administrator who is considering offering new employment to the teacher to communicate with the administration of the district where the teacher is currently employed.</P>
<P>2.A school administrator should not initiate action which encourages a teacher to break a contract with another district.</P>
<P>3.An administrator should not permit a teacher to teach in his/her district when that teacher is under contract to teach in another district but is not fulfilling the contract.</P>
<P>4.Before a contract is offered to a teacher, it should be specifically determined that the teacher is legally able to sign the contract.</P>
<P>5.At no time should the hiring administrator visit prospective employees in school districts without the knowledge and permission of the local school administration.</P>
<P>6.Applicants who have been under consideration and placement offices where vacancies are posted should be informed when vacancies are filled.</P>
<P><B>ETHICS</B></P>
<P>I. INITIATING ACTION</P>
<P>Problems involving the ethical conduct of any school administrator shall be referred to the state Ethics Committee.  Except as otherwise provided herein, any complaint about the ethical behavior of an administrator or request for an investigation of his/her conduct must be presented in written form to the state Ethics Committee or executive body of the WASDA, and must bear the signature of the person or persons making the complaint or requesting an investigation.  Neither the state Ethics Committee nor the Executive Committee of WASDA shall initiate action on the basis of hearsay, or oral request, anonymous letter or other unsigned documents.</P>
<P>When circumstances exist which may indicate a possible violation of ethical behavior and no formal written complaint has been filed with either the Ethics Committee or the Board of Directors, the Board of Directors, by majority vote, direct the Ethics Committee to make a &quot;preliminary investigation.&quot;  The purpose of this preliminary investigation will be to ascertain the facts connected with a specific situation to determine whether or not a formal investigation should be conducted.  Any member whose behavior is being questioned by this method shall be so notified.  All reports of preliminary investigation shall be filed in written form with the Board of Directors and a copy given to the member whose behavior is being questioned.  No disciplinary action will be taken as a result of a preliminary investigation.</P>
<P>Written and signed complaints received by the Ethics Committee shall be disposed of, after due deliberation or investigation by a quorum of the committee at least ninety days from the receipt of the complaint.  The committee may take any one of the following actions:</P>
<P>1.Drop the complaint for lack of reliable evidence or because the charges are inconsequential.</P>
<P>2.Drop the complaint on the grounds that it involves a question of administrative judgment rather than ethical behavior.</P>
<P>3.Authorize and institute a special investigation or hearing.</P>
<P>4. Issue a warning.</P>
<P>5.File a recommendation for disciplinary action with the WASDA Executive Committee.</P>
<P>Investigations authorized by the state Ethics Committee shall be organized on the basis of teams of no less than three nor more than seven investigators with the qualifications necessary to gather accurate data on the submitted complaint.  The revocation of an administrator's certificate by a legally constituted state authority, conviction by a court for a criminal offense, or censorshipby a duly recognized national or state professional organization or committee may constitute grounds for initiating an investigation by the state Ethics Committee.</P>
<P>Special hearings may be convened by the state Ethics Committee subsequent to the report or recommendation of an investigating committee.  Hearings should be confined to charges made known to the accused in writing.  The accused should be apprised in writing of his/her professional rights and responsibilities, including the right to obtain legal counsel at his/her own expense.  The chairperson of the Ethics Committee shall preside over hearings convened by that body.  Hearings based on an investigation of facts in evidence should not be confused with hearings related to appeals from the judgment of the Ethics Committee or WASDA Executive Committee.</P>
<P>II. JUDGMENTS AND DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS</P>
<P>Judgments rendered by the state Ethics Committee shall be based on careful investigation of the validity of charges, after any necessary hearings have been held, and in the light of deliberations by at least a quorum of the committee.  The judgment should be recorded in the official minutes of the committee.</P>
<P>When it becomes necessary to institute disciplinary measures for conduct judged to be unethical, the following penalties may be used at the discretion of the Ethics Committee or the Executive Committee of WASDA:</P>
<P>1.<U>Warnings or reprimands</U>.  Such action may be taken by the state Ethics Committee or WASDA Executive Committee.  Written warnings or reprimands shall not be released by the committee but shall be considered a confidential exchange between a member and the state Ethics Committee or the Executive Committee.  The person judged to have violated the Code of Ethics may at his/her own discretion release the nature of the warning or reprimands shall insist that unethical behavior cease or more severe disciplinary action may be taken.</P>
<P>2.<U>Suspension</U>.  The state Ethics Committee may recommend suspension from membership to the Executive Committee of WASDA and may also make such recommendations to the AASA Ethics Committee.  Decision on suspension from the state association shall rest with the Executive Committee, and final decision on suspension from AASA shall rest with the AASA Executive Committee.  During the period of suspension, which shall be for no less than one year and no more than five years, a member shall--</P>
<P> A.not have membership status;</P>
<P> B. be relieved of all committee assignments;</P>
<P> C. not hold or be eligible for any association office;</P>
<P> D. not be sent any publications of the association, and;</P>
<P> E.not be invited to attend or participate in an official manner in any professional meetings held under the auspices of the association from which he has been suspended.  During the last six months of a suspension, WASDA Ethics Committee shall review the record of a suspended member and recommend to WASDA Executive Committee whether the period of suspension shall be terminated at the appointed time, extended or changed to expulsion.</P>
<P>3.<U>Expulsion</U>.  Expulsion implies permanent and total severance of relations with the professional association. Expulsion and details of expulsion shall remain a matter between the administrator and Executive Committee unless the administrator wishes to make it public.  Only WASDA Executive Committee has authority to expel a member. WASDA shall notify the AASA in writing when a member is expelled from the state association.</P>
<P>Any recommendation by the Ethics Committee for suspension or expulsion that is subsequently approved shall be considered effective on the date it is filed formally with the Executive Committee even though formal action is taken at a later date.</P>
<P>The exception to this shall be where a petition for appeal has been filed within the time limits specified below.  In appealed cases, suspensions or expulsions that are approved subsequently by the Board of Directors shall be recorded in the formal records as effective from the date the written petition for appeal was received in the office of the president or the Executive Director of WASDA.</P>
<P>All disciplinary recommendations and actions, along with memoranda of investigations shall be matters of written records. These records shall be kept in the permanent and confidential files of the committee and association.</P>
<P>III.  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS</P>
<P>Every WASDA member shall be presumed to be innocent of ethical transgressions until evidence proves to the contrary.  The administrator has available the following rights and avenues of appeal whenever ethical conduct is questioned and at all levels of disciplinary procedure the administrator has the right to be represented by counsel.</P>
<P>1.Any member whose ethical conduct is under question shall be notified in writing by registered letter by the state Ethics Committee that a complaint has been received questioning his/her ethical behavior and that sufficient grounds exist to institute further investigation of the facts pertaining to the case.</P>
<P>2.Any member whose ethical conduct is under question is entitled to written notice of specific charges lodged against him/her and to know the name(s) of his/her accuser(s).</P>
<P>3.Any member whose ethical conduct is questioned shall have the right to appear at any session where complaints concerning his/her ethical conduct are under review.  The Ethics Committee shall inform the accused member of its recommendations, including recommendations for disciplinary action, if any, at the same time its recommendations are filed with the Executive Committee.</P>
<P>4.Any member subject to suspension or expulsion from WASDA shall be notified in writing by the President that WASDA Ethics Committee has recommended to the WASDA Executive Committee that the member be suspended or expelled from WASDA membership.  He/she shall be informed of the time limits within which an appeal may be made and of appeal procedures.</P>
<P>5.The WASDA Executive Committee shall establish a satisfactory time and date for a hearing.  The Ethics Committee and the member shall be present to make statements.  The hearing must be held within 60 days of the Ethics Committee recommendations.</P>
<P>6.The Executive Committee will take action following the hearing.  If suspension or expulsion is determined by majority vote of the Executive Committee, notice will be provided the member with an outline of the procedures for appeal.</P>
<P>IV. APPEAL PROCEDURE</P>
<P>Every member has the right to appeal suspension or expulsion by the Executive Committee.  An appeal must be filed within 60 days following the date of written notification for suspension or expulsion by the Executive Committee.</P>
<P>A petition for appeal shall be made in writing to the Executive Director of WASDA.  A petition to appeal the decision of the Executive Committee to the complete membership of the WASDA Board of Directors shall be made through the office of the Executive Director.</P>
<P>It shall be the responsibility of the Board of Directors to notify the appellant within 60 days of the receipt of the petition of the time and place for the hearing of the appeal to show cause why the decision of the Executive Committee should not be approved and implemented.  The Board of Directors decision shall be final.</P>
<P>The accused member shall bear all his/her personal and privately contracted legal expenses incurred in appearing before a state Ethics Committee, as well as in final appeals to the state Executive Committee and Board of Directors.</P>
<P><B>V. REVIEW PROCEDURE</B></P>
<P>Any accused member has the right to request that his/her case be reopened and judgements reevaluated whenever new evidence becomes available.  The request shall be made in writing to WASDA Ethics Committee.  The Ethics Committee shall examine the evidence and determine whether sufficient grounds exist for reopening and reevaluating the case.  The decision of WASDA Ethics Committee shall be final, and no further appeals are available from it.</P>
<P><B>VI. ETHICS OF NON-MEMBERS OF WASDA</B></P>
<P>The behavior of all administrators, non-members, as well as members of WASDA, influences the public image of school administrators.  The public may find it difficult, if not impossible, to distinguish on the basis of limited contact between apractitioner who belongs to a professional society and one who does not.  All too often it is assumed that those who practice the same profession are members of the same professional society.  WASDA must demonstrate concern for the ethical behavior of all practicing administrators even though its influence may be greater among members than non-members.</P>
<P><B>EVALUATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the desirability of program and service evaluation at all levels of education in Wisconsin.  The focus of such evaluations shall be on improvement so as to offer students in Wisconsin the best learning opportunities possible. Such evaluations shall be used to determine modifications in existing programs and the identification of unmet needs.  It is also WASDA's position that the responsibility for providing quality education rests with the local school districts.  Therefore, continuous efforts should be made to avoid the need for or imposition of legislative mandates.  WASDA further endorses the desirability of national and state educational assessment programs as additional means to assess local programs.</P>
<P>Finally, WASDA strongly favors and encourages efforts by institutions of higher education and other professional organizations which strive to develop meaningful criteria and measures for the evaluation of educational programs.</P>
<P><B>FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that there is an appropriate place in the scheme of American education for the participation of the federal government through a financial and fiscal participation, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA is committed to the historic and constitutional position of local control of local government functions, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA while respecting the position of fiscal participation of the federal government, wishes to reaffirm its belief and position of strong local control, </P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA supports the continuing and expanding participation of the federal government in public education to the point that it does not inherently weaken the position of the local government agency or body.</P>
<P><B>INSERVICE EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that school governments and administrator leadership must be maintained and advanced in a regular program of inservice education in order to insure quality education programs, and</P>
<P>Whereas, such inservice educational programs are an essential district expense that realizes district investments many times over.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA encourages local school boards and superintendents to support and participate in adequate inservice education programs, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that such inservice education programs be an essential district expense.</P>
<P><B>LEGISLATIVE</B></P>
<P>1.Recommendations of WASDA, especially as they pertain to the Legislative Committee, must be structured within a broad statement of political philosophy which will lend a high degree of flexibility to the legislative tasks and processes of the Legislative Committee.</P>
<P>2.The effectiveness of WASDA legislative efforts are in proportion to the number of administrators who actively participate in the political processes at all levels of government.  Progress has been made in that respect, but certainly more administrators must involve themselves if our legislative program is going to grow in quality and strength.</P>
<P>3.Every effort should be made to maintain close working relationships with other administrative organizations. WASDA should as a matter of course invite members of these other organizations to send representatives to legislative meetings in the effort to broaden our base and maximize our efforts.</P>
<P>Further, a similar type of relationship or workable alternative should exist between the WASDA legislative committee and the other working committees of WASDA as the business of such committees and their recommendations would impact upon legislative matters.</P>
<P>4.We support the philosophy that the Department of Public Instruction retain its allocation and utilization of state funding in the operation and implementation of its service responsibilities to the 400 plus school districts in the state. Also, that all federal funds coming into the state of Wisconsin relating to elementary and secondary education be processed through the Department of Public Instruction.</P>
<P>PLATFORM - LOCAL CONTROL</P>
<P>The Legislative Committee of WASDA rejects any charge that local control of public school education is a &quot;myth&quot; or that such local control has outlived its usefulness.</P>
<P>We believe that little evidence exists which supports any contention that, within our political system, levels of government above the local level produce more rational or better decisions concerning public education.</P>
<P>We believe that intelligent decision-making on all levels of government is dependent upon the capacities, values and interests of the decision-makers involved.  It is at the local level where responsive publics can be directly involved in the decision-making process of public school education, and because of the proximity of such publics at the local level, we believe that the public does and can make rational capable decisions concerning the quality of the educational programs it desires in its local school districts.</P>
<P>Therefore, the Legislative Committee of WASDA reaffirms local control of public school education, as constitutionally mandated from the state to local school districts and boards of education, firmly believing that local control of public education can most successfully translate the informed public will into effective policies for public school educational programs.</P>
<P>PLATFORM - POLITICAL PROCESS</P>
<P>The Legislative Committee of WASDA believes that the political process is a dynamic process which is constantly changing and which involves a high degree of personal interrelationships, accurate knowledge and ability to perceive the &quot;real&quot; issues and motivations underpinning all legislation and legislating.  Thus, it is axiomatic that those individuals entrusted with the task of executing a legislative program for the association must have the flexibility to act in good judgment and to effectuate compromise in all matters pertaining to legislation, irrespective of specific platform statements of the association.</P>
<P>PLATFORM - GOALS FOR STATE FINANCIAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS</P>
<P>1.State general aid for public elementary and secondary schools be funded at a level of 65 percent of total costs.</P>
<P>2.Total principal and interest costs of buildings and the costs of capital outlay be part of shared costs in the school aid formula.</P>
<P>3.For calculating primary aids in the formula, the highest level of state aid would be computed on the part of the districts shared costs which does not exceed 115 percent of the previous year's  statewide average shared cost which exceed 115 percent will be funded by secondary aid.</P>
<P>4.Categorical aids at a level of 70 percent be retained for support of Chapter 115 programs, and a level of 70 percent support be implemented for social workers, nurses and psychologists.l</P>
<P>5.Support the proration of state aids in emergencies and strikes.</P>
<P>6.The 115 percent primary ceiling serves as an adequate cost control of school expenditures on the local level. Expenditures exceeding such level must reside in the decision-making authority of local boards of education.</P>
<P>7.Support existing state categorical aids to public elementary and secondary schools and such aids should be adjusted upward in conjunction with increased costs due to inflation.</P>
<P>8.Biennial appropriations be maintained for financing the operations of the Department of Public Instruction and state financial aid to local school districts.</P>
<P>9.Any state legislative mandated programs to public schools, after consultation and input from the appropriate educational organizations must be funded accordingly by increases in state financial support for the operations of such programs.</P>
<P><B>LIAISON WITH STATE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION</B></P>
<P>The Executive Committee, by direction from the Board of Directors, represents the WASDA in all meetings with the Department of Public Instruction.</P>
<P><B>MEETINGS, INSTITUTES AND CONVENTIONS</B></P>
<P><B>HELD DURING SCHOOL TERMS</B></P>
<P>The colleges and universities and the state Department of Public Instruction are requested to limit the number of meetings and conferences called during school time requiring teacher absence from classes.  It is gratifying to know that the State Superintendent is working on the problem--(1) contacts with the chief school administrators are to be made prior to the announcement of meetings, (2) as many meetings as possible will be scheduled during non-school hours, (3) the number of meetings will be kept at a reasonable level.</P>
<P><B>MEMBERSHIP PERSONAL SERVICE</B></P>
<P>INVESTIGATIVE PROCEDURES:</P>
<P>In the event a full voting member, in good standing, needs assistance from the WASDA in his/her relations with the school board, that steps to be taken to secure such assistance be as follows:</P>
<P>1.If the district administrator wishes to obtain legal counsel, the administrator shall contact the Executive Director of the WASDA or, if the Executive Director is not available, the chairman of the School Administrator-School board Relations Committee.</P>
<P> A.Upon proper authorization legal counsel will be provided the member requesting legal assistance.</P>
<P> B.Upon authorization by the WASDA Executive Director the member requesting legal services shall be authorized to expend up to $700 in defense of his/her position or contract language.</P>
<P>C.Financial assistance beyond the $700 must have the approval of the WASDA Board of Directors or the Chairperson of the WASDA Administrator-Board Relations Committee in order to be authorized for payment by the WASDA Executive Director.  If a member incurs legal costs beyond the initial $700, the individual can make application for up to an additional $500 grant in matching funds.  Thus, for a WASDA member to receive up to a $500 additional grant from the Executive Committee, the member would have to show legal fees up to an additional maximum of $1,000 beyond the initial $700 grant.  For example:  A member incurring $950 of authorized legal costs would receive a $825 grant ($700 + $125 matching funds.)</P>
<P> D.The WASDA Board of Directors may request a status report and recommendation relating to the case involved prior to taking official action on a request for the additional financial assistance.</P>
<P>2.Should an administrator desire a fact finding investigation, the administrator shall contact the Executive Director ofthe WASDA or the Chairman of the WASDA Administrator-School Board Relations Committee.  Such investigation, to be effective, should have the approval of the respective school board.  In general, the investigating team shall be composed of the Executive Director of the WASDA, the Executive Director of the WASB, two members of the WASDA Administrator-School Board Relations Committee and two members of the WASB.  The findings of said investigative team shall be confidential information reserved to the respective administrator and the board of education.</P>
<P>GUIDELINES FOR COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN CONDUCTING FACT FINDING INVESTIGATIONS:</P>
<P>1.The School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee will conduct an investigation only when a written request is received as outlined in the Investigation Procedures.</P>
<P>2.The School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee members will conduct a fact finding investigation only when such investigation is authorized and directed by the Chairman of the School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee. </P>
<P>3.WASDA and its School Administrator-School Board Relations Committee shall always act in a highly professional manner when participating in any requested investigation.</P>
<P>4.Identification of areas of conflict and reasons for local actions taken shall be of major concern to the WASDA committee.</P>
<P>5.The committee shall always keep in mind that a school's only reason for being is to serve the children of the community and any recommendations should in no way jeopardize this function.</P>
<P>6.One of the aims of the committee should be to provide help and understanding, not only for the administrator, but, the school board and community as well.</P>
<P>7.The investigation should be impartial in seeking out the truth and members of the committee should not get involved in any discussion of their own ideas and convictions about the particular situation.</P>
<P><B>MILWAUKEE-MILWAUKEE SUBURBAN DESEGREGATION POLICY</B></P>
<P>Be it resolved that the WASDA go on record as favoring improvements of the present Chapter 220 program for the purpose of voluntarily increasing the racial balance of schools and expanding the educational opportunity for all students; further, that WASDA oppose mandated school district reorganization.</P>
<P><B>MINORITY ADMINISTRATORS</B></P>
<P>WASDA shall in its own operations and through its assistance urge local, state and national educational organizations to:</P>
<P>1.establish and carry out effective programs which lead to the recruitment and appointment of minorities to leadership positions.</P>
<P>2.involve all minorities in all leadership training opportunities, both as participants and leaders.</P>
<P>3.involve minorities at all levels of decision making.</P>
<P>4.involve minority administrators in the total socio/political processes of the community.</P>
<P>5.provide for career progression in leadership positions.</P>
<P><B>MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS</B></P>
<P>Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly adopt the concept that all members of the administrative team shall be provided with multi-year contracts and that the members of the WASDA shall actively pursue and recommend to their boards of education multi-year contracts for all administrative team members.</P>
<P><B>POLITICAL ENDORSEMENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, it is the policy of WASDA to promote strong public education in Wisconsin's elementary and secondary schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the strength and viability of public education is dependent upon political process and especially by the enactments of the legislative branch of the state of Wisconsin, and</P>
<P>Whereas, it is deemed to be in the best interest of public elementary and secondary education if the WASDA organization would contribute to the elective process and the information available to voters by endorsing candidates for certain political offices.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA Board of Directors shall develop procedures for political endorsement* by the WASDA organization which will allow for the statewide participation of the membership in the endorsement process, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the offices to be included in this procedure be Governor, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Representative, and State Senator, and</P>
<P>Criteria for endorsement shall be as follows:</P>
<P>GOVERNOR</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators will endorse a candidate for the elected office of Governor of the state of Wisconsin as follows:</P>
<P>1.Within two weeks after the date of July 12, the WASDA Political Endorsement Committee will meet.  This committee will consist of the following people:  the WASDA President, the Past President, the President-elect, the WASDA Legislative Committee Chairperson, the Legislative Committee Vice Chairperson and the Executive Director of the WASDA.  The purpose of this meeting is to make the plans for the endorsement.  Items to consider will be:  endorsement if there is a primary election, dates for future meetings, development of the list of questions that will be asked of the candidates relative to the issues at the time, development of a timetable for endorsement procedures, etc.</P>
<P>2.Prior to the election, the candidates will be sent a list of questions asking for their positions on the various issues which are of concern to WASDA and its members.</P>
<P>3.Prior to the final endorsement, the Endorsement Committee will meet with the candidates to discuss with them their responses to the list of questions sent to them.  In addition, the committee will attempt to secure commitments from the candidates on various issues in return for our endorsement.</P>
<P>4.The Endorsement Committee will then meet to select the candidate which they will recommend for our endorsement. This candidate's name will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their final approval.</P>
<P>STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators will endorse a candidate for the elected office of State Superintendent of Public Instruction as follows:</P>
<P>1.Within two weeks after the first Tuesday of January, the WASDA Political Endorsement Committee will meet.  This committee will consist of the following people:  The WASDA President, the Past President, the President-elect, the WASDA Legislative Committee Chairperson, the Legislative Committee Vice Chairperson and the Executive Director of the WASDA.  The purpose of this meeting is to make the plans for the endorsement.</P>
<P>Items to consider will be:  endorsement if there is a primary election, dates for future meetings, development of the list of questions that will be asked of the candidates relative to the issues at the time, development of a timetable for endorsement procedures, etc.</P>
<P>2.Prior to the election, the candidates will be sent a list of questions asking for their positions on the various issues which are of concern to WASDA and its members.</P>
<P>3.Prior to the final endorsement, the Endorsement Committee will meet with the candidates to discuss with them their responses to the list of questions sent to them.  In addition, the committee will attempt to secure commitments from the candidates on various issues in return for our endorsement.</P>
<P>4.The Endorsement Committee will then meet to select the candidate which they will recommend for our endorsement. This candidate's name will be submitted to the Board of Directors for their final approval.</P>
<P>WASDA STATE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE POLITICAL ENDORSEMENT PROCEDURES</P>
<P>1.A political coordinator will be selected for each of the 33 Senatorial districts.</P>
<P>2.The political coordinator shall be a member of either the WASDA Legislative Committee or the WASDA AIL-PAC committee.</P>
<P>3.A member of either the WASDA Legislative Committee or a member of the WASDA AIL-PAC shall be appointed to serve as the chairperson for each of the 99 Assembly districts.</P>
<P>4.It will be the responsibility of the political coordinator of the Senatorial districts to promote and coordinate the activities and political involvement of the three chairpersons appointed to the Assembly districts within the Senatorial district.</P>
<P>5.The political coordinator and the chairperson for each Assembly district retain the option of selecting additional members of the WASDA to serve on their Political Endorsement Committee.</P>
<P>6.The political coordinator and the chairpersons of the 99 Assembly districts retain the authority to determine if it would be advisable for the WASDA members within that political boundary area to endorse any of the candidates seeking a state office.</P>
<P>7.If the political coordinators and the chairpersons of the 99 Assembly districts determine that an endorsement would be to the advantage of the WASDA, this determination would be made strictly by the members of the WASDA within that Senatorial district or by the members of the WASDA within a specific Assembly district.</P>
<P>8.If and when a political endorsement for either a state Senator or a state Representative is made, the chairperson should notify the WASDA office.  The WASDA office would then notify the candidate about the endorsement and authorize the candidate to use the name of the WASDA in his/her political campaigns, if he/she desires to do so.</P>
<P>9.The above procedure provides local authorization for an endorsement without requiring further endorsement by the WASDA Legislative Committee or the WASDA AIL-PAC, or official confirmation by the WASDA Board of Directors.</P>
<P>    10.It is also recommended that each candidate considered for endorsement be interviewed by members of the WASDA prior to official endorsement.</P>
<P>11.It is recommended that each candidate considered for endorsement be interviewed by members of the WASDA prior to official endorsement.</P>
<P>    12.Members of the WASDA are encouraged to endorse candidates that they believe will prove to be strong supporters of public elementary and secondary education in Wisconsin, rather than selecting candidates because of personal political affiliations.</P>
<P>Members of the WASDA are reminded that each of the 99 Assembly seats are up for election every two years.  One-half of the 33 Senate seats are up for election every two years.  Thus, of the 33 Senatorial districts, there will only be 16 or 17 racesevery two years.  In other words, the state Representatives are elected for two-year terms, while our state Senators are elected for four-year terms.</P>
<P><B>PROFESSIONAL GROWTH</B></P>
<P>Because the responsibilities of the superintendency are becoming increasingly complex, and because the development of management skills of highly motivated school executives will increase their ability to lead their districts in the fast changing arena of public education, the WASDA is encouraged to pursue a training program which will deliver growth opportunities in ways which will make them both accessible and valuable to practicing superintendents.</P>
<P><B>PROFESSIONAL NEGOTIATIONS</B></P>
<P>The chief school district administrator shall serve as the coordinator of the procedures and responsibilities relating to the union/management collective bargaining process.  The position of the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators should, therefore, support the active role of the superintendent of schools in the professional negotiations process and recommend that the superintendent exert the necessary professional leadership for the representatives serving on the board of education collective bargaining team.  The basic obligation of the chief school district administrator should be to serve the best interests of the pupil.</P>
<P><B>PUBLIC FUNDS FOR PRIVATE SCHOOLS</B></P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators recognizes and supports the need for diversity of educational opportunity for Wisconsin children.  The association further recognizes the depth of the challenge it faces in obtaining funds in sufficient amounts to properly support existing and planned quality educational programs in the public school system.</P>
<P>Therefore, the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators opposes direct financial aid from state and federal sources to schools which are private and/or sectarian in nature.  We believe that financial support for non-public institutions would weaken the fabric of public education and would tend towards increasing rather than minimizing the divisiveness characterizing our society.</P>
<P>Certain categorical aids are presently available to non-public school children.  The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators feels that to exceed these limited and publicly supervised aids is to extend financial support to the maintenance of the systems themselves.  The association supports the contention that public funds can best be expended to broaden and strengthen public school programs.</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators remains strongly opposed to the voucher system as presently proposed and reaffirms the necessity for working vigorously for the best educational opportunities within the context of the existing public school system.  Also, the WASDA strongly opposes the enactment of tuition tax credits for students attending parochial and private schools as advocated by the federal government.</P>
<P><B>PUBLIC GROUPS AND EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA believes that chief school district administrators should provide leadership in working with and supporting all groups whose purpose is to provide the best educational opportunities for children.  The association encourages its leadership to become actively involved in and cooperate in the efforts being extended by such consortiums as the Wisconsin Council of School Administrative Associations (WCSAA), the Wisconsin Council for United Action in Public Education in Wisconsin, and the Joint Committee on Education in Wisconsin.</P>
<P><B>RESEARCH</B></P>
<P>We believe that WASDA has a key role in identifying needed educational research.  In order to carry out this role effectively there must be a continuous and systematic means of communicating and making joint research decisions between and among the WASDA membership, the Department of Public Instruction, the University System and the WASDA Research Committee. Furthermore, there must be some assurance that recommendations emerging via these shared decision making processes reach the state of priority implementation in a timely manner.</P>
<P>The WASDA membership requests an active/involved role in the annual DPI Superintendent's Fall Conference.  The forumprovided therein should be used to initiate the shared decision making process and to draw upon the insights of the State's District Administrators to identify and promote needed research.  This input would then be used in further discussions with the University System, the DPI and the WASDA Research Committee in supporting the implementation of the decided upon research.</P>
<P>The WASDA membership urges a high priority be placed on soliciting and implementing a cooperative approach to research relevant to the superintendency.  We believe that the WASDA Board of Directors should be authorized and empowered to release funds in amounts commensurate with the value of the research effort to the organization and that timelines should be established to receive the research results within the year the data was compiled.</P>
<P>We further believe that:</P>
<P>1.Critical administrative decisions must be based upon the findings of carefully designed, validated and relevant studies which have particular significance to an application at the local level.</P>
<P>2.The University System and the DPI have access to data which must be analyzed, interpreted and communicated to administrators in a coordinated manner.</P>
<P>3.Administrators need a coordinated support system in being able to gain access and use research data, particularly as it relates to the performance of students beyond high school.</P>
<P>4.The chief function of the Research Committee is to provide a standing committee to meet with and advise those individuals, institutions and/or agencies having the responsibility for the initiation of research studies having particular relevance to the administration of public education.</P>
<P>5.Secure help of research groups who have the expertise and technology to analyze data.</P>
<P>6.Coordinate the research efforts emanating from the various WASDA committees.</P>
<P><B>RETIREMENT</B></P>
<P>WASDA would support legislation which would merge the State Retirement System of Wisconsin; allow for full retirement after age 60; and the development of a factor which would take into account a cost of living index.</P>
<P>Whereas, an effective and strong retirement is important to the well-being and career planning of the school district administrator, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the district administrator's position is basically a twelve-month position as compared to a regular teacher's position of nine months, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the position is one of high stress due to the responsibilities it involves, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the Wisconsin retirement system affecting administrators undergoes periodic reviews and changes, and</P>
<P>Whereas, many states include a provision for vesting the retirement account at a stage it is encouraged that the state of Wisconsin revise its vesting procedures to five years.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA support legislation that would eliminate the present penalty for early retirement of district administrators by including them in the same or similar group as protective occupations, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA Retirement Committee, with the support of the Executive Director, be empowered to support or oppose bills related to a change(s) when there is insufficient time to gain Board and/or membership support, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved the WASDA support efforts to establish a reciprocal retirement system between neighboring/midwest states, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that should an administrator terminate his/her administrative career for retirement or other purposes, that said administrator would have the option to draw out both the employee and employer retirement funds and its corresponding interest or dividends earned during the period said funds are in the retirement fund, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA promote and provide more information than presently exists on the retirement programs through better informational publications and continue to provide informational meetings for administrators on this subject, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved the WASDA encourage its members to become more fully aware of the provisions of the retirement program.</P>
<P>Be it also resolved that WASDA supports the policy that the State Investment Board shall be prudent in all its future investments of Wisconsin Retirement System Funds with due regard for human rights and the protection of the world environment.  WASDA further recommends that all Wisconsin Retirement System funds be retained for retirement purposes.</P>
<P><B>RIF PROCEDURES</B></P>
<P>Resolved that the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly endorse the concept that each school district board adopt a policy regarding a lay-off procedure for the administrative team members that would be necessitated as a result of a substantial decline in the pupil population of the school district.  The school district administrator shall take the initiative to review existing RIF policies with the administrative team members and will actively pursue adoption of an RIF policy by board action.</P>
<P><B>SCHOOL DESEGREGATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that each child shall have an equal opportunity for education that reflects America's pluralistic society, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that school district administrators have a moral and legal obligation to provide leadership to ensure equal opportunity for education.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA support the concept of encouraging districts to voluntarily participate in desegregation efforts and that school district administrators provide affirmative leadership to prevent discriminative or reverse discrimination in any desegregation efforts.</P>
<P> <B>SCHOOL FUNDING</B></P>
<P>WHEREAS alternative methods of funding the public schools of the State of Wisconsin are being considered by the Governor's Commission on Education in the 21st Century; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS there is public outcry regarding the current level of property taxes having to support an inordinate portion of school costs; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS any change in the tax structure for the support of public education should provide for equal tax for equal cost per pupil and to ensure equal educational opportunity for all the students of the State without district islands of tax overburden; and</P>
<P>WHEREAS legislators are seeking fair and effective cost containment techniques to be used for limiting imprudent educational expenditures;</P>
<P>NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT:</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators make a strong recommendation to the School Finance Subcommittee of the Governor's Commission on Education to include in their recommendations retention of the equalization aid formula as the primary distributor of state school aids, which can most equitably affect the goal of property tax relief, while ensuring equal educational opportunity for all the children of the State and at the same time offering opportunity for local effort and invoking cost containment through the spending disincentive of secondary shared costs.</P>
<P><B>STATE SUPERINTENDENT</B></P>
<P>In view of the important role of educational leadership served by the Superintendent of Public Instruction, WASDA strongly believes that the requirements of training, experience and certification in the field of school administration be retained.</P>
<P>We also propose that WASDA as an organization take an active role in the selection, support and election of the best possible candidate for state superintendency as determined by a WASDA selection committee.</P>
<P><B>SUMMER SCHOOL</B></P>
<P>Sixty-five percent or more of Wisconsin public school salary schedules require attendance at summer school or other additional training at specified intervals.  In addition, another ten percent encourage such training.</P>
<P>Although many of our institutions of higher learning are providing workshops, the selection of courses is limited.  Therefore, to meet the required salary schedules, teachers are asking for four-week summer sessions.  Universities and colleges should consider offering two four-week summer sessions per summer in addition to the usual eight-week sessions.  It would then be possible for teachers to enroll in a four-week session or to continue for eight weeks of summer work.  This would give the teachers an opportunity to continue with the formal training and would also help alleviate the strain on teachers.</P>
<P>School administrators are also looking for ways to further their education in administration.  Summer school sessions of eight weeks duration make it impossible for administrators to attend summer school unless they are released from duty or are within commuting distance.  Workshops of one to two weeks would give administrators an opportunity to attend sessions and not interfere with their summer work.</P>
<P>It is recommended that institutions of higher learning survey communities to determine the areas of interest to superintendents and that one- to two-week workshops be provided for them.</P>
<P><B>TAX EXEMPTION</B></P>
<P>Any legislation designed to grant special and specific exemptions should make provisions to compensate school districts, in a fair and equitable manner, for the loss of the financial resources previously realized from the property exempted.</P>
<P><B>POSITION ON TAX WITHHOLDING</B></P>
<P>One of the primary responsibilities of the public elementary and secondary schools of this state is the development of and training for responsible citizen participation in the democratic process.  The recent phenomenon of citizen actions directed toward the withholding of that portion of their property taxes which supports local school programs must be viewed with great concern.  Such efforts by municipal officers are not only clearly illegal but can very well be counterproductive if the participants in such actions are sincerely committed to both good education and effective tax reform.</P>
<P>The Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators strongly opposes such tax withholding actions.  The association continues to urge and will lend its full support to responsible efforts to bring about a comprehensive and meaningful revision of the program of financing elementary and secondary education.  Our longstanding position before the state legislature regarding both the improvement of the school aids formula and the reduction of local property taxes is well established; however, we stand firmly committed to the principle that effective and lasting change in a democracy must be accomplished though utilization of appropriate and existing legal channels.</P>
<P><B>TAXES</B></P>
<P>WASDA reaffirms its position that increased state aids for schools are both a necessity to alleviate soaring property taxes and to tap a broader tax base for the financial support of public education.</P>
<P>WASDA supports the economic principles of a plan which seeks to utilize broader tax sources for the support of public education.</P>
<P>WASDA will support obtaining revenue from higher income tax, extended sales tax, increased sales tax, and new taxesrecommended by our state economics.</P>
<P>WASDA supports legislation to refund the 4 percent sales tax on school building construction to help reduce this cost.</P>
<P><B>TEACHER CERTIFICATION</B></P>
<P>Support the position that retains teacher certification authority and administration in the Department of Public Instruction and support legislation that recognizes competency as a basis for initial certification, and in-service as a requirement for continued certification.</P>
<P><B>TEACHER PREPARATION</B></P>
<P>A.All public schools should participate in teacher preparation by:  (1) providing opportunities for student teaching, and; (2) cooperating with college and university officials in strengthening and upgrading field experiences for all students of education.</P>
<P>B.There should be close liaison with the state Department of Public Instruction and the Deans of Schools of Education in an effort to keep those concerned apprised of specific problem areas for administrators in teacher training programs, internship programs, teacher placement, and teacher certification and to work cooperatively towards solutions.</P>
<P>C.WASDA supports the maintenance of systems that will protect the continued use of confidential credentials and recommendations.</P>
<P>D.WASDA affirms the obligation and right of school administrators to evaluate the performance of teachers and to make, in strict confidence, professional recommendations regarding that performance and that WASDA provide legal aid in defense of any member facing legal action resulting from professional recommendations made in confidence and in good faith.</P>
<P>E.Employment and placement agencies should be notified of WASDA's desire to participate in decision making involving significant modifications in confidential record forms and credential packets and in the manner in which such information is disseminated.</P>
<P><B>TENURE</B></P>
<P>The WASDA continues to hold the position that a teacher tenure law is not beneficial to elementary and secondary education programs in Wisconsin.</P>
<P>WASDA reaffirms its position that the Fair Dismissal Act provides sufficient safeguards for the professional employees and thus, the WASDA stands opposed to tenure for teachers.</P>
<P><B>TUITION TAX CREDITS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, there are significant political proponents for legislating tuition tax credits, and</P>
<P>Whereas, this could have significant impact on public schools by decreasing available financial resources for said schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, this could place unequal responsibilities for providing mandated high cost programs not required of private schools receiving said tax support, and</P>
<P>Whereas, private schools have no requirements to meet minimum educational standards.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA and its members oppose any legislation in part or whole which would ultimately grant tuition tax credits for attendance at private schools or facsimiles thereof.</P>
<P><B>TRANSPORTATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA should propose and/or support legislation requiring local school districts to provide and finance transportation of children to only private schools which are located within the boundaries of the school district.</P>
<P>WASDA should support legislation which would recognize the actual and total distances involved in public school transportation.</P>
<P><B>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>Whereas, the WASDA reaffirms its support of the importance of a strong vocational component within the context of a comprehensive secondary school and K-12 districts, and</P>
<P>Whereas, a close working relationship be supported between local school districts and the Vocational, Technical and Adult Education schools, and </P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA will support career education programs beginning in the elementary grades and continuing through adulthood, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA reaffirms its support for youth groups and clubs and other special projects relating to vocational education in the secondary schools of Wisconsin, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA strongly supports the efforts of the Department of Public Instruction (DPI) in promoting vocational education in the local school districts, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA will support the idea that the primary place for the &quot;training&quot; component of the Jobs Training Partnership Act to occur is the comprehensive high school setting, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA will support cooperative business, industry--school projects that enhance vocational training and opportunities for young people.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA supports that study and possible development of a two-way communication system throughout our state of instructional and in-service purposes, and</P>
<P>Further be it resolved that WASDA should remain alert to the possibilities offered within the structure of the newly reorganized Cooperative Educational Service Agencies and the impact they may have on vocational education.</P>
<P><B>VOCATIONAL - TECHNICAL EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>The 60/40 split of federal funding for vocational education in the state of Wisconsin be reevaluated in the light that allowances be made for the age of students served and proportionate populations served.</P>
<P>A continued effort be made and that additional clarification be made between secondary schools and VTAE schools in the state of Wisconsin.</P>
<P>Efforts be continued to work toward articulation of secondary and post-secondary vocational and technical education programs.</P>
<P>Additional state funds be appropriated to support vocational education programs at the secondary level.</P>
<P>That programs in career education beginning with kindergarten through adulthood be established and developed throughout the state of Wisconsin.</P>
<P>Employment services for students and high school graduates should be established in the secondary schools of Wisconsin.</P>
<P>That participation in youth groups relating to vocational education be supported in local comprehensive high schools.</P>
<P>That health occupations in the comprehensive high school in Wisconsin be developed and stimulated.</P>
<P>That work-study programs for fourteen- and fifteen-year-old students be investigated.</P>
<P>That the 1020 committee, which will be given the authority to determine the use of federal funds as defined in Title X of the 1972 Amendments to Education, be housed with the Wisconsin Board of Vocational, Technical and Adult Education.</P>
<P>The WASDA establish liaison with the University of Wisconsin's Career Center for Studies in Vocational and Technical Education, which will be sponsoring a career education in-service project for administrators.  And further, that administrators be encouraged to participate in this in-service project.</P>
<P>Presently vocational-technical education is allowed to levy up to two mills on local property taxes.  WASDA supports the concept that vocational-technical education be supported by state and federal general revenues and by student fees.</P>
<P>That certification standards for instructors in the area of vocational education be reviewed and revised as they pertain to general methods and criteria, local school input, competency and problems relating to unique skills.</P>
<P>That the Department of Public Instruction, the DILHR and local school districts continuously review and update standards and policies relating to the cooperative study, work study and on-the-job training programs in secondary schools.</P>
<P>That the WASDA promote through local districts and other related agencies a uniform definition of terms so students, parents and the general public can better know and understand the efforts of vocational education in secondary schools.</P>
<P>That WASDA promote through local districts and other related agencies a renewed effort vocational curriculums, the values of the work ethic and the importance of attitude in the world of work.</P>
<P><B>VOUCHER PLANS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, voucher plans, or similar proposals, are presented for legislative consideration, and</P>
<P>Whereas, said plans could interfere with a school district's ability to operate with consistency of enrollment and financial support due to potential competition from other schools, both public and private, and</P>
<P>Whereas, schools already having strong programs with adequate financial support would in all probability receive more financial support from the voucher plan, while schools needing said support to build up their programs would receive less support, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the voucher plan would have many of the similar detrimental effects upon public schools as would the tuition tax credit plan.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA formally opposes legislation which would support this concept.</P>
<P><B>WOMEN ADMINISTRATORS</B></P>
<P>WASDA, in its own operation and through its assistance urge local school districts, and in the work with other educational organizations at the local, state and national levels shall:</P>
<P>1.Strive to insure that women have equal access to educational administrative positions.</P>
<P>2.Establish and carry out effective programs which lead to the recruitment and appointment of women to leadership positions.</P>
<P>3.Initiate support for and participate in training activities directed at assisting women to advance professionally.</P>
<P>4.Involve women in all leadership training opportunities, both as participants and leaders.</P>
<P>5.Involve women at all levels of decision making.</P>
<P>6.Involve women administrators in the total socio-political processes of the community.</P>
<P>7.Provide for career progression in leadership positions.</P>
<P>8.Promote the status and visibility of women in educational administration.</P>
<P>9.Publish dates and share information related to the employment and utilization of qualified women in educational administration.</P>
<P><B><U>STUDENTS</U></B></P>
<P><B>ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, there is a concern about the number of Wisconsin high school students who drop out prior to graduation, and</P>
<P>Whereas, there are fewer opportunities for unskilled and poorly trained individuals, and</P>
<P>Whereas, unemployable individuals become wards of society, and</P>
<P>Whereas, past and present dropout prevention has not seemed to be effective.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA encourage the development of alternative education programs, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that WASDA take a leadership role in developing joint planning with vocational districts, the CESA organization and other public and private employers.</P>
<P><B>BASIC LANGUAGE</B></P>
<P>Whereas, every strong nation must be able to communicate with its citizens, and</P>
<P>Whereas, in every strong nation the citizens must be able to communicate with each other, and</P>
<P>Whereas, schools are charged with the teaching of the basic language of our society, and </P>
<P>Whereas, English is the basic language of the United States.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA take a stand to encourage the teaching of English rather than teaching in the native language, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that bilingual instruction be transitional in nature.</P>
<P><B>CHEMICAL ABUSE PROGRAMS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, chemical dependency in America is among the highest of any developed country in the world, and</P>
<P>Whereas, a significant number of high school seniors regularly abuse drugs, and</P>
<P>Whereas, roughly 2/3 of all Americans try an illicit drug before they finish high school, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the single leading cause of death among youth is drunk driving.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that WASDA support the establishment of chemical abuse programs in every high school in the state of Wisconsin, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that WASDA support a uniform 21-year-old drinking law in the United States.</P>
<P><B>CHILD ABUSE AND NEGLECT</B></P>
<P>Whereas, child abuse and child neglect is a growing problem in the United States, and</P>
<P>Whereas, all school employees are charged with the responsibility of reporting incidents of suspected child abuse and child neglect, and</P>
<P>Whereas, the district administrator is responsible for the supervision of all programs.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the school district administrator will taken an active role in the reporting of suspected cases of child abuse and child neglect, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the district administrator will provide for inservice of employees to assist them in identifying, and how to handle suspected cases of child abuse and child neglect.</P>
<P><B>COMPETENCY TESTING</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA recognizes programs for establishing minimal competencies and basic skills examination for promotion and/or graduation have been instituted by legislative action and by mandates of local school boards, and</P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA believes that such programs should be based upon the acknowledgement that multiple levels of individual differences exist among all students, and</P>
<P>Whereas, such programs should not limit expectations of student performance by establishing single standards of achievement, but should provide assessment including professional judgments of the students' cumulative experiences and acquisition of basic skills consistent with their identified learning abilities.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that WASDA believes these programs should reflect concern for student needs beyond expected minimal competencies and should consider their goals beyond high school.</P>
<P><B>COMPULSORY SCHOOL ATTENDANCE AGE</B></P>
<P>The WASDA supports State Statutes 118.15(1)(a) which states that unless the child has a legal excuse or has graduated from high school, any person having under control a child who is between the ages of 6 and 18 years shall cause such child to attend school regularly during the full period and hours, religious holidays excepted, that the public or private school in which such child should be enrolled is in session until the end of the school term, quarter or semester of the school year in which the child becomes 18 years of age.</P>
<P><B>CORPORAL PUNISHMENT</B></P>
<P>The WASDA supports 118.31 of the State Statutes, which states, &quot;No official, employe or agent of a school board may subject a pupil enrolled in the school district to corporal punishment.  The team &quot;corporal punishment&quot; means the intentional infliction of physical pain which is used as a means of discipline.  &quot;Corporal punishment&quot; includes, but is not limited to, paddling, slapping or prolonged maintenance of physically painful positions, when used as a means of discipline.  </P>
<P>This section does not prohibit an official employee or agent of a school board from using reasonable and necessary force to quell a disturbance or prevent an act that threatens physical injury to any person, to obtain possession of a weapon, to use self-defense, to protect property, etc.</P>
<P><B>DISCIPLINE OF STUDENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, a well-oriented classroom and a well-ordered school best meets the educational needs of all the students enrolled, and</P>
<P>Whereas, young people need rules and regulations, as well as the strong supporting role models of interested teachers, so that discipline can be maintained within the classroom and the school, and</P>
<P>Whereas, our society needs disciplined people to act as responsible adults.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA support efforts at the local level to provide the necessary staffing and programmingto afford assistance to students who need disciplining, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA encourage boards of education and district administrators to in-service teachers and support staff so that there is a consistent pattern of discipline well understood by both faculty and students in both individual classrooms and entire school buildings, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA support efforts by board of education and school administrators to work closely with the home so that discipline can be developed in elementary and secondary school-age students in joint efforts between school and home.</P>
<P><B>DISRUPTIVE STUDENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, disruptive students interfere both with their own learning and with the learning of other students, and</P>
<P>Whereas, disruptive students undermine the positive learning atmosphere of schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, there are many causes for the behavior of disruptive students which can be resolved through appropriate persons and programs.</P>
<P>Be it, therefore, resolved that the WASDA supports special counseling and guidance for disruptive students, and</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA supports special program settings if necessary so that the needs of disruptive students are met while at the same time the needs of all other students are not interfered with, and</P>
<P>Be it finally resolved that disruptive students who continue to disrupt be confronted with consequences appropriate to their continued violations.</P>
<P><B>ENTRANCE AGE</B></P>
<P>WASDA supports the change in the status that brought about a uniform age of September 1 and continues to support the prospect of state aid which would be allocated for such programs starting at age 4 and proportionate to full or half-day programs.</P>
<P><B>GIFTED &amp; TALENTED STUDENTS</B></P>
<P>Whereas, children are endowed with special gifts and talents; and</P>
<P>Whereas, it is in the best interest of these children, as well as of the community, state and nation, that these special gifts and talents be developed insofar as possible, and</P>
<P>Whereas, these special gifts and talents require special instructional strategies and special curriculum content.</P>
<P>Therefore, be it resolved that the WASDA support the development of appropriate legislation encouraging programming and providing the necessary funding incentives to meet the needs of gifted and talented elementary and secondary school students.</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the WASDA encourage school districts to develop programs for their gifted and talented students in recognition of the special potential of these students.</P>
<P>Be it further resolved that the state fund a competitive grant program that will adequately fund staff appointments for gifted and talented K-12 programs throughout the state.</P>
<P><B>SPECIAL EDUCATION</B></P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the idea that the State of Wisconsin should provide through its LEA's a strong special educationprogram designed to serve students with exceptional educational needs and designed to meet the requirements and standards set forth by PL 94-142.</P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the idea that current state law and agency rules and regulations respecting special education could be and should be revised so that the special education delivery system would be appropriate to the demographics of Wisconsin and would permit more effective ways to serve students with exceptional needs.</P>
<P>WASDA strongly supports the idea that the funding system for special education would benefit from reform and revisions which would place the major burden of support of special education at the state level rather than at the local level and would equitably distribute aid.  WASDA requests the opportunity to participate in any state study groups established to recommend reforms of the special education aid formula.</P>
<P>With respect to these positions WASDA puts forth these considerations:</P>
<P>1.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to promote special education.  At the time PL 94-142 was conceived, Wisconsin was a leader in the delivery of special education services.  WASDA has always supported efforts that Wisconsin be a leader in the area of special education.  WASDA has always supported the idea that school districts must live up to their responsibilities to comply with the letter and the spirit of the laws of the land.</P>
<P>2.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to provide educational services appropriate to the needs and the unique conditions of the state.  At the time PL 94-142 was conceived, Wisconsin in anticipation of the law put together state law and agency rules and regulations which in the implementation have created a delivery system, which in concept not only met, but also exceeded, the letter and spirit of PL 94-142 and in general created for LEA's a cumbersome, cost-ineffective system, which cannot be shown to be appropriate to either the demographics of Wisconsin or for the best interest of students with exceptional educational needs.</P>
<P>3.Wisconsin has a history of demonstrated concern and effort to provide sufficient funding to encourage and support special education.  The implementation of the laws and rules and regulations which were laid down in anticipation of PL 94-142 have generated for the state and LEA's tremendous special education costs.  The state is currently moving toward an alternative funding system in the hope of establishing greater equity and greater control of the budgeting and distribution of special education aids.  WASDA feels there is a real peril to LEA's if a substitute formula is adopted which fails to maintain the state's obligation to support the major share of the tremendous direct and indirect costs generated by the state mandated delivery system.</P>
<P><B>IMPROVING STUDENT PERFORMANCE IN BASIC ACADEMIC SKILLS</B></P>
<P>As a result of expressed concerns about low student performance in academic skills and in the event of legislative action concerning the teaching of basic skills, the WASDA Committee on Educational Program Evaluation has identified a number of issues and concerns which should be deliberated prior to enactment of any legislation.  The issues included herein are considered by the committee to be important considerations in order to effectively address the problem of improving student achievement in basic skills.  The committee defines basic skill instruction to include reading, writing and arithmetic.</P>
<P>Prior to deliberating any legislative remedy it is critical that specific problems related to basic skills be identified.  If indeed problem(s) are identified and if legislation is deemed desirable, the following stipulations should be observed:</P>
<P>1.It is imperative that legislative remedies be aimed at rectifying specific correctable deficiencies rather than at the broad unspecified area of &quot;basic skills.&quot;</P>
<P>2.It is imperative that legislative remedies include standards of acceptable performance for those basic skills.  These standards would not only apply to students who have been identified as having exceptional education needs.</P>
<P>3.It is imperative that legislation allow local school districts to develop their own educational programs for helpingtheir students reach the stipulated standards.</P>
<P>4.In order to ascertain compliance with the law the legislation should include procedures for reporting achievement in basic skills to the Department of Public Instruction.</P>
<P>5.It is imperative the legislation include a stipulated time period for evaluating the impact of the law on student performance with regard to basic skills at the end of a defined time period.  A sunset provision should be included which would allow for evaluation and termination or modification of the statute.  A reasonable time period might be three to five years.</P>
<P><B>STUDENT RIGHTS</B></P>
<P>Support the position on student rights which states that students have rights, as well as responsibilities, similar to those of all citizens.</P>
<P><B>SUBSTANCE ABUSE</B></P>
<P>WASDA urges administrators to work with other agencies to establish prevention/intervention programs for students affected by alcohol and other substance abuse.</P>
<P><B><U>ORGANIZATION</U></B></P>
<P><B>COOPERATIVE EDUCATIONAL SERVICE AGENCIES</B></P>
<P>Whereas, WASDA supports CESAs as a cost effective approach to maintaining and improving quality education in Wisconsinpublic schools, and</P>
<P>Whereas, collaborative educational endeavors among school districts, colleges, Vocational Technical Adult Education Districts, universities, business, industry and the state can be facilitated effectively by CESA, and</P>
<P>Whereas, CESAs are designed to coordinate interdistrict programs effectively and efficiently, and</P>
<P>Whereas, there is a growing need for interdistrict collaboration to provide quality education with limited resources.</P>
<P>Now therefore be it resolved that:</P>
<P>WASDA members support CESAs through political action to stabilize state funding for CESAs and that</P>
<P>WASDA assume a leadership role to improve the image of CESAs through public relations efforts and that</P>
<P>WASDA support the state's commitment to strengthening the CESA role in the delivery of educational service to districts, and that</P>
<P>WASDA continue to support its Executive Director's lobbying efforts for CESAs.</P>
<P><B>DPI STAFF</B></P>
<P>Because education is a state function, the DPI must have staff availability for continuing services to local school districts.  A decrease of staff members in an era of increased demands on the schools of Wisconsin would have adverse consequences.</P>
<P><B>PTA</B></P>
<P>Whereas the PTA is the best source to resolve the communication gap regarding school programs, finances and educational needs within the local school district;</P>
<P>And whereas membership by parents in the state affiliated PTA unit has the advantage of resources from the state and national Congress of PTA:</P>
<P>Be it resolved by WASDA to encourage every District Administrator to initiate units of PTA in his/her local district which are affiliated with the Wisconsin Congress of Parents and Teachers.</P>
<P><B>RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS</B></P>
<P>WASDA Policies and Resolutions Committee commends all sincere efforts being made to identify areas of common concern, to clarify points of conflict, and to identify areas of agreement within the teaching profession.</P>

<P><B>PROFESSIONAL IMPROVEMENT COMMITTEE</B>:</P>
<P>It is the responsibility of this committee to be prepared to suggest topics and subjects and speakers to be included in the WASDA Annual Educational Conference held in May.  It is the function of the committee members to determine a subject or subjects for the Annual Bill Kahl Seminar, to determine a site location for the Bill Kahl Seminar, and to give consideration as to the appropriate dates to conduct the Bill Kahl Seminar.  The State Superintendent's Fall Conference is held each September.  The State Superintendent usually requests input from the WASDA regarding subjects, topics and speakers that WASDA members believe would be of major interest to its membership.  It would be the function of this committee to review the State Superintendent's Fall Conference program each year and be prepared to come forth with suggestions and recommendations when planning the Fall Conference for the ensuing year.</P>

<P ALIGN="center"><I>An Alliance of:</I></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Accushi">The Association of Wisconsin School Administrators (AWSA)</FONT></P>
<P ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Accushi">Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO)</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN="center"><FONT FACE="Accushi">Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS)</FONT></P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>HISTORY</B></H2>
<P>The SAA was founded in 1991 when the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators (WASDA) and the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators (AWSA) joined their advocacy efforts. With the addition of the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials in 1992 and the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS) in 1994, the SAA has grown to represent virtually every licensed school administrator in the State of Wisconsin. This increasingly diverse membership provides a broad perspective and a deep understanding of educational issues.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>MISSION</B></H2>
<P>To advocate on behalf of school administrators in their efforts to strengthen Wisconsin's national leadership in education so that our children receive a world class education.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>ADVOCACY</B></H2>
<P>The SAA's diverse membership is united by a commitment to continuously improve the quality of Wisconsin public education. The SAA will support legislation which focuses on the following basic principles:</P>

<UL>
<LI>The education of our children must be state government's primary purpose. The state must adhere to its constitutional obligation to &quot;provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable,&quot; and &quot;free and without charge for tuition to all children between the ages of 4 and 20 years.&quot;</LI>
<LI>All children deserve to receive an education that meets their needs and abilities.</LI>
<LI>There must be coordination among school programs and community-based programs to ensure that the whole child receives attention.</LI>
<LI>Parents must be active participants in the education of their children, from birth to graduation.</LI>
<LI>Standards must be established by which parents, communities, and government can determine the quality of education provided to our children and measure their performance.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The SAA legislative agenda, which is published annually, outlines legislative positions and the beliefs they are based on in the following areas:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Educational Programs</LI>
<LI>Finance and Facilities</LI>
<LI>School Governance</LI>
<LI>Support of Educational Leaders</LI>

</UL>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>SERVICE</B></H2>
<P>The SAA serves as a vehicle for members to collectively advance the policy deliberations of today's most important educational issues. For example, every year the SAA sponsors project teams consisting of volunteers from around the state who are interested, have expertise and are willing to work intensively to analyze issues that impact upon the children educated in Wisconsin. Through their work these teams serve our members and the public alike.</P>
<P>If you would like information on current project team proposals, please contact the SAA.</P>

<P><B>FCC RELEASES RECOMMENDATIONS.</B> On November 7 the FCC and the Jt. Board (a board established to develop special rates for schools and libraries) released their recommendations. The Joint Board recommends providing higher discounts for economically disadvantaged schools and libraries and those entities located in high cost areas. Discounts are a minimum of 20% and range from 40-90% for all but the least disadvantaged schools and libraries.</P>
<P>The 1996 Act directs the Federal-State Joint Board to adopt new universal service support mechanisms that are specific, predictable, and sufficient to advance the universal service principles enumerated in the Act. One principle enunciated in the Act is &quot;Elementary and secondary schools and classrooms, health care providers, and libraries, should have access to advanced telecommunications services. &quot;</P>
<P>The Joint Board recommends that eligible schools and libraries be able to purchase at a discount any telecommunications services, internal connections among classrooms, and access to the Internet. The Joint Board recommends providing higher discounts for economically disadvantaged schools and libraries and those entities located in high cost areas. Discounts are a minimum of 20% and range from 40-90% for all but the least disadvantaged schools and libraries. Total expenditures for universal service support for schools and libraries is capped at $2.25 billion per year, although any funds not disbursed in a given year may be carried forward and also disbursed.</P>

<P><B><FONT FACE="Albertus Medium">Below are some pointers for evaluating superintendents that were recently listed in a WASB publication:</FONT></B></P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Set aside a special, regular time for evaluation.</B> Schedule the evaluation for a retreat or spearate board meeting. Don't wait for a crisis.</LI>
<LI><B>Use an evaluation form that's as simple as possible. </B></LI>
<LI><B>Jot things down as they occur to you.</B> Don't wait until the last minute to fill out an evaluation. If you do, you're likely to place too much weight on your most recent phone call from an irate (or, for that matter, a delighted) parent.</LI>
<LI><B>Give everyone a voice. </B>Several consultants suggest having board members answer essay-type questions on their own. The board president can compile the consensus evaluation that will be used in the evaluation discussion.</LI>
<LI><B>Be fair.</B> Don't punish the superintendent at evaluation time if you're in one of the minority blocs. Remember that the superintendent's job is to carry out the wishes of the majority of the board of education. Don't engage in psychoanalysis or assisn motives to the superintendent.</LI>
<LI><B>Be positive.</B> People in education know you should build on children's strengths, remember that adults are just like children. It is important to end the evaluation on a positive note.</LI>
<LI><B>Be willing to seek outside help.</B> It's much easier for an outside person to corral difficult board members than it is for you to corral yourselves. Your state school board association should be able to help or refer you to consultants in the field.</LI>
<LI><B>Try to keep things in perspective.</B> Don't be too influenced by one recent dramatic error or magnificent accomplishment.</LI>
<LI><B>Allow time for the superintendent to respond.</B> Don't leave your superintendent sputtering--or wondering. Now might be a good time to let the superintendent participate in an evaluation of the board.</LI>
<LI><B>Debrief.</B> As soon as you complete an evaluation, you should analyze what worked and what didn't. Then develop a new written plan for the next evaluation. </LI>

<P><B>A. Purpose</B></P>
<P>Proper administration of the schools is vital to a successful educational program.  The general purpose of the District Administrator should be to coordinate and supervise, under the policies of the Board, the creation and operation of an environment in which students learn most effectively.  The District Administrator's duties and functions should be appraised in terms of the contribution made to improving instruction and learning.  To this end, the School Board must endeavor to create and sustain a professional climate that calls forth and uses the full creative capacities of the Administrator.  Such a climate calls for common understanding, mutual respect and a full measure of confidence between the members of the Board and the Administrator.  Thus, when the objective of the School Board is to optimize student learning opportunities in an environment which is open, trusting, and caring, the evaluation of Administrators is a process designed to promote and nurture professional growth.</P>
<P>Specifically, the implementation of a planned program of Administrator evaluation should seek to:</P>
<P>1. Improve Administrator performance.</P>
<P>2.Document Administrator performance in relationship to respective job description.</P>
<P>3. Measure the effectiveness of Administrator leadership.</P>
<P>4. Assess the compatibility of the Administrator's objectives and district goals.</P>
<P>5. Establish a base for planned growth.</P>
<P>6.Provide information to enable informed decisions to be made regarding contract renewal and compensation.</P>
<P><B>B. Evaluators</B></P>
<P>To enhance the validity of the evaluation process it is desirable to have more than one source of data.  The following sources and forms of evaluation should be included:</P>
<P>1.  SelfEvaluation</P>
<P>2.  Board Evaluation</P>
<P>SelfEvaluation shall consist of completing the District Administrator Resume and the District Admiftistrator Evaluation Form.</P>

<TITLE>LEGAL OPINION ON ADMINISTRATOR CONTRACTS </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BACKGROUND="BLUSTONE.GIF">
<H1 ALIGN="center"><A ID="I1" NAME="I1"></A>MEMORANDUM</H1>
<P>To:  Miles Turner, Executive Director</P>
<P>  Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators</P>
<P>From: William E. McCardell</P>
<P>Date:  July 26, 1995</P>
<P><B>Re:  Changes in Law Regarding Administrators' Contracts</B></P>
<P>You have requested our opinion regarding certain issues which arise with respect to administrators' contracts entered into on or after today's date, pursuant to 1995 Wisconsin Act 27 (the &quot;Act&quot;), which the Governor signed this morning.  Contracts entered into prior to today's date are not subject to the provisions of the Act, and are not addressed herein.</P>
<P>You have posed the following question to us:</P>
<P>&quot;May school boards offer administrators contracts obligating the parties to each other for more than two years?&quot;</P>
<P>The Act describes the time periods of administrators' contracts as follows:</P>
<P>118.24(1): A school board may employ a school district administrator, a business manager, and school principals and assistants to such persons.  The term of each employment contract may not exceed two years.  A contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each.</P>
<P>118.24(8): Personnel administrators and supervisors, curriculum administrators  and assistants to such administrative personnel, when employed by the school board of any school district to perform administrative duties only, may be employed for a term that does not exceed two years.  A contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each. . . .</P>
<P>It is clear that administrators covered under sections 118.24 (1) and 118.24  (8) must have employment contracts, whose terms may not exceed two years. However, any contract for a term of two years may provide for one or more extensions of one year each.  I construe such language to mean that those contracts having terms of two years may indeed be extended in increments of one year each, thereby obligating each party to such contracts for the duration of the two-year term and any oneyear extensions to the contracts.  Although the term of the contracts may not exceed two years, the one-year extensions can automaticallyand continuously roll year after year.</P>
<P>Please note that there are no qualifications or limitations on the number of successive contract extensions which may be entered into by the parties.  When the parties enter into a twoyear contract, successive extensions may be part and parcel of the original contract.  Additionally, such extensions may be entered into at any time during the pendency of the two-year contract.</P>
<P>Indeed, since the Act does not limit the number of two-year contracts a school board and administrator can enter into, one can legitimately argue that school boards may offer an administrator multiple twoyear contracts or one contract for a term of two years with multiple oneyear extensions.  In any event, the parties will be obligated to each other for the duration of the original contract and any other contracts or extensions entered into by the parties.</P>
<P>We have discussed these issues with numerous individuals directly involved in the legislative process and the drafting of the statutory language.  It is quite clear that a majority of the individuals believe that since a school board can enter into successive two-year contracts, it can enter into contracts for a term of two years, whose terms also include automatic extensions of one or more years.</P>
<P>This opinion is an initial analysis of the law, and is provided without the benefit of any court or state agency interpretation.  If and when such interpretations become available, all parties must carefully analyze the law in light of such interpretations. Finally, all parties should be aware that any changes made in administrator contracts should be reviewed by legal counsel in conjunction with applicable Board policies and individual administrators' employment contracts.</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Introduction</B>
</H2>
<H3><B>BUILDING UPON SUCCESS</B></H3>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial"><B><I></I></B></FONT>Historically, the people of Wisconsin have valued and invested in their public schools.  By any measure the State has had, and continues to have, a strong rate of return on this investment.  Despite not being among the top ten highest spending states, on per capita expenditures on public education, our students currently lead the nation in ACT scores, placement in advanced course work, and enjoy the best school to work initiative in the country.</P>
<P>The School Administrators Alliance aggressively supports an agenda aimed at building upon Wisconsin&#146;s national leadership in education.  In its entirety this agenda is aimed at enhancing student achievement, increasing efficiency, and achieving greater equity in educational opportunity.</P>
<P>The SAA Legislative Agenda for 1997-99 was established by the SAA&#146;s thirty-six member Legislative Committee and endorsed by each member associations&#146; Board of Directors&#146;.  The Agenda will guide Wisconsin&#146;s school leaders advocacy efforts for the two-year legislative session beginning in January 1997.</P>
<H3><B>The Alliance</B></H3>
<P>The School Administrators Alliance was founded in 1991 when the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators (WASDA) and the Association of Wisconsin School Administrators (AWSA) joined their advocacy efforts.  With the addition of the Wisconsin Association of School Business Officials (WASBO) in 1992 and the Wisconsin Council of Administrators of Special Services (WCASS) in 1994, the SAA has grown to represent  virtually every licensed school administrator in the State of Wisconsin.  This increasingly diverse membership provides a broad perspective and a deep understanding of educational issues.</P>
<P>The mission of the SAA is to represent the interests of children in Wisconsin.  The SAA advocates on behalf  of school leaders in their efforts to strengthen Wisconsin&#146;s national leadership in education to ensure that Wisconsin&#146;s children receive the highest quality education possible.</P>
<P ALIGN="center">&nbsp;</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Child Advocacy Statement</B></H2>
<P><I>O</I>ur children must be the most important concern in our country. If we focus on the child, everything else will fall in place. Educating every child is critical to the success, perhaps to the survival of this nation. Creating a quality education system requires a commitment by each community and neighborhood. The education of our children must be our first priority.</P>
<P>School administrators in Wisconsin are committed to serve as effective advocates for children. The School Administrators Alliance (SAA) was formed to represent the interests of children, and declares that its members will continually strive to enact laws which enhance the interests of children and oppose bills which harm them.</P>
<P>The SAA will support legislation which focuses on the following basic principles:</P>
<P> 1. The education of our children must be a primary purpose as well as the fundamental responsibility of the state. The state must adhere to its constitutional obligation to &quot;provide by law for the establishment of district schools, which shall be as nearly uniform as practicable&quot; and &quot;free and without charge for tuition to all eligible children .&#148;</P>
<P> 2. All children, regardless of ability to pay, deserve to receive an education that meets their needs and abilities.</P>
<P> 3. Coordination among school programs and community-based programs to help ensure that the total child receives the appropriate attention and  services.</P>
<P> 4. Active participation of parents in the education of their children, from birth to graduation.</P>
<P> 5. Standards must be established by which parents, communities, and public officials can determine the quality of education provided to our children and measure their performance.</P>
<P>Legislation that advances these  principles will strengthen Wisconsin as a national leader in public education.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Educational Belief Statements</B></H2>
<P><B>I. Educational Programs </B></P>
<P>WE BELIEVE that it is the right of all children to have access to effective instructional programs that provide learning opportunities based on their individual needs and promote lifelong learning.  THEREFORE, we hold that effective educational programs:</P>
<P> A. Are based on a fundamental partnership of the child, parent, teacher, administrator, business and industry; and local, state and federal governments;</P>
<P>B. Promote the use of  effective research-based educational practices; </P>
<P> C. Promote the cognitive, physical, and affective growth of the student;</P>
<P>D. Promote local community participation and support;</P>
<P> E. Are accountable in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, as determined by the achievement of identifiable standards;</P>
<P>F. Promote excellence through cooperation and diversity; and</P>
<P> G. Provide children with the resources and opportunities to develop skills appropriate for the challenges of the future;</P>
<P> H. Provide equitable access to emerging technologies for all students.</P>
<P><B>II. Finance and Facilities</B></P>
<P> WE BELIEVE that public education must be funded at a level sufficient to meet the needs of all children.   Therefore:</P>
<P>  A. We support maintaining funding of public education at a level sufficient to provide an effective and efficient state educational system.</P>
<P> B. Funding public education is a responsibility shared by local school districts, the state, and the federal government.</P>
<P> C. Primary responsibility for expenditure levels and accountability rests with local school  boards.</P>
<P>D.State aid should be distributed in a manner designed to support the state constitutional  principle of schools that are as &#147;uniform as practicable&#148;.</P>
<P>E.Any state program for funding general state aid in public schools should be equalizing, sum sufficient, fiscally progressive, and consistent with the philosophical intent of the state constitution.</P>
<P>  F. Wisconsin law should continue to require that the state share in the cost of debt service.</P>
<P> G. Public education funds must ensure support of public education programs only.</P>
<P>WE BELIEVE that all students must be afforded a safe and healthful learning environment which best supports the total educational program. THEREFORE,</P>
<P> H. Local, state, and federal governments must share the responsibility of providing quality public school facilities.</P>
<P>I. Local school facilities must be accessible to all people.</P>
<P> J. All students must be provided with a safe and healthful environment in which to learn.</P>
<P><B>III. School Governance</B></P>
<B></B>
<P>WE BELIEVE that the state's constitutional responsibility to provide free and public education must be accomplished by maximizing authority and accountability at the local public school district level. THEREFORE,</P>
<P> A. The state must reinforce local leadership by providing professional and technical assistance with flexible regulations.</P>
<P> B. State legislation must encourage and assist local school boards to initiate programs designed to improve the quality of education.</P>
<P> C.Local stakeholders must be encouraged to participate in the decision-making process..Effective school governance occurs when school boards establish school policy and support administrative teams in implementing those policies.IV. Support of Educational Leaders</P>
<P>WE BELIEVE that research on effective schools identifies school administrators as important determinants for quality educational programs and for implementing successful and effective schooling. The highly visible and often controversial roles and functions of school administrators place many pressures and demands at professional and personal levels. THEREFORE,</P>
<P> A. School administrators must be provided an equitable contract which includes compensation that is competitive and which provides benefits in addition to salary that are commensurate with their specific positions.</P>
<P> B. Professional training and licensing requirements, based on high standards of competency, must serve to ensure a high quality and ethical work force of school administrators.</P>
<P> C.  Support and fair treatment is critical to the retention of effective school administrators.</P>
<P> D. Within the educational system, emerging leaders should be identified and actively encouraged to pursue administrative roles.</P>
<P> E. Equal opportunity must be a guiding principle for staffing administrative positions.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>Legislative Position Statements</B></H2>
<P><B>I. Educational Programs</B></P>
<P>  A. Standards and Assessment</P>
<P>  We support clearly defined educational standards.  We support assessments which measure students&#146; success in meeting these standards.</P>
<P> B. Students Ready to Learn</P>
<P>  We support legislation assisting communities to develop a comprehensive system to implement strategies which meet local needs so that all students will start school ready to learn.</P>
<P> C. Early Intervention</P>
<P> We support legislation which assists school districts in implementing programs which will help all students leave the primary grades (K-2) with critical, developmentally appropriate skills.</P>
<P> D. Alternative Education Programs</P>
<P>  We support statutory and administrative rule provisions and funding which both encourage and allow school districts to develop and implement research based programs that effectively and efficiently address the needs of a diverse student population.</P>
<P> E. Staff Development Needs</P>
<P>  We support school improvement measures which place a high priority on staff development programs with emphasis in technology.</P>
<P> F. School to Work Transition</P>
<P>  We support further legislation and administrative rules designed to implement comprehensive school to work transition programs in Wisconsin. Local school districts should develop these programs in collaboration with federal and state agencies, educational institutions, and local businesses. Increased business involvement in school-to-work transition supported by tax credits for businesses which provide apprenticeships, job site coordination, and other tangible contributions to a coordinated school-to-work program.</P>
<P> G. Educational Technology</P>
<P>  We support legislation which enacts a comprehensive state technology plan which provides for the following.Technologies which  enable each student in every school district in the state to access  two-way full motion video/voice/data.  These technologies should be installed to the &#147;schoolhouse door&#148; at no cost to the district.</P>
<P>Broadband service to each Wisconsin school at affordable discounted rates. These should be equal for all schools, fixed at a flat cost, and  neither mileage nor usage sensitive.</P>
<P>Each school in the state the opportunity to effectively access  the superhighway to enhance student learning.  Incentives and resources should be dedicated to staff development, acquisition, installation, software, and maintenance of systems to assure all districts the opportunity to bring the power of technology to each student.</P>
<P>A technology network throughout the state that is mutually compatible to all users.  The system  design must be effectively integrated among members of the broader community including, but not limited to, all  PK-12 schools, the University of Wisconsin system, technical colleges, libraries, and all levels of  government plus their agencies.</P>
<P>A comprehensive state commitment guaranteeing  each student the opportunity to engage the  powers of technology to maximize  learning.</P>
<P> H. Alternative Post Secondary Policies</P>
<P> We support legislation which directs Wisconsin post-secondary educational institutions to develop and implement alternative admission policies which accommodate non-Carnegie unit entrance requirements.  Further, we support legislation directing the establishment of seamless academic programs between secondary schools and all Wisconsin post-secondary institutions.</P>
<P> I. Public School Choice </P>
<P>The SAA would support legislation on public school choice, or open enrollment, provided that the following conditions are included in the legislation in order to ensure fair and equitable implementation:</P>
<P>1. Incoming transfer students must bring revenue into the receiving districts which is at least equivalent to the per pupil cost of the receiving district, or the specific cost of educating an individual student, whichever is greater.</P>
<P>If the state aid which a sending district receives is not sufficient to meet the costs of a receiving district to serve any student, the difference must be paid from a state tuition fund.</P>
<P>There may be no direct or indirect transfers of local property tax dollars.</P>
<P>Applications from students wishing to transfer to other public school districts must be submitted to sending and receiving school districts by January 15, of the year prior to the anticipated transfer, and the receiving school district must either confirm or deny the transfer by August 1, of the same year. All transfers must remain in effect for one full school year.</P>
<P>5. Transferring students must meet the requirements for graduation, class rank, grade points, and scholarship eligibility for the receiving school.</P>
<P>6. Transportation costs must be paid by the state.</P>
<P>7. Children disadvantaged by economic, educational, or disabling (EEN) conditions may not be discriminated against.</P>
<P>8. Racial balance must not be adversely affected.</P>
<P>9. Resources must be provided to facilitate the development of cooperative efforts among schools that will increase opportunities for all students.</P>
<P>10. Transfers must not be approved which allow students to avoid pending disciplinary action.</P>
<P>11. Choice, or open enrollment, must be limited to public schools only.</P>
<P>12. Choice, or open enrollment, must be phased in over several years to lessen the impact on school districts and to provide time for planning and evaluation.</P>
<P>13. Resources must be provided for planning and staff development so that they have the capability to plan for needed staff, facility, and program changes.</P>
<P>14. Public funds should not be utilized for marketing purposes.</P>
<P>15. All special education functions must be carried out by the receiving district.</P>
<P>The receiving board of education shall have the sole authority in determining space available. (SAA Position Paper #1)</P>
<P><B>II. Finance and Facilities</B></P>
<P>A. REVENUE LIMITS</P>
<P>1. Institute a 15% hold harmless on the percent of revenue generating capacity a district experiencing a declining student population could lose in one year. </P>
<P> 2. Reinstate prior law (pre 1995 Act 27) in regard to school district transfer of  service requests.</P>
<P>3. Exclude revenues needed for the payment of debt service authorized by school district resolution from the limit only if all of the following applies:</P>
<P>The debt must be issued to repair or maintain existing facilities or build new school district facilities; and/or for the purchase, installation, and integration of technology into the curriculum.</P>
<P>&#149;The aggregate outstanding indebtedness of the school district incurred under this subdivision without a referendum shall not exceed the total of $500,000 per district plus $250 per student.</P>
<P> 4. Include summer school membership in calculating the 3-year average used in determining the revenue cap limit.</P>
<P>  5. Allow a district to capture unused levy authority from prior years.</P>
<P> 6. Give school boards the same authority as other governmental bodies to finance and construct facilities and that repeals the statutory provision which permits the filing of a petition for a referendum on a school board resolution to issue a general obligation promissory note.</P>
<P> 7. Repeal the recent mandate to go to referendum for all borrowing and would exempt borrowing from revenue cap controls.</P>
<P> 8. Retain revenue cap penalty funds for use in redistribution through general aid.</P>
<P> 9. We would support the following exemptions from the revenue caps:</P>
<P>Exempt districts whose prior year per pupil expenditure was below the  state average expenditure per pupil.</P>
<P> Exempt Fund 80 (Community Services).</P>
<P>Exempt costs incurred under the post-secondary options act and mandated options for children at risk.</P>
<P>Exempt any loss in revenue related to servicing  debt.</P>
<P>B. SCHOOL FUNDING:</P>
<P>1. MODIFICATIONS IN EQUALIZED AID FORMULA: &quot;95 IN 95&quot;</P>
<P>The equalized aid formula is an efficient and could be an equitable way to fund education in Wisconsin.  It does, however, need to be modified to meet the changing needs of education for the future.  With this in mind, we recommend the following changes:</P>
<P>00.0The DPI will list the equalized value per student for each school district in the state.  It will then rank order each district in the state from lowest to highest.  The department shall then add the number of students in each district beginning with the lowest value per student.  When the total number of students equals 95 percent of the students in the state, the district's value per student, in which that student resides, shall be the state primary guarantee.  We believe that this will provide more access to the tax base for participation in the formula.</P>
<P>The DPI shall list the shared cost per student for each school district in the state.  It will then rank order each district in the state from lowest to highest.  The department shall add the number of students in each district beginning with the lowest shared cost per student.  When the total number equals 95 percent of the students in the state, the district's shared cost per student, in which that student resides, shall be the state primary cost ceiling.  We believe that this will provide access to the formula for a larger number of students.</P>
<P>The secondary guarantee should be set at 95 percent of the state average valuation behind each student.  This would be calculated by the DPI exactly as it is currently, but using the multiplier of 95 percent instead of 106 percent.  This will provide a stronger penalty to those districts that exceed the primary cost ceiling than does current law.</P>
<P>These recommendations will provide the changes that are necessary to increase equability among districts while still meeting the criteria commonly employed by the courts, i.e., by</P>
<P>including 95 percent of the students and 95 percent of the tax base in the formula.  It also preserves the current formula, (which is not always easily understood) and will provide a stabilizing and comfort factor for school districts.</P>
<P>Union high school and K-8 districts are not included in this plan specifically and we prefer that the expertise of the DPI be utilized to determine by what means the suggested formula might provide equitable funding for them.</P>
<P>2. ELIMINATION OF OTHER DISEQUALIZING FACTORS:</P>
<P>The formula modifications listed will go a long way to provide equity in the equalized aid formula.  However, there are several other modifications that will need to be made to it to provide more equitable distribution of funds.<U>Eliminate minimum aids</U>.  We recognize, however, the need for property-rich income-poor districts to have some relief.  With that in mind, we recommend that homestead tax credits be increased to assist low income individuals located within these districts.</P>
<P><U>Eliminate special adjustment aids</U>.  Modifications in the base formula should remove any need for these adjustments.</P>
<P><U>Eliminate the levy credit</U> as this contributes to disequalizing the formula.  All funds associated with the levy credit program should be added to the equalized aid formula.</P>
<P>3. MODIFICATIONS OF CATEGORICAL AIDS</P>
<P>Currently, there are over 30 categorical aid programs identified and funded by the state.  The goal of the SAA is to simplify the equalized aid formula and removed disequalizing factors.  To accomplish this goal, the following recommendations are made regarding categorical aids:</P>
<P>Aid for programs for the handicapped should be funded at the level dictated by state statutes.  Continued reduction of special education funding creates animosity towards handicapped children's programs in local school districts.</P>
<P>Transportation, CHCEB, library aids, and tuition aid should be continued as currently in  place.</P>
<P>Other categorical programs should be funded through a category entitled Achievement Goals Program.  The SAA believes that accountability for students' performance must be an integral part of any school funding proposal.  We also recognize that students in lower income homes present challenges for educators to overcome because research indicates that low incomes inhibit students' achievement of state mandated goals.  With this in mind, we recommend a categorical program titled, &quot;The Achievement Goals Program&quot; which will distribute moneys to schools to develop special programs for low achieving students.  In order to allocate these funds, we propose that each school or district receive $2,000 per student who is eligible for free or reduced cost lunches.  These funds must be targeted for locally-developed programs for these students with special needs.</P>
<P>We also recommend that other current categorical aid programs be closely examined to see whether they can be folded into the Achievement Goals Program.  For instance, one categorical program which might be better served by inclusion is integration aid (Chapter 220).</P>
<P>Our recommended funding level of $2,000 per student, as identified by those eligible for free or reduced lunches, is based on the cost of the Success for All Program, which is identified for illustrative purposes only.  The Success for All Program was developed by Robert Slavin, of Johns Hopkins University, for schools with high concentrations of low income and minority students.  It includes preschool for four-year-olds, full-day kindergarten, one-on-one tutoring for students in grades one and two who are performing below grade level, a language development program, a problem solving-manipulative focused mathematics program, cooperative learning, peer tutoring, and a family liaison person reaching out to families and helping to coordinate social services.  The primary goal of the program is to have all students performing at grade level in reading and mathematics by the third grade.</P>
<P>4. RESOLUTION OF ADDITIONAL DISPARITIES:</P>
<P>The following issues are identified as needing further discussion and resolution:</P>
<P> &#149; The financial impact on school districts providing services to children who are severely/profoundly handicapped.  A formula must be developed to address these extremely high costs.  A recommendation related to this problem will be forthcoming from the Council of Administrators of Special Education.</P>
<P> &#149; Integration Aid under Chapter 220.  It has been recommended that support for the program be removed from the equalized aid formula.  Whether the program should be funded most appropriately as a categorical aid or under the achievement goals program, is yet to be determined.  There is no question regarding the need to support children eligible for the 220 program, it is only a question of where the financial support is budgeted.</P>
<P> &#149; Current revenue caps present a problem to those districts who tax at a high level and have low school expenditures.  Under current law, it is not possible for those districts to increase their spending per pupil; in fact, the disparity between low spending and high spending districts can be expected to increase.  It is recommended that exemptions to the current revenue caps be considered for those districts who are classified as low spending (lower quartile).  A formula for controlling the extent of the exemption would have to be developed.</P>
<P>&#149; The question of accountability received considerable discussion from the planning group.  Participants are unanimous in recognizing the need for accountability as part of any school funding proposal.  However, the development of an accountability system must be prefaced by a more complete definition of the primary educational program the state will finance.  It is time to review the specifics of that primary program in light of the educational changes that have occurred during the past 20 years (SAA Position Paper #2).5. EEN FUNDING:</P>
<P>We support legislation which will establish a fixed percentage of expenditures which determines the pool of money available for the support of educating EEN students.</P>
<P>We support greater flexibility in programming for EEN children at the local level.</P>
<H2 ALIGN="center"><B>School Governance</B></H2>
<P>A. Mediation/Arbitration</P>
<P>The State should maintain the mediation/arbitration process which was in place prior to July 1, 1993 with the following modifications:</P>
<P> 1. Incorporate appropriate timelines that prevent school districts from competing with each other and which fit the districts' budget cycle in a more timely manner.</P>
<P> 2. Eliminate the ability to select a state-provided arbitrator unless mutually agreed to by  both parties to a labor dispute.</P>
<P> 3. Allow for local arbitration as an option.</P>
<P> 4. Require all school districts to use a standard costing procedure.</P>
<P> 5. Assign weighted consideration for statutory arbitration criteria.</P>
<P> 6. Unless otherwise stipulated by both parties, any modifications in working conditions for which costs can be determined, shall be included as part of the compensation package for the year the costs become an obligation of the school district.</P>
<P> 7. Establish criteria within Wisconsin statutes for arbitrating non-monetary language items.</P>
<P> 8. Define more clearly what are mandatory, permissive and prohibited subjects of bargaining.</P>
<P> 9. Restrict the identity of comparables for non-credited employee units to the immediate labor pool from which the district's employees will come.</P>
<P> 10. Preclude districts from naming a particular vendor in a labor contract.</P>
<P> 11. Require that the arbitrator be precluded from attempting any kind of mediation of a labor dispute for which he/she has also been asked to render an arbitration decision (SAA Position Paper 3).</P>
<P>B. Compensation Caps</P>
<P>The School Administrators Alliance opposes compensation caps for any public sector employee (SAA Position Paper 5).</P>
<P>C. Compulsory Education</P>
<P>The SAA believes in compulsory school attendance until age 18, with an option for school boards to provide alternative educational opportunities for children beginning at the age of 17.  School boards should be allowed to enter into agreements with youths and parents in this age group who have a full time job or other opportunity available and want to take a temporary leave-of-absence from school.  The student, his or  her parent(s), and the school board should have the flexibility to agree on ways for the student to continue his or her education toward receiving a high school diploma at a later time.</P>
<P>D. Residency Requirements  </P>
<P>We support legislation which clarifies the student residency laws of the state with respect to such situations as joint custody settlements, emancipated minors, aliens, married minors, and minors who are living with non-custodial relatives or adult friends.</P>
<P>E. Collection of Prescribed Statutory Data</P>
<P>We support legislation that provides for a state-wide data collection system to gather prescribed statutory data in a uniform, non-duplicative manner.  This system should create a state data base that can be conveniently used by all state and local governmental agencies.</P>
<P>F. Cooperative Educational Service Agencies (CESA&#146;s) </P>
<P>We support efforts to remove barriers for CESA&#146;s to allow them to maximize inter-agency collaboration, provide for equal educational opportunities, and encourage the innovative sharing of human resources and technology.</P>
<P>G. Pay-for-Performance </P>
<P>We oppose mandated pay-for-performance programs for public school employees.  (SAA Position Paper 4)</P>
<P>H. Recall Elections</P>
<P>We support an amendment to SS 9.10 (2)(b) that will limit recall petitions for a city, village, town or school district office to cause related to malfeasance or conduct that is deemed to be a breech of the ethical or moral standards of the community.</P>
<P>I. Establishment of School Calendar</P>
<P>We support legislation which makes the school calendar a prohibitive subject of bargaining.</P>
<P>J. Home-Based Instruction</P>
<P>We support legislation which requires home-based private educational programs to provide information to the department of public instruction regarding attendance, curriculum, enrollment, testing, and children with exceptional needs.</P>
<P>K. Site-Based Management</P>
<P>We support site-based management efforts as defined by local school districts.</P>
<P>L. Truancy</P>
<P>We support legislation that creates a model for collaboration among schools, social service agencies, community-based organizations, health services, juvenile justice, youth employment, child care, and other appropriate public and private agencies.  Elements of this legislation must include a) an elimination of unnecessary and frequently destructive duplication of services, b) a system for cross-agency sharing and use of relevant information about youth and families placed at risk because of economic or environmental circumstances, and c) regular case-specific exchanges of information among appropriate personnel. </P>
<P>M. School Consolidation </P>
<P>We support legislation that provides additional monetary incentives for those school districts that are voluntarily consolidating.</P>
<P>N. Family and Medical Leave</P>
<P>We support legislation which aligns the Wisconsin family and medical leave law with the similar federal law.</P>
<P>O. State Department of Public Instruction</P>
<P>We support legislation which provides DPI with adequate funding to meet its constitutional and statutory obligations.  We also support efforts to balance the department&#146;s regulatory and support roles.</P>
<P>P. Charter Schools:</P>
<P>We support current charter school law.  We recommend local school districts be allowed the same consideration as charter schools.</P>
<P>Q. Discipline/Order/Safety</P>
<P>Legislation initiated to combat school violence should be balanced on three components: Prevention, Intervention, and Suppression.</P>
<P>Legislation should encourage communities (parents, students, educators, and the public, non-profit and private sector) to work together, share resources, and assume responsibility for ensuring that our children do not become victims of violence (SAA Position Paper #6).</P>
<P>Support of Educational Leaders</P>
<P>A. Administrator Contracts</P>
<P> We support legislation which would allow local school boards the discretion to award continuous contracts beyond the length of time in current law to licensed administrators.</P>
<P>We support legislation that allows local school boards the flexibility to establish administrative contracts at a level that will retain and promote the highest quality administrators.</P>
<P>B. Contract Renewal</P>
<P>We support legislation that requires that administrators be provided with a fair and equitable contract nonrenewel procedure that addresses the following criteria: (SAA Position Paper #7)</P>
<P>1.  NOTICE</P>
<P>2.  REASONABLE RULE OR ORDER</P>
<P>3.  INVESTIGATION</P>
<P>4.  FAIR INVESTIGATION</P>
<P>5.  PROOF</P>
<P>6.  EQUAL TREATMENT</P>
<P>C. Benefits </P>
<P>We support legislation that maintains, as a minimum, those administrator contract benefits gained through previous contracts unless by mutual agreement..</P>
<P>D. Retirement </P>
<P>We support legislation which provides a permanent &quot;rule of 85&quot; in order to qualify for full retirement benefits from the state teachers retirement system.</P>
<P>We support legislation which enforces the IRS non-discrimination rules for the multiplier (i.e. 2.0 for all).</P>
<P>We support legislation which provides for the inclusion of medical insurance benefits within the state teachers retirement system.</P>
<P>E. Professional Development </P>
<P>We support legislation that provides on-going financial resources for continuous administrative training.</P>
<P>F. Professional Standards</P>
<P>We oppose legislation which removes the current requirement that all school administrators, except for school business administrators, have at least three years of successful teaching experience or its equivalent in order to qualify for an administrator license. </P>
<P>We support the establishment of an alternative educational process that allows individuals to acquire the proficiencies needed to be licensed as an administrator.</P>
<P>We support legislation that requires appropriate licensure for all educational administrator positions.</P>

In addition, copies of SAA position papers containing background information regarding SAA proposals on revenue limits (declining enrollment, technology and capital improvements, and transfer of service requests) and instructional technology (affordable/equitable access, investments in infrastructure, and facilitation of consulting, training, information services), and attracting quality candidates into administration, are also available by contacting the Alliance.</P>
<P><B>SAA Legislative Committee Re-Cap</B></P>
<P>The SAA Legislative Committee met in Stevens Point on December 13, 1996.  The committee:</P>
<P>&#254;Voted to begin the process for endorsing a candidate for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thus, the Legislative Committee will interview the two candidates that emerge from the primary on February 18.  After this interview, the committee make a recommendation and forward to each member association&#146;s board of directors.  If each of the four member association boards of directors approves the Legislative Committees&#146; recommendation, the SAA will make a public endorsement.</P>
<P>&#254; Communicated serious concerns regarding DPI's plan to set proficiency standards based on the Terra Nova tests that were administered for the first time this fall.  Concerns included test validity, administration, scoring, and curricular alignment.</P>
<P><B>NOTE:</B>  State Supt. John Benson announced at the SAA's candidates forum on December 19 that the DPI would not set proficiency standards based on the results of these first-year tests.</P>
<P>&#254;The Committee also recommends the SAA advocate the following:</P>
<P>&#254;Lengthen the number of years required to re-bid the contract for the State&#146;s knowledge and concept examinations from once every 3 years to once every 10 years.  In addition, require that those tests be based on grade-by-grade standard competencies.</P>
<P>&#254;Reinstate school districts' ability to waive the performance and payment bonding requirement. And/or raise current $500 threshold for the performance/payment bond requirement to no less than $50,000.</P>
<P>&#254;Directed staff to form committee to outline administrators' positions on current and future educational standard and assessment issues.</P>
<P><B>SAA ACTION SURVEY</B></P>
<P>Thank you!  213 of you have returned your SAA Action Survey.  This information is key to the SAA achieving its goal of becoming the most effective and respected grass roots lobbying organization in Wisconsin.</P>
<P><B>SAA COMMITTEES ON SCHOOL FINANCE AND RETIREMENT BEGIN WORK IN </B><B>DECEMBER</B></P>
<P> The SAA Committee on School Finance met for the first time in December.  WASDA is represented by Superintendent Gene Hamele of Waunakee who chairs the committee and Bob Kattman of Glendale-River Hills and Tony Kujawa of Baraboo.  The committee&#146;s charge is to bring the current SAA school funding proposal up-to-date, and to ensure that the school administrators who serve on the Legislative Council Committee on School Finance have the most beneficial impact on the process that is possible.</P>
<P> SAA Committee on Retirement met for the first time in December.  WASDA is represented by Superintendent Lee Siudzinski of Kaukauna on the committee.  The committee&#146;s charge is to review the SAA legislative positions on retirement issues; and discuss what retirement policy issues that SAA should focus on in this legislative session.</P>

Raising a child is one of the special joys of life.  Unfortunately, nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession.
<P>
The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) is a world renown surrogate parenting and egg donation program located in Beverly Hills, California.  CSP was established because we strongly believe that couples who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity.  Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to meet that need.  Unlike some alternative methods of creating a family, the surrogacy process allows a child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In-Vitro Fertilization) both parents.  It also gives the couple the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself.  And finally, since their child is conceived only because of their own existence, the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the couple.

<H3>Become a Surrogate Mother and help create a family for an infertile couple.
</H3><P>For many couples, surrogacy is a last hope to have a child.
<P>Being a surrogate mother offers a woman a chance to share the joy of
parenthood, experience pregnancy again, do something that makes a difference,
and changes the lives of the couple she chooses.
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) offers
an "Open" Program in which you choose and meet your couple. You are in contact
with them throughout the pregnancy, and will remain so after the birth with
pictures, letters, etc.
<P>CSP provides coordination of all aspects of the surrogacy arrangement.
Our goal is to provide care, protection and guidance to each person involved
in the experience. This includes having a counselor assigned to your case
during and after your participation in the program, and providing monthly
support group meetings where you will meet with other surrogate mothers.
<P>To quote a recent Surrogate Mother:
<BLOCKQUOTE><I>Seeing the couple's faces light up when their baby was born,
I know I gave someone such a precious gift of a lifetime. The Mom is always
telling me I'm her guardian angel. I hope other Surrogates accomplish the
same satisfaction I did</I>.

<H4><CENTER>A 40-minute video explaining the Hows and Whys of Surrogate
Parenting</CENTER><BR><CENTER>VHS Format<BR>US $17.00 plus shipping and
handling</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation, Inc. has long been
helping infertile couples create families since 1980, and with our assistance
hundreds of long awaited babies have been born to some very thankful parents.
&#160;The staff at the Center believes that educating people about surrogacy
is one of their most important responsibilities. &#160;However, many people
who are considering this option have difficulty envisioning the type of women
who become surrogate mothers. &#160;In addition, couples may also be curious
about other couples' experiences with surrogacy.
<P>In <B>Creating Your Family </B>you will meet seven surrogate mothers as
well as two couples whose children were born with the assistance of surrogate
mothers. &#160;They will answer questions that most couples have about surrogacy,
in addition to some questions that no one thinks to ask. &#160;You will be
guided through the surrogate parenting process that has been so grossly
misrepresented in the media. &#160;Most importantly, you will be introduced
to the human factor of this process that is so often clouded with statistics
and legalese.
<P>Some of the topics covered in the video include:<BR>
<UL><LI>What motivates a woman to be a surrogate?<BR>
<LI>What motivates infertile couples to ask a surrogate for help?<BR>
<LI>Why group support meetings for the surrogate are important.<BR>
<LI>The role of the counselor in the process.<BR>
<LI>How couples and surrogates choose each other.<BR>
<LI>The role of the doctor, lawyer, and other professionals.<BR>
<LI>The first meeting between a couple and their surrogate.<BR>
<LI>How surrogate mothers tell their children about surrogacy.<BR>
<LI>What happens at the time of delivery.<BR>
<LI>The relationship between Surrogate mothers and couples after their baby
is born.<BR>
<LI>What do parents tell their child about this special birth.

Raising a child is one of the special joys of life.  Unfortunately, nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession.
<P>
The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) is a world renown surrogate parenting and egg donation program located in Beverly Hills, California.  CSP was established because we strongly believe that couples who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity.  Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to meet that need.  Unlike some alternative methods of creating a family, the surrogacy process allows a child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In-Vitro Fertilization) both parents.  It also gives the couple the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself.  And finally, since their child is conceived only because of their own existence, the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the couple.

The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), offers an organized, comprehensive program, which includes advertising, administration as well as coordination of psychological, legal and medical services.  We are proud to offer an "open" program where the couple and surrogate choose each other, then meet one another prior to determining if this is the surrogate they would like to work with.  The counselor is present at the meeting to assist with overcoming any initial uneasiness in meeting someone for the first time and more importantly can direct the conversation as well as encourage the discussion of important issues.
<P>
CSP has been practicing surrogate parenting for 16 years.  We have had over 427 births, and have <b>never</b> had an Surrogate Mother change her mind.  This is due to our strict screening process.  Our statistics show that only 1 in 20 Surrogate Mother Applicants are accepted.  CSP has very strict requirements as to who we accept into our program.  We are assisted by 4 full-time counselors who specialize in field of surrogacy and egg donation, and provide psychological screening and ongoing support for the surrogate mothers and egg donors throughout the process and as long thereafter as she desires.  
<P>
The typical surrogate mother profile is a woman of fertile age, between 21 and 34, who has children of her own and presently acting as a parent to those children, and has a good medical and pregnancy history. She is a responsible and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile couple have a child of their own.  Other criteria for participation in our program include her intelligence, stability and sense of self fulfillment.  She understands that the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the intended parents.

<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation offers to both donors
and recipients an organized, comprehensive egg donor program, which includes
advertising, administration as well as the coordination of psychological,
legal and medical services. Our egg donors are specifically solicited,
psychologically counseled, medically evaluated, provided with legal counsel
and matched with the intended parents.
<P>We at the Center are proud to offer an "open" egg donor program where
participating couples and egg donors have the opportunity of meeting one
another. The intended parents have the opportunity to know the woman they
have chosen as their egg donor. They can find out about her history, her
likes and dislikes, her personality, etc. The donor they have chosen
is presented with some information about the recipient couple.
<P>We encourage Recipient Couples and Egg Donors to meet one another. The
goal of the egg donation process is two fold. It enables women who can carry
a pregnancy but cannot produce viable eggs to conceive through the In Vitro
Fertilization process (IVF) and bear a child. It allows fertile women the
incredible opportunity to help childless couples have the child they have
yearned for. <B>The Center has been very successful in advertising for egg donors; as of December 1995 we have over 150 profiles of women hoping to be chosen by
a recipient couple.</b>
<P>In recent years there have been two major advances in reproductive technology
that make use of donor eggs a viable option for women who would not otherwise
be able to have a child. The first advance has been the introduction of
ultrasound guided transvaginal (non-surgical) recovery of donor eggs. This
is an outpatient procedure requiring sedation. Laparoscopy and general anesthesia
are not required. The second advance is the success in cryopreservation
(freezing) of in vitro fertilized embryos. Typically, donor and recipient's
cycles are synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus
optimize the chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessary
for a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle,
thus making the procedure more cost effective.
<P>In the last five years, the use of in vitro fertilized donor eggs has
been widely accepted with resulting births to our couples who live in many
countries including Australia, England, Israel, and the United States.
<P>Our 15 year history with screening potential candidates, administrating
and coordinating of third party arrangements has provided us with the necessary
experience to make successful and appropriate matches between donors and
recipients. The typical egg donor profile is a woman of fertile age, between
21 and 34, who is a mother with a good medical history. She is a responsible
and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile
couple have a child.

<H2><CENTER>The Need for Psychological and Legal Counseling</CENTER>
</H2><P>Unlike any other alternative method of creating a family, the surrogate
process allows a child to be biologically related to one, or in the case
of embryo transplant, both parents. It also gives the couple the opportunity
to become involved and experience the pregnancy itself. Also, it allows the
couple some control over the ultimate genetic makeup of their child. Having
a child with the help of a surrogate mother can be an exciting and fulfilling
way to experience the joy of parenthood.
<P>Women have varied motivations in their decisions to be surrogate mothers
and egg donors. (Many times this motivation is more instinctive as in "I
am helping someone who desperately wants a baby", or hard to articulate.)
The potential psychological and emotional harm to the surrogate mother or
egg donor and her family is a risk that no couple should ask her to take
until she is fully informed.
<P>Every surrogate mother and egg donor needs a private session with an expert
counselor in the field to enable her to discuss all parameters of surrogacy
and egg donation. She must understand that there will be a child "out there"
that she has carried or help create and yet she will not be considered the
mother. If she participated in the Artificial Insemination (AI) program,
the child so conceived will have a genetic connection to her. Only with fully
informed consent can a surrogate mother or egg donor make a healthy decision
that she can participate and fulfill the obligations of being a surrogate
mother. The desire to assist a childless couple must be approached with full
information and careful consideration.
<P>It is important that the surrogate mother or egg donor meets and talks
to other surrogate mothers or egg donors. During group support meetings,
(held under the guidance of the counselor), surrogate mothers and egg donors
meet other surrogate mothers and egg donors who are in all stages of the
program. Some in the group may be on medication and others may already have
given birth. Through exposure to all stages, the surrogate mother and egg
donor can finally decide if participation is safe for her.
<P><A HREF=Hillbio.html>Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D.</A>, <a href="WhosWho.html#Carol">Carol Wolfe, MFCC</a>, <a href="WhosWho.html#Donna">Donna Robertson, LCSW</a> and <a href="Gordbio.html">Elaine Gordon, PhD</a>, and The Law Offices of Vorzimer, Garber, Masserman &amp; Ecoff, offer a four hour legal and psychological orientation for couples who have their own potential surrogate mother or egg donor. This includes a private session with the counselor to discuss the psychological aspects of surrogacy and egg donation, thereafter they meet with the attorney, whose practice emphasizes this field of law, to discuss the legal ramifications and finalize parental rights. Surrogate mothers and egg donors need to seek independent legal counsel.
<P>Some important issues for discussion during psychological and legal consult
for surrogate mothers: compensation, birth defects, abortion, lost wages
due to complications of pregnancy, guardianship of child in event couple
dies before the birth, death of surrogate while pregnant, financial
accountability for medical bills, insurance coverage and potential denial
of insurance coverage, multiple fetus development and selective termination,
contact during pregnancy and after birth, and effects on all the children
involved. It is important that these issues are discussed in depth and each
party understands the other's feelings, liabilities, duties and responsibilities.

<center><HR WIDTH=560></center>
</H2><P>                 


<H3>Is CSP more expensive than other programs?
</H3><P>No, not if you compare apples with apples. Here is why. Our program
is comprehensive. Please note all the services we offer and compare us with
other agencies. We have a full support staff of eight, including medical
coordinator, surrogate coordinator, and trust administrator, among others.
In addition, our team consists of a psychological group of four experienced
counselors, and an experienced law firm we are associated with. We are affiliated
with the finest medical groups currently practicing in the field of infertility.
<P>We also state all costs. Our estimate anticipates all of your expenses,
instead of giving you an initial low fee which excludes many expenses you
will later be asked to pay. If other agencies gave you the same service we
do, their costs would probably be greater than ours. Our fee is $15,800.00.
The remainder of the costs are medical, psychological, legal and surrogate
fees. Please note most of these costs are incurred no matter what program
you select.
<P>We offer over sixteen years of experience in this field with a sterling record of success. The Center offers the most comprehensive program available. We
are proud to provide you with the experience and track record that is simply
not available with other agencies or programs. Ask questions. Compare the
programs! The more information you have, the better informed you will be
to make the appropriate choice for you.
<P>
<H3>Do you have a waiting list to be matched with a Surrogate?
</H3><P>Yes, and that is the good news!
<P>Only a small percentage (about 5%) of potential surrogate mother applicants
are accepted into our program. It takes approximately four months to fully
screen a surrogate candidate before she is able to be matched with a couple.
We are very particular in our selection process. When you are matched with
a surrogate, she will have already been thoroughly screened. You meet your
surrogate only after she has undergone medical evaluations, psychological
screening and testing, criminal background check, insurance evaluation, etc.
<P>Our philosophy is simple. You have waited a long time to come to this
point. A wait of several months for the best surrogate working with the best
program seems reasonable to us and our more than four hundred clients during
the past sixteen years.
<P>
<H3>Do we need to come in for a full consultation?
</H3><P>Yes. We believe this decision is so important, you must have full
informed consent and knowledge of our program before joining us. The only
way we know how to accomplish this is for you to spend four to six hours
at our Center, meeting with our entire staff, a member of the psychological
team and an attorney experienced in the field of surrogacy. There is a lot
of information given at this meeting, and at its end, you will have a very
comprehensive view of all aspects of surrogacy; psychological, legal,
administrative and procedural.
<P>In this complex and emotional partnership, it is also important that prior
to our working together over the next eighteen months to two years, we get
to know you and you get to know all of us. A little familiarity breeds a
lot of comfort when it comes to surrogacy. If you think there's any obligation
in coming to our consultation, let us reassure you we never allow couples
to join our program at the consultation. Even our overseas couples must go
home and digest all of this information prior to making any decision.
<P>
<H3>Do you have a waiting list for Egg Donation?
</H3><P>No. Our Egg Donor program has a surplus of Egg Donors for several
reasons. First, many of our Egg Donors are former surrogates who want to
continue to help couples, yet do not wish to enter into another surrogacy
arrangement (remember, that's a two year commitment!). So, we have a number
of screened, terrific women who are Egg Donor candidates.
<P>Also, the number of women who wish to be Egg Donors is vastly greater
than the number of women applying to be surrogates. So we find ourselves
with an abundance of Egg Donors as opposed to the usual, chronic "shortage"
of surrogate mothers.
<P>
Finally, our Egg Donor program is fairly small and is used primarily as an adjunct to physician's Egg Donor programs (Egg donor programs at a Doctor's office is usually run like a sperm donor program with "closed", anonymous matches). Our Egg Donor program is "open", much like our surrogacy program.   Open referrs to a range of contact possibilities:  you can meet one another face to face;  you can talk on the phone; you can write a note to your egg donor thanking her for her assistance;  you can send her flowers after the transfer as a thank you;  you release only your first names, etc.  In our program we have found that many parties have elected to meet one another with the counselor present.  This enables our Intended Parents to ask questions and get a better understanding of who their donor is.   The totally anonymous situation is rare in our organization.
<P>We are experts at matching specific Egg Donors for specific couples. Our
clients find that our experience in screening and matching women to help
infertile couples is simply unparalleled by any group, much less a medical
group where the emphasis is on the medical procedures not the matching process.
<P>
<H3>Do we get more personal service with a "small" program than with the
Center for Surrogate Parenting?
</H3>
<P>
No, you don't!  Our staff is very available.  After office hours, there are emergency numbers to call anytime to reach one of our staff members or one of the psychological team members assigned personally to you.  We have a staff of eight trained members, as well as being associated with five counselors and an attorney's office, we are able to share the responsibilities and utelize the strengths each staff member or associate has.  With tasks being shared between everyone, we all have time to deal with each issue and pay attention to each and every client.
<P>
Our organization is staffed with real professionals working together to help our couples create their families.  We are a multidisciplinary team of counselors, lawyers, physicians and administrators, and after sixteen years, we know what our clients need; communication, dedication and real commitment to our couples and surrogates.
<P>
To quote one of our couples from a March 9, 1995, letter to our Center:
<P>
<b>"Your staff was wonderful.  Whenever we called (and we did frequently) the response was immediate.  Words can never express our appreciation to you and your staff.  Please know we will be thankful that your center exists and if ever you need someone for references we are available."</b>


<P>

<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation offers an organized,
comprehensive program, which includes advertising, administration as well
as coordination of psychological, legal and medical services. Our surrogates
are specifically solicited, psychologically and medically screened, provided
with legal counsel and matched with the intended parents. We are proud to
offer an "open" program where the surrogate chooses her couple, then they
will meet one another prior to determining if this is the couple she would
like to work with. The Surrogate has the opportunity of finding out in person
about the couple's history, their likes and dislikes, their personality,
etc. The counselor is present at the meeting to assist with overcoming any
initial uneasiness in meeting someone for the first time and more importantly
can direct the conversation as well as encourage the discussion of important
issues.
<P>The Surrogacy process provides fertile women with the opportunity to help
childless couples create their families. They can share the joy of parenthood,
experience pregnancy again, and feel fulfilled knowing that they made someone's
dream come true.
<P>There are two surrogate programs, and deciding which is right for you
is an individual decision.
<P>
<UL><LI>Artificial Insemination Program - the Surrogate mother's egg is used
and she is artificially inseminated at an infertility clinic with a very
simple medical procedure.<BR>
<LI>In-Vitro Fertilization Program - This program is more complex. The couple
will create embryos using their own eggs and semen, then transfer the embryos
to the Surrogate Mother. Typically, the Couple and Surrogate's cycles are
synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus optimize
the chance of a conception. When there are more embryos than necessary for
a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle,
thus making the procedure more cost effective.
</UL><P>In both programs, an Infertility Specialist will oversee the case
until 6-8 weeks after confirmation, then release the Surrogate Mother to
the care of her own OB/GYN and local hospital.

<H2>Are you a potential surrogate?</H2>
Our 15 year history with screening potential candidates, administrating
and coordinating of third party arrangements has provided us with the necessary
experience to make successful and appropriate matches between donors and
recipients. The typical surrogate profile is a woman of fertile age, between
21 and 34, who is a mother with a good medical history. She is a responsible
and empathetic woman who looks forward to the experience of helping an infertile
couple have a child.
<P>We only work with women who have known fertility and are raising the child.
It is easier for a surrogate mother not to bond with the child carried for
the adopting couple, if she can go back to the stability of her own family
<P>We do not allow women on welfare or AFDC to be surrogate mothers for the
Center. We feel it is not to their families' benefit to be dependent upon
the money with which the surrogate mother's time is compensated.
<P>It is difficult to put a price on the gift of a family. In particular
lawsuits, the judicial system is asked to determine reasonable compensation
for the loss of limb, physical function and sometimes even of a life. Breaking
down the compensation given to a surrogate mother, approximately $1.50 an
hour, is a small token of gratitude for the gift of life and family.
<P>Women who become surrogate mothers do so because they love their own children
and cannot imagine a world without them. These fertile women have a deep
compassion for infertile couples. For most of these women, being pregnant
was an easy and enjoyable experience.
<P>It is difficult for people who have never experienced infertility to
understand the desperateness by which the infertile couple's life becomes
consumed. The need is great for a professional organization, such as the
Center of Surrogate Parenting, to be available to guide all the parties involved
through the important practical issues of the highly emotional situation.
<P>The Center is dedicated to making the process of surrogate parenting positive
in all ways for both the prospective parents and surrogate mother, and their
families.
<P>If a husband is not supportive, or a potential surrogate's child becomes
frightened by the idea of "Mommy giving the baby to someone else", or there
is discomfort in the experience and uncertainty about the idea, the Center
declines the prospective surrogate mother's application. The process of surrogate
parenting is not for everyone, no matter how caring and sincere a woman may
be.
<P>If a prospective couple is unable to understand the philosophical and
psychological motivation of the surrogate parenting process, the Center will
let them know that they are not appropriate for the program. The surrogate
mother, whether traditional or gestational, is giving a great gift to the
infertile couple.
<P>The Center provides very careful medical, psychological and criminal screening
on all parties involved. Requirements include attendance at surrogate mother
support groups, which are provided once a month in the Los Angeles, Orange
County and San Francisco areas.

<H2><CENTER>Why I Wanted to Help Your Mom &amp; Dad</CENTER>
</H2><P>
<H3>Dear Katie:
</H3><P>In less than a week you will see the world for the first time, feel
the touch of your parents, and journey to the comfort and safety of your
own home. I find myself wanting to write to you now, while I still feel your
life inside of me. It is hard to put into words what I am feeling and what
I'd like you to know about me. I guess a good place to start is at the beginning,
and I why I wanted to help your mom and dad have a baby in the first place.
<P>Before I had Ryan and Karen, I knew I wanted to have children. I wanted
children born out of the love between my husband and I. I used to wonder
what I would have done if I tried and tried, but was unable to have children.
I'm sure I would feel a deep void in my life ...an emptiness which could
not be filled. Fortunately for me, I was able to have children easily. Ryan
and Karen have filled my life with joy and given me a feeling of fulfillment
which goes beyond words.
<P>When I heard about how hard your mom and dad had been trying to have a
baby, and saw how sad and lonely they were that they couldn't, I knew I wanted
to help them so they could experience the happiness that I have enjoyed with
my own children. Even though pregnancy is not all fun and games, I enjoy
being pregnant ...feeling a life grow inside of me.
<P>Twice we tried and nothing happened. On the third try, you beat the odds!
I'll never forget telling your mom, "So are you ready to be a mommy?" She
couldn't believe it. I said, "I'm not kidding, we're pregnant!" Then she
cried.
<P>Ryan and Karen have handled my pregnancy with you well. Ryan couldn't
wait to pick out a gift for you and always reminded me to play your musical
bear to you everyday. Although he was excited about seeing you, he pointed
out that he'll be happy when your born because then I can go in the jacuzzi
with him again. Karen loved to talk to you. She would see other pregnant
women and say "I wonder whose baby that is?." I know you will always be special
to her. Ray has been a wonderful husband through my aches, pains and mood
swings. He never really understood why I wanted to be pregnant again, but
he supported me all the way and is happy to be helping your mom and dad have
a family.
<P>Having you grow inside me has been a wonderful, amazing experience. Helping
your parents bring a new life into the world has brought me much happiness
and satisfaction. I want you to know that I have very special feelings towards
you. Despite these feelings, there was never any doubt in my mind that you
belonged to your parents. There will always be a special place for you in
my heart. I will feel a loss when you go home, but I will also feel great
knowing I've helped your parents have the child they've always wanted. I
know you will be loved and cherished as much as any baby could possibly be.
My only wish is that your life be a happy one - full of love and joy and
fulfillment.
<P>

<H3><CENTER>A LOVE LETTER</CENTER>
</H3>
<B>Dear Julia,</B>
<P>By now, you know me pretty well. And you know that I can write on
just about any subject. But I feel as though there are no words to express
what you have done for me and Gregory. Jamie is a miracle if ever there was
one. He is the baby of my heart. The one I've always wanted and imagined.
But, he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
<P>One year ago, I couldn't even look at a pregnant woman without feeling
pain. I couldn't look into the window of a nursery furniture store or a baby
clothiers store without wondering what I could have done to deserve such
punishment.
<P>Every time there was a story about an infant abandoned or abused, I wanted
to take that child and make it my own. I couldn't understand why someone
who had been so blessed could abuse that privilege.
<P>Now, after eight years of waiting, I am actually somebody's mommy. You
can't imagine what it feels like to write those words. Every little thing
Jamie does is so precious to me.
<P>You gave what so few have the power to give. Not just an egg and a uterus.
The care and concern for others to make being a surrogate mother worthwhile.
How many people have the ability to make someone else's dream come true?
That's just what you've been able to do. And you've done it with such openness,
such selflessness, such pride. I hope that Jamie will inherit a little of
that from you.
<P>Julia, I hope that you realize that with your strength, and your positive
attitude, you can do anything you set your mind to. I hope this experience
has proven that to you.
<P>Soon, you will start a new life in Idaho. I know that you and Ken will
make it a fantastic success. I see your children, Alex and Seth, growing
up in an atmosphere of wonderful values and plenty of love. They can't help
but be successes, too.
<P>I know, too, that we will not continue to be as close as we've been. And
that's probably only natural. But understand that I will be thinking of you.
Jamie will know who you are as soon as he is old enough to understand. And
he will be taught to love and respect you. Of course we'll keep in touch
and keep you informed of his progress. And I hope you will let me know what
is new and exciting in your life, too.
<P>It's obvious how many people in your life think you are terrific and special.
But, with the exception of Ken and the boys, no one will really know the
full extent of what you have done the way Gregory and I do.
<P>I don't know if I could feel any closer to you. Not if we were sisters.
You've changed my life for the better and in the process I can see the positive
things you've done for yourself.
<P>No matter what else happens in the rest of your life, you have already
done more to prove you are a caring person than most people will ever be
able to do. And I have the baby to prove it.
<P>I love you, Julia. And, I always will.
<P>

<B><I>FINANCES</I></B>
<ul>
<li>Just as Surrogate Mothers give a gift to a couple, the couple needs
to give something back.
<li>Traditional (Artificial Insemination) Surrogates receive $15,000, and
Gestational (In-Vitro Fertilization) Surrogates receive $12,000. The surrogate
mother receives these amounts over the course of the pregnancy.
<li>Medical expenses are paid by the couple.
<li>Additionally, there is a $500 maternity clothing allowance and our surrogates
receive monthly reimbursement checks for expenses relating to participation
in the program, such as childcare, lost wages, mileage, phone calls, etc.
In the event of a high-risk (i.e., multiple) pregnancy, the surrogate mother
is taken care of.
</ul>
<P>
<B>COUNSELING</B>

<P>Each surrogate mother is assigned to a specific counselor, who will
provide ongoing support and guidance throughout the surrogacy process. Every
month, our surrogates attend a group support meeting where they meet with
other surrogate mothers in their area. The Center believes that it is very
important that each person involved in the surrogacy relationship is taken
care of, therefore, not only the surrogate mother, but also her spouse and
children are taken into consideration during screening and participation
in the program.
<br>The counseling team also does a psychological evaluation on both the Intended
parents to determine their appropriateness for surrogacy. Those couples who
the Psychologists do not feel are appropriate are not accepted by CSP's program.
<P>
<B><I>PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</I></B>
<P>The Center only works with women who are:

<UL><LI>between the ages of 21 &amp; 35 years.
<LI>mothers already.
<LI>not receiving any form of government assistance (such as AFDC.)
</UL><P>Surrogate mothers must also be given medical clearance from an
infertility specialist and be screened by a member of the counseling team
affiliated with CSP.

<P>
<H3>How long have you been in business?
</H3><P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting &amp; Egg Donation, Inc. has been
in business since 1980.
<P>
<H3>How many births have you had?
</H3><P>The Center is proud of the hundreds of births we have been involved
in since 1980. &#160;At any given time, we have dozens of surrogates pregnant
with their couples eagerly awaiting the birth of their children.
<P>
<H3>What programs do you offer?<BR>
</H3><UL><LI>Traditional Surrogacy (AI)
<LI>Gestational Surrogacy (IVF)
<LI>Egg Donation (ED)
</UL><P>
<H3>Will I meet my couple?
</H3><P>The Center runs an "open" program. &#160;This means that you will
meet your couple prior to any medical procedures being undertaken. &#160;In
our program, you will choose your couple and the couple will choose you.
&#160;You couple participates in the pregnancy as much as is comfortable
for you, e.g. going to doctor's appointments, attends the birth, and sends
photos to you after birth.
<P>
<H3>Have you ever had a surrogate mother change her mind and keep the baby?
</H3><P>No. The actual number of cases in the entire country that have gone
to court are a tiny handful (actually less than 17). None of these have come
from our program.
<P>
<H3>Has a couple ever refused to take their child?
</H3><P>No. &#160;We have had three cases where the child was born with birth
defects. &#160;No couple has refused to take their child, despite the birth
defects.
<P>
<H3>Are couples medically and psychologically screened?
</H3><P>Both couples and surrogate mothers are medically and psychologically
screened in our program.
<P>
<H3>How do I know my couple can afford the costs involved?
</H3><P>The Center is very concerned about protecting our surrogate mothers
and their families against any unpaid bills. &#160;The Center holds full
trust funds sufficient to cover your fees and expenses throughout the pregnancy.
&#160;These funds are&#160;deposited into your trust account before you begin
working together.
<P>
<H3>How many staff members do you have?
</H3><P>Eight staff members plus four full time independent counselors.

<H3>ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF:
</H3><P>Our administrative staff coordinates between Surrogate, Intended
Parents, doctors, psychologists, laboratories, hospitals and attorneys. (Doctors,
psychologists, attorneys are independent professionals.)
<P>Our skilled staff provides care and quidance, and ensures that all necessary
steps are taken and full documentation is in place prior to commencement
of medical procedures. Additionally, statistics are updated regularly regarding
our program.
<P>Staff includes:
<P>
<UL><LI>Medical Coordinator-coordinates all medical aspects of the process,
including screening &amp; procedures.<BR>
<LI>Financial Trust Administrator-handles all financial matters between couple
and Surrogate Mother.<BR>
<LI>Surrogate Coordinator-contact person for potential surrogate mothers.<BR>
<LI>Administrative-responsible for requests for information, correspondence,
and database.
</UL><P>
<H3>PSYCHOLOGISTS:
</H3><P>Psychological Team of Dr. <a href="Hillbio.html">Hilary Hanafin</a>, Carol Wolfe MFCC, Donna
Robertson LCSW, and Dr. <a href="Gordbio.html">Elaine Gordon</a>, are specifically trained and individually
recognized nationally for their work in the field of third party reproduction.
Each surrogate mother is assigned to a specific counselor, who will provide
ongoing support and guidance throughout the surrogacy process. Every month,
our surrogates attend a group support meeting where they meet with other
surrogate mothers in their area. The Center believes that it is very important
that each person involved in the surrogacy relationship is taken care of,
therefore, not only the surrogate mother, but also her spouse and children
are taken into consideration during screening and participation in the program.
<P>The counseling team also does a psychological evaluation on both the Intended
parents to determine their appropriateness for surrogacy. Those couples who
the Psychologists do not feel are appropriate are not accepted by CSP's program.
<P>
<H3>INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS:
</H3><P>The Center works in conjunction with recognized infertility specialists
who utilize advanced reproductive technologies. These specialists are independent
of the Center. All participants undergo an in depth medical screening and
evaluation in our Surrogate Program.
<P>For IVF, typically, the specialist involved is the doctor that the couple
has past experience working with.
<P>For Artificial Insemination, the Center will send you to a doctor closest
to the Surrogate Mother.
<P>
<H3>LEGAL COUNSEL:
</H3><P>The Surrogate Mother and the Intended Parents must each meet with
outside independent legal counsel to discuss the contractual agreement into
which they both enter. This contract should define all parties' rights and
responsibilities. Contracts are drafted by the couple's attorney, The Law Offices of Vorzimer, Garber, Masserman &amp; Ecoff</a>.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Deidre>Deidre Hall's Story; a made for TV
Movie</A><BR>Deidre Hall's Story: After All</CENTER>
</H3><P><CENTER>(ABC November 12, 9pm)</CENTER>
<P>
<P>Los Angeles -<B>"We're going to have a baby!"</B> &#160;It seems that
each of the hundreds of couples who have asked the Center for help in creating
their family has chosen a different way to tell the good news to friends
and family. Some have written letters, others get on the phone, some even
throw a big party! Deidre Hall, star of Days of our Lives, and husband Steve
Sohmer, decided to tell the world their story first with a cover story in
People Magazine and now, a made for TV movie.
<P>Airing November 12 on the ABC television network, Deidre Hall's Story:
After All (starring, of course, Deidre Hall), details the 20 years of Deidre
trying to have a baby. Like all couples experiencing infertility, Deidre
and Steve endured numerous visits to the infertility specialist, failed IVF
attempts, and experienced their hopes and dreams dash away month after month.
The movie also takes us on their journey to the Center for Surrogate Parenting
and their meeting with Robin, the surrogate who completed their family with
2 beautiful children. Deidre and Steve decided to go public and produce their
surrogacy story because as Deidre says, "Women are spoon fed a lot of
misinformation and they are terrorized by stories of failed adoptions and
failed surrogacies. The Baby M story, a nasty battle involving the surrogate
mother, was a nightmare. I'm not trying to teach people how to be involved
in surrogacy. I'm trying to say there is a successful way to do this. There's
more to this than people realize. It's an exquisite trust; it's a profound
sharing."
<P>While Deidre Hall's Story: After All is not a documentary, it does a
surprisingly good job at realistically describing the process and the emotions
involved in surrogacy. A particularly gratifying aspect of Deidre Hall's
Story: After All, for the staff at the Center is the recognition paid to
the professionals involved in Surrogate Parenting.
<P>We thank Deidre, Steve and their two lovely boys, David Atticus and Tully.
We also thank Robin, the surrogate, for allowing us to share in part of their
lives. A successful surrogacy arrangement is always cause for joyous celebration.

<P>We have spent the last month surfing the Internet looking for information
on surrogacy and egg donation. There have been a few sites where we have
found some information, but no main source of information or access to
professional opinions. So, we have decided to begin creating and developing
our own site on the World Wide Web, which will offer information and updates
on surrogacy and egg donation. From our Home Page, Net users will be able
to link to other sites or receive information on a large range of topics.
Some topics to be covered are: general information on surrogacy and egg donation;
myths and realities of surrogacy and egg donation; psychological aspects
of third party reproduction; updated success rates; names of infertility
doctors; names of sperm banks for semen analysis and workups; social disease
testing recommended; legal issues; legislative updates, and Frequently Asked
Questions.
<P>We envision that the Center will facilitate an evening of Internet Relay
Chat (a "party line" real-time conversations on the Net), with a guest host.
These guests will include: psychologists and psychotherapists specializing
in the field of surrogacy and egg donation, infertility doctors, lawyers,
social workers, couples at different stages in the surrogacy process, and
surrogate mothers sharing their stories. We feel that an occasional open
discussion will be beneficial.
<P>We welcome any ideas, suggestions, comments and help in establishing our
WWW Home Page. Please e-mail the Center at:

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Bedrest>The Surrogate and Bedrest</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>by <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Carol">Carol Wolfe</A>,
M.F.C.C.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The vast majority of surrogate mothers have had smooth and easy pregnancies.
When a surrogate has a difficult and complicated pregnancy she requires bedrest.
She is often surprised and finds herself with some difficult coping and stress
management ahead. The surrogate knows that people in her life are watching
to see if she will fall apart at the birth. She often will feel that she
has to present a picture that "everything is OK...no problem!". Surrogates
are usually "givers", meaning that they volunteer for everything and are
usually bad at receiving. It can be very difficult for them to recognize
their own needs, much less ask for help.
<P>One of the most challenging aspects of bedrest is that the surrogate may
be able to take care of the needs of her own children. She may be unable
to do the thousand things a mom does to keep the family running, such as
meals, getting kids up for school, music lessons, Girl Scouts, etc. A pregnancy
in the third trimester can be difficult with its limitations anyway, but
bedrest will amplify those difficulties a hundredfold. The surrogate is disabled
and uncomfortable. She may be on monitors and medications, and wants to be
sure that her responsibility to the baby is taken care of. Additionally,
she may be feeling very guilty that her family has to sacrifice so much.
<P>The second most challenging part of the pregnancy and bedrest, is the
strain on her marriage. It is inevitable that her husband is going to have
to cover some of these duties. He is supportive of her desire to do this,
but husbands have varying degrees of desire to participate at all. He may
begin to be grumpy and disgruntled over his added responsibility and will
rarely let the couple see this. It is not that he is unhappy about the overall
goal of helping to create a family, but that he is concerned about the
difficulties that may be endured by his own family.
<P>Sometimes a difficult pregnancy can involve anything from the scare of
miscarriage with a few weeks of bedrest, to weeks of hospitalization. Financial
compensation a surrogate receives is not emotionally comforting when a surrogate
is completely disabled. A couple should be very careful not to have the attitude
that "she is getting paid for this anyway". This attitude can be extremely
damaging to the relationship. The surrogate/prospective parents relationship
is benefited by each party trying to understand what the other may be
experiencing. Those who are able to understand and empathize usually report
a more successful experience.

<H3><CENTER><B><A NAME=Seminars>International Seminars</A></B></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>As the Center's reputation grows internationally, we continue to bring
our message of positive surrogacy to couples on virtually every continent.
Over the next few months, we will be hosting seminars in Taiwan, Australia
and Israel. Our first international seminar took place in Israel in 1991
where we discovered couples were very eager to get our information and meet
the Center's staff, without having to spend the time and money to fly to
Beverly Hills. Since a meeting at the Center is almost always mandatory prior
to joining our programs, these international seminars provide all of us with
great opportunity; the couples have their consultation in their place of
residence, and the staff at the Center enjoys great sightseeing!
<P>Incidentally, we now consider next year's seminars in New York, Chicago
and Dallas as just a trip around the corner.

</H3><P>
<P>Greetings from Cloud 9!
<P>Enclosed are a few photographs of Brianna (born Dec. 14, 1994 by Polly,
surrogate mother) and some of the people who helped to make her possible.
We hope that the last earthquake has not created for you as big a "shake
up" in your lives as Brianna has for us! We don't regret a sleepless minute.
Actually, she has been very understanding of us, and has tolerated almost
all of our foibles and lack of comprehension of the lectures she gives us
each day. She is very good-natured and seems to love people (she certainly
gets passed around like a football). We credit part of this apparent adaptability
to the first few weeks of her life in which she traveled 1/3 the length of
California a couple of days after she was born, flew to Kansas and back at
5 days old, and then few to Canada a couple of weeks later. Then there have
been several parties in her honor to attend, etc. etc. Quite the social schedule
for one so young.
<P>We thought you might like the photographs enclosed. To be sure, you will
receive others. Proud? Who, us?
<P>Thank you again for helping to facilitate the most wonderful experience
of our lives!
<P>With our best wishes,
<P>Bruce, Betty and Brianna

Donation</A></B></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<UL><LI>THE CENTER OFFERS AN "OPEN" EGG DONATION PROGRAM WITH A REGISTRY
OF OVER 150 AVAILABLE DONORS.<BR>
<DL><DT>"Open" refers to the range of communication between the Intended
Parents and their egg donor. Some couples elect to meet their egg donor and
be open about their full identity, while others may wish to divulge only
a limited amount of information. Each couple must select their own comfort
level. At a minimum, couples will receive a photograph of their donor and
her children, as well as her full application form. The application covers
questions of ethnic background, education, family genetics and medical
history.<BR>
</DL></UL><UL><LI>A DONOR MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE GENETIC CHILD OF HER OWN.<BR>
<DL><DT>This proves her fertility. She has carried a pregnancy and become
a parent; she has also experienced "bonding".<BR>
</DL></UL><UL><LI>DONORS SHOULD NOT DONATE MORE THAN THREE TIMES, PREFERABLY
ONLY TWICE. <BR>
<DL><DT>We must be concerned about the genetic history of your child. Since
egg donation is a fairly new field, we do not know the full medical side-effects
of stimulating the ovaries. We also do not know the effects of a child knowing
he/she has many half-siblings with several different families.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Clock>Egg Donation: Reversing the Biological
Clock</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>by <A HREF=Gordbio.html>Elaine Gordon</A>, Ph.D.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center is proud to announce its <A HREF=EggD.html>comprehensive egg
donation program</A> utilizing the team approach. Donors are thoroughly screened
both medically and psychologically in an effort to assess whether they meet
the stringent guidelines established by the professional staff. There is
new hope for women who have previously been unable to conceive due to premature
ovarian failure, age, or genetic considerations. The success rate using donor
eggs is far greater for these women than In Vitro Fertilization, where they
use their own eggs. Although the odds are significantly better, they
unfortunately are not 100%.
<P>Recipients are interviewed and counseled regarding the medical and
psychosocial implications of the process. Introductions and matches are made
by consent of both parties. Egg donation is said to be a new reproductive
cure which enables patients to achieve their dream, to bear and nurture a
child. Egg donation provides a means for the medical community to turn back
the biological clock of women nearing the end their reproductive years.
<P>The old tradition of donation is based on anonymity, secrecy, and
nondisclosure. However, there is one question that emerges as the foremost
in recipients minds when they begin to contemplate egg donation: The issue
of anonymous verses non-anonymous donation. Tradition and experience have
led us to question the wisdom of old policies and consequently resulted in
developing a program that offers the opportunity for non-anonymity. We realize
it is very easy to keep egg donation a secret and we also know there are
no easy answers to this very difficult dilemma.
<P>Whether one turns to egg donation or not depends on the medical diagnosis.
In consultation with your physician, the decision should be made whether
you are an appropriate candidate for egg donation. If you are, you must also
decide whether you are psychologically prepared to be a candidate. This means
being ready to make a commitment to parenting a child that is genetically
related to only one of you. It also involves asking yourself and your partner
some hard questions which deserve some very honest answers. These questions
will be extremely difficult ones. Who to tell or not tell; when to tell;
the non-genetic relationship disclosure issues, and what to tell the child,
are all important questions that need to be discussed.
<P>If you have any questions concerning the egg donation program, please
feel free to <A HREF=Contact.html>call our office </A>for more information.
We look forward to working with those patients who find egg donation to be
their option and making their experience a rewarding one.

<H4>Birth Certificate reflects the Genetic Parents in Gestational Surrogacy
</H4><P><A HREF=Attybio.html>John K. Ciccarelli</A>, Esq. advises that Paternity
and Maternity Judgments remain the method of choice for finalizing the parental
rights in gestational surrogacy in California. Mr. Ciccarelli explains that
by his appearance in court prior to the birth of the baby, he is able to
obtain an order from a judge directing the hospital and physicians to complete
the birth certificate by listing the couple's names as the mother and father.
Therefore, there Is no need for an adoption to take place. While Mr. Ciccarelli
employed this method prior to the California decision in Johnson vs. Calvert,
there is no doubt that the Court's ruling in that case provided the lower
courts with additional guidance to this procedure. This method has been
successfully used in more than 126 IVF births. To date, no California court
has refused to recognize the couple's parental rights.
<P>
<H4>Folic Acid &amp; Pregnancy: &#160;A New Discovery
</H4><P><B>Folic Acid</B> is important prior to and during the early stages
of pregnancy. It helps to protect the unborn baby against birth defects of
the spine and brain, like spina bifida or "open spine". Once a potential
surrogate mother is medically cleared and accepted into our program, she
intakes 0.4 mg of <B>Folic Acid</B> every day for approximately 4 months
prior to pregnancy. <B>Folic Acid</B> is a B vitamin and is found mainly
in green leafy vegetables, beans, asparagus, citrus fruits/juice, whole grain
foods and liver. For additional information, call The March of Dimes,
1-800-367-6630.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=Supreme>Surrogacy Recognized As Parenting
Option</A><BR>Parental Rights Upheld by U.S. Supreme Court</CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>In a case of paramount importance to the infertile community, the Supreme
Court has let stand a California decision that establishes the biological
or intended parents in a surrogate arrangement as the legal parents of any
child born from such an arrangement.
<P>The court also upheld that the contract employed by the Center For Surrogate
Parenting between surrogates and the intended parents is legally enforceable.
Finally, the higher court ruled that surrogate parenting is not against
California public policy.
<P>By refusing to hear a challenge to existing laws, the U.S. Supreme Court
has concurred with the California Supreme Court that a gestational surrogate
has no rights as a mother and cannot claim parental rights. Although the
rulings were only applied to gestational surrogate agreements, the decisions
may also impact agreements whereby the surrogate is both the genetic and
birth mother since in both types of arrangements the "intent" is identical:
to provide the infertile couple with a child.
<P>The rulings arose from the case of Anna Johnson vs. Mark and Crispina
Calvert. Ms. Johnson had agreed to carry the genetic child of the Calvert's
and then attempted to claim parental rights. Although the parties were not
in the Center's program, the Calvert's did use a contract prepared by the
Center. It was this contract specifically that was ruled enforceable. This
case redefines parental rights, reinforces surrogacy arrangements and once
again establishes California as a leader in expanding procreative rights
for infertile couples.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=study>Comprehensive Study of Gestational Surrogate Transfers
Now Completed</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The Center For Surrogate Parenting has completed studying 294 gestational
surrogacy transfers that involved 111 Center clients between 1986 and 1993.
This is the largest number of cases analyzed at one time. Clients studied
included those who supplied fresh embryos and frozen embryos and surrogates
who underwent IVF or ZIFT.
<P>The overall full-term or ongoing pregnancy rate for all clients was 26%.
As with other studies, the rate for women under 40 using fresh embryos was
higher, 28%, than those for women over 41 which was 6%. Although the statistics
for women over 40 using frozen embryos was actually higher than those using
fresh, 12% vs. 6%, the study showed that those women undergoing fresh transfers
were much older, up to 48 years old, than those using frozen embryos.
<P>The Center conducted the study in response to the most frequently asked
question: is IVF more successful with a younger uterus even if the eggs are
older? The overall gestational surrogate success rate, 26%, for full-term
or ongoing pregnancy is higher than the overall IVF rate. But the results
are still somewhat inconclusive and some, such as the ZIFT results which
show a 35% success rate for women under 41, are inconsistent with other studies.
<P>The study found that the majority of pregnancies, 51 out of 60, occurred
by the second attempt. Eleven out of the 60 were multiple births.
<P>It was also found that the miscarriage rate for gestational surrogates,
26%, was similar to the miscarriage rate for women over 35 in the general
population. Most studies show that the miscarriage rate for women under 35
is 20%.
<P>The Center's clients participating in the study were patients of 18 different
physicians who performed the actual IVF and ZIFT procedures.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=questions>Before You Begin: Questions to Ask Concerning
Surrogacy</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The Center For Surrogate Parenting offers a full range of psychological
counseling for surrogate mothers, egg donors and prospective parents to help
them decide if surrogacy is the best way for them to build, or help someone
else build, a family. Because of its careful screening and on-going counseling,
legal coordination and guidance services, the Center has a perfect 1.5-year
record of all parties fulfilling their agreements.
<P>Before entering any surrogacy program, consider the following:<BR>
<OL><LI>Does the program recruit its own surrogate mothers, and if so, through
what means?<BR>
<LI>Will the program work with a surrogate mother recruited by the couple?<BR>
<LI>Are surrogate mothers provided with established, experienced psychological
counseling, and if so to what extent?<BR>
<LI>Is medical screening required of the surrogates, and if so to what extent?
Does the program require testing beyond that recommended by the American
Fertility Society?<BR>
<LI>Does the program offer gestational surrogacy (surrogate IVF, ZIFT, host
uterus) as well as traditional surrogacy?<BR>
<LI>How does the program assist with the medical procedures and treatments
required in AI, IVF, and ZIFT? Are they able to coordinate the logistics
between physicians, surrogate mothers, clinics and hospitals?<BR>
<LI>What type of emotional support does the program offer the couple and
surrogate mother - counseling, group support, both?<BR>
<LI>To what extent is contact between the couple and surrogate encouraged
prior to birth?<BR>
<LI>What type of legal counsel is provided to the couple and the surrogate
mother and does it include the preparation of contracts and legal representation
to finalize the parent/child relationship?<BR>
<LI>What are the financial obligations incurred by the couple? What is the
payment schedule?<BR>
<LI>At what point is the couple responsible for the surrogate mother's medical
expenses? Must the couple pay for a surrogate's medical care prior to her
completing the full screening process?<BR>
<LI>Does the program have a medical registry for updating the medical history
of the surrogates or the children?<BR>
<LI>Does the program have a referral list of previous client couples?<BR>
<LI>Does the program have access to the latest legislative policies and laws
regarding surrogacy and are they able to respond in a timely manner to any
changes affecting surrogacy?<BR>
<LI>Do they have back-up personnel to immediately cover in the event of illness,
vacations, other contingencies, etc.?

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=pregnant>"We're Pregnant!"</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>Just as the ways to conceive a child now takes many forms, so do
the methods of telling couples that a baby may be on the way. The Center
plans ahead with couples, physicians and surrogates on how to deliver the
pregnancy results.
<P>Most often, the physician's office will call the Center and the couple
directly if the results are negative. They then agree on who will tell the
surrogate. When the results are positive, they calls goes out to the surrogate
and Center. The surrogate then helps to inform the couple of their success.
<P>Some women want to personally tell their husband of a positive result
in order to replicate the birth process more closely. Others are happy to
have the surrogate give the news. The way surrogates do this are as varied
as they are.
<P>Teddy bears, positive pregnancy tests, and streamers and balloons have
all been used to inform waiting couples. One surrogate learned of her pregnancy
right before Mother's Day and sent a Mother's Day card to announce their
success to the intended parents.
<P>Whatever method of communication the message is the same: a baby is on
the way and with it the fulfillment of a couple's dreams and hopes.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=bonds>Special Bonds - Deciding On A Second Child
Together</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>For infertile couples the path to parenthood is one that requires new
decisions with nearly every step. Once they have decided to create a family
through surrogacy, they must select the surrogate. And, once they have one
child, they must decide if, and how, they will have another. Those who want
more than one child may again look to their surrogate for help.
<P>Surrogate mothers are not asked to commit to carrying more than one pregnancy
but about 20% of surrogates choose to do so. Some become pregnant for the
same couple, others bring a first child to another family.
<P>Typically, the decision to repeat a surrogacy experience for a family
is made when the first child is 6 to 12 months old. By this time, the couple
and surrogate have an established relationship and have decided on the boundaries
of their extended family.
<P>Most gestational surrogates want to provide a couple with a second child
for the same reasons the couple want another child - reasons that are no
different than those given by any family, including those with no fertility
problems. Genetic surrogates agree to more than one pregnancy so the children
will have similar genetic ties and have a shared history of their birth.
<P>All surrogates who go on to a second pregnancy, do so because they found
the first experience positive and safe and believe that what they have done
is special enough to warrant repeating.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=screening>Genetic Screening Will Help Assure a Healthy
Pregnancy</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>by Ann Garber, M.S. Dr.P.H.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Genetic screening for certain inherited disorders provides important
information for couples who are planning a pregnancy. It is estimated that
all individuals are "carriers" of between 5 to 10 recessive genes.
<P>A carrier has one normal gene and one abnormal gene for a specific disorder
in each of his or her cells. Generally, the carrier of a recessive gene does
not have the symptoms of that inherited disease because the normal gene disguises
the abnormal gene.
<P>However, when both the mother and father carry the same defective recessive
gene, there is a one-in-four chance that any child they have will inherit
the recessive gene from both parents and be born with a severe form of the
disease.
<P>Screening for carriers of genetic traits is important when matching couples
with a surrogate using artificial insemination (AI), as well as in vitro
fertilization, (IVF).
<H4>Certain groups are at risk
</H4><P>Genetic screening is particularly important for certain ethnic groups
that have a higher incidence of a genetic disease than found in the general
population.
<P>Those groups include African Americans, who have a higher risk of carrying
the sickle cell trait; Ashkenazi Jews who have an increased risk of carrying
the Tay Sachs gene; and individuals of Mediterranean or Southeast Asian descent
who can carry Thalassemia.
<H4>Disease Often Hidden
</H4><P>A common misconception is that genetic screening is not necessary
unless there is a family history of a genetic disease. In fact, in the majority
of cases where an individual is recognized as being a carrier of a recessive
disease, there is no relative with that disorder.
<P>That is because the disease only shows itself when two carriers contribute
an abnormal gene in the egg and the sperm, and an affected offspring is born.
Usually there is no known prior history of the disease in either side of
the family. Genetic screening for all individuals in high risk populations
is the only way to identify carriers.

<H4>International Surrogacy
</H4><P>The Center has gained international expertise and now provides surrogacy
services and counseling for clients worldwide. Recent advances in embryo
freezing have reduced the cost of procedures for those living in countries
with socialized medicine, shortened travel time and alleviated some of the
emotional turmoil of long distance, third-party cycle synchronization. Successful
surrogacy partnerships have occurred for couples living in Italy, England,
France, Denmark, Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, New Guinea, Hong Kong,
Argentina, Venezuela, Singapore, Guatemala, Nigeria, Taiwan, Egypt, Germany,
Mexico and Sweden.

<H4>New Method of Preparation has 56% Pregnancy Rate
</H4><P>Dr. Michael Feinman and his colleagues at Pacific Fertility Medical
Centers of California have reported a 56% pregnancy rate for egg donation
and gestational surrogacy. This unusually high level of success is achieved
by preparing the recipient with injectable estradiol valerate instead of
giving her oral estrogen or using an estrogen patch. The chances for pregnancy
also increased when the egg provider was under 35 and the recipient had a
healthy uterus.
<H4>PZD, SUZI Methods Show Successful Results
</H4><P>The Huntington Reproductive Center (HRC) in Pasadena reports 30 live
births and approximately 10 ongoing pregnancies utilizing the PZD and SUZI
microfertilization procedures. HRC also is among a handful of clinics in
the U.S. to offer the new ICSI technique, where a single sperm is injected
directly into the cytoplasm of an egg. Using this method egg fertilization
was achieved where only a few immobile sperm were present in the entire
ejaculation.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=real>Surrogacy in the 1990s<BR>The Real
Story</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The common perception of surrogacy-what it is, who does it, and how it
works-has seeped into the public consciousness by way of sensationalized
news headlines and aftemoon talk shows, via politicians who find it expedient
to denounce surrogacy, and from religious, pseudo-feminist and antiabortion
groups whose tenets require women to abdicate the right and responsibility
to control their own bodies. Those who speak out the loudest against surrogacy
seem to know the least about it. Few have ever faced the devastation of
infertility themselves. Yet seldom have they included infertile couples or
surrogate mothers in public policy-making decisions about surrogacy.
<P>
<H4>SURROGACY WORKS<BR>99% Success Rate
</H4><P>Understandably, an infertile couple trying to resolve childlessness
would be hesitant to pursue surrogacy without accurate information and reliable
resources. But any enquiring mind delving deeper than NationalEnquirer headlines
would discover that surrogacy works! According to the health department of
the state of New York's estimate of approximately 4000 surrogate births since
the late 1970's, only 11 documented cases involving custody of the child
have gone to litigation, and in every case except one, custody has been awarded
to the intended parents. Compared to other forms of social contract such
as marriage or adoption, surrogacy enjoys a significantly higher success
rate (over 99%). The 1992 Information Please Almanac states that in 1990,
there were approximately 2,448,000 marriages in the U.S., and 1,175,000
divorces-a failure rate of almost 50%. In adoption, one study conducted by
adoption specialist <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Carol">Carol Wolfe</A>, MFCC, found
that out of 250 birthmothers who had agreed to place their child with prospective
adoptive parents, in 38% of these cases, one or the other party withdrew
from the agreement prior to or following the birth. (This differs from the
often-quoted figure of 5 - 15% of birthmothers who change their mind after
the birth.)
<P>
<H4>GESTATIONAL SURROGACY<BR>"...a second wave of surrogate mothers..."
</H4><P>Not only is traditional Artificial Insemination surrogacy highly
successful, but according to a front-page article in the August 12, 1990
issue of The New York Times,"surrogacy is not only actively practiced but
expanding in a new direction, bringing hope to some families... ." This new
direction, which the Times heralds as the "second wave of surrogate mothers"
is gestational surrogacy, in which a woman carries an infertile couple's
embryo and delivers a baby to whom she has no genetic connection. The article
also interviews internationally recognized infertility specialists Drs. Richard
Marrs and Paulo Serafini who perform embryo transfers into gestational surrogate
mothers when medically indicated. The Ethics Committee of the American Fertility
Society states "there could be a role for surrogate gestation in reproductive
medicine." The Times quotes Lori B. Andrews, a lawyer specializing in
reproductive law at the American Bar Foundation. "This is a growing area
of surrogacy... more in vitro fertilization centers are offering it, and
more couples are drawn to it." Clearly, growing acceptance within the medical
community has moved surrogacy from the media spotlight into the medical joumals.
<P>
<H4>PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS
</H4><P>Professional surrogate practitioners can now provide full-service
programs which address every aspect of the process. At the Center for Surrogate
Parenting, comprehensive case management of each couple and surrogate mother
ensures the best possible outcome for all parties. This means independent
legal counsel for both surrogate and couple, complete medical screening,
ongoing psychological counseling for all participants, and finaricial management
to insure that all fees, insurance and anticipated expenses are covered.
<P>Surrogacy has moved beyond the shadows and innuendo of the tabloids and
talkshows, emerging in the 1990's as an established practice offering real
solutions for creating families.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=experiences>Surrogate Mothers Compare
Experiences</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Independent Arrangements vs. Professional Surrogacy
Programs</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Three surrogate mothers share insights gained by working both independently
and through professional programs. All expressed the hope that their experiences
will prove helpful to women considering becoming surrogate mothers.
<P>
<H4>"Susan"
</H4><P>Susan wanted to be a surrogate mother ever since the day her own
child was born, after learning that the woman in the hospital room next to
her had tried to take her own life. The woman's child had been stillborn,
necessitating an emergency hysterectomy. Susan placed an ad in her local
paper, using her home phone number, offering to become a surrogate mother
for an infertile couple. She received many calls. Using her own intuition
and good sense, she screened the couples herself, finally selecting a warm
and deserving couple. They had no contract, the agreement was sealed with
a handshake. After the third insemination, Susan became pregnant. The wife,
whose doctor had suggested surrogacy since she had severe tubal damage, became
pregnant herself when Susan was three months pregnant. The couple was wonderful,
insisting they were thrilled with two children. Susan gave birth to a boy,
the wife a girl. All parties honored their agreement and the experience was
a great success.
<P>Only after researching surrogacy for a college paper did Susan realize
how perilous her situation had been and how very fortunate she was in its
outcome. The second time around she worked through a professional surrogacy
agency which offered her far better protection against unforeseen events.
She noted that doing it on her own made the process appear less expensive
for the couple, and she could see no real advantages for the surrogate.
<P>
<H4>"April"
</H4><P>April loved being pregnant but a messy divorce made being a single
mother a tremendous burden. She wanted to have a child for someone who could
really enjoy motherhood. She felt confused and ambiguous about being paid
for this service. After becoming involved with a professional surrogate agency,
it became clear to her that she was being paid for her services, not a child.
She felt comforted that the agency took care of all legal matters, screened
the couples for social diseases, and provided ongoing counseling and support.
She was matched with a couple and the three of them produced a beautiful
baby boy. The experience was so successful that two years later, they all
tried again, but this time they felt confident that they could do it on their
own. April became pregnant with twins. In retrospect, April felt the main
problem was that they all had become too close, taking too much for granted.
Communication broke down - everyone was afraid to say what he or she was
really feeling, or to ask for what was needed. Money was an uncomfortable
subject. The birth was an emotional rollercoaster - the couple, unprepared
for twins, April desperately needing to hear a "thank you." She says she
wants to be a surrogate one more time, to end on a positive experience. This
time she wants to go through a professional program. "I will never do it
any other way!"
<P>
<H4>"Emily"
</H4><P>Suffering two years of infertility herself, Emily wanted to help
a childless couple after completing her own family. She found a reputable
surrogate agency and helped two infertile couples to become families.
Subsequently she was contacted by a couple who offered her more money to
work with them independently. Because of her previous successful experiences,
she felt confident about doing it on her own and agreed. Once she became
pregnant, the couple could "see I had no back-up. They were very nice to
me until they got what they wanted." After the birth, they refused to pay
the balance of her fee as well as the obstetrician's bill of several thousand
dollars, which Emily eventually paid herself. Her husband insists she work
through a surrogate program the next time.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=frozen>International Frozen Embryo Shipping Program A
Success</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Customs Agent Plays Crucial Role</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>As our international clientele expands and the technology of embryo freezing
advances, the Center's program has opened the door to international shipment
of frozen embryos. This allows couples who live in countries with socialized
medicine, such as Israel, Australia and England, to create embryos less
expensively. It also reduces the travel expenses and emotional rigors of
long distance, third-party cycle synchronization. So far, our program has
produced two births from embryos shipped from England and Australia, with
another five couples currently in the process.
<P>Our customs agent is responsible for all aspects of shipping, from filing
complicated customs paperwork and fee payment, to pickup and delivery to
respective doctors. Because the embryos are shipped in liquid nitrogen, which
is considered a "hazardous material" it requires special clearances. Contents
are referred to as "human tissue", the client's name never appearing on any
of the forms. In addition, the agent must make special preparations to insure
the embryos are not x-rayed. Direct routes must be booked and detailed knowledge
of suitable airlines is essential.
<P>We hope to be shipping embryos from Japan soon, as worldwide interest
in this option continues to grow.

</H3><H4><CENTER>Preconceptions About Surrogacy<BR>The Center Asks Its Infertile
Couples ...</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<H4>Q. What was your initial reaction to surrogate parenting?
</H4><P>A. &#160;In the beginning stages of exploring this option, most couples
were aware of the negative press surrogacy had received, fueling their main
fear that the surrogate mother would have problems relinquishing the baby.
Several couples also worried that their own relationship would be adversely
affected, since the wife, in the case of artificial insemination, would have
no genetic connection to the child. Other concerns were that it might be
exploitative of the surrogate, or that the whole process was just too
complicated. Many couples were positive about surrogacy. They believed it
was neither the government's nor the public's business to interfere in this
very private area of their lives. They saw it as a win/win situation for
all participants.
<H4>Q. At what point did you decide to pursue surrogate parenting?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>Several of the couples maintained that the turning point
occurred after meeting with the Center's psychologist and staff. Becoming
informed about surrogacy, knowing that the surrogate mothers were well-screened,
both medically and psychologically, and meeting other couples who had
surrogate-born children, all contributed to a decision to move forward with
surrogacy. All felt that good mental health professionals were at the heart
of the process. In addition, couples were reassured by the Center's full-service
program which provided comprehensive legal, financial, and case management
of the arrangement.
<H4>Q. How did your feelings about surrogacy change once you became involved?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>"Surprised" is the word most often used by couples to describe
their feelings about surrogacy once their child is born. They are surprised
by their feelings toward their surrogate mother. One wife, who helped deliver
their baby, said she felt an intense love and connection with the surrogate.
Couples report that they knew would feel indebted to her, but they were surprised
at how much they learned from her and the high regard they felt for her as
a person. One wife who was worried about the possible exploitative nature
of surrogacy, was amazed to discover how many benefits the surrogate mother
enjoyed, independent of the financial aspects. She watched her own surrogate
grow in confidence, having managed and completed the surrogate process with
such success. She also felt having the extra money was very empowering and
allowed her to think more broadly regarding her life's choices. Another couple
noted that all parties had grown and changed, having learned a great deal
from each other.
<P>Another common "surprise" reported by most couples was the desire to "let
the world know." They were intentionally open about the circumstances of
their child's birth.
<P>Several couples also believed that people should be discouraged from pursuing
surrogacy on their own. There could be too many unanticipated twists and
turns. They also felt strongly the need for some kind of legal guidelines
and regulation.
<P>There was a general concurrence that surrogacy was a synergistic experience.
The process itself transformed participant's lives in many ways, enriching,
empowering and enlightening all who took part.

</H3><H4><CENTER>Family Building Solutions</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center For Surrogate Parenting salutes the ingenuity and determination
of its infertile couples who have decided to have more than one child. The
following are examples of some unique family combinations created by our
clients using adoption, surrogacy and high-tech reproductive technology:<BR>
<UL><LI>Three children - one "homemade" child, one adopted child, one
surrogate-born child.<BR>
<LI>Fraternal quadruplets, born through gestational surrogacy, from embryos
placed into two different surrogate mothers at the same time. One had triplets,
the other a single baby.<BR>
<LI>Twins, a boy and a girl, from the same egg retrieval, one embryo placed
into a gestational surrogate, the other embryo returned to the biological
mother.<BR>
<LI>One surrogate-born child and one child the result of an egg donated by
the same surrogate mother but carried by the infertile wife.<BR>
<LI>Three surrogate-born children, two girls from the same surrogate mother,
and a boy from a second surrogate.<BR>
<LI>Two children a boy and a girl, born with the help of two different
gestational surrogate mothers.
</UL><P>These parents will pass on a legacy of love, faith and courage to
their children. They have given a whole new meaning to the word "family."

<H4>One Way or Another ...
</H4><P>The Center received a lovely thank you letter from a couple who had
joined the Center's Gestational Surrogacy Program. Although the embryo transfer
into their surrogate mother had not produced a pregnancy, the leftover embryos
transferred back into the biological mother did! Congratulations Mom!
<H4>Genetic Testing
</H4><P>Genetic testing has become an integral part of the Center's screening
process. Dr. Ann Garber, a Certified Geneticist, has developed a genetic
history for completion by all participants in the Artificial Insemination
Surrogacy and Egg Donation Programs. Dr. Garber reviews all completed histories
and provides a written assessment for each individual.
<H4>Standardized STD Testing
</H4><P>Working with Smith Kline Beecham Laboratories, the Center has
standardized the testing of surrogates and couples for sexually transmitted
diseases. Special specimen packets have been developed for our clients to
take to their own physicians, who perform the necessary tests and ship them
to Smith Kline Labs. The results are then printed across a teleprinter directly
to the Center and evaluated by our Medical Coordinator.
<H4>Israel, France, and Japan
</H4><P>Once again the Center will submit for presentation at the 8th World
Congress on IVF and Assisted Reproduction in Kyoto, Japan, its updated paper,
"<A HREF=Handel.html>Success Rate of Surrogate Gestational Pregnancies Using
In Vitro Fertilization Donor Oocytes</A>" which they have previously presented
at the 6th and 7th World IVF Congresses in Tel Aviv, Israel, and Paris, France.
<H4>Its A Small World!
</H4><P>One of our clients tells a story about how her father, who was waiting
for a connecting flight in a Colorado airport in the middle of the night,
happened to strike up a conversation with the only other person in the terminal,
a woman also waiting for a flight. They began talking about their grandchildren.
The woman's daughter had just given birth to her first granddaughter. Our
client's father talked about his granddaughter and a new grandson that would
be born in a few months. Eventually, all the waiting and talking produced
the amazing revelation that all their respective grandchildren were conceived
with the help of gestational surrogate mothers!

<H4>DES Patients Can Benefit from Gestational Surrogacy
</H4><P>Dr. David Meldrum from the Center for Advanced Reproductive Care
in Redondo Beach, California, reports in Fertility and Sterility, 54:287,
1990, that physicians should be aware of the marked reduction of viable pregnancy
with IVF in DES exposed women with uterine abnormalities other than a small
uterus. Rates were decreased to as low as one third of controls with T-shape,
constrictions or irregular margins.
<H4>Microfertilization Success
</H4><P>Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California, under the
direction of Drs. Paulo Serafini and Joel Batzofin, has perfected two procedures,
PZD (Partial Zone Drilling) and SUZI (Sub-Zonal Sperm Injection), which allows
the management of previously untreatable male factor fertility. Their pregnancy
rate is 35% for PZD and 43% for SUZI. As of August 1992, they have had nine
live births with thirteen pregnancies ongoing.
<H4>Immunologic Response Treatment Achieves Pregnancy
</H4><P>The Center is pleased to announce a pregnancy for a client following
immunologic response treatment of their surrogate at the University of Utah.
The client had attempted several inseminations with their surrogate before
determining that the surrogate had a negative percentage inhibition response
and no blocking activity on a mixed lymphocyte culture with the donor. After
two months of treatment their surrogate became pregnant and subsequently
gave birth to a healthy baby boy.
<H4>Egg Donation Success in Women Over Forty
</H4><P>Drs. Jacobson, Galen and Weckstein of the Bay Area Fertility Medical
Group in the San Francisco East Bay, report on the success of their egg donor
program in recipients over forty. To date, they have achieved 14
ongoing/delivered pregnancies in 35 completed cycles, representing a 40%
success rate. Donors can be provided or couples are welcome to work with
their egg donors.

of Candidates</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>The Center's many carefully screened egg donors are finding themselves
in an unusual situation. They are having to wait for recipient couples. In
the past, the circumstances were reversed; infertile couples were forced
to wait long periods for egg donors.
<P>Many egg donor programs rely on the random donation of left over eggs.
This results in a one to two year wait for a donor. At this writing, the
Center has a surplus of waiting donors.
<P>The Center's success in attracting qualified egg donors is best explained
by an egg donor whose recipient mother recently gave birth to twins. "It
feels great to help someone finally have a family without having to go through
the pregnancy and birth myself. This is truly the GIFT' OF LIFE."

<P>As if the pain and grief of infertility weren't enough, most people struggling
with childlessness are also saddled with massive medical bills. In response,
RESOLVE has been working on passing mandated infertility medical coverage.
So far, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Texas, Arkansas, California
and Hawaii have passed legislation covering in vitro fertilization (IVF)
and/or other infertility procedures.
<P>The very concreteness of these actions is bringing more men into the
organization. While RESOLVE has always been an organization for both men
and women, women, in our culture seem to be more disposed to ask for and
accept help. Doing something, taking action - this seems to be a masculine
way of coping. Indeed, all of us may feel that affecting change is a method
of gaining some control over one's life.
<P>What's more, one gets not only information at those late night advocacy
meetings; the sharing of similar experiences provides emotional support for
the people who work together for a common goal.
<P>While RESOLVE's purpose was to advocate for expanded insurance coverage
for infertility-related procedures, we found that participation in this effort
often helped to meet the emotional needs as well as ease the financial burden
of the infertile community.
<P>RESOLVE is a national organization for over 20,000 people with 53 chapters
in forty states. Their mission is to support, educate and advocate about
fertility issues and to assist the infertile person and/or couple to find
a unique solution to the painful dilemma of infertility. For further information,
write to RESOLVE, 5 Water Street, Arlington, MA 02174-4814, or call at (617)

</H3><H4><CENTER>New Mom Writes to Her Surrogate Mother</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Dear Julia,
<P>By now, you know me pretty well. And you know that I can write on just
about any subject. But I feel as though there are no words to express what
you have done for me and Gregory. Jamie is a miracle if ever there was one.
He is the baby of my heart. The one I've always wanted and imagined. But,
he wouldn't be here if it weren't for you.
<P>One year ago, I couldn't even look at a pregnant woman without feeling
pain. I couldn't look into the window of a nursery furniture store or a baby
clothiers store without wondering what I could have done to deserve such
punishment.
<P>Every time there was a story about an infant abandoned or abused, I wanted
to take that child and make it my own. I couldn't understand why someone
who had been so blessed could abuse that privilege.
<P>Now, after eight years of waiting, I am actually somebody's mommy. You
can't imagine what it feels like to write those words. Every little thing
Jamie does is so precious to me.
<P>You gave what so few have the power to give. Not just an egg and a uterus.
The care and concern for others to make being a surrogate mother worthwhile.
How many people have the ability to make someone else's dream come true?
That's just what you've been able to do. And you've done it with such openness,
such selflessness, such pride. I hope that Jamie will inherit a little of
that from you.
<P>Julia, I hope that you realize that with your strength, and your positive
attitude, you can do anything you set your mind to. I hope this experience
has proven that to you.
<P>Soon, you will start a new life in Idaho. I know that you and Ken will
make it a fantastic success. I see your children, Alex and Seth, growing
up in an atmosphere of wonderful values and plenty of love. They can't help
but be successes, too.
<P>I know, too, that we will not continue to be as close as we've been. And
that's probably only natural. But understand that I will be thinking of you.
Jamie will know who you are as soon as he is old enough to understand. And
he will be taught to love and respect you. Of course we'll keep in touch
and keep you informed of his progress. And I hope you will let me know what
is new and exciting in your life, too.
<P>It's obvious how many people in your life think you are terrific and special.
But, with the exception of Ken and the boys, no one will really know the
full extent of what you have done the way Gregory and I do.
<P>I don't know if I could feel any closer to you. Not if we were sisters.
You've changed my life for the better and in the process I can see the positive
things you've done for yourself.
<P>No matter what else happens in the rest of your life, you have already
done more to prove you are a caring person than most people will ever be
able to do. And I have the baby to prove it.
<P>I love you, Julia. And, I always will.

</H3><H4><CENTER>Birth Power: The Case for Surrogacy<BR>by Carmel Shalev.
201 pp. New Haven Yale University Press, 1989.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Carmel Shalev, an attorney educated at Yale University and living in Tel
Aviv, writes, "just as men have the right to be compensated for their sperm,
so should women have the right to be compensated for their reproductive services
and become surrogate mothers." This is the thesis of Ms. Shalev's "Birth
Power," which explores the social and legal issues raised by combining impersonal
reproductive technologies with increasingly varied challenges to the traditional
family. Looking ahead, she maintains that surrogacy contracts should be legal
and binding. She contends that legalizing surrogacy would empower, not enslave
women. This is a provocative and insightful book, raising fundamental questions
which Ms. Shalev cannot always answer.

</H4><P>
<P>The Endometriosis Association is a non-profit organization that, for the
past ten years, has been dedicated to providing information and assistance
to those suffering from the disease, as well as to researchers and doctors
studying its relationship to infertility.
<P>Endometriosis is a disease of women in their reproductive years in which
tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found growing outside of the
uterus. Endometriosis affects 5-1/2 million women in North America, causing
infertility in 30-40% of the cases. It often causes pain and scarring, resulting
in blocked tubes and adhesions. But researchers now believe that there may
be inflammatory and immunological changes that occur as well which may cause
infertility in endometriosis patients.
<P>The Endometriosis Association provides support services on a group, individual
and crisis basis, an education program through their newsletters, videotapes,
and written information, and a research program which includes the largest
endometriosis registry in the world. For further information, call
1-800-992-3636, or write to the Endometriosis Association, 8585 North 76th
Place, Milwaukee, WI 53223.

</H3><H4><CENTER>After the Birth<BR>by <A HREF=Hillbio.html>Dr. Hilary Hanafin,
Ph.D.</A><BR>Psychologist, Center for Surrogate Parenting</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<H4>Q. What feelings do surrogate mothers experience after the birth?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>Feelings after the birth are unique for each woman and
are reflective of their individual experience. On the positive side, the
most commonly reported feelings include relief from the physical drain of
pregnancy and the emotional strain of preparing for the birth and separation.
Surrogates also report a feeling of relief to recover their own lives and
get on with the business of living. Other postpartum feelings include a sense
of pride for having made a childless couple's dream come true, and accomplishment
in having achieved such a challenging goal. A good surrogate program should
leave a surrogate feeling fulfilled, resolved and satisfied. She should feel
that she has personally benefited from the experience. In follow-up studies,
surrogate mothers report a greater appreciation of their family, an enrichment
of their lives, and an increase in self confidence.
<P>Of course, every surrogate experience has some negative postpartum feelings
as well. The two pervasive ones are: the loss of the pregnancy itself (which
for some surrogates may be their last), and the other is the loss of the
infertile couple. After the birth, the open, warm and caring relationship
undergoes a change, and the loss of the attention and specialness is keenly
felt. After the birth, negative feelings can also be triggered if a surrogate
has some painful, unresolved history.
<P>The surrogates reported a range of feelings about their birthchildren.
Very often, their attachment is reportedly greater to the couple than to
the baby. Commonly, her perception is that the child is "their child", both
morally and existentially; the child would not have come into being if it
were not for this particular couple's love and desire. Surrogates describe
feelings of love, care, interest and joy toward the child, but report that
their feelings are different from those they experienced with their own children.
A curiosity about the child remains and a sense of caring and moral obligation
usually continues. However, typically surrogates have reported an absence
of long-term grieving over the loss of the child.
<P>A primary variable in the surrogate's feelings is the infertile couple's
treatment of her during the pregnancy, the hospital birth and directly
afterwards. A woman's grief is greatly intensified if she feels abandoned,
rejected or used by the parents. Her separation is greatly eased and facilitated
if she feels respected, trusted and appreciated. The new parents' behavior
can have a tremendous influence on their surrogate mother's long-term feelings
about herself and her participation.
<P>
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER><HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME=family>In a Family Way</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>Increasingly, family members are helping each other to solve the painful
dilemma of childlessness. The Center has assisted many couples with the legal
and psychological issues which may arise when working with a family member.
The Center reports involvement in a wide variety of situations: a sister
being a surrogate via artificial insemination for her sister, a sister-in-law
carrying the embryo of her brother and his wife, and a twin sister donating
eggs.
<P>Third-party reproduction within a family presents a unique psychological
situation in which professional counseling is essential; one cannot simply
walk away from family if problems arise - it is a lifetime involvement. Some
of the psychological issues to consider are who, what, when and how to tell
extended family members. It is also important for them to understand their
own family history together prior to conception and how the birth of the
intended child may affect their future relationship.
<P>Legal issues must be addressed as well, including resolution of the legal
status of the child. In the case of egg or sperm donor, the woman giving
birth from a donated egg is the legal mother, as is the husband in the case
of sperm donor. In the case of surrogacy via artificial insemination, a
step-parent adoption must be completed in which the wife adopts her husband's
child. In the case of IVF/Host surrogacy (in which the embryo is produced
by the infertile couple), an attorney may petition the courts to enter the
genetic parents names on the birth certificate, thereby eliminating the need
for a step-parent adoption. Other legal issues needing attention might include
the drafting of a contract or agreement to meet the needs and expectations
of all parties.

<H4>Birth of Egg Donor Twins
</H4><P>The Center congratulates both recipient and donor in the birth this
March of twin girls. Working in conjunction with our Center, Dr. Paulo Serafini
of Huntington Memorial Hospital Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California,
helped perform this medical miracle. The donor, who lives in Southern California,
was previously a surrogate mother in the Center's Surrogate Program. When
asked about her experience, she laughed, "it was the easiest way I ever helped
bring twins into the world." Her couple called her from the hospital after
the birth to share their joy. She noted that they were planning to implant
the two frozen embryos (remaining from the initial egg retrieval) sometime
early in 1991.
<P>
<H4>New Reproductive Center
</H4><P>Dr. Ricardo Asch, Director of the Center for Reproductive Health
in Orange, California, will be completing his new facility this summer. It
will include a full, in-office operating suite to facilitate egg retrieval
and implantation. Dr. Asch has been an integral part of the Center's Egg
Donor Program, and has assisted many of our clients.
<P>
<H4>International Surrogacy
</H4><P>The Center reports working with many international clients. So far,
our surrogate mothers are helping to create families for couples living in
Italy, England, France, Denmark, Australia, Israel, Japan, Canada, New Guinea,
Hong Kong, Argentina, Venezuela, Singapore, Guatemala, Nigeria and Taiwan.
<P>
<H4>Center Adds Nurse to Staff
</H4><P>We are pleased to introduce Amy Grant Rivera, R.N., who has just
joined our team. Amy is a registered nurse with 10 years experience. She
graduated with a B.S.N. from The Catholic University of America in 1980.
She has most recently worked at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los
Angeles, delivering IVF babies conceived with the help of Dr. Richard Marrs.
Amy will act as medical liaison with our infertile couples, surrogate mothers
and physicians.
<P>
<H4>Worlds First Frozen Embryo Birth via Surrogacy
</H4><P>Beginning life as an embryo frozen in the blastocyst stage, a baby
girl was born this March to a gestational surrogate mother in the Center's
program. Dr. Richard Marrs, of the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los
Angeles, performed the initial egg retrieval, which did not produce a pregnancy
when used in a fresh transfer, but did succeed in the subsequent frozen attempt.
Mother and surrogate mother are still amazed and doing well after a routine
delivery.
<P>
<H4>Operator Assistance
</H4><P>Since we do not advertise for clients, a routine question asked of
our prospective parents is "how did you hear about The Center?" Many reply
that we are on RESOLVE's referral list, or that various gynecologists, IVF
clinics, or university teaching hospitals refer them - but our favorite was
the couple who found us by calling the wrong number. Upon discovering we
were not the credit department of Sears, they proceeded to ask who in fact
we were. And the rest is history, including their family's newest member,
little Lillianne.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=success>Surrogacy: The Quiet Success Story</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>As surrogacy enters its second decade of practice in the United States,
an important fact is becoming increasingly clear: surrogate parenting is
an extraordinarily successful human endeavor.
<P>The sensational publicity surrounding a handful of surrogacy cases ("Baby
M" in particular) should not overshadow the fact that there have been an
estimated 1,500 successful surrogate births. A professional program that
matches infertile couples with carefully screened and counseled surrogate
mothers is newsworthy only to the participants. Understandably, media ignores
the quiet, consistent successes in favor of sensational controversy.
<P>The application of advanced reproductive technologies such as IVF, GIFT,
ZIFT and embryo freezing to the field of surrogacy is new opportunities for
childless couples who have refused to give up the dream of someday having
a family.
<P>It is perhaps the American spirit of never saying never nor accepting
a situation as hopeless which is responsible for keeping the United States
at the forefront of applied reproductive technology.

<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER><HR>
<H3><CENTER><A NAME=ftc>Federal Trade Commission Role in Protection of IVF
Consumer</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>We have recently had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Michael Katz,
Supervisory Investigator with the Division of Service Industry Practices
for the Federal Trade Commission.
<P>The recent proliferation of IVF clinics, including some that are suspected
of making deceptive claims, has prompted action by the FTC. Mr. Katz reports
that there are approximately 200 clinics in the United States, a 25% increase
over 1987. Thus far, the FTC has asked 25 of them to substantiate and clarify
their publicized "success rates." For example, the FTC has asked clinics
to differentiate between chemical pregnancies, clinical pregnancies, and
the "take home baby rate."
<P>We are impressed with the FTC's involvement in the policing of fraud against
infertile couples. Their monitoring of the IVF community is of great potential
benefit to the infertile couple. Besides taking legal action and imposing
penalties for fraud, the FTC hopes to eventually provide a consumer guide
to assist patients in choosing IVF clinics and understanding their statistics.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=zift>World's First ZIFT Birth</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>An important milestone was reached in May of this year with the birth
of a healthy baby boy conceived by ZIFT (Zygote IntraFallopian Transfer),
an innovative procedure. This major event occurred at the Hospital of the
Good Samaritan in Los Angeles under the direction of Dr. Richard Marrs, working
in conjunction with our Center.
<P>In the ZIFT process, the infertile couple produces their own embryos through
in vitro fertilization. By means of a laparoscopy, the newly fertilized embryos
(rather than simply the sperm and egg as is done in GIFT) are placed into
the fallopian tubes of a surrogate gestational mother, whose cycle has been
synchronized with the donor mother's cycle.
<P>The Center provided the professional components for all parties involved
in this technological miracle, including selecting and screening the surrogate
mother, as well as coordination of all legal, psychological and medical aspects
of the surrogate process.

</H3><H4><CENTER>Frequently Asked Questions About Surrogate Parenting</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<H4>Q. What motivates a woman to become a surrogate mother?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>According to studies conducted by psychologist
<A HREF=Hillbio.html>Dr. Hilary Hanafin</A>, a recognized authority on surrogacy
and adoption who has interviewed over 500 surrogate mother candidates in
the last six years, major motivations are: enjoyment of the pregnant state
and the desire to be pregnant again. These women uniformly describe their
previous pregnancies as relatively easy. Being pregnant provides an opportunity
to feel special and to experience a sense of wholeness. They also have empathy
for childless couples, an empathy increased by prior contact with an infertile
couple's pain and by the importance of children in their own lives. A third
reason was the desire to do something remarkable with their lives and to
make a unique contribution. Many perceive being a surrogate as providing
a sense of accomplishment. Financial gain is not the primary factor.
<H4>Q. What is the legal status of surrogate parenting in the U. S.?
</H4><P><B>A. </B>Surrogate parenting has become a states' issue, with individual
states differing in their legal approach to surrogacy. Florida makes it illegal
to pay a surrogate anything other than expenses. Louisiana, Michigan, and
New Jersey have declared surrogate contracts unenforceable, while states
such as Nevada and Arkansas have declared surrogacy legal and contracts
specifically enforceable. The majority of states, including California, have
yet to pass laws on surrogacy. However, surrogacy continues to flourish here,
with the complete cooperation of the courts, and the state Department of
Adoptions.
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting welcomes questions regarding any aspect
of the surrogate parenting process.

</H3><H4><CENTER>A personal story from a couple experiencing the IVF/HOST
surrogate process.</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>It was sunny and I was able to sit out on our deck while I waited nervously
for the phone call from California. Maureen, the nurse coordinator from the
IVF team would be calling with the results of the pregnancy test. When the
phone finally rang, I was so nervous that I found it hard to breathe as I
answered. Would the miracles of modern science allow us nature's miracle:
a child'?
<P>My husband and I began this journey in 1981, little knowing how difficult
and emotionally draining it would be. Like all parent-hopefuls, we were very
optimistic about conceiving in short order. Three, six, twelve months- and
pages of temperature charts later- my period kept coming with painful regularity.
<P>Over time, five top-notch fertility specialists examined, counseled, operated
on and treated me. No one had an explanation, just the label "idiopathic
infertility." Under various doctors' directions, I tried treatments almost
randomly. Drugs first; clomid to stimulate ovulation, progesterone to beef
up endometrium, and parlodel, which sometimes is effective in cases of
unexplained infertility. Next we tried artificial insemination several times
a month for four months. I joined the waiting list for our local in vitro
fertilization program (IVF) which had just been opened up to "unexplained"
infertility patients.
<P>Every month that went by was agony. I wanted a baby. I needed a baby.
If nothing else, I had to know that someday there would be a baby. We signed
up with the government's adoption program but the waiting period was projected
to be four to five years and, because of an age limit, it was unlikely that,
in the end, we would be permitted to adopt a child.
<P>Some couples say they will only go through IVF once - the emotional and
financial consequences of failure are too painful. It didn't work for us
that first time in June, 1985. But I was determined to persevere. Feeling
that I absolutely had to keep trying has carried me through more surgical
protocols than I care to add up. Once, twice, three more times with no success.
<P>I think we first heard about surrogates in 1985 and kept the idea in the
back of our minds. With our IVF experience, and knowing that we could produce
apparently viable embryos, we contemplated how marvelous it might be to conceive
a child of our own and have the embryo carried by a surrogate mother. When
the news broke about an Ohio medical team having done this, we were thrilled.
If our attempts continued to fail, there might still be a way for us to have
our own child.
<P>I feel very lucky when I consider the dramatic changes in options for
infertile couples that have arisen in the past ten years. Bless the researchers
who were brave enough to extend IVF studies from animals to humans. And bless
the medical teams who were brave enough to extend the technology of embryo
transfer to surrogate mothers.
<P>After another failed IVF attempt in July, 1987, we felt that it was time
to earnestly pursue surrogacy. We joined a comprehensive program at the Center
for Surrogate Parenting in Beverly Hills, California. We were matched with
four possible surrogates before biology cooperated enough to give us a shot
at a successful IVF attempt. Toward these four women I feel a strange mixture
of gratitude and awe; they can get pregnant! They have easy pregnancies.
They want to help me! They are willing to go through all the trials and
tribulations of pregnancy and birth so that I, too, can be a mother.
<P>After having had eggs retrieved surgically seven times and completing
five embryo transfer procedures, I was willing to try one last time. But
this time, I was counting on the miracle of someone else's body to make it
all worthwhile. The day before the results came back, I hit rock bottom.
I was sure it hadn't worked, and my emotional turmoil was so great that,
for the first time, I vowed I would not do it again. I experienced a brief
period of emotional limbo when the results of the first blood test showed
low levels of HCG (the pregnancy hormone). There was a chance that it had
worked! False hopes; it had been a transient, terminated pregnancy. The medical
world has a name for it "chemical pregnancy." Only in the world of infertility
can this be considered "progress."
<P>Despite vowing "never again," my emotional strength did rebound, or rather
stubbornness and resigned determination carried the day. There would be ONE
more time.
<P>I needed to try that one more time as soon as possible. With a somewhat
greater degree of medical intervention, we were able to try to simultaneously
achieve pregnancies with two new surrogates in June. Both tried so hard to
make it work for us. Again, the day before the results were due, I was both
paralyzed with fear and overcome with gratitude that someone else - a surrogate
- was trying to share my emotional burden and help me try to become a mother.
<P>Just as I answered the phone, my husband arrived home to provide moral
support. Walking towards the deck, he saw me talking on the phone with Maureen,
tears pouring down my cheeks. He didn't say a word as he came towards me,
feeling that inexpressible wave of crushing disappointment once again. I
finally managed to sob out Maureen's first words to me: "Do you have any
champagne?". His tears came as fast and furiously as had mine. With those
words, an emotional burden built on six long years of agony, frustration
and tears began to lift. We are finally expecting a child.

</H4><P>The Center is pleased to announce the first twin egg donor pregnancy
under its new comprehensive Egg Donor Program. The program allows women who
cannot produce viable eggs, but can carry a pregnancy, to utilize donor eggs
for in vitro fertilization. Since the recipient mother gives birth, she is
considered the legal and natural mother of the child.
<P>
<H4>Unique Reproductive Center
</H4><P>The Huntington Reproductive Center in Pasadena, California is one
of the few facilities worldwide which combine full-time female and male
infertility specialists in a comprehensive program. The team approach of
Drs. Paulo Serafini, Joel Batzofin, William Blank and Gary Hubert combines
their expertise in IVF/ET, GIFT, ZIFT, IUI, and EARS (electrically assisted
recovery of sperm) to help a reported 44% of all their patients take home
a child.

<H4>Long Distance IVF Surrogacy
</H4><P>Dr. Jirair Konialian of Granada Hills, California has achieved a
viable pregnancy with an infertile British couple and an IVF/Host surrogate
mother in the Center's program. Working in conjunction with Century City
Hospital in Los Angeles, Dr. Konialian coordinated the synchronization of
both women's cycles via FAX, letter and telephone. The entire process, including
the aspiration of eggs, was filmed as part of a British documentary series,
"The Human Factor," scheduled to air this Fall.

in the U. S.</A></CENTER>
</H3><H4><CENTER>Kim Cotton Visits the Center for Surrogate Parenting</CENTER>
</H4><P>
<P>Kim Cotton, Britain's first financially compensated surrogate mother who
was the focus of British media attention in 1985, spent a week this summer
at the Center recounting her experiences as a surrogate and learning about
the Center's protocols, safeguards and group support approach to surrogacy.
<P>Both professional surrogacy and private adoption are illegal in Britain.
With the help of Gena Dodd, who herself had a surrogate-born son, Kim founded
COTS (Childlessness Overcome Through Surrogacy), a volunteer organization
which helps put infertile couples and potential surrogate mothers in contact
with each other, as well as providing a psychological support system for
surrogates currently pregnant. They are in their second year of operation
and have 165 members, hold an annual General Meeting, and publish a quarterly
newsletter. Mrs. Cotton frequently lectures on surrogacy at universities
and has provided testimony for various ethical committees, including the
British Medical Association (who have yet to report).
<P>Upon her return to England, Kim Cotton reported in the latest COTS newsletter,
"The Center for Surrogate Parenting in California is, in my opinion, surrogacy
run to absolute perfection... It is regarding the surrogate mothers where
the agency really shines ... she is closely monitored and supported throughout
the whole procedure... You will never meet a girl until she has passed the
medical and the psychological screening ... I sat through a surrogate interview
with her husband and child present. I compared notes with Hilary Hanafin
(the Center's psychologist) afterwards ... I thought she was ideal, but Dr.
Hanafin had reservations ... The chances are extremely high that you will
bring home a child of your own without difficulty and with the knowledge
your surrogate will be looked after, long after you have gone home ... To
sum it up, if you want Host/IVF surrogacy, definitely go to Los Angeles -
if you want AI surrogacy (artificial insemination), again definitely L.A.!

</H3><P>
<P>The world's first frozen embryo pregnancy with a surrogate mother was
achieved at our Center this June, working in conjunction with Dr. Richard
Marrs at the Hospital of the Good Samaritan in Los Angeles.
<P>This medical first marks the beginning of the Center's Frozen Embryo Program,
whereby infertile couples who are able to create embryos may retrieve them
at their own IVF clinics and subsequently ship the frozen embryos to Los
Angeles for implantation into host uteri. In other cases, it may be appropriate
for the surrogate to travel to the prospective parents' home town for the
implantation.
<P>For couples living a great distance from southern California, the Frozen
Embryo Program offers the opportunity to create a genetically related child
without the cost and time expenditures of previous methodologies.

</H3><H4><A NAME=break><CENTER>New Hope for Infertile Couples and Failed
IVF patients</CENTER></A>
</H4><P>
<P>A preliminary study of IVF procedures in which an embryo is transferred
to a host surrogate mother (gestational surrogate) reports a pregnancy rate
of 30% and a take home baby rate of 28 % per cycle for clients in our program.
This is a remarkable figure, considering that according to a study of IVF
success rates published in the March, 1988 issue of the New England Journal
of Medicine, the pregnancy rate for traditional IVF programs (not using a
gestational surrogate) is between 10-15%, while the take-home baby rate is
only 8 % per cycle. Success rates for IVF when used in conjunction with a
healthy fertile, gestational surrogate mother during her unstimulated, natural
cycle, is over three times greater than in traditional IVF programs. This
information will be more thoroughly presented by the Center for Surrogate
Parenting to the World Congress in In-Vitro Fertilization in Jerusalem on
April 2-7, 1989, in a <A HREF=Handel.html>keynote speech </A>by Center Director,
Attorney <A HREF="WhosWho.html#Bill">William Handel</A>.
<P>Mr. Handel, on behalf of the Center's clients, has successfully petitioned
the California Superior Court to declare the biological parents of the child
carried by a gestational surrogate to be the natural and legal parents of
their baby. While the surrogate bears the child for the biological parents,
the parents' names appear on the birth certificate as the mother and father
of the child. Thus the need for any adoption procedures is eliminated.
<P>Because of the expanded possibilities and greater chances for conception,
a growing number of in-vitro fertilization clinics, as well as individual
physicians, have requested the help and participation of the Center for Surrogate
Parenting in providing all non-medical components for their
<A HREF=surrpar.html>Host Surrogate Programs</A>. These professional services
include finding, screening, counseling and matching of IVF/host surrogates,
providing the contractual agreements and administration of trust funds.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=egg>New Comprehensive Egg Donor Program
Offered</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>Many couples who are considering surrogate parenting may now be candidates
for a comprehensive <A HREF=EggD.html>Egg Donor Program</A> offered by the
Center for Surrogate Parenting. Egg donation enables a select portion of
the infertile community to take advantage of new reproductive technologies.
Women who can carry a pregnancy but who cannot produce viable eggs (or whose
eggs carry a genetic defect) can conceive through the In-Vitro Fertilization
process with donor eggs and bear a child. No adoption is necessary as the
woman who gives birth is considered the legal and natural mother.
<P>In the past, egg donor programs have relied on IVF patients (who are infertile
to begin with) to donate excess eggs to infertile couples on a random basis.
Until now, there has never been a formal program that specifically solicited,
screened and matched egg donors with prospective recipients, as well as
coordinating all legal, psychological and administrative functions. The Center
reports that there is no wait for the many carefully screened egg donors
who are available to assist an infertile couple.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=legal>Legal Status of Surrogacy in
California</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>We are pleased to report that California still remains one of the most
enlightened states in its attitude towards surrogate parenting. The California
courts, the Department of Adoptions and the enforcement agencies throughout
the state have consistently cooperated with us and facilitated the surrogate
process. The Petition for Adoption (stepparent), Judgment of Paternity and
Judgment of Genetic Parenthood have been accomplished smoothly in concert
with courts and state agencies.
<P>In early 1989, a legislative task force was formed to study surrogate
parenting and recommend legislation that would protect all parties involved.
The Center for Surrogate Parenting has been asked to provide model legislation
for the task force to study, thus establishing California as one of the first
states to consider enlightened and comprehensive surrogate legislation.

</H3><P>
<P>OPTS is a non-profit, national volunteer organization based in Los Angeles,
founded in 1988 by parents whose children were born through surrogacy or
by other birth methods. OPTS advocates, supports and protects the birth rights
of all children. OPTS actively seeks to keep open the options made available
by the new reproductive technologies to infertile couples. Kathe Linden,
founder and spokesperson for OPTS, has appeared on numerous occasions before
the California State Legislature as an expert witness, representing the views
and concerns of infertile couples.
<P>OPTS also acts as a resource for information about surrogacy. A primary
objective is to facilitate the exchange of information between couples just
beginning to explore the process with couples who have already had a child
through surrogacy.

<H3><CENTER><A NAME=research>Research Pays Off for Infertile
Couple</A></CENTER>
</H3><P>
<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting, with the help of an infertile couple
in its program, has pioneered the recent development and use of TEST YOLK
BUFFER for fresh semen shipping. This enables a husband to collect a semen
specimen at home and ship overnight (via Federal Express or other next-day
courier service) to the inseminating physician's office for a next day
insemination - without freezing or even refrigerating the sample.
<P>Not only is damage from freezing eliminated, but the Test Yolk can actually
improve the sperm's ability to penetrate the egg. Unlike frozen sperm, semen
shipped in Test Yolk Buffer can be manipulated as if it were a fresh sample;
for example, it can be washed for intrauterine inseminations, if necessary.
<P>In addition to the superior quality of semen in Test Yolk Buffer, the
time and costs involved in inseminations for our out-of-town clients are
dramatically less than for frozen sperm. The Center's infertile couple who
did extensive research of their own on Test Yolk Buffer (since he was using
it himself), greatly contributed to the development of its use in our program.
We are delighted to announce that their research has proved fruitful and
they are currently expecting their first child.

believe that it is their constitutional right to create a child for an infertile
couple.
<P>Beginning in 1987, Ms. Jan Sutton, R.N. president of NASM, and several
other members of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers visited state
legislatures throughout the United States, appearing as expert witnesses
and disseminating information, advice, and experience in the area of surrogate
parenting from the surrogate's perspective.
<P>The philosophy of the National Association of Surrogate Mothers is that
surrogate parenting is a viable option for infertile couples and that the
practice must be regulated and controlled. The safeguards must be strict
and rigorous, and the professionals involved must be well trained, conscientious,
and at all times be held accountable. With the safeguards in place, surrogacy
not only is an option that should be available to infertile couples, but
it also has been an extremely successful method of creating a family.

<P>The Center for Surrogate Parenting is pleased to announce its tenth pregnancy
in the IVF/Host Surrogate Program, including one set of twins born in December
1988.
<P>We concluded 1988 with a total of 83 births. The year 1989 promises a
record number of deliveries in our traditional, non-IVF program (we have
18 pregnancies in progress), as well as our IVF/Host Surrogate Program and
the new Egg Donor Program.
<P>In 1988-89, under the direction of <A HREF=Hillbio.html>Dr. Hilary
Hanafin</A>, the Center participated in five separate, independent studies
on the various aspects of surrogate parenting, acting as a general resource
and providing statistics as well as professional opinions and recommendations.
These five studies are providing interesting insights and will be published
later this year.
<P>In 1987-88, The Center for Surrogate Parenting was joined by three new
members. Elizabeth Tilles, Program Coordinator at the Center, has had a child
delivered by a surrogate mother as well as personally having struggled through
the infertility maze including IVF. Carol Sanchez has joined us to work as
a psychotherapist with Hilary Hanafin, Ph.D. Ms. Sanchez has a degree in
Marriage, Family and Child counseling and is a former surrogate mother candidate
with our program. Janice Paur, our Administrator, struggled for years with
infertility herself, and with the help of a specialist, is happy to report
that she is now the mother of three sons.
<P>We invite inquires from anyone wishing to have any information of surrogate
parenting or using the Center as a resource regarding various aspects of
infertility.

<H4>ZIFT pregnancies
</H4><P>Dr. Richard Marrs of Los Angeles (Hospital of the Good Samaritan)
reports that he has achieved two successful ZIFT (zygote intra fallopian
transfer) pregnancies (out of four attempts) with Host Surrogate Mothers
from the Center's program. In addition, through his own programs, the traditional
IVF process, Dr. Marrs has achieved five pregnancies using frozen embryos.
<P>
<H4>IVF/Host Surrogate Mothers success rates
</H4><P>Dr. Jirair Konialian of Granada Hills Medical Group (Century City
Hospital) reports one of the highest success rates utilizing the IVF/Surrogate
process. Dr. Konialian also notes that preliminary statistics from throughout
the U.S. on IVF/Surrogate procedures indicate that these success rates are
not aberrational.
<P>
<H4>ZIFT without surgery
</H4><P>Using specially developed instruments, Dr. Ricardo Asch (University
of California, Irvine) has achieved a viable pregnancy by performing an
ultrasound guided low-tubal transfer of an embryo to the fallopian tube.
<P>
<H4>Retrospective study

<P>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE RESULTS OF <A HREF=Hanafin.html>THE SURVEY</A> CONDUCTED
ON SURROGATE MOTHERS AND COUPLES WHO HAVE COMPLETED THE SURROGATE PROCESS.
IT WAS PRESENTED TO THE AMERICAN PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION CONVENTION NEW
YORK ON AUGUST 28, 1987.
<P>This study included follow-up surveys that were mailed to surrogate mothers
who had relinquished a child and to couples who had received a child through
the surrogate process. The survey consisted of 25 questions, both short answer
and likert scale, that addressed their reactions to and thoughts about their
surrogacy experience. A questionnaire was mailed to the 37 sets of adoptive
parents who had received children from these surrogate mothers. Of the adoptive
couples, 16 responded.
<P>The infertile couples reported very little emotional discomfort due to
their having worked with a surrogate mother. Of the 16 couples, three reported
stress and discomfort concerning the artificial insemination process and
anxiety regarding achieving a conception, and three others reported that
they had wished they had been more involved with the pregnancy. The infertile
couples consistently reported that the child's genetic connection to only
one parent had very little influence on how they related to closeness and
understanding because of their genetic relation to the child. All of the
couples reported that they perceived the child as theirs, not as the surrogate's
or a child they feel is shared with the surrogate. It could be hypothesized
that the surrogate's and couples' shared perception that the child is the
couple's helps to minimize discomfort.
<P>Both surrogates and couples reported that they felt they had sufficient
contact with the other party. The twenty surrogates who responded all had
post-partem contact through the child's first birthday. Of the nine surrogates
for whom over two years or more has passed, all but one had contact through
the second year. Typically, the adoptive parents sent cards and photos at
Christmas and/or the child's birthday. Fourteen of the surrogates who
participated in the study reported that they had met face-to-face with the
couple and child at least once after saying good-bye at the hospital. Only
one couple reported any degree of fear that the surrogate will make uninvited
contact. Within this group of adoptive parents, 15 couples stated that they
plan to tell the child of its adoption, and one couple was uncertain as to
what they would do.
<P>The infertile couples and the surrogate mothers seemed to agree on several
points in this follow-up survey. None of the couples of the surrogate mothers
regretted their decision to participate in the program. Additionally, they
both reported that knowing each other was beneficial to their experience.
In the surrogate's reports, as well as in the couple's reports, the appreciation,
warmth, sharing, and knowledge of each other were helpful in making the
experience meaningful and enabled the surrogate to more easily relinquish
the child. They also predicted that knowing each other benefited the children
involved. For instance, both sample groups felt that surrogate mothers should
have a psychological evaluation prior to participation in such a program.
<P>This study suggests that contact between the individuals and the families
who have come together to create this child should be open. The contact appears
to provide a positive and communicative environment for all participants.
Furthermore, the open relationship helps to minimize secrecy and denial which
are detrimental to the children.

<P>Mental health professionals are being confronted by the new forms of
reproductive technology. Specifically, the surrogate mother, herself, challenges
many of our assumptions about human behavior. In this new arena psychologists
have had to question personal and theoretical beliefs regarding bonding,
attachment, loss, pregnancy and family. We are being called upon to collect
data, predict behavior, and counsel participants in the varying options available
to creating families.
<P>In an attempt to understand behavior and the effects of surrogate parenting,
two studies were conducted. They explored the perceptions of women volunteering
to serve as both the gestational and biological mother to the purpose of
relinquishing their parenting rights to an infertile couple.
<P>The first of the studies included 89 surrogates who were participating
in a surrogate mother program in the Los Angeles area. The program's staff
psychologist collected demographic information and statements regarding their
motivations to be a surrogate during an interview. The MMPI was also collected
and 376 items were used. The second of these studies included follow-up surveys
which were mailed to surrogate mothers who had relinquished a child and to
adoptive couples who had received a child through the surrogate process.
The survey consisted of 25 questions, both short answer and likert scale,
that addressed their reactions to and thoughts about their surrogacy experience.
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER>
<H3>Surrogate Mother Profile
</H3><P>
<P>The demographics of the 89 surrogate mothers can be summarized as follows.
The women had a mean age of 28 years and a mean of 2.0 children. The mean
number of years of formal education was 13. A ratio of five to one of the
women were anglo. Of the sample, four to one were currently married and three
to one had full-time employment. The vast majority of the sample had been
raised in a Christian faith, with 25% being Catholic. The Black and Asian
population and the Jewish heritage were nearly absent from this sample.
<P>Abortion and adoption occurred in the histories of the sample. Only three
participants had adoption as part of their history. Of these, one was adopted,
one had placed a child for adoption, and one had siblings who were adopted.
Of the surrogate mother sample, 37% had abortion in their history. Thirteen
percent of the women had had more than one abortion. For some, unresolved
feelings regarding these terminations were a factor in their desire to be
a surrogate.
<P>The motivations to become a surrogate mother are summarized in table one.
Enjoyment of the pregnant state and the desire to be pregnant again were
cited by the vast majority of surrogate mothers. These women uniformly described
their previous pregnancies as relatively easy. Being pregnant seemed to provide
an opportunity to feel special and to feel a sense of wholeness. They also
felt empathy for childless couples, an empathy increased by prior contact
with an infertile couple's pain and by the importance of children in their
own lives. A third motivation was the desire to do something remarkable with
their lives and make a unique contribution. Many perceived being a surrogate
as providing a sense of accomplishment. Financial gain was also cited but
consistently was not the primary motivating factor. The surrogates described
the fee as becoming less important as their relationship with the adoptive
couple increased. Of the participants, 12% indicated that being a surrogate
mother was an attempt to compensate for a prior loss in their history. The
most obvious examples were the surrogates who earlier had voluntarily terminated
a pregnancy and believed that creating a child for someone else may help
them resolve feelings regarding the termination.
<P>The mean scores and ranges of the MMPI are presented in figure 1. The
profiles were typically unremarkable with most scores falling within one
standard deviation of the midline. Only 7.9% of the surrogate mothers had
a clinical score above the 70th percentile. Overall, 2.3% had two clinical
scores elevated above the 70th percentile. Of the clinical scores, scale
1 had the lowest mean. Scale 0 had the widest range of the clinical scores,
from the 30th percentile to the 78th percentile. The correction scale was
especially notable and overall was the most elevated scale. Furthermore,
73.9% of the profiles had a F-K score of -11 or less. Because the MMPI was
taken during the women's screening process for acceptance into the program
the K score and the F-K score might be interpreted as the surrogate mothers'
tendency to be guarded and/or deny emotions in the hopes of making a good
impression.
<P>The individual MMPI profiles revealed no critical pattern typical for
this sample. Elevations of scales 1, 2, 8, 7 were notably absent from the
profiles. Scales 0, 6, 9, 4 and 5 were more present but were not significantly
elevated. In summary, it can be stated that surrogate mothers of this sample
do not exhibit pathology according to the MMPI.
<P>However, given the limitations of this measure, we must use other instruments
and techniques to understand the dynamics of the women who choose to be surrogate
mothers. Extensive clinical interviews and participation in support group
meetings, and additional tests are valuable tools in assessing surrogates.
It is important to explore both conscious and unconscious motivations so
to assess whether being a surrogate serves as a functional or dysfunctional
purpose for the participant and her family. Thorough assessment will prevent
collusion with pathology, exploitation, or unhealthy degrees of denial.
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER>
<H3>Follow-up Study
</H3><P>
<P>Of the participants in the study described above, 37 have relinquished
the child to the adoptive parents and are at least 10 months post-partum.
Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to 37 surrogates, 20 of whom responded.
A similar follow-up questionnaire was mailed to the 37 sets of adoptive parents
who had received children from these surrogate mothers. Of the adoptive couples,
16 responded. The responses are summarized in table two.
<P>The 20 surrogates who responded to the questionnaire ranged from 10 months
to 3 years post-partum. Their emotional adjustment since the relinquishment
of the child demonstrates two components. The first component being feelings
reported for approximately two weeks after birth. Four of the surrogate mothers
reported post-partum blues. Two of them mentioned longer term concerns. One
expressed concern about her daughter's adjustment to the relinquishment of
the child and the other expressed a concern about what the child might feel
toward the surrogate in the future. Secondly, surrogates reported missing
the contact with the adoptive parents and their special role as a surrogate
mother. some surrogates grieved the loss of pregnancy itself because it was
expected to be their last pregnancy. Additionally, several surrogates reported
that convincing others that she felt at peace with the relinquishment caused
periodic frustration. The questioning ad doubts expressed by some friends,
family, and acquaintances as to why she was not noticeably grieving were
bothersome.
<P>Grieving over the separation from the child was notably absent. The attachment
was most often greater to the couple than to the child. The surrogates'
perception that it was always "their child" is often based on the fact that
the child would not have come into being if it were not for the particular
couple's desire. the belief that the baby; was always the couple's child
minimized feelings of loss. Surrogates consistently described their feelings
of attachment for this child as different than their feelings for their other
children. Affection and care was expressed, but the bonding was described
as similar to attachment for a friend's or relative's child.
<P>All of the surrogates reported positive feelings since the birth of the
child. These included feeling satisfied, fulfilled, resolved, and better
about themselves. All felt surrogacy was beneficial for themselves. Five
reported an increase in confidence and an enrichment of their lives. Another
nine reported a stronger marriage and greater appreciation of family and
children. Five to two of the respondents were able to articulate a clear
positive influence on their lives by being a surrogate mother -- for example,
increased marital communication, being inspired to pursue further education
and increased individuation from extended family. They also reported that
their immediate family had adjusted better than their extended family.
<P>When the surrogates thought of the child they reported thinking mostly
of the adoptive couple's happiness. They also expressed curiosity at how
the child looks and how he or she has developed. Of the 20 surrogates who
responded, six to one perceived the child clearly as the couple's child.
Only 3 of the surrogates perceived the child as still shared by the couple
and by themselves. Overall, of the 20 who responded, there was a minimal
amount of emotional discomfort reported by the surrogate mothers in relation
to themselves and their children.
<P>The adoptive couples similarly reported very little emotional discomfort
due to their having worked with a surrogate mother. Of the 16 couples, three
reported stress and discomfort concerning the artificial insemination process
and anxiety regarding achieving a conception and three others reported that
they had wished they had been more involved in the pregnancy. The adoptive
couple consistently reported that the child's genetic connection to only
one parent had very little influence on how they related to the child in
general. Of the fathers, three reported feeling a greater sense of closeness
and understanding because of their genetic relation to the child. All of
the couples reported that they perceived the child as their child, not as
the surrogate's child or as a child they feel is shared with the surrogate.
It could be hypothesized that the surrogates' and couples' shared perception
that the child is the couple's child demonstrates denial which helps to minimize
discomfort.
<P>Both surrogates and couples reported that they felt they had sufficient
contact with the other party. The twenty surrogates who responded all had
post-partum contact through the child's first birthday. Of the nine surrogates
for whom over two years or more had passed, all but one had contact through
the second year. Typically, the adoptive parents sent cards and photos at
Christmas and/or the child's birthday. Fourteen of the surrogates who
participated in the study reported that they had met face-to-face with the
couple and child at least once after saying good-bye at the hospital. Only
one couple reported any degree of fear that the surrogate will make uninvited
contact. Within this group of adoptive parents, 15 couples stated that they
plan to tell the child of its adoption, and one couple was uncertain as to
what they would do.
<P>The adoptive couples and the surrogate mothers seemed to agree on several
points in this follow-up survey. None of the adoptive couples or the surrogate
mothers regretted their decision to participate in the program. Additionally,
they both reported that knowing each other was beneficial to their experience.
In the surrogates' reports, as well as in the couples' reports, the appreciation,
warmth, sharing, and knowledge of each other were helpful in making the
experience meaningful and enable the surrogate to more easily relinquish
the child. They also predicted that knowing each other benefitted the children
involved. The couples and the surrogates both want surrogate parenting legalized
so there will be appropriate restrictions and regulations on the process.
For instance, both sample groups felt that surrogate mothers should have
a psychological evaluation prior to participation in such a program.
<P>These studies are a beginning of necessary longitudinal studies on surrogates,
their families, and the children. the data presented agrees with the minimal
literature to date suggesting that surrogate mothers do not exhibit pathological
personalities and appear to function well both before and after the birth.
It further suggests that contact between the individual and the families
who have come together to create this child should be open. The contact appears
to provide a positive and communicative environment for all participants.
Furthermore, the open relationship helps to minimize secrecy and denial which
are detrimental to the children.
<P>New reproductive alternatives are now established, but it is mandatory
that we proceed with caution. Mental health professionals can assume a
significant role in evaluating, monitoring, and counseling within the new
programs. Psychologists can be helpful in preventing exploitation. The psychology
professional must assess for each individual where surrogacy constitutes
a constructive life step or where it is a collusion with pathology.
<P>However, in order to assist attorneys, physicians, and families, we need
to reassess the values, beliefs and assumptions of our culture and of our
profession regarding acceptable ways to create families. History suggests
that forms of surrogacy have provided acceptable alternatives in different
cultures and at different times in our history. Perhaps surrogacy will become
another behavior that we will come to understand as not pathological, but
as one that broadens the continuum and definition of what humans can think
and feel. Specifically, surrogacy may expand our knowledge about varying
degrees of attachment behavior between biological mother an child. We may
now have to question what is commonly perceived in our society as an absolute
attachment that every woman feels to every child she carries. The road ahead
is indeed a challenging one. Above all else, we must proceed with the children's
best interest as our primary concern.

<H3>Introduction
</H3><P>This paper presents a review of a new procedure involving gestational
surrogate mothers. The dramatic increase in vitro clinics and procedures
has logically extended to the transferring of embryos from an infertile couple
to a gestational surrogate mother. The first such gestational surrogate birth
was reported in 1987. Since that time there have been approximately 30 births
worldwide. Due tot he fact that the surrogates are implanted during unstimulated
cycles and are young women with successful pregnancy histories, it was
hypothesized that the success of in vitro fertilization will be greater when
working with gestational surrogates.
<P><A NAME=Foot1ret>The</A> legal, psychological, and medical dynamics of
such a solution to childlessness are indeed complex. There are few or no
laws that address legal issues of working with a surrogate mother and there
are few studies that outline the psychological risks and considerations.
This paper will outline the procedures of one center which specializes in
providing legal, psychological, and administrative services to all patients.
It outlines issues that any medical team should consider prior to becoming
involved in gestational surrogacy. Furthermore, the most current findings
on the pregnancies using in vitro fertilization donor findings on the pregnancies
using in vitro fertilization donor oocytes will be
presented.<SUP><A HREF="#Foot1">1</A></SUP>
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER>
<H3>Sample
</H3><P>The sample consisted of 22 infertile couples who came to the "Center
for Surrogate Parenting" in Los Angeles, California. These couples were of
childbearing age, but unable to conceive due to hysterectomy, malformed uterus,
extreme health risk of pregnancy, or unexplained infertility. Of the women,
17 ranged in age from 33 to 41 and 4 ranged in age from 42 through 47 years
old. All were medically determined to still be ovulatory.
<P>The gestational surrogate mothers consisted of 17 women who had met the
psychological and medical requirements of the Center. They all had histories
of uncomplicated pregnancies. Within this sample, 16 were under 32 years
of age and 1 was 36. All were medically determined to be fertile, healthy,
and with regular cycles.
<P>
<H3>Procedures
</H3><H4>A. Psychological
</H4><P>Surrogate mother applicants and their spouses underwent an orientation
and psychological screening process. Only women who had successful, uncomplicated
pregnancies and who had children of their own were interviewed. Each candidate
was told of the risks and demands of such a program. The orientation emphasized
informed consent regarding legal, medical, and psychological challenges.
The psychological screening process involved assessing their intelligence,
ability to keep commitments, social support systems, self-esteem, coping
mechanisms, sensitivity toward others, and stability. Furthermore, their
motivations and their expectations were fully explored. Candidates were only
accepted if they were motivated by factors other than money, and if they
foresaw being a surrogate as a personally rewarding experience.
<P>After initial interviews, selected candidates were given psychological
testing. They were required to attend the mandatory support group meetings
with other gestational surrogates. They were then medically evaluated for
fertility and general health (including social disease testing).
<P>The Center also provided a similar orientation for infertile couples,
with each couple meeting with the staff psychologist to assess appropriateness
for the program. Alternative solutions to childlessness, marital issues,
expectations, informed consent and stability were discussed.
<P>Accepted surrogate mother candidates and infertile couples were subsequently
matched and introduced to each other under the guidance of a staff psychologist.
Both sets of clients received psychological consultation throughout their
participation.
<H4>B. Legal
</H4><P>The surrogate and the Intended Parents have a legal relationship
because she is carrying a child pursuant to a comprehensive and sophisticated
contract that has been entered into. Prior to entering into this legal
relationship, both the surrogate and the Intended Parents must undergo a
full and comprehensive legal consultation with independent counsel. This
consultation includes a full description of the surrogate contract as well
as the possible liabilities, duties and responsibilities of each party. The
consultation includes an explanation of the ambiguous status of the contract
in the United States. Very few jurisdictions have ever passed laws on the
legality of surrogate parenting, and in particular, gestational surrogacy
has never been addressed by any legislative or judicial body. Because there
has never been a situation where a gestational surrogate attempted to renege
on her contract or a couple was not willing to go forth under the terms of
a gestational surrogacy agreement, the contract has never been tested.
<P>Once the surrogate and the perspective parents had been legally informed
of their rights and duties under the contract, a match was made and the parties
once again went through the process of reading the contract together. This
was done with the assistance of a video tape in which an experienced attorney
again explained in full the legal aspects of he relationship.
<P>Prior to the implantation, medical insurance was purchased on behalf of
the surrogate and life insurance policies were set into place on behalf of
the parties. The entire anticipated expense of the procedure, including medical
expenses, payment to the surrogate, legal, administrative and psychological
fees and all other anticipated miscellaneous expenses were placed in a trust
account.
<P><A NAME=Foot2ret>At</A> approximately the sixth month of pregnancy, a
legal petition was filed with the court of appropriate jurisdiction requesting
a judgment for maternity and paternity on behalf of the biological parents.
This legal action was initiated to establish the legal relationship between
the prospective biological parents and the child. With the granting of the
petition of maternity and paternity, the surrogate was deemed to have no
parental rights to the child and the biological parents were legally deemed
the natural parents of thee child (while in utero). This petition eliminated
the necessity of any adoption proceedings and legally recognized the intended
relationship that the parties had created. The legal document contains the
declaration of parentage and also orders the birth certificate be issued
with the names of the biological parents as the natural parents of the
child.<SUP><A HREF="#Foot2">2</A></SUP>
<H4>C. Medical
</H4><P>The doctor and patient decided whether the in vitro, ZIFT, of GIFT
procedure was to be utilized. In the first embryo transfer attempt, estrogen
and progesterone, along with HCC were used to synchronize the donor mother's
cycle with the cycle of the specified surrogate mother. For all subsequent
transfers, the donor mother took Lupron to help synchronize her cycle with
her surrogate's cycle. Typically, up to three embryos were implanted with
the ZIFT procedures and up to five embryos were implanted with the IVF procedure.
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER>
<H3>Results
</H3><H4>A. Medical
</H4><P>Of the 22 infertile couples, 21 of them underwent embryo transfer
procedures. One couple was unable to produce the necessary oocytes. 31 embryo
transfers into surrogate mothers were conducted. There were a total of 5
dropped cycles due to problems with synchronization of the two women's cycles
and 4 dropped cycles due to lack of proper oocyte development.
<P>Of the 31 transfers performed, 22 utilized the IVF procedure, 5 utilized
ZIFT, and 4 utilized GIFT procedure. (The GIFT and ZIFT procedures have only
been offered in the last year.)
<P>Of the 31 transfer attempts, 10 resulted in pregnancy. Of these pregnancies,
1 resulted from GIFT, 2 resulted from ZIFT, and 7 resulted from IVF. None
of the 5 transfers conducted on behalf of donor mothers who were over 41
years have been successful to date.
<P>Of the pregnancies achieved, 7 occurred on the patients first embryo transfer
attempt, 1 was achieved on the patient's second trial, and 1 occurred on
the patient's fourth trial.
<P>Currently, the status of the pregnancies is as follows: 4 have delivered
(one twin pregnancy); 2 are in the third trimester; 1 is in the second trimester;
1 is in the first trimester; and 2 of the pregnancies ended in miscarriage
at 9 weeks.
<P>The pregnancy rate for this sample group is 32% per transfer. The "take-home
baby rate" per transfer is 25.8%. Overall, of the 22 couples attempting to
end their childlessness thus far 8 of them will take home a baby, resulting
in a 27.5% of the patients.
<P>
<H4>B. Legal
</H4><P>All of the gestational pregnancies in the program resulted in successful
legal outcomes. These legal actions for maternity and paternity were filed
in four different counties in California. The courts have been inclined to
allow these as a matter of course. All have been granted with no opposition
and extreme ease. Therefore, the biological parents names were on the birth
certificates immediately with the gestational surrogate having no parental
rights.
<H4>C. Psychological
</H4><P>Of the four surrogate mothers who have delivered, all were able to
relinquish the child without grief reactions or ambivalence. All of the pregnant
surrogates appear to see themselves as clearly a gestational mother and have
not expressed a need or desire to keep the child. Furthermore, the surrogates,
pregnant experience and exhibited no regrets. being able to have contact
with the parents and with other gestational surrogates appear to be important
valuables in their psychological resolution.
<P><CENTER><A HREF=home.html>Return to CSP Home Page</A></CENTER>
<H3>Discussion
</H3><P>Although gestational surrogacy is in its infancy as an alternative
to infertile couples, it appears that with the proper protections and safeguards
it is an extremely successful method of creating a family. Obviously, many
infertile couples prefer a biologically related child, and the possibility
of gestational surrogacy allows the chance for these couples to fulfill this
important need in their lives.
<P>It is important to note that the success of gestational surrogacy is based
on a comprehensive program of protections for all parties. These involve
a very thorough legal grounding, as well as independent legal representation.
It is critical that the attorneys who are involved are well versed in the
area of reproductive technology law. The Center for Surrogate Parenting has
been successful in its petitioning of the California Courts to recognize
that gestational surrogacy needs to be viewed differently than other third
party solutions to childlessness. The need for thorough psychological screening
is essential for any successful program. It is impossible to underestimate
the need for a strong psychological base and well qualified psychological
experts in the field of surrogacy.
<P>It is this involvement of experienced professionals that minimizes the
medical team's responsibility and liability regarding the non-medical aspects
of surrogacy. It is important that the medical community be protected by
putting into place a comprehensive contract, appropriate insurance policies
and a mutual understanding between the parties. With all the professional
in place (the legal, the psychological and the medical), the risks involved
in gestational surrogacy are few and the potential is enormous.
<P>It is clear that placing embryos in young women with unstimulated cycles
results in a most favorable situation for pregnancy. The number of gestational
surrogate procedures is increasing dramatically. With a conscientious team
approach this alternative should be able to assist the infertile population
as well as provide further medical understanding into the variables of in
vitro, ZIFT, and GIFT.
<P><HR>
<P><SUP><A NAME=Foot1>1</A></SUP>The medical procedures reported were conducted
by Jirair Konialian, M.D., Century City Hospital, Los Angeles, CA, Jaroslav
Marik, M.D., Beverly Hills Medical Center, Beverly Hills, CA Richard Marrs,
M.D., Hospital of the Good Samaritan, Los Angeles,
CA.<SUB><A HREF="#Foot1ret">[Return]</A></SUB>
<P><SUP><A NAME=Foot2>2</A></SUP> This legal procedure is quite different
from the procedure involved when a surrogate is artificially inseminated.
Under these circumstances, a suit for paternity is filed on behalf of the
father and the infertile wife must subsequently adopt her husband's child.
The surrogate relinquishes all parental rights to the adoptive mother, thus
establishing a step-parent adoption
procedure.<SUB><A HREF="#Foot2ret">[Return]</A></SUB>

</H2><P>
Raising a child is one of the special joys of life.  Unfortunately, nearly one out of five couples is denied this experience because of problems beyond the control of the medical profession.
<P>
The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc. (CSP) is a world renown surrogate parenting and egg donation program located in Beverly Hills, California.  CSP was established because we strongly believe that couples who are ready and willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood deserve that opportunity.  Having a child with the help of a surrogate can be an exciting and fulfilling way to meet that need.  Unlike some alternative methods of creating a family, the surrogacy process allows a child to be biologically related to either one or (in the case of In-Vitro Fertilization) both parents.  It also gives the couple the opportunity to become involved in the pregnancy itself.  And finally, since their child is conceived only because of their own existence, the true genesis of the child is its creation in the minds and hearts of the couple.

<H2>How is our program different?
</H2>
The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), is very different from other programs because we rely so heavily on psychological screening.  On average, a potential surrogate is screened for 3-5 months before she is presented to couples.  During that time they are continually being monitored by the counselors and CSP staff members.  We want to make sure that a Surrogate Mother fully understands what she is entering into, so that each party (the surrogate, her family, and the couple) is protected.  During the screening process, the potential surrogate mother is given every opportunity to exit the program and break contract with the Center, without incurring costs to herself.  Additionally, we meet with the Surrogate Mother's husband/partner, to ensure he is supportive of her decision to assist a couple. We consider the decision to become a surrogate mother to be a family decision.   Her husband/partner will also be asked to undergo full social disease testing.
<P>
We are also unique in the comprehensive manner in which we approach a surrogacy arrangement.  We combine each of the aspects (legal, psychological, financial, screening, and medical coordination) into a complete program, and then take it one step further.  Each week, we have a staff meeting in which all of CSP staff members, as well as the counseling team, and the attorney meet and discuss every active client, one by one, to ensure that everyone is kept updated, and that nothing is overlooked.  The ability to unite all of these aspects is what makes us such a strong team.  All members of our team have a long term working relationship together.
<P>
Per a client who did extensive research of the surrogacy programs in the U.S., and then chose CSP, "None of the other programs placed the emphasis your Center does on caring about and protecting each person involved in the surrogacy relationship."

<dt><B>A Surrogacy Program Tailored for Your Needs</B>
<dd>There are three surrogate programs, and deciding which is right for you
is an individual, and usually medical, pyschological, and financial decision.
<P>
<DD><B>Artificial Insemination Program</B>
<DD>The Surrogate mother's egg is used and she is artificially inseminated at an infertility clinic.  Following the successful insemination, pregnancy and birth, the Surrogate releases the baby to the couple for stepparent adoption by the husband's wife.  The husband is already the biological (natural) father.
<P>
Couples who generally choose this program have usually undergone a full hysterectomy; or have a genetic condition making the use of their own eggs not a viable option;  or have an immunilogical condition (i.e. are allergic	 to one another); or wife's eggs are no longer viable and will not create a viable pregnancy; or they cannot afford in vitro fertilization.

<DD><B><A HREF=Costai.html><img src="/art/redball.gif" border=0> Estimated Costs of Artificial Insemination Program</A></B>
<P>
<DT><B>In-Vitro Fertilization Program</B>
<DD>The couple will create embryos using their own eggs and semen, then transfer the embryos to the Host Surrogate Mother.  Typically, the Couple and Surrogate's cycles are synchronized to facilitate the transfer of fresh embryos and thus optimize the chance of a conception.  When there are more embryos than necessary for a single cycle, remaining embryos can be frozen for use in a later cycle, thus making the procedure more cost effective. Following a successful implantation, pregnancy and birth, the Surrogate releases the baby to the biological parents, whose names appear on the original birth certificate, if the birth occurs in the state of California.  There is no need for adoption procedures.
<P>
Couples who generally choose this program have, or can create viable embryos, but experienced problems with implantation;  or had a partial hysterectomy but have viable ovaries; or she was born without a uterus but has ovaries; or is a DES exposed woman; or has an incompetent uterus.

<P>
<DT><B>In-Vitro Fertilization/Egg Donation Program</B>
<DD>An Egg Donor provides an ovum for fertilization by the sperm
of the couple. The resulting embryos belong to the couple and are transferred
to a Host Surrogate Mother. The Surrogate releases the baby to the Intended
Parents, and parental rights are established.

<center><HR WIDTH=560></center>

<B>PHASE 1: TO BEGIN THE PROCESS:</B>
<UL>
<li>Contact the Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP), if you would like our information booklet, or review the information we have on the Internet.

<li>Call CSP to make an appointment for a consultation. This is a 4-6 hour consultation during which you meet one on one with a counselor, the attorney, and each member of our staff.  There is a $400.00 flat fee for this consultation.  ($200 for CSP and $200 for the counselor's consultation).  No documents are signed and no commitments made by either party.  This consultation gives CSP the opportunity to teach you about the reality of surrogacy  and ensures you understand surrogacy prior to your committing to signing retainers with our program.
<li>After the consult, we will provide you with our Retainer Agreements .  We request you do not retain us the same day, but take these retainers home to review the documents.  Once you are comfortable with all the legal issues, and you wish to retain CSP, the next step would be to  sign and mail the Retainer Agreements along with the retainer fees.

</UL>

<B>PHASE 2: THE MATCHING PROCESS:</B>

<UL>
<li>There is usually a waiting period between the time a couple retains CSP and when a couple selects their surrogate mother. (although it varies, 3-8 months is average, depending upon which program you enter, and your criteria.  We will keep you informed of the current wait period).  During this waiting period, CSP is processing surrogate mothers through the program (psychological and medical screening, etc.,), as well as ensuring the couples file is complete. 
<li>Preparation for matching
<ul>
<li> Couple writes profile for presentation to surrogate mothers, along with photographs.
<li>HIV testing for Intended Parents and Surrogate and her husband
<li>Semen analysis
<li>Genetic analysis
<li>STD lab results when close to matching.
</ul>
<li>Your surrogate mother is completing our screening process (psychological, medical, background, etc) and her cycles are being monitored with the use of ovulation kits.
<li>The Match with your surrogate
<ul>
<li>Couple and surrogate receive profiles of each other
<li>Once you have selected one another, a meeting is arranged with your  counselor present
<li>Contracts are drafted, Surrogate has independent legal counsel, and contracts are signed.
</ul>
<li>Financial - Trust account held by CSP must be established before any medical procedures take place. Detailed ledgers are sent to couples every month showing the status of the trust account.  Couples are always welcome to visit our offices to review their file and at any time can request a copy of their file.
</UL>
<B>PHASE 3: MEDICAL PROCEDURES:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Artificial Insemination Program
<UL>
<LI>Surrogate monitors ovulation to plan for inseminations
</UL>
<LI>In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) Program
<UL>
<LI>Begin medications for synchronization of cycles and preparation for
embryo transfer
</UL>
</UL>
<B>PHASE 4: THE PREGNANCY &amp; BEYOND:</B>
<UL>
<LI>During the pregnancy, couples remain in contact with their surrogate
about every two weeks.
<LI>Couples usually visit their Surrogate several times during pregnancy
and attend the ultrasound to get their first pictures of their baby.<BR>
<LI>The process of establishing your legal parental rights begin during second
trimester of pregnancy.
<LI>Couples are almost always present at the birth, &amp; begin parenting
immediately.
<LI>Contact after birth should include pictures and letters, cards at the
holidays and birthdays are also appropriate.

<DT><B>How long have you been in business?</B>
<DD>The Center for Surrogate Parenting & Egg Donation, Inc., (CSP)  has been in business since 1980.
<P>
<DT><B>How many births have you had?</B>
<DD>CSP is proud of our over 428 births as of December 1995, and  we currently have 36 ongoing pregnancies (41 babies due).  In 1994 we celebrated 67 births!

<P>
<DT><B>What are the advantages of a fully comprehensive program?</B>
<DD>CSP approaches surrogacy as a team effort. The professionals
involved have worked together for many years, and with many hundreds of clients.
Each person is able to voice their opinions, brainstorm with the other
professionals, and decide what will be in the best interest of the couples
involved. In our program, it is not just one persons opinion that counts.
<P>Every week the entire staff meets to discuss activity on every clients'
file. We feel this time spent together sets us apart from other programs.
This is a strength and indicative of our commitment to our couples. Each
professional brings a different perspective, allowing more in-depth coverage
of cases and preventing details and issues from being missed.
<P>
<DT><B>Have you ever had a surrogate mother change her mind and keep the baby?</B>
<DD>No, in our over 428 births, we have never had a surrogate mother change her mind. The actual number of cases gone to court are less than 17 in
the entire country, but none of these have come from our program.
<P>
<DT><B>How do I finalize my parental rights?</B>
<DD>Couples are represented by independent legal counsel. We hold your
hand throughout the process, and no couple in our program has ever failed
to finalize their parental rights, regardless of the State the couples resides
in.
<P>
In the Artificial Insemination program, the surrogate mother's name and the Natural/Intended Father's name appears on the birth certificate.  The couples then returns to their state of residence and competes the step-parent adoption needed to finalize the Intended Mother's legal parental rights.
<P>
In the In Vitro Fertilization program, the names of the natural father and natural mother (the couple who donates their egg and sperm), will appear on the original birth certificate.
<P>
<DT><B>Are surrogates and donors medically and psychologically screened?</B>
<DD>Both couples and surrogate mothers and their husbands, or egg donors and their husbands, are medically and psychologically screened In our program.
<P>
<DT><B>How am I matched? and Will I meet my surrogate?</B>
<DD>Once a surrogate mother has been psychologically and medically screened,  completed her criminal background search and has medical insurance in effect, she is ready to be presented with couple's profiles to begin the selection process.
Generally a surrogate mother will receive 2-3 profiles of couples.
If she selects a couple, her profile is mailed to that couple for their consideration.
A couple could therefore receive one, or two or more profiles, depending on whether they were selected by a surrogate mother.
Couples then have the opportunity to review the profile(s), knowing they have already been selected by the surrogate mother(s).
The counselors are on hand to assist couples in the selection process.
If none of the profiles are acceptable to the couple, their information is sent to other surrogate mothers and the process continues.
Through our selection process you are only presented with candidates that meet our requirements and are finished with their screening process.
Most of the applicants do not pass the screening process, and their profiles are NOT presented to couples.
Basically, we do not believe in presenting a couple with a hypothetical	 candidate.
CSP recognizes that couples have been through a lot, and we are cautious to protect couples.
<P>CSP is an "open" program.  This means that couples will meet their surrogate mother prior to any medical procedures being undertaken.
Our selection process allows surrogates to select her couple and couples to select their surrogate mother.
The final choice regarding selection is the couples!
We consider it to be our responsibility to your child to ensure that he/she fits in with the "look" of your family and that you feel very positively about your surrogate mother.
By giving you the final say as to whom you are matched with, gives you the power to decide what is in your best interests.  
<P>Couples participate in the pregnancy as much as is comfortable for them.  Most couples try to attend some doctor appointments and all couples are present for the birth of their baby.
<P>
<DT><B>Is a trust account established? What if my surrogate mother asks for
additional funds?</B>
<DD>CSP is the administrator of the contract and deals with all the financial issues, taking the burden away from the couple.  This allows the couple and the surrogate mother to concentrate on the pregnancy, and prevent any awkward conversations regarding finances or reimbursements. 
<P>CSP is very concerned about protecting our couples and surrogate mothers.  We hold full trust funds sufficient to cover expenses throughout the pregnancy.  Physicians and surrogate mothers are therefore guaranteed their fees.  Should a couple file for bankruptcy, divorce or both die, while their surrogate mother is pregnant, she will not be left with any bills.  All payments are guaranteed for the trust account.
<P>Compensation is very clearly dictated by the contract which is signed by both the couple and the surrogate mother and her husband.  All parties are represented by independent legal counsel and therefore all Parties have a clear understanding of the financial considerations and have expressly agreed to abide to these considerations in writing.
<P>Each month the Intended Parents will receive a ledger detailing the financial activity in their account.  CSP has a Trust Administrator whose responsibility it is to administer clients trust funds, verify and process surrogate mother's expenses and doctor's bills.
<P>
<DT><B>How many staff members do you have?</B>
<DD>CSP has eight staff members and we work closely with four full-time independent counselors, and couple's independent legal counsel.  All staff members are cross-trained, therefore if one staff member is ill, or takes a vacation, the other staff members can take over the case.  Our weekly staff meetings enables each staff member to keep abreast of the status of each client.
<P>
<DT><B>What is your screening process for surrogate mothers?</B>
<DD>Potential surrogate mothers go through a three to five month evaluation, including psychological testing, interviews, genetic evaluation, criminal background and driver license search, social disease testing including HIV, and a medical evaluation by a fertility specialist.  Surrogate mother does not incur any costs whatsoever throughout the process.  Therefore at any time, if a surrogate mother decides  not to continue in our program, she can walk away without incurring a financial burden.  If a surrogate mother decides to stay with our program, it is because she wants to continue and is dedicated to assisting her couple.
<P>
<DT><B>Do you offer counseling?</B>
<DD>Yes, CSP is associated with four full time independent counselors who have each had over 8 years experience in counseling surrogate mothers and infertile couples.  We provide full counseling before, during and after the birth.  Counseling is available to couples and surrogate mothers for as long as you need the counseling.
<P>CSP offers group support meeting for surrogate mothers.  These meetings are held once a month.  During support group your surrogate will get the opportunity to meet other women who are in various stages of participation in our program.
<P>
<DT><B>How much will surrogacy cost?</B>
<DD>Generally, traditional surrogacy will cost $42,000-$46,000.
Gestational surrogacy costs about $45,000 depending on
the number of retrievals and transfers attempted.
<p>The above figures reflect all anticipated expenses including compensation
to the surrogate, all medical and laboratory fees, psychologist fees, legal
retainers, advertising costs for surrogate mothers, life insurance, medical insurance, etc. The figures above reflect accurate costs from the time you enter our program to the time you are at home with your child, and parental rights are finalized.
<P>
<DT><B>How much will Egg Donation cost?</B>
<DD>To get started in our Egg Donation program, a fee of $500 is paid to the counselor.  ONLY if you select an egg donor and agree to work with her and she agrees to assist you, are additional fees due.
<P>Non-medical costs for egg donation include:
<UL>
<LI><TT>$1,500.00 </TT>Administration & advertising fees - payable to CSP
<LI><TT>$1,000.00 </TT>Psychologist ($500 to begin process, $500 once matching has occurred)
<LI><TT>$2,500.00 </TT>Egg Donor compensation
<LI><TT>$ &#160;750.00 </TT>Attorney fees for Intended Parent's legal counsel, includes contracts
<LI><TT>$ &#160;250.00 </TT>Egg donor attorney fees, includes review of contracts
</UL>
<P>
<DT><B>What if I have my own surrogate?</B>
<DD>CSP recommends a legal and psychological clearance consultation that is offered by independent legal counsel and independent counselors.  For a $500.00 fee, Intended Parents and their potential surrogate mother and her partner, can meet with an attorney and counselor for education and an evaluation. 
<P>CSP does offer to coordinate private arrangements and offers full case management.
<P>
<DT><B>Are you too far away?</B>
<DD>No, on average 20% of our clients live in Australia, Japan, England & Europe.  A large number of our clients live on the East Coast.  Distance to a program should not be as important as the skill level of the people who work for the program, and their yeas of experience.  The  majority of our surrogate mothers live in the State of California.  CSP is located in California because of  the positive political and legal climate California offers.  We are located in Beverly Hills because this location allows us to be ideally geographically located with regards to the infertility doctors, counselors and attorneys.

<DT><B><I><A HREF=WhosWho.html>ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF:</A></I></B>
<DD>
Our administrative staff coordinates between Surrogate, Intended Parents, doctors, psychologists, laboratories, hospitals and attorneys.  (Doctors, psychologists, attorneys are independent professionals.)  Our skilled staff ensures that all necessary steps are taken and full documentation is in place prior to medical procedures.  CSP obtains all necessary legal clearances, monitors all aspects of the program, including disbursement of all expenses on behalf of the Intended Parents, and furnishes a full accounting to all parties.  We encourage all our clients to stay in close contact with our offices during this process.
<P>
<DT><B><I>INFERTILITY SPECIALISTS:</I></B>
<DD>
CSP works in conjunction with recognized infertility specialists who utilize advanced reproductive technologies.  These specialists are independent of CSP.  Infertility Specialists examines and verifies that the Surrogate is healthy, fertile and capable of having a normal, healthy child.  This medical examination is thorough, comprehensive and includes testing for venereal diseases, AIDS, and other conditions which may affect the health of the child or the Surrogate Mother.

Candidates are comprehensively evaluated and tested.  In addition, every Surrogate entering the program attends mandatory counseling sessions from initial screening through post delivery.  These sessions include both monthly group support meetings with other Surrogates and individual attention by the counselor.  Group support sessions include new candidates, pregnant Surrogates and post delivery Surrogates.

<H3>Dear Karen,
</H3><P>Being an egg donor has been a very special experience. Since I was
a teenager I wanted to do something that would make a difference in someone
else's life. Helping a mature\responsible couple have a baby who are unable
to conceive seemed an excellent way to fulfill my desire.
<P>The process requires time, involvement, perseverance, and personal dedication.
I was very fortunate because my family was completely supportive. At times
I questioned my involvement in the procedure because I had to devote myself
to helping a couple (that I didn't know) have a baby.
<P>As a mother of two beautiful children I understand the longing to be parents
and I hope that my personal involvement will help the recipient couple realize
their dream to have a family. Personally I feel happy with the decision I
have made and which that each one of us would do something positive to make
a difference in this world.
<P>

<P>Dr. Elaine Gordon, Ph.D. is a Clinical Psychologist with a specialty
in infertility, child development, reproductive medicine and third party
family-building. Besides her role as a therapist and group facilitator working
with patients struggling with fertility related issues, she lectures on various
topics surrounding the psychology of reproductive medicine. Dr. Gordon is
the author of <A HREF="NewsF95.html#Mommy">Mommy, Did I Grow in Your Tummy?
Where Some Babies Come From</A>, a children's book dedicated to explaining
a child's unique reproductive beginnings.
<P>Her professional associations include The American Psychological Association,
The American Fertility Society, and the Pacific Coast Fertility Society.
She is currently serving as Education Chair for the Psychological Special
Interest Group of the American Fertility Society. Dr. Gordon's clinical work
include therapy and group for couples and individuals, staff training for
programs involved in reproductive medicine, and third party screening and
evaluation matching donors and recipients for egg donation and/or surrogacy.
She counsels birthmothers and prospective parents who are considering adoption.
<P>Dr. Gordon is well versed in both the medical and psychological aspects
of reproductive medicine utilizing third parties. Her involvement in egg
donation and surrogacy programs has stimulated an interest in the issues
surrounding secrecy and disclosure in third party parenting. Related to the
disclosure/nondisclosure issue is the need to assess the advantages and
disadvantages of open versus closed donation policies. Dr. Gordon is currently
involved in several research projects investigating the psychological implication
of using egg and/or sperm donation as a means of building families.

the names of the legal father and adoptive mother.<BR>

<DL>
<DT>Trust Funds in the amount of $600-800.00 for the court filing

<P>     <B>Robert M. Stern</B>, Professor of Economics and Public Policy,
received his Ph.D. in economics from Columbia University in 1958.  He
was a Fulbright scholar in the Netherlands in 1958-59, taught at
Columbia University for two years, and joined the faculty at Michigan in
1961.  He has been an active contributor to international economic
research and policy for over 35 years. He has published numerous papers
and books on a wide variety of topics, including international commodity
problems, the determinants of comparative advantage, price behavior in
international trade, balance-of-payments policies, and the computer
modeling of international trade and trade policies.  He has been a
consultant to and done research under the auspices of the Office of the
U. S. Trade Representative, the Departments of Labor, State, and
Treasury, the Senate Committee on Finance, National Commission of
Employment Policy, the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, the Economic Council of Canada, the Economic Commission for
Latin America and the Caribbean, and the World Bank.  He has
collaborated with Professor Deardorff for nearly two decades in
developing the Michigan model of world production and trade. This is a
computer-based model which has been used to study a variety of important
policy issues such as the effects of the GATT Multilateral Trade
Negotiations, changes in the structure of protection, trade and
employment, changes in military expenditures, and the effects of changes
in exchange rates.  He is currently working with Drusilla Brown (Tufts
University) and Alan Deardorff on the computational modeling and
analysis of multilateral and preferential trading arrangements.


<P>     Professor Stern is co-director of the Research Seminar in
International Economics, and he teaches a variety of undergraduate and
graduate courses in international economics in the Department of
Economics and in the School of Public Policy.  He is also currently head

<P>     <B>Thomas E. Weisskopf</B>, Professor of Economics, received his
Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1966.  He taught at the Indian Statistical Institute in New Delhi
(1966-68) and at Harvard University (1968-72) before joining the faculty
at the University of Michigan in 1972.  In 1973 he helped to establish
the graduate field of Political Economy and since then he has taught
courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level in economic
development and macroeconomics as well as Marxian economics and
political economy.


<P>     Professor Weisskopf's early research focused on issues of third
world development and underdevelopment, with particular attention to
South Asia.  In the late 1970s, his research interests shifted to the
macroeconomic problems of advanced capitalist economies; in particular,
he undertook studies of trends in productivity growth and profitability
from a neo-Marxian political-economic perspective.  In recent years he
has been working on problems of Economic transition and instructional
development in the formerly socialist economies of the East,
concentrating especially on the interaction between political and
Economic change in contemporary Russia.


<P> Professor Weisskopf is co-author and co-editor (with Richard Edwards
and Michael Reich) of <U>The Capitalist System: A Radical Analysis of
American Society</U> (Prentice-Hall, 3 editions, 1972, 1978, 1986), and
co-author (with Samuel Bowles and David Gordon) of <U>Beyond the Waste
Land: A Democratic Alternative to Economic Decline</U> (Anchor
Press/Doubleday, 1983) and <U>After the Waste Lane: A Democratic Economics
For The Year 2000</U> (M.E. Sharpe, 1990). He has contributed numerous
articles to journals such as the <I>American Economic Review</I>, <I>The
Cambridge Journal of Economics</I>, and <I>The Review of Radical Political
Economics</I>.  He is currently working on a collaborative project to
develop an introductory economics textbook for use in Russia. 


<P>     <B>Warren C. Whatley</B>, Associate Professor of Economics, 
received his Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1982 and joined the
faculty at Michigan in 1981.  His primary research interests are in
economic history and he has published several influential papers dealing
primarily with the economic and institutional transformation of the
American South since World War I.  His new research is on black workers
in industrial labor markets since World War I. Recent publications
include &quot;Getting A Foot in the Door: Learning, State-dependence and
the Racial Integration of firms,&quot; <I>Journal of Economic
History</I>, 1990; &quot;Southern Agrarian Labor Contracts as
Impediments to Cotton Mechanization,&quot; <I>Journal of Economic
History</I>, 1987; and &quot;A History of Mechanization in the Cotton
Plantation South,&quot; <I>Quarterly Journal of Economics</I>, 1985.


<P>     Professor Whatley teaches undergraduate courses, graduate
courses and seminars on American economic history, political economic
theory and race, racism, and ethnicity.  He has been Associate Dean of
the Horace H. Rackham School of Graduate Studies since 1992.

University of Chicago, University of Tilburg, the University of Munich,
the University of Wisconsin, the University of Warsaw and Tel Aviv
University.  She also taught in the A.E.A.'s Economics Training Program
in Beijing during the fall semester of 1986, and held a Fubright
fellowship in Poland.  She was a board member of the A.E.A.'s Committee
on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) from 1984-87,
and a member of the advisory panel to the Law &amp; Social Sciences
Program at the National Science Foundation from 1987-89.  She is an
editorial board member of <I>Land Economics</I>, <I>Journal of the
American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association</I> (AREUEA),
<I>Journal of Real Estate Economics and Finance</I>, <I>Journal of Urban
Economics</I>, and a member of the Board of Directors of the Social
Science Research Council.


<P>     Among her recent articles are &quot;The Corporate Bankruptcy

The Econometrics Lab, located in room 142 Lorch Hall, has been providing
graduate students and faculty with state-of-the art computing facilities
since 1993.  The lab has both PC's and Unix-based Sun workstations, and
the latter can be accessed remotely from anywhere on campus or at home via
modem.  Supported econometric software includes Gauss, SAS, RATS, LIMDEP,
Shazam, TSP, and Stata.  Other programming languages and compilers and
word processors are also available.  Mathematica is also available in the
lab.  The lab employs two consultants to help students and any graduate
student is eligible for an account in the lab.

<H2>General Facilities And Special Programs</H2>

<H3>Sumner and Laura Foster Library</H3>

The <A HREF="">Sumner and Laura Foster Library</A>
combines the library collections of
the Department of Economics and the School of Public Policy.  Housed on
the second floor of Lorch Hall, the Foster Library's primary purpose is
to serve the faculty and graduate students in the two units. The Foster
Library's collection focuses on materials in the field of international
development, public policy, and economics.  While the majority of the
collection is comprised of journals and working papers collected from
the U.S. and abroad, it also contains books, dissertations, reference
works, and foreign and U.S. government documents.  In addition to
providing access to library materials and maintaining its collection,
the Foster Library offers reference and information services, casual
reading and study areas, and course reserve materials.

<A HREF="http://rsqe.econ.lsa.umich.edu/">
<H3>Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics</H3>
</A>

The Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics (RSQE) is an integral
component of the econometrics program in the Department of Economics. 
The Seminar provides the student with an opportunity to combine the
study of econometric theory with the practice available from an ongoing
research project in econometric analysis.  The RSQE sponsors two
principal activities in which qualified students are welcomed as
participants and through which Research Assistant appointments are
available.  One activity is centered around the RSQE's econometric
models of the U. S. economy and the economy of the State of Michigan and
includes 1) a forecasting program which produces quarterly forecasts of
the economy, 2) a program of structural and policy studies concerned
with the dynamics of the economy as represented by the econometric
model, and 3) continual research aimed at improving the specification of
the models.  The other principal activity involves basic research on
econometric technique and its application to substantive economic
problems.  General supervision of seminar projects is provided by the
faculty associated with the RSQE. Doctoral dissertations are frequently
generated by the research carried out under RSQE auspices.

<H3>Center for Research on Economic and Social Theory</H3>

The Center for Research on Economic and Social Theory (CREST) serves as
the central forum for those faculty and students whose primary interest
is in economic theory.  CREST holds weekly seminars in which original
research of resident faculty and students or innovative work in economic
theory which has recently appeared in the economic literature is
discussed.  Many of the papers discussed in the seminar are subsequently
duplicated and distributed as CREST discussion papers to members of
Economics departments at other universities. The Center also brings to
Michigan a number of guest lecturers from other universities.  Although
it is located in the Economics Department, membership in CREST is not
limited to economists, but includes members of the Mathematics,
Political Science, and Philosophy departments as well.

<H3>Research Seminar in International Economics</H3>

The seminar is a research and training facility located in the Department
of Economics.  The seminar program includes the formulation of international
economic theory, the empirical testing of hypotheses implied by the theory, the
measurement of quantitative international economic relations, and the analysis of
evaluation of significant problems of policy and the operation of international
economic institutions.  The seminar meets weekly under the direction of
Professors Stern, Deardorff, and Levinsohn.  Research results usually are
published in journals or edited volumes.

<H3>Area Centers</H3>

The University engages actively in certain Area Studies, with special
emphasis on China, Japan, the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, Western
Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and the Near East and North Africa.  A
variety of programs and courses is offered covering economic, political,
historical, and cultural studies of these areas.  In the Department of
Economics, Prof. Li has worked on issues relevant to both Chinese and
Eastern European economic issues, and Prof. Adams specializes in Western
Europe, especially France.  Prof. Porter has done field work in
Colombia, Pakistan, Kenya, Indonesia, and India.  Prof. Saxonhouse
specializes in the Japanese economy. In addition, many other faculty
have worked in particular countries at one time or another. 
Interdepartmental seminars are carried on in several of these areas.

<H3>Japan Economy Program</H3>

The Department of Economics maintains the national headquarters of the
Committee on Japanese Economic Studies which is chaired by Professor
Saxonhouse and which has received extensive funding from foundations and
corporations in both Japan and the United States.  At Michigan, the
Committee sponsors the Japan Economy Program.  Graduate student
participation in the research and training activities of the Japan
Economy Program is encouraged through special seminars and research
assistantships.  For students with fluency in Japanese or the aptitude
and inclination to undergo further language training, a limited number
of multi-year fellowships are available. During the past few years, the
Department of Economics has received a number of grants designed to
facilitate the training of specialists on the Japanese economy.  For
further details, contact Professor Saxonhouse (313-764-3296).


<H3>Center for Russian and East European Studies and Center for Chinese
Studies</H3>

The Center for Russian and East European Studies and the Center for
Chinese Studies provide a comprehensive multi-disciplinary program of
courses in area studies and language training.  They award graduate
fellowships, some of which have been held by economics students in
recent years.  The Centers' research projects sometimes provide research
assistantships for graduate students.  In addition, the Centers maintain
reading rooms with current publications on the area and sponsor many
lectures and seminars by leading scholars from various countries.  For
further details, contact Professor Li (313-763-9561).

<H3>Committee for Comparative and Historical Research in the Market
Economies </H3> 

The Committee for Comparative and Historical Research on
the Market Economies (CCHROME) is a unit within the Department of
Economics.  CCHROME serves as an institutional locus within the
University for comparative and historical economic research on Japan,
Western Europe, the United States, and other market economies.  Graduate
student participation in the research and training activities of CCHROME
is encouraged through seminars and research assistantships.  For
students with research interests related to CCHROME activities, some
fellowship support is available.  In addition, special multi-year
fellowships are available from the Committee on Japanese Economic
Studies for which CCHROME maintains the national headquarters.  For
further information, contact Professors Adams, Saxonhouse, or Whatley
(313-764-5567).


<A HREF="http://www.isr.umich.edu/src/">
<H3>Survey Research Center</H3>
</A>

The Survey Research Center of the 
<A HREF="http://www.isr.umich.edu/">
Institute for Social Research</A> engages
in extensive economic research, especially in the field of consumer
behavior.  A number of advanced graduate students in the Department of
Economics participate in the research program of the Center on a
part-time basis.  Through this work many students receive first-hand
experience and training in the increasingly important application of
survey research methods to economic problems.  There are also full-time
positions as Assistant in Research for those who need to take time out
from classes to accumulate funds while learning research methods.  The
Center's archives of survey data can provide a useful source of
materials for doctoral dissertations.  For further information, contact
the Survey Research Center, Institute for Social Research
(313-763-5186).


<A HREF="http://psc.lsa.umich.edu/">
<H3>Population Studies</H3>
</A>

The Populations Studies Center is an interdisciplinary center that
conducts research and training activities in demography, with an
emphasis on the interrelations between population studies and other
social sciences.  An economic demography graduate training program has
been run jointly by the Population Studies Center and the Economics
Department since the 1960s, providing fellowship support to economics
Ph.D. students interested in the connection between economics and
demography.  The program supports 6-8 economics Ph.D. students per year.
 Students may combine economic demography with any other fields in
economics, with many students choosing labor economics, public finance,
or economic development.  Students in the program are given office space
at the Populations Studies Center and have access to the computing and
other research support facilities at the Center.  Economics faculty with
appointments at the Center are John Bound and David Lam.  Students who
wish to obtain further information should contact Professor David Lam,
coordinator of the Training Program in Economic Demography
(313-998-7275)


<A HREF="http://www.spp.umich.edu/">
<H3>School of Public Policy</H3>
</A>

Programs of study leading to a master's or doctoral degree in Public
Policy are offered by the School of Public Policy.  For the master's
degree, the student normally completes the required course work in two
academic years and satisfies a practicum requirement during the
intervening summer.  In addition to economics, required courses in the
program deal with political science, organization theory and
quantitative methods.  Several of these courses are open to interested
economics students.  Interested students should contact the School of
Public Policy, 440 Lorch Hall (313-764-3490).


<A HREF="http://www.bus.umich.edu/resource/otp/tax.html">
<H3>The Office of Tax Policy Research</H3>
</A>

The Office of Tax Policy Research is housed in the School of Business
Administration and is directed by Professor Slemrod, who has a joint
appointment in Economics and the Business School.  Faculty associates of
the Office come from the Economics Department, the Business School, and
the Law School.  It sponsors several tax-related activities, including a
tax policy lecture series, conferences on issues of current interest,
joint research projects, research seminars, a tax database and a
dissertation fellowship. Several graduate students hold research
assistantships with the Office each year.  For further information,
contact Professor Slemrod (313-936-3914).

<H3>Joint Program in Law and Economics</H3>

A small number of exceptionally well-qualified applicants are admitted
jointly to the Graduate School and the Law School and permitted to
pursue a program leading to both the Ph.D. degree in economics and the
J.D. degree.  The program can be completed in five calendar years but
most students take longer.  The program requires simultaneous
application to both the Law School and the Economics Department.  To be
eligible for consideration for this program, the applications must be
submitted no later than January 15.  Interested students should write to
the Admissions Office, University of Michigan Law School, for further
details (313-764-0537). Financial aid is available on an equal basis
with continuing Ph.D. economics students.  Other aid is occasionally
available from the Law School.

<H3>Joint Program in Social Work and Economics</H3>

A program of study leading to the doctoral degree in Social Work and
Economics is available.  Course requirements will be planned for each
student to include economic theory, statistics, and public finance or
labor economics. The student must pass preliminary examinations in
economic theory and in public finance or labor.  For other requirements
and additional information, students may write to the Supervising
Committee for the Doctoral Program in Social Work and Social Science,
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~socwk/ssw.html">
School of Social Work</A> (313-763-5768).

<H3>Joint Program in Statistics and Economics</H3>

A joint program is available with the Department of Statistics leading
to a Master's in Statistics and a Ph.D. in Economics.  A doctoral
student specializing in econometrics may obtain a Master's in Statistics
by completing Statistics 501, 510, 511, 531 or Stat 526 with Economics
775, 776 and two other approved statistics courses at the 500 level or
above.  For further information on this program, contact the
Chairperson, 
<A HREF="http://www.stat.lsa.umich.edu/netsc-index.html">
Department of Statistics</A> (313-763-3519).


<H3>Graduate Economics Society</H3>

The Economics Society plays two roles in the graduate program. First, it
serves as the vehicle for student participation in the decision-making
processes relating to the graduate program itself. Second, it sponsors
various activities designed to broaden the outlook and perspective of
students as prospective economists.  The Society also helps new students
acquaint themselves with the Department and with life in Ann Arbor.

<P>The Society is an informal organization and all graduate students are
automatically members.  In recent years, student representatives have
played a significant role in the development and reorganization of the
graduate program.  The faculty has shown its interest in securing the
opinions of students and the Society has contributed to student-faculty
communications.

<P>The President of the Society and a second elected representative
attend departmental meetings and the President attends meetings of the
Departmental Executive Committee.  Other student representatives are
members of the Departmental Graduate Program Committee, the Admissions
and Fellowships Committee, and the Committee on Speakers.

<P>The Economics Society sponsors an orientation program for new
students and assists them in familiarizing themselves with Ann Arbor,
the University, and the Department.  Other social affairs are sponsored
by the Society during the year.


<H3>Conference on the Economic Outlook</H3>

The Department of Economics and the Institute for Social Research
jointly sponsor the annual Conference on the Economic Outlook.  This
Conference takes place each November and is attended by a large number
of business, academic, and government economists.  The program consists
of formal lectures and round-table discussions dealing both with the
short-term economic outlook for the coming year and the economic and
social setting over the longer run.  A continuing feature of this
Conference is a forecast for the U.S. economy in the year to come, made
on the basis of the econometric model developed by the Research Seminar
in Quantitative Economics.

<A NAME="Reach">
<H3>I.  Requirements to Reach Candidacy
</H3>
</A>
	The following courses and exams are required of all students in
order to reach candidacy:
<P>
<OL TYPE="A">	
<LI><B>Mathematics and statistics courses</B>:  All students must receive
at least a B- in each of Econ 653, 654, 673, and 674.  A student can place
out of any of these course requirements, however, by passing a placement
exam at the beginning of the relevant course during the student's first
year in the program.
<P>
<LI><B>Core theory courses</B>:  Normally, each student will take Econ
601, 602, 603, and 604 during the first year in the program.  Students
with additional time commitments, e.g. due to English language courses or
GSI responsibilities, may be allowed by the Director of Graduate Studies to
postpone Econ 602 and Econ 604 until their second year in the program. 
Students are required to pass a prelim in each area of theory by May one
year after the relevant coursework is completed.  If a student has still
not passed a theory prelim by this May, but has passed the other theory
prelim by that date, then that student will be allowed one more chance
during the following September.  <EM>However, if a student's GPA at the 
end of the first year is below 5.0, then in order to remain in the 
program that student must pass by September starting the second year all 
theory prelims for which the relevant coursework was completed during the 
first year.</EM> 
<P>
	Students are required to take Econ 601-604 for credit and cannot
register for a theory prelim until the associated course work has been
completed.  The only time a student can take a theory prelim without
having taken for credit the two associated theory courses is in May of the
first year or September of the second year.  If a student does so, then
the prelim must be passed by September of the second year to remain in the
program.  If the prelim is passed, then the requirement to take the
associate courses for credit is waived.
<P>

<LI><B>Major fields</B>:  Each student is required to pass a prelim in
each of two major fields.  Prelims can be taken each May and September. 
Normal preparation for each prelim is a two-course sequence in that field. 
<EM>Both prelims must be passed by May of the student's fourth year in the
program.</EM>
<P>

<LI><B>Other course requirements</B>:  
<OL TYPE="1">	<P>
    <LI>Each student must receive at least a B- in a course in a third
    "minor" field.
    <P>
    <LI> Each student must take two "cognate" courses, which are courses
    (approved for graduate credit) in another department of the University. 
    These courses can be cross-listed in the Economics department.
    <P>
    <LI>One of the student's three fields (the two major and one
    minor) must be either <I>Advanced Theory</I> or <I>Econometrics</I>.
</OL>
<P>
<LI><B>Available Fields</B>:  The current list of approved fields consists of:
 Advanced Theory, Economic History, Econometric Theory, Industrial
Organization, International Economics, Labor Economics, Monetary Theory,
Population Studies, Public Finance, and Transition Economics.  If the
Department, due to staffing limitations, is able to offer only one course
in a field, then that field can only be used to satisfy the "minor" field
requirement.  If no courses are offered, then that field cannot be used to
satisfy Departmental requirements.  However, when a course in one of these
fields is not offered, the Director of Graduate Studies, in consultation
with members of the relevant field, has the power to approve an
alternative course, taught outside the Department, or approve a reading
course with one of the members of the Department.
<P>
	While the Department discourages use of other fields, a student
may petition the Director of Graduate Studies to substitute a field not
included in the above list.  To do so, the following procedure must be
followed for a major field:

<OL TYPE="1">	<P>
    <LI>Two faculty members in the Economics Department must be found
    to sponsor the field.
    
    <LI>These faculty members should, together with the student, draw
    up a reading list appropriate for a two-course sequence in the proposed
    field.  In some cases, these courses may be based on regular courses
    offered outside the Department, supplemented where appropriate.
    
    <LI>These faculty members should agree to supervise these two courses,
    and agree to write and grade a preliminary exam in the field.
    
    <LI>The student should submit the reading list to the Director of
    Graduate Studies, along with a one-page petition describing why this
    alternative field is important for the student's education.
    
    <LI>This material will be circulated to all members of the Graduate
    Program Committee.  Unless objections are received from a majority of the
    members within a month, the petition will be approved.  Otherwise, the
    student can meet with the committee to try to convince a majority to
    approve it.
</OL>
<P>
	For a proposed minor field, the same rules should be followed,
except that only one faculty member is needed, and there would be no
prelim.
<P>
<LI><B>Teaching and research experience</B>:  Each student is required to
spend the equivalent of one year in a half-time teaching or research
assistant position.
</OL>

<A NAME="After">
<H3>II.  Requirements after Reaching Candidacy</H3>
</A>

<OL TYPE="A">	
<LI><B>Third year paper</B>:  All Ph.D. students are required to enroll
in Econ 695-696 during their third year.  In these courses, each student
is expected to complete a research paper of "publishable quality" with the
assistance of an assigned faculty supervisor.  The paper should be no more
than twenty-five pages long.  Each paper must be approved by two faculty
supervisors, on a pass/fail basis.  If the supervisors disagree on the
grading as of September of the student's fourth year or later, then the
student can ask the Director of Graduate Studies to appoint a third reader
whose word is final.  A failed paper can be revised and resubmitted, but
only three separate submissions of a paper will be considered.<P>

<LI><B>Seminar registration</B>:  All 4+ year students are required to 
enroll for one of the field seminars are are encouraged to enroll at the 
earliest possible time when their schedules permit.  Students registered 
in a seminar should participate actively in the seminar to merit course 
credit and are urged to present their own research to the seminar.  The 
specific requirements for each seminar will be chosen by the faculty 
running that seminar.  When students in 4+ find it difficult to register 
due to financial constraints or conflicts with other course commitments, 
they must seek a waiver from the Director of Graduate Studies. <P>

<LI><B>Proposal defense</B>:  Each student must successfully defend a
thesis proposal before a committee approved by the thesis chairman,
preferably including four faculty members.  A student must have
successfully defended a proposal to be ranked in Group 1 for GSI
eligibility in a student's fifth year, to be ranked in Group 2 in the
student's sixth year, and to be ranked in Group 3 in later years.<P>

<LI><B>Final thesis defense</B>:  If the final thesis defense occurs more
than seven years after the student first enrolled in the Department, then
the Director of Graduate Studies must approve the awarding of a degree.<P>

<A NAME="TAships">
<H3>III.  Rules for Assignment of Graduate Student Instructors</H3>
</A>

<OL TYPE="A">
<LI><B>Eligibility for a GSI assignment</B>:  
<P>
<OL TYPE="1">	
    <LI>All students <I>must</I> enroll for the required GSI training course
    during the first term of employment or become ineligible for a GSI
    assignment during the subsequent term until the training has been
    completed.  Students who have taken the CRLT International GSI
    workshop are <I>not</I> exempted from this requirement.
    <P>
    <LI> Foreign-born students who currently have a score on the ELI exam of
    4- on the grading scale of 1-5 are ineligible for a GSI assignment.
    <P>
    <LI>Foreign-born students scoring 4- on the ELI exam must obtain a
    4P rating from CRLT's IGSI workshop to be eligible for a GSI assignment. 
    All that is promised is that among students with a 4P rating, we will
    attempt to assign in priority order.
    <P>
    <LI>Students must have passed the theory prelim for any courses
    taken in their first year by May of their second year in order to be
    eligible to teach in the fall of their third year.
    <P>
    <LI>Students must have passed all theory prelims by May of their
    third year in order to teach in the fall of their fourth year.  
    <P>
    <LI>Students who are required to pass a theory prelim in September
    of their 2nd or 3rd year in order to remain in the Ph.D. program are
    ineligible for GSI assignments in the fall semester of that year.
    <P>
    <LI>Students who did not submit an acceptable third-year paper by
    May of their fourth year are ineligible for a GSI assignment.  
    <P>
    <LI>Students who have received from LSA at least tuition plus a
    quarter-time stipend for a teaching or research assistant position during
    at least ten semesters, not including spring or summer, are no longer
    eligible for a GSI assignment.
    <P>
    
    <LI>If a student has taught at least twice and the student's latest 
    average teaching evaluation score on question 298 ("Overall, my 
    [graduate student] instructor is an excellent teacher") is below 
    2.75, he or she cannot teach the next semester, and can teach after 
    that only if they have participated in some approved CRLT training.  
    (First-time GSIs are exempt from this rule during their first 
    semester teaching.)  If a student has any evaluation score
    lower than 3.00 in any section in the previous semester, the GSI must
    accept the supervision of CRLT personnel to continue teaching in the
    subsequent semester.  The most recent TA rankings will be used to
    determine any term's GSI assignment.  GSIs with an average ranking below
    3.00 who do not accept CRLT supervision will not be assigned a GSI
    position.
    <P>

    <LI>Students whose latest TA evaluation is below 3.00, or who have not
    taught before, are ineligible to teach during the spring or summer
    semesters.
    <P>
    <LI>In response to severe complaints about a GSI from the faculty
    member in the course, a GSI may be disallowed from teaching the following
    semester, or allowed to teach only with the assistance of CRLT personnel. 
    When a faculty member is unhappy about the performance of a TA, the first
    step will be to inform the GSI of the nature of the problem in 
    writing, so that the GSI has a chance to rectify the problem.  The 
    faculty member should also inform the Graduate Chair and the 
    instructors in the Department's GSI training course.  If the problem 
    is severe enough, current GEO rules provide for remedies during the 
    semester.  In any case, if the faculty member recommends that the GSI 
    not be allowed to teach the following semester, the case will go to 
    an ad hoc committee composed of the Graduate Chair, the Associate 
    Chair, and the instructors in the Department's GSI training course.
    <P>
    <LI>Students with a GPA below 5.00 are ineligible to be GSIs.
    <P>
    <LI>GSIs assigned to Economics 101 and 102 are required to attend
    all staff meetings and lab training sessions in addition to meeting
    scheduled sections, lecture section, and office hours.  The GSI will be
    warned only once and if these obligations are not met and problems
    continue, as determined by the faculty in charge of the course, the
    student will be ineligible to be hired for a term.
    <P>
    <LI>All other applicants are eligible.

<H2>GUIDE TO THE BUREAUCRACY</H2>
<EM>
	Information about how to navigate the rules and <BR>
	regulations of the Ph.D. Program in Economics.
<P>
(The contents of this document were last modified on July 31, 1996.)
</EM>
</CENTER>

<P>	This guide presents a variety of information about requirements
and bureaucratic matters relating to the Ph.D. program in economics.  It
is important to remember that a number of funding possibilities outside
the University require students to be advanced to candidacy and/or to
have successfully defended a proposal and/or completed a Master's
degree.


<P>     Any questions in regards to the graduate program, particularly
material not covered in this guide but which should have been, should be
addressed to Mary Braun in Room 250 Lorch.  Also ask those questions that
remain about the material covered.  Now just sit back, relax, and
discover the wonderful world of bureaucracy.

<A NAME="Prelims">
<H3>Prelims</H3>
</A>

<P> 	Prelims are given twice a year, May and September.  All students must
register if they are going to take either a field or theory prelim by the
deadline, which is typically a month or so before the exam.  The
registration and deadline are announced via e-mail and posted on flyers
outside the Graduate Student Lounge and Room 250.  It is necessary for
students to register in order to be assigned a number (the prelims are
graded blindly) and in the case of field prelims, to determine which field
committees need to be formed.  There is no penalty for registering and
then not taking the exam.  It is best to inform Mary Braun if you will not
be taking the exam so that no one is kept waiting for you to show up, but
even that is not required.  Prelims must be passed on the schedule
outlined in the <A HREF="rules.html">&quot;Rules and Regulations of the
Graduate Program&quot;</A>.  You are encouraged to take advantage of every
opportunity you have to take a prelim. 

<P> The number under which you registered will be on the copy of the exam
that is given to you.  You use that number on your bluebook (you're
responsible for bringing the bluebook, not the department) instead of your
name as well as the name of the field and the date. In the case of the
macro and micro prelims, you are asked to answer each question in a
separate bluebook.  This is not necessary for the field prelims.  The
prelims are often photocopied to be read by faculty outside of Ann Arbor
(particularly during May) so you are encouraged NOT to write on both sides
of the page, to use ink, and to write clearly. 

<P> Prelim results are announced in a letter from the Director of Graduate
Studies or the Chair.  This letter is held in Room 250 to be picked up for
about two days (announcement that the letter is available goes out on
e-mail).  Any letters not picked up in that time are mailed out to the
address left with Mary Braun.  You can also call or e-mail her for results
if you wish.  Students who know they will be out of Ann Arbor before the
results are available can have their letter mailed immediately.  You can
also request your letter be picked up by whomever you designate. 

<P> Prelim grading timelines vary considerably across fields and across
individual committee members.  Results have been announced in as soon as a
day and as long as four weeks.  Individual results are not posted. 
Pass/fail rates are posted. 

<P> Students can pick up copies of past prelims for review at any time in
Room 250.  The micro and macro theory prelim answers are also available. 
Written answers to the field prelims are not prepared and therefore not
available. 



<A NAME="Cogs">
<H3>Cognates</H3>
</A>

<P>     Every student advanced to candidacy and/or awarded a Master's
degree in Economics must complete two cognate courses.  This is a
Rackham requirement.  Econ 673 counts as one cognate since it is
cross-listed as Stat 505.  You do not need to register the course as
Stat 505 to get cognate credit.  Most LS&amp;A departments give graduate
credit for any 400-level course they offer to students outside their own
discipline.  You may need to register for that course for graduate
credit, however, to have it count as a cognate.  Sometimes, taking a
400-level course for graduate credit involves additional work.  Students
should check with the department that is offering the course to confirm
that the course 1) is approved for graduate credit and 2) if there is
additional work required of students taking it for graduate credit.


<P>     Any undergraduate course that has been approved for graduate
credit, any graduate course in another department, or a cross-listed
graduate-level economics course will fulfill this requirement.  The
requirement is to complete 4 hours of cognate work.

<A NAME="MA">
<H3>Master's Degree</H3>
</A>

<P>     Students have finished a Master's degree in Economics if they
have taken two theory courses (601-604); Econ 653, 654, 673, and 674 or
the equivalency exam in those courses; two cognate courses; and two
field courses.  The field courses can be either a sequence or two
distinct fields.  You must have 30 credit hours on your transcript to be
awarded a Master's and have at least a B (5.00) GPA.


<P> 	Students are encouraged to apply for a Master's as soon as the
appropriate course work is complete.  Many fellowships offered outside the
department and summer internships require applicants to have completed a
Master's degree.  In addition, you will want to note on your CV (resume),
that you have completed a Master's degree.  You can only do this if it is
posted on your transcript.  <EM>It is only posted on your transcript if
you applied and received it.</EM> If you do not apply for it when you
first complete the coursework, you can still apply any term after that. 
However, the date you apply for the degree is the one posted on your
transcript; it will not be back-dated to the date you actually finished
the Master's degree course requirement. 


<P>     Application forms are available by the bulletin board outside
Room 250 Lorch and should be turned into that office.  If the
application is turned in less than two months before the degree is
granted, you will still receive the Master's, but your name will not be
printed in the Convocation program.  Degrees are awarded for April,
August, and December.


<A NAME="Reg">
<H3>Registration after you've completed the required coursework but
before candidacy</H3>
</A>

<P>     All students working as a Graduate Student Research Assistant,
Graduate Student Instructor, or Staff Assistant must be registered for at least
six hours during the term of their appointment, regardless of the
fraction of that appointment.  If you have completed all the required
coursework but are not a candidate, you can register for Econ 990 with a
selection from 1 to 8 hours.  If you don't want to enroll for anything
but Econ 990, you would register for 6 hours.  If you have one course to
take, you can register for 3 hours of Econ 990 which brings your
registration for that term to 6 hours.  Again, you have to fill in the
<A HREF="#Fac">section number</A> of the faculty you will be working on your
pre-dissertation research.  You should both have the same understanding
of just what this pre-dissertation research will encompass during the
term since the faculty will be turning in a grade sheet at the end of
the term for this course.


<A NAME="Fac">
<H3>Faculty Section Numbers</H3>
</A>

<P>	Every faculty has a section number assigned and a list of those 
numbers is posted on the bulletin board across from room 250 Lorch.


<A NAME="Ind">
<H3>Independent reading course</H3>
</A>

<P>     Any student who has worked out an independent reading course
with an appropriate faculty member registers for Econ 700, the 
<A HREF="#Fac">section number</A> of the faculty, and a selection of 1 to 8 
credit hours (typically 3 credit hours).


<A NAME="Visit">
<H3>Visiting a course</H3>
</A>

<P>     You can enroll in any graduate economics course as a visit
instead of credit.  Each faculty determines the parameters of the visit
status for their own course and it is important that you talk to the
faculty prior to enrolling.  Your transcript will list the course grade
as VI.  The VI never turns into a grade or figures into your grade point
average.  The same tuition charge is assessed for a visit as it is for
courses taken for credit.

<A NAME="Inc">
<H3>Incompletes</H3>
</A>

<P>     Individual faculty are responsible for setting the incomplete
policy for their own course. You must talk to the faculty to come to an
understanding that an incomplete will be given for any particular course
and just what remains to be completed.  There is no time limit for
completing the work unless imposed by the faculty.  The faculty turns in
an I on the grade sheet and that I appears as the grade on your
transcript.  Once the work has been completed, that I is crossed out on
the transcript and the grade you received is posted beside it.

<A NAME="Trav">
<H3>Travel Grants</H3>
</A>

<P>     Rackham provides some travel grant money for students who are
delivering a paper at a conference.  The money for this program is in the 
process of being transferred to the department and details about the 
program will be publicized when they become available.  The Department 
will award $150 plus 1/2 of the remaining travel expenses up to $300 if a 
student is presenting a paper at the meeting of a recognized economic 
organization.  The department travel award is available only once to
students over the course of their program and can't be used to give or
attend seminars at other universities.


<A NAME="RAs">
<H3>Research Assistantships</H3>
</A>

<P>     Research assistants are hired on an <I>ad hoc</I> basis by individual
faculty using whatever criteria they feel are appropriate.  Research
assistants at .25 fraction and above receive a full tuition waiver,
GradCare health insurance, and a stipend based on their fraction.  Most
research assistants are hired by word of mouth among the faculty and
they are the best source of information about who among them have such a
position available.  Occasionally, a research assistant position will be
posted on e-mail, outside Room 250 Lorch, or outside the office of the 
faculty advertising the position.

<A NAME="GSIs">
<H3>Graduate Student Instructors</H3>
</A>

<P> Graduate Student Instructors are hired by the graduate program in the
procedure outlined in the <A HREF="rules.html">
&quot;Rules and Regulations of the Graduate Program&quot;</A>.  
GSIs are hired by term.  Applications are typically available outside of
Room 250 Lorch early in April for the following fall term.  If you are
interested in teaching only in the winter term, check with the graduate
program office in October.  There are only a few GSI positions available in
the Spring or Summer term and only those with prior teaching experience
are eligible. 

<A NAME="Hour">
<H3>Graders and Hourly Employees</H3>
</A>

<P>     Faculty often advertise for Ph.D. students to work as hourly
employees or graders. Graders differ from GSIs because they are not
working the same set of hours every week of the term.  Many times an
advertised research assistant position is really a temporary hourly
position. Although the duties fall under a research assistant title, the
position is only funded to allow a student to be paid <I>X</I> number of
dollars per hour and the student turns in the number of hours worked on
a bi-weekly basis.  If you are offered either of these positions, you
must complete the necessary paperwork in the Main Office, Room 238 Lorch
before you can be paid.

<A NAME="Cand">
<H3>Candidacy</H3>
</A>

<P>     To be advanced to candidacy, Ph.D. students in economics must
have the following requirements completed:

<OL>
    <LI>Passed the micro theory prelim

    <LI>Passed the macro theory prelim

    <LI>Passed two field prelims
    
    <LI>Completed Econ 653, 654, 673, 674 with a grade of B- or
	above or passed the equivalency exam

    <LI>Completed two cognate courses with a grade of B- or above.
	If you have taken Econ 673, this counts as a cognate since it is
	cross-listed as Stat 505.  You do not have to be registered in Stat 505
	to get credit for this as a cognate.

    <LI>Completed a course in either Econ 675, 677, 775, 776, or
	75X with a grade of B- or above
</OL>


<P>     The graduate program office prepares the paperwork for Rackham
for students to be advanced to candidacy.  It is a good idea to let the
office know when you have completed the requirements (or within a term
of completing) just to make sure that the paperwork is being done.


<P>     The term you get advanced to candidacy, you register for 8 hours
of Econ 995.  The <A HREF="#Fac">section number</A> should be the faculty 
member who is the chair of your committee.  (The list of faculty and their 
numbers is posted on the bulletin board across from Room 250 Lorch.)  Since 
few folks know who this is the first term they are advanced to candidacy,
you should enroll with a faculty member in your major research field.
Always check with the faculty you have chosen before you register.  Each
faculty has their own expectation of what dissertation research involves
in any given term.  Since the faculty turn in a grade sheet (marked
S-satisfactory or U-unsatisfactory) at the end of the term, <B>it is very
important that both of you understand just what constitutes satisfactory
progress during the term</B>.


<P>     If you are registering before your candidacy paperwork has been
processed through Rackham, you must register for 8 hours of Econ 990
with the same section number procedure outlined above.  Once the
registrar gets notice via the computer from Rackham's database, your
election will automatically be changed to the correct Econ 995
registration.


<P>     Why get advanced to candidacy as soon as you can:  to save
money.  Candidacy fees are substantially less than out-state tuition.
Even if you are not picking up the tab, graduate students who are
candidates are much more attractive hires for faculty recruiting
research assistants since the tuition charge is less.  In addition,
several fellowship programs and internships require applicants to be
candidates.  The department encourages students to become candidates as
soon as possible in their academic careers.


<P>     Candidates can enroll for one free course every term.  You can
take this free course for credit or as a visit.  Candidates are
encouraged to enroll for the field seminar that is most appropriate for
their research interest each term.  If there is a term in which the
candidate enrolls only for dissertation research, you can enroll for two
free courses in any subsequent term.  You can not register for two free
courses the first time you become a candidate with the expectation that
you will not take any courses in the next term.  If a student enrolls
for Econ 995 and two courses in the first term of candidacy or when they
have not &quot;banked&quot; a course from a previous term, the student
will be charged full-time out-state tuition.

<A NAME="Def">
<H3>Proposal Defense</H3>
</A>

<P>     All students must defend a proposal by September 30 of the year
they go on the job market.  What is a proposal?  It is whatever your
committee, and particularly your committee chairperson, says it is.  The
proposal defense is entirely within the province of the department.
Therefore, you do not need to be registered for the term in which you
defend your proposal. There is, however, a proposal defense form that
your committee completes and returns to the graduate program office. The
student must also turn in a copy of the proposal to the graduate program
office.


<P>     The graduate program recommends that all members of the
dissertation committee attend the proposal defense.  However, this is
often not the case.  Many proposal defenses do not include one or more
members of the committee due to scheduling difficulties or uncertainty
over the cognate member.  The dissertation chair determines what
constitutes appropriate attendance at the proposal defense.  The advice
of the graduate program office would be to caution the student that it
is important that all members of the dissertation committee be clear
about the topic and the direction of your research.


<P>     A proposal defense can be graded as a Pass; Pass II, subject to
approval of suggested minor changes; Provisional Pass, subject to
approval of major changes; and Rejection.  A student expecting to go on
the job market must have obtained either a Pass or Pass II at their
proposal defense.


<P> 	In order to remain in Group 1 for a graduate student instructor
position, a student must successfully defend his or her proposal by the
beginning of the fifth year. 

<A NAME="Comm">
<H3>Dissertation Committee Membership</H3>
</A>

<P>     All dissertation committees must have at least four members.  At
least two of those must be faculty in the economics department.  You can
have as many committee members (over the four required) that you think
appropriate.  However, you should be aware that the more committee
members, the greater the likelihood of encountering scheduling difficulties.
You must have one cognate member on your committee.  The cognate member
must have a regular appointment in a Rackham department.  You can have
members of your committee that are not associated with the University or
with a Rackham department, but they can not be the sole chair of the
committee or the cognate member.  Every member of your dissertation
committee must have a Ph.D.


<P>     Your dissertation committee must be approved by Rackham.
Typically, the graduate program office completes the paperwork once you
have defended your proposal using the names listed on the proposal form.
However, if you defended your proposal without a complete committee,
this can't be done.  There is no notification to your dissertation
committee members that they have been nominated or approved for this
service.  A dissertation committee can be changed at any time.  Rackham
requires all students to have their dissertation committee approval
forms completed prior to a format check.

<H2>Creating your own Homepage</H2>

These instructions are for faculty and graduate students with an account
in the Econometrics Lab.  Other UMich users should refer to 
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/hpgw/how-to-homepage.html">
these instructions</A> for creating their own homepage.
<P>
<HR>

<P>By popular demand, the World-Wide Web server has been updated
to allow users to make their own home pages.


<P>Simply make a directory called <B><CODE>public_html</CODE></B> in your
home directory, and make sure that that directory, the documents in it,
and your home directory are permitted world-readable (since, after all,
you are letting the world read them on the web).  You don't have to permit
the files in your home directory to do this, but other users on the system
will be able to see what files you have (except for IFS files, since IFS
does permissions by directories only, not by files!). 


<P>To do this, type <B><CODE>chmod 755 ~</CODE></B> (note the tilde) and
<B><CODE>chmod 755 public_html</CODE></B>, as well as <CODE><B>chmod 644
filename</CODE></B> where <B><CODE>filename</CODE></B> is the name of any

<A NAME="Intro">
<H3>INTRODUCTION</H3>
</A>
  
     The graduate programs in economics at The University of Michigan
offer preparation for the wide range of careers now open to professional
economists in academic, business, and government sectors.  The
Department's faculty and graduates have long been involved in leading
developments in research and teaching and in governmental economic
policies.  The graduate programs are designed to continue this tradition,
by providing their students with rigorous analytical and practical
training.  <P>
     The Department offers two major programs, one leading to the Ph.D.
degree in Economics, the other leading to the Master of Arts degree in
Applied Economics (MAE).  <P>
     The Ph.D. program in Economics at Michigan has a long history and
many distinguished alumnae and alumni.  Designed primarily to train
professional economists, its emphasis is on the theoretical core of the
discipline, and its applications together with the essential research
skills.  In order to ensure that the quality of students is high and that
they have close contact with the faculty, new enrollment each year is
limited to about twenty-five entrants.  Most elective classes are small
and permit extensive class participation.  The sequence of core courses
provides an intensive basic preparation in the discipline, while advanced
courses, seminars, and research opportunities are offered in a wide
variety of specialized fields.  <P>
     The doctoral student will ordinarily devote the first two years to
coursework, independent reading, and preparation for the preliminary
examinations. The theory exams are normally completed by the end of the
first year or at the beginning of the second, and the applied field exams
by the end of the second year or at the beginning of the third.  The
remaining years are devoted primarily to the dissertation.  The time
required to write a dissertation varies so widely that it is difficult to
generalize about it.  For those who work part-time as teaching assistants,
it normally takes three to four years.  <P>
     The Master's program in Applied Economics, as the name implies, is a
policy-oriented program, with emphasis on the application of economic
tools and concepts to practical problems arising in a variety of fields. 
Enrollment is limited to about twenty new entrants each year.  Students in
this program ordinarily require one year to complete their work.  <P>
     The integrated programs of study and research described in this
brochure are designed to bring students into the mainstream of modern
economics by offering them the opportunity to work with leading scholars. 
The programs are also designed so as to provide substantial flexibility in
setting up a course of study fitted to the student's interests.  They
offer the student distinguished--in some cases, unique--resources in each
of many specialized fields and techniques.  <P>
     The Department also participates in a rich variety of
inter-departmental programs, including survey research, population
studies, natural resources, health economics, urban studies, law and
economics, social work and economics, and regional studies.  <P>
     All these programs naturally endeavor to develop high skills in
analysis, research, and expression.  But they aim also to encourage the
student's originality and independence of mind in seeking out and
contributing to economic issues of genuine significance. 
<P>

<A HREF="#Contents"><EM>(Back to Table of Contents...)</EM></A>
<P>

<H3>THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF DOCTOR OF PHILOSOPHY IN ECONOMICS</H3>
 
     Admission is limited to students whose undergraduate record shows
genuine capacity for advanced work in the field of economics.  A full
economics major is not a prerequisite, but some previous training in
economics is essential (the intermediate level micro- and macroeconomic
theory courses are the most important).  Training in calculus, linear
algebra, and probability and statistics is also essential and grades
received in these courses are important factors in the admission decision. 
When appraising an applicant's scholarly promise, however, the faculty
looks not merely at the academic record but also at letters of
recommendation and the results of the Graduate Record Examination. 
Successful applicants will be those who appear strong by all these
criteria.  <P>
     The student can best prepare for graduate work in economics by taking
a broadly-based undergraduate program that includes liberal arts,
mathematics, and the natural and social sciences, rather than simply
accumulating credits in a large number of economics courses.  In
particular, prior work in advanced mathematics (especially calculus,
linear algebra, and mathematical statistics) can dramatically ease the
student's program during the first year and eliminate some required
courses. Because modern economics is highly quantitative, students without
sufficient mathematical preparation often have great difficulty completing
the program.  <P>
     In addition to the general requirements of the Graduate School,
students are expected to meet various departmental requirements.  These
are always under review and subject to revision.  The following paragraphs
summarize the present requirements. 
<P>
 
<A NAME="PhD1">
<H4>The First Year</H4>
</A> 

     A student's first year in the program is devoted to the core
curriculum.  A full course load would be: 

<PRE>  Fall Term                     Winter Term

  Econ 601 (micro theory)       Econ 603 (micro theory)
  Econ 602 (macro theory)       Econ 604 (macro theory) 
  Econ 653 (mathematics)        Econ 654 (mathematics) 
  Econ 673 (statistics)         Econ 674 (econometrics) 
</PRE> 

<P> Those
who are well prepared in mathematics or statistics may satisfy some or all
of the math and statistics requirements by passing equivalency exams. 
Some students may be advised to postpone one of these courses, typically
macroeconomics or statistics, until the second year.  For example,
first-year students holding teaching assistant positions normally take
three courses, as do foreign students who are required by the English
Language Institute to take supplementary courses in English.  <P>
     Preliminary exams are given each May and September in both
microeconomics and macroeconomics.  All students are required to pass each
exam within a year of completing the respective course.  In addition,
students who do not place out of the math and statistics courses must
receive a least a B- in each of these courses. 
 
<A NAME="PhD2">
<H4>The Second Year</H4>
</A>
 
     During the second year, since most students are teaching assistants,
the normal course load is three courses.  Most students complete any
remaining courses from the core curriculum during the second year, and
then take a two-course sequence in each of two "major" fields.  The
current list of available fields includes: Advanced Theory, Econometric
Theory, Industrial Organization, International Economics, Labor Economics,
Monetary Theory and Economic Stabilization, Population Studies, Public
Finance, and Transition Economics.  Other fields can be arranged on a case
by case basis.  Recent examples have been Health Economics, Finance, and
Natural Resource Economics.  Students must pass preliminary examinations
in their two major fields.  These exams are normally taken in May of a
student's second year or in September of a student's third year.  Both
exams must be passed by May of the fourth year.  <P>
     In addition to completing two "major" fields, each student must also
take one course in a "minor" field, chosen from the above list.  One of
the three fields chosen, the two "major" fields and the one "minor" field,
must be either Advanced Theory or Econometrics.  This requirement is
intended to insure that students are well versed in the particular
research techniques that they will use in writing their dissertations. 
Finally, students are required to take two "cognate" courses, which are
any courses (approved for graduate credit) in another department of the
University.  A wide variety of courses can be used to satisfy this
requirement.  Economics 673 counts as a cognate, satisfying one of the two
courses required.  Many students satisfy the requirement with a finance
course in the Graduate School of Business or a course in mathematics or
statistics.  Econ 775 (Stat 575) and Econ 776 (Stat 576) may be used to
satisfy this cognate requirement.  <P>
     The "minor" field requirement and the cognate requirement would
normally be completed by the end of the second year or the middle of the
third year, depending on a student's previous course load.  Courses used
to satisfy these requirements must be passed with grades of B- or better. 
<P>
     There is no general foreign language requirement for graduate
students in economics.  However, in individual cases where a student's
area of specialization or dissertation subject demands knowledge of
another language, the Department will encourage the student to acquire the
needed language skills.  <P>
 
<A NAME="PhD3">
<H4>Candidacy</H4>
</A>
 
     Once these course requirements and exams are completed, the student
has reached "candidacy," and is ready to begin work full time on economic
research for the dissertation.  <P>
     To help students make the transition from course work to research,
the Department requires that students complete a relatively short research
paper of "publishable" quality during the third year, under the
supervision of an appointed faculty member.  This paper normally starts
out as a paper written for a second-year course, and is then revised and
strengthened with the help of the faculty member.  Third-year students
meet regularly in a seminar with one of two faculty supervisors to discuss
research technique and to present results of their own research.  <P>
     Before receiving a Ph.D., each student is required to complete a
significant research project in order to satisfy the thesis requirement. 
Through writing a thesis, the student develops the capacity to conceive
and formulate a research topic, to bring knowledge and techniques from the
relevant fields to bear upon it, and to develop conclusions which advance
scholarly understanding.  Work on the dissertation also lays the
foundation for the student's own future research and professional
publications.  In many cases, the thesis will grow out of the third year
paper.  <P>
     Each student will be helped on the thesis by a research advisor, and
eventually by a committee of at least four faculty members.  As soon as is
feasible after the thesis committee has been selected, the student writes
and defends a formal dissertation proposal which describes the research
topic and the methods to be used in the analysis. Once the committee has
accepted the proposal, the student proceeds with the planned research. 
Throughout this period the student is expected to attend and take an
active part in the advanced seminar in the appropriate special field. 
When the dissertation is complete the student defends it in an oral
examination before the dissertation committee. 
 
<A NAME="PhD4">
<H4>Teaching and Research Assistantships</H4>
</A>
 
     Given the value of teaching and research in a student's training, the
Department requires the equivalent of one year of half-time experience in
a teaching or research assistant position.  Virtually all students would
do this even if it were not required.  In order to insure that teaching
and research assistant positions are available to as many students as
possible, the University also allows any one student to receive
college-funded teaching or research assistant positions for no more than
ten semesters.  <P>
     Most of the available teaching assistant positions are in the
principles courses and involve three hours in class per week.  The class
time is spent answering questions about the more difficult points covered
by the faculty in lecture that week and going over problem sets.  There
are also a few teaching assistant positions available in the upper-level
undergraduate and core graduate courses.  Some summer teaching assistant
positions are also available.  The Department also normally finances over
a dozen summer RA jobs for students following their first or second year
in the program.  These positions provide students substantial research
experience early in their program and help them establish a close working
relationship with some faculty member.  Individual faculty members finance
other RA positions, as do various research organizations on campus
including the 
<A HREF="http://www.isr.umich.edu/>
Institute for Social Research</A>, the 
<A HREF="http://mqem.econ.lsa.umich.edu/">
Research Seminar in Quantitative Economics</A>, and the 
<A HREF="http://www.bus.umich.edu/resource/otp/tax.html">
Office of Tax Policy Research</A>.  <P>

<A NAME="PhD5">
<H4>Financial Support</H4>
</A>
 
     The Department provides several types of financial aid to its Ph.D.
students.  Entering students are automatically considered for financial
aid unless they indicate they have support from elsewhere.  <P>
     <EM>Teaching assistant positions</EM>:  All continuing students making
satisfactory progress should be able to obtain a teaching assistant
position.  In addition, about a quarter of the students in the first-year
class are offered teaching assistant positions, generally in the
principles courses.  All students are required to take the Department's TA 
training course before becoming a TA for the first time.  In addition, all 
international students must demonstrate proficiency in the English 
language in an oral examination, and must successfully complete a 
three-week course in teaching techniques offered each May and August, 
to qualify for a teaching assistant position. 
Teaching assistantships entitle the student to a tuition waiver, and a
salary which depends on the time commitment required for the position. 
During 1995-96, a teaching assistant position in the principles course
required seventeen hours per week and paid a salary of $4041 per semester, 
plus health insurance. 
<P>
     <EM>Fellowships</EM>:  Entering American students with a strong
undergraduate grade point average and high GRE scores are eligible for the
University's Regents Fellowship.  This fellowship provides a tuition
waiver and a generous stipend for the first two years of the student's
graduate program, plus a guarantee of a teaching assistant position during
the following two years, subject to the usual stipulation that the student
be making satisfactory progress towards the degree.  <P>
     In addition, there are a variety of <A HREF="grad/fellowships.html">
other fellowships</A> available with
the Department and the University.  Qualified minority students are
eligible for generous support.  A number of fellowships exist for students
interested in area studies (Chinese, Russian and East European, Near
Eastern and North African, South and Southeast Asian studies).  To be
eligible for these fellowships, a separate application must be submitted
to the relevant Area Center before February 1 for the coming academic
year.  Information and application forms may be obtained by writing to the
appropriate Area Center at Lane Hall, University of Michigan.  In
addition, the Department maintains a number of attractive fellowships for
the study of the Japanese economy.  Students seeking support for graduate
study of the Japanese economy should contact the Department's Japan
Economy Program directly.  Students expressing an interest in demography
may be eligible for multi-year traineeships which are offered through the
Population Studies Center.  <P>
     Each year about half a dozen of our students who have reached
candidacy receive University fellowships, allowing them to work full time
on their dissertation.  Further information about these fellowships is
available from the Department.  <P>
     Finally, the Department has limited funds to provide tuition waivers
or small fellowships to entering students in appropriate circumstances. 
<P>
     Of course, financial aid is also available outside the University,
through the National Science Foundation, the CIC minority fellowships
program, the Sloan Foundation, and through other sources.  <P>
     <EM>Loans</EM>: Loan funds may be available through the University 
to aid students who are otherwise unable to continue their graduate work.
Students may also participate in the loan program of the National Defense
Education Act of 1958.  For information, contact the Office of Financial
Aid, Student Activities Building, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI,
48109.  <P>
     <EM>Prizes</EM>: The John E. Parker Prize (currently $500) is awarded
for an outstanding written contribution in the area of labor economics or
human resources.  This prize is usually awarded annually.  In addition,
the Robert Roosa Fellowship is awarded every few years to support
dissertation research in the area of monetary economics.  <P>
 
<A NAME="PhD6">
<H4>Professional Placement</H4>
</A>
 
     The Department actively assists its graduating doctoral students to
obtain professional positions with universities and colleges, research
institutions, government and international agencies, and business firms. 
This assistance is provided routinely by those faculty members who have
worked most closely with the students, as well as by a single faculty
member who, as Placement Officer of the Department, assists all doctoral
students seeking jobs.  Administrative costs of placement assistance are
covered in part by a charge to those using the service.  The demand for
well-trained graduates in economics continues to be strong in the private
and government sectors.  About two-thirds of our graduates end up in
academic positions.  The rest find attractive jobs in international
organizations, the government sector, consulting firms, or occasionally
elsewhere in the private sector.  Unlike graduates of many traditional
Ph.D. disciplines, trained graduate economists continue to be in high
demand.<P>
 
     The placement of doctoral students over the past five years
(1990-1994) is summarized below: 
 
<PRE>    Type of Institution                      Number 
 
    Nationally ranked universities 1-20        10
    Other research universities                19
    Liberal arts colleges                       9
    Government and nonprofit organizations     13
    Private industry and consulting firms       3
</PRE> 

<A NAME="PhD7">
<H4>The Master of Arts (MA) Degree in Economics</H4>
</A>
 
     Except in special circumstances, applicants who seek only a Master's
Degree will be considered solely for the Master's Degree in Applied
Economics (MAE), which is described below.  The MA Degree in Economics is
instead ordinarily earned by students in the Ph.D. program upon successful
completion of a portion of their course work.  Some students who are
initially admitted to the Ph.D. program may eventually choose to complete
only the requirements for the MA degree, while successful doctoral
students earn the degree as a matter of course. <P>
     Specific course requirements for the MA degree include two core
theory courses, usually Economics 601 and 602 (with an average grade of B
or better), plus appropriate training in statistics and mathematics, two
applied field courses, and two cognate courses.  Alternative courses can
be substituted with the approval of the Graduate Director.  <P>

<A NAME="PhD8">
<H4>Procedures for Application</H4>
</A>
 
<!--     Applications for admission to the Ph.D. program (which automatically
includes application for financial support) should be addressed to : The
Mail Room, Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, Michigan, 48109.  
-->
<B>APPLICATIONS FOR FALL ADMISSION MUST BE RECEIVED
BY JANUARY 15 OF THAT YEAR</B>.  There is no separate application form for
financial aid.  Entrance in the Winter or Spring-Summer Terms is approved
only in highly unusual cases.  <P>
     <B>All</B> applicants must take the general aptitude Graduate Record
Examination and must provide three letters of recommendation from
undergraduate teachers or others in a position to evaluate the applicants'
potential for graduate study.  <P>
     Admission and fellowship awards are usually announced by March 15,
and students are asked to indicate their acceptance of fellowship offers
by April 15.  An enrollment deposit of $200 (non-refundable) applicable to
first-term fees is made at this point by students who choose to enter the
program. 
<P>
 
<A NAME="PhD9">
<H4>International Students</H4>
</A>

     The Department welcomes applications from talented, fully-prepared
inernational students.  Applicants whose native language is not English 
are required to take an English Language Test in their country as part of 
the process of admission.  The Graduate School will supply information
regarding the arrangements for taking the test.  Fluency in English is
essential to success in the graduate program.  Applicants will be admitted
to the Graduate School only if their scores in the test are sufficiently
high.  Those with clear fluency in English, as confirmed by an oral
presentation, will be eligible for teaching assistant positions.  Courses
on English as a foreign language are available on campus for students who
do need further training in English.  <P>
     International applicants face a special difficulty in gaining admission in
that members of the Department are rarely well-qualified to judge the
academic credentials of students from foreign universities.  Accordingly,
applicants from universities outside the United States are reminded of the
necessity of taking, through a U.S. embassy or consulate, the Graduate
Record Examination (of verbal, mathematical, and analytical achievement)
offered by the Educational Testing Service.  Further, it is particularly
useful to include information about rank in class and to have letters of 
recommendation are written by professors who
understand U.S. graduate schools and their requirements.  <P>
     All international students who come to the University of Michigan on
student visas must certify sufficient funds to support themselves and

<H3>THE PROGRAM FOR THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS IN APPLIED ECONOMICS (MAE)</H3>
</A>
 
     This degree program is designed for students who wish to apply the
theory and techniques of economics to the analysis of practical problems
in a variety of fields.  Unlike the Master of Arts Degree in Economics,
the MAE is <B>NOT</B> an intermediate step to the Ph.D.  (However, 
students in the program may, of course, apply to the Ph.D. program.) <P>
     The MAE program addresses itself to the needs of three kinds of
students: (1) those who want advanced training in economics in order to
qualify for jobs in government or private organizations that require
greater expertise than is provided by an undergraduate degree, (2) those
who wish to study economics as a complement to their work in another
field, and (3) those who need further background in economics, math, or
statistics, or who need to certify their ability to do graduate work in
economics, in order to gain admission to a Ph.D. program.  For the second
group, dual programs, including in some cases dual degrees, can combine
economics with public health, social work, law, natural resources,
demography, industrial relations, statistics, business administration, and
other fields.  <P>
     Applicants to this program should have completed intermediate micro-
and macroeconomic theory courses as well as courses in calculus and
introductory statistics.  <P>
     The degree is earned in a minimum of three terms and requires 33
hours of graduate course work.  The course sequence for the degree
normally includes two core theory courses, usually Economics 501 and 
502, three courses covering some aspect of quantitative methods used in
economics, usually including Economics 553 and 571, three courses in 
two different applied fields in economics, and three courses in related 
fields of the student's choosing.  The student's overall program is chosen 
in consultation with the Director of the MAE program.  <P>
     No thesis is required and there are no examinations other than the
course examinations.  <P>
     <B>APPLICATIONS FOR SPRING ADMISSION TO THE MAE PROGRAM 
MUST BE RECEIVED BY MARCH 1 OF THAT YEAR</B>.  
Funds for direct support of MAE students are severely limited.  
<!-- Applications for admission should be addressed to:  The
Mail Room, Rackham School of Graduate Studies, University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, Michigan 48109.-->  <P>
     <B>All</B> applicants must take the general aptitude Graduate Record
Examination and provide three letters of recommendation from undergraduate
teachers or others in a position to evaluate the applicant's potential for
graduate study.  Foreign applicants should consult the previous section of
this brochure for additional information.  <P>

<B>Econ 501   Applied Microeconomic Theory</B>.  Cross. 
<P> 
A course designed for students in the MAE program.  Basic models in the
principal areas of microeconomic theory are covered: consumer demand,
production and costs, product markets, factor markets, allocative
efficiency, and corrections for market failure.  Most of the course is
spent studying the use of these tools in the analysis of specific
microeconomic policy problems.  Application of theory to current policy
problems is stressed, and a substantial amount of class time is devoted to
exercises based on such problems.  Prerequisite:  Intermediate
microeconomic theory. 
<P> 

<B>Econ 502   Applied Macroeconomic Theory</B>.  Hymans, Johnson. 
<P> 
A course designed for students in the MAE program.  Approximately
one-third of the course is spent reviewing and elaborating on standard
macro theory of the sort covered in an advanced undergraduate course.  The remainder of the time is spent on applications of this theory to problems of stabilizing aggregate demand, unemployment and inflation, economic growth, and macroeconomics of open e
conomies.  Students will normally do a computer project involving hypothesis testing or model simulation. 
Prerequisite:  Intermediate macroeconomic theory. 
<P>

<P>
Analysis of the application of advanced economic theory to problems in the
health services field.  Focuses on several health economic issues,
including topics of current policy interest as well as topics for which
the application of economic theory has been fully explored.  General
discussion of the appropriate economic theory and a critical review of the
relevant health economics literature.  Students must read approximately
30-40 articles and write 6 or 7 short papers. Prerequisite: Econ 501 and
permission of the instructor.

<A NAME="gc11">
<H3>NATURAL RESOURCES ECONOMICS</H3>
</A>

<B>Econ 668/NR 668   Advanced Natural Resources Economics</B>.  Salant.
<P> 
This course reviews the literature on the pricing of natural resources
(agricultural goods, renewable and nonrenewable resources and durables)
overtime.  The first half of the course considers resources which are
privately owned; the second half considers resources that are common
property.  To provide a point of reference, the behavior of resource
markets in the absence of government intervention is studied first.  There
is then an extensive treatment of the dynamic effects on market equilibria
of widespread government policies (unanticipated, partially anticipated or
fully anticipated).  Policies analyzed include: bufferstocks used to
affect prices (ceilings, floors, bands, and pegs); bans, embargoes, price
controls and whatever else is timely or of interest to participants.  To
simplify the mathematics, discrete-time methods are used predominately. 
The Kuhn-Tucker theorem is utilized when studying competitive equilibrium under certainty.  Dynamic-programming is used to study single-agent (planning or monopoly) problems under uncertainty (with or without learning).  Multi-stage game theory is used to
 investigate dynamic
common-property problems.  A working understanding of these methods is developed during the course.  Prerequisites:  Econ 501 or 601, 653 and 654
or permission of the instructor. 
<P>

<B>NR 669   Advanced Environmental Economics</B>.  Salant.
<P>
In the presence of pollution externalities, market allocations are
typically inefficient and corrective government regulation may be
desirable.  This course first reviews Pigouvian taxes, pollution permits
and other traditional "remedies" but then points out various real-world
informational, technological, and political constraints which make such
"solutions" infeasible.  The course then focuses on optimal regulatory
policies in the presence of these real world constraints.  Topics
discussed are likely to include 1) optimal regulation when firms possess
more information about compliance costs than regulators; 2) the law and
economics of monitoring and enforcing compliance when monitoring is
costly; 3) collective choice of pollution control strategies (e.g. voting
in pollution control organizations such as the Genossenschaften); 4) the
implementation of systems for trading pollution rights and/or
sophisticated pricing schemes for controlling pollution; and 5) the
inclusion of "stock effects" and other more realistic technological
assumptions into economic models of pollution control. Prerequisites: 
Econ 501 or 601, 653 and 654 or permission of the instructor.

<P>
<HR>

<A NAME="Barbour">
<H3>BARBOUR SCHOLARSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> The Department nominates one student who meets the criteria outlined
by the Barbour Scholarship based on academic merit.  Typically, this
student is in her second or third year of study.  This student's
application is reviewed by a Rackham committee for the award. 


<A NAME="Grader">
<H3>GRADER POSITION</H3>
</A>

<P> These positions may be filled by any graduate student not restricted
from working by a currently-held fellowship.  Faculty are required to
apply for grading money.  Once the request has been approved, you fill out
the paperwork to be hired.  You are paid a set fee per hour and turn in
your hours as they worked.  Graders are not eligible for health insurance
or a partial or full tuition waiver


<A NAME="GGSI">
<H3>GRADER GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR</H3>
</A>

<P> These positions are awarded by the individual faculty who are teaching
in the courses that have been assigned a position by the LS&A Dean's
Office.  Grader GSI appointments are always less than .25 and come with no
health insurance and only a partial tuition waiver.  You must be enrolled
for at least 6 credit hours for the term you hold the appointment.  In the
past, they have been picked up as an addition to an existing GSI or GSRA
appointment. 


<A NAME="GSRA">
<H3>GRADUATE STUDENT RESEARCH ASSISTANTSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> GSRAs are hired on an ad-hoc basis by individual faculty members using
whatever criteria they feel are appropriate.  Jobs may be posted any place
within the department as well on e-mail.  In most cases, positions are
filled by students who have been studying in a particular field with the
faculty who has grant money to fund a position.  The GSRA works at least
.25 appointment (10-12 hours weekly), has a tuition waiver and GradCare
health insurance. 


<A NAME="GSI">
<H3>GRADUATE STUDENT INSTRUCTOR POSITION</H3>
</A>

<P> GSIs are hired by the Department of Economics using a set of rules
outlined in the <A HREF="rules.html">&quot;Rules and Regulations of the
Graduate Program&quot;</A> that is distributed to first-year students and
available in Room 250 Lorch.  Typically, the deadline for applying for a
Fall or Winter termposition is the end of April and for applying for the
Spring/Summer term the end of January.  The most common GSI position is a
.40 appointment (17 to 19 hours weekly) that includes a tuition waiver,
health insurance, and a stipend of $4040 per term. 


<A NAME="Raphael">
<H3>MARY MALCOMSON RAPHAEL FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> The Department nominates one woman for this award on the basis of
academic merit within the program who meets the criteria.  This woman is
typically in the third or fourth year of study. 


<A NAME="Moore">
<H3>MOORE DISSERTATION RESEARCH PRIZE</H3>
</A>

<P> The Moore Dissertation Prize is a $1,000 award presented annually to
support the research phase of the dissertation process.  To be eligible,
the student must be a candidate and have a written dissertation plan
approved by at least two members of his/her committee.  The student's
topic must belong to the general area of Applied Microeconomics and must
involve both empirical analysis and issues of public policy as an
essential part of the research agenda.  The deadline varies but has
typically been near the end of the Winter term. 


<A NAME="Parker">
<H3>PARKER MEMORIAL PRIZE</H3>
</A>

<P> An annual competition for the John Elliot Parker Memorial Prize in
Labor Economics and Human Resources with an award of $500.  The prize is
given for an outstanding written contribution in the area of labor
economics or human resources.  If no paper reaches this threshold of
excellence, no award is given.  The deadline varies but has typically been
near the end of the Winter term. 


<A NAME="OneTerm">
<H3>RACKHAM ONE-TERM DISSERTATION FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> In past years, we have been able to award four one-term fellowships
yearly.  One of the awards has gone to the author of the best third-year
paper for the Fall term of their fourth year.  Otherwise, the Fellowships
Committee has the option of dividing the awards between Fall and Winter
terms as they wish.  The fellowship consists of a tuition waiver, GradCare
health insurance, and a stipend of $3600.  You can only be awarded this
fellowship once and you must have a dissertation committee approved by
Rackham.  You may not be employed during the tenure of this award. 
Applicants are required to submit a copy of everything they have written
relating to their dissertation, an outline of what remains to be written,
and two letters of recommendation from faculty working on your
dissertation committee.  The deadline is June 25 for the Fall Term and
November 1 for the Winter Term.  In the past, most of the awards have gone
to students who are on the market for the Fall term and those likely to be
on the market the following year for the Winter term. 


<A NAME="Predoc">
<H3>RACKHAM PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> We can nominate up to five students for the Rackham Predoctoral
Fellowship.  These students' applications are then reviewed by a Rackham
committee.  In the past, we have had one or two students be awarded a
Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship.  The fellowship includes three terms of a
tuition waiver, GradCare health insurance, and a $12,000 stipend.  You may
not be employed during the tenure of this award. 

<P> Before we nominate the five students, we hold an internal competition. 
Students must be all completed work relating to their dissertation, an
outline of whatever remains to be completed, and two letters of
recommendation.  Typically the deadline has been at the end of November. 
The five students are chosen both on the strength of their academic record
and their dissertation research.  The Rackham Predoctoral Award is
intended to finance students during the final year of their Ph.D. work so
you m ust have support from your dissertation committee that you are
within a year of completing your dissertation. 


<A NAME="Sloan">
<H3>SLOAN FOUNDATION FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> The Sloan Foundation Fellowship follows the guidelines for the Rackham
Predoctoral Fellowship closely.  However, we are limited to nominating
only three students.  Since the deadline is shortly after that for the
Rackham Predoctoral Fellowship, the committee recommends that the top
three students nominated for the Predoctoral are also nominated for the
Sloan Fellowship.  All students competing for the Rackham Predoctoral
Fellowship are therefore also competing for the Sloan Foundation
Fellowship without havin g to complete any additional paperwork. 


<A NAME="Summer">
<H3>SUMMER RESEARCH FELLOWSHIP</H3>
</A>

<P> Funding varies but typically we have supported 20-25 students as
Summer Research Fellows.  Applicants are in their first or second year of
the program.  The intent is to give students first-hand experience in
working on a research project under the close supervision of a faculty
member in the Department.  The stipend is around $2000. 

<P> To apply, the student finds a faculty member interested in working
with them on a mutually agreeable topics.  Often faculty have advertised
topics where they are looking for assistance but you may also propose a
topic to them.  Once you and the faculty have agreed on a topic, write a
two-page description of the project and submit it to Room 250 Lorch by
February 10. 

<P> The Fellowship Committee makes the funding decisions based on which
projects appear to work best for the student.  This include not only the
quality of the project but also by the role the student will have in it. 
Where there is limited funding, preference will be given those with a
higher GPA, those who have not had a Summer RF previou sly, and to
second-year students who will be ineligible for an award the following
summer. 


<A NAME="Travel">
<H3>TRAVEL GRANTS</H3>
</A>

<P> Travel grants up to $150 plus 1/2 of the remaining travel expenses up
to a maximum of $300 are available to students who are presenting a paper
at some recognized economic organization.  A student can be awarded a
Travel Grant only once during the length of the program and can't be used
to give or attend seminars at other institutions. 


<A NAME="Outside">
<H3>FELLOWSHIPS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS</H3>
</A>

<P> There are a number of fellowships that are offered for doctoral
students in economics that are available from outside the department.  A
list of those that were advertised during the previous year is available
to be picked up in Room 250 Lorch.  In addition, there is a notebook of
the previous year's advertisements of these awards for more detailed
information about them.  This notebook and list also includes those
fellowships available through the 
<A HREF="http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/">International Institute</A> and 
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.itd.umich.edu:8888/11/acadaff/rackband/gopher/Fellowships">
