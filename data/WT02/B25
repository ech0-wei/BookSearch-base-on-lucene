Product Overview<br>

<table border=0 cellpadding=6 cellspacing=0 align=center>
<tr>
<td>
<font size=+1>
The <em>NetFortress</em> is a breakthrough approach to high-level network
security, combining for the first time the very best in encryption and key
exchange technologies with plug-and-play ease of installation.<p>

A stand-alone box the size of a small desktop computer, the NetFortress
creates a totally secure, point-to-point encrypted transmission between
the computer or LAN it protects and an outside network.  
Once the NetFortress is installed, your system cannot be
subverted or logged onto by an outsider.<p>

Installed in minutes by plugging in two cables, the NetFortress automatically 
self-configures to all major platforms.  It then authenticates itself and the receipt point
and uses a public based 512-bit dual key-exchange to
create a virtually impenetrable barrier.  To increase security even further,
the keys are automatically changed every 24 hours with no user
intervention.<p>

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>Unprotected Networks --<br>Hacker's Paradise</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
The explosive growth of the Internet brings with it the growing threat of
attacks on corporate and institutional networks by unauthorized parties.
Media reports are replete with stories of sophisticated hackers and irate
former employees exploiting TCP/IP's particular susceptibility to intruders.<p>

Hacker magazines, newsletters and web sites abound.  Neophyte hackers
can visit hundreds of FTP sites and download sophisticated tools,
software, and detailed instructions on how to attack any type of protocol,
hardware environment or operating system.<p>

In response to this growing menace, government agencies such
as CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) issue regular
advisories on how sites are being infiltrated and how to ward off
trespassers.<p>

It's obvious that connecting to shared networks, the Internet or operating on TCP/IP
based private corporate "Intranets" without effective security represents a significant risk to
the corporate infrastructure.<p>

Unfortunately, security solutions proposed by network administrators are
often not implemented due to lack of staff, insufficient budgets, ineffective
software tools or simply the indifference of top management.

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>Firewalls -- The Trade Offs</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
Firewalls and multiple firewalls have been the most effective protection to
date against unauthorized intrusions.  But firewalls and multi-tiered
protection methodologies vary greatly in effectiveness and take their toll
on performance and network administration.<p>

Firewalls are also very costly and can quickly run into the tens
of thousands of dollars and more. They are difficult to install,
involve complicated documentation, need
frequent software updates and extensive user training. They also
require full-time network personnel to control access and data flows.  Firewalls
make network operations exceedingly difficult to monitor.<p>

Even the best firewalls generally do not create reliable encryption.
They operate mainly in the transport or application layer of the network
and leave significant header information vulnerable and exposed to the
hacker.  Firewalls are often ineffective and can be defeated by expert hackers.
Firewalls are an imperfect solution to network security.<p>

<font color=#3399ff size=+2><em>The NetFortress -- Not a Firewall</em></font>
<br>
<font size=+1>
While the NetFortress can complement any firewall and make it more
secure, the NetFortress itself is not a firewall.  It is not a modem, router or
packet-filtering device.  It does not work on the vulnerable application
layer, and requires little or no human intervention for installation, support
or maintenance.<p>

It is not a complex combination of computers and software.  It requires no
user training and no traffic control administration.  The NetFortress
is also not a mind-boggling expense.<p>

<br>
<font size=+1>
Representing a significant technological achievement, the NetFortress prevents the transmission
of any helpful data to a hacker attempting a break-in.<p>

While most security programs work at the application layer, the NetFortress
works at the network layer, the most basic layer operating across
various LANs and WANs.  In doing so, the NetFortress exceeds it's 
competitors' security provisions by encrypting the entire application
layer and the transport layer headers, and even modifying some 
portions of the network layer headers.  Consequently, transmissions 
no longer expose any useful information or "hooks" to hackers and 
provide greater security against attack than all other encryption 
techniques.<p>

<center><h2>Security and the Internet:</h2>
<h4>Secure Virtual Networks in an<br>
Open Systems World</h4>
</center>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Open standards have created a paradox for the Internet. On one hand
they enable the protocols 
necessary for rapid transfer of data between dissimilar systems. On the
other hand they usually permit potential security and data integrity
problems to occur. The explosive growth of the Internet and resultant
low cost access are powerful financial incentives for businesses to
move corporate networks from leased or dedicated lines to the Internet. 
However, most security methods are expensive, unreliable and do not
take into account the full range of attacks hackers are making on
systems. DSN's NetFortress blocks hacker attacks and provides an
inexpensive, effective tool for building Virtual Private Networks over
the Internet. It is a hardware/software solution that applies secure
authentication, coupled with encryption techniques and advanced
security protocols to the network layer of data communication. It is
also useful for securing communication within enterprise-wide
intranets.
<p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Most companies, federal and state governments
have complicated data communications networks that have evolved over
several generations of computing systems. The networks routinely run
many different protocols through Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Local
Area Networks (LANs). The WANs are usually based on a variety of
different services over costly leased lines to maintain a high degree
of availability, security and data integrity. In addition, most
companies have Internet connectivity and routinely run World Wide Web
(WWW) sites that are loosely coupled, if at all, to their corporate
networks. The reasons for the latter are many and frequently include
security and data integrity issues. This adds to the complexity of
managing the Web site and complicates remote site management for most
companies.
<p> 
This document introduces the NetFortress solution for creating secure,
virtual private networks over public lines such as the Internet. It
examines the problems companies face when trying to build Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs) over public media and describes how these can
be overcome.
<p> 
Computer security has become a highly technical subject. Hackers are
increasingly sophisticated in their attacks and the availability of
powerful and inexpensive computing power has made their efforts even
easier. This paper does not intend to present a complete introduction
to the subject of cryptography and computer security -- hundreds or
thousands of pages would be needed for that. It does introduce and
explore key technological issues relating to computer security to help
the reader understand and evaluate security strategies, as well as the
benefits of the NetFortress solution.

<h2>The Data Communication Imperative</h2>
<p>
Information Technology (IT) is a key differentiator for predicting
business success. Intelligent use of corporate data, the speed and
accuracy of internal and external communication, as well as the
flexibility and 
adaptability of network structures and applications help determine
which businesses will succeed and which will fail.
<p>
In both the public and private sector, customers are demanding better,
faster service for less money. They want answers now and they have a
low tolerance for errors.
<p>
In this environment, IT departments are hard pressed to deliver
everything that management and their users want and most IT shops have
backlogged projects. Because of this, security sometimes
suffers.
<p>
More importantly, open standards in network architectures and computing
paradigms pose tremendous security risks. This can expose company
information, processes, sales contacts and R&D breakthroughs to the
prying reach of malicious hackers or competitors. Not even leased T1 or
other high speed lines guarantee security.
<p>
What is needed is a strategy to confidently build secure virtual
networks that leverage the low cost and high availability of the
Internet. The NetFortress fills this need with a hardware/software
solution that encrypts at the lowest all-software level of data
communication. This simultaneously protects proprietary data and foils
hacker attacks. With the NetFortress, companies can safely build VPNs
that leverage the Internet's growing advantages.
<p>
<h2>The Low Cost Internet Alternative</h2>
<p>
For many large companies,
the first line of defense against hackers has been high-cost leased T1
(1.544 megabit per second) lines guarded by expensive and hard to
maintain firewalls. The expense is high for large companies; for medium
to small companies, the costs can be prohibitive.
<p>
These high costs make the Internet an attractive alternative for
corporate traffic.
<p>
For example, a company with T1 lines connecting four offices in Los
Angeles, Chicago, New York and Atlanta may spend $25,000/month on
telecom expenses. That expense drops to between $12,000 and $15,000
when the network is moved to the Internet, a savings of 40% to
50%.

<p>
<h2>Hackers: What They Want</h2>
<p>
Hackers come in many forms --
from kids who have picked up some of the many tools and algorithms for
breaking into systems that are available on the Internet, to graduate
students who have tremendous 
knowledge about the inner workings of computers and seemingly unlimited
amounts of time, to the professional who works for an intelligence
agency or, more likely, a competitor. Each is dangerous and can cause
untold millions of dollars of damage to businesses or government
agencies.
<p>
Hackers have many different motivations and goals: simple curiosity,
the thrill of a challenge, the desire to read or steal private
information, planting false or misleading information, crashing
computer systems, etc. 
<p>
Despite their differences, they have some techniques in common:
<p>
<ol>
<li><b>Listening in</b>. If an ongoing conversation is not encrypted, or is
encrypted in a way that can be broken, listening in may provide all the
information that is desired. More often, listening in is a preliminary
action used to gain information such as password data which will allow
further access to a system.
<p>
<li><b>Password guessing</b>. Programs exist today to guess the system
passwords. Some of these are surprisingly successful at gaining
unauthorized access.
<p>
<li><b>Protocol abuse</b>. This uses a company's established procedures
against it.  For example, by listening in, a hacker may be able to
determine the exact point in a two-way communication when an encrypted
credit card number is passed between two computers. Although the hacker
can't always decrypt the message to recover the actual card number, he
can capture the encrypted number. By mimicking the rest of the protocol
and feeding the encrypted credit card number at the appropriate time,
the hacker may gain access or be able to register a charge. By studying
the company's protocol, he can violate system security without breaking
any encryption algorithm. 
<p>
<li><b>IP spoofing</b>. Using this attack, the hacker changes his IP address
to one he knows is considered safe by the targeted system. Now
recognized as a friend, he may gain unauthorized access. 
<p>
<li><b>Trojan Horse</b>. Having gained access to a system using some other
method, the hacker leaves a program in the compromised system which
quietly and unobtrusively wreaks havoc on a system and/or sends him
all the data he needs.
</ol>
<p>
Most of these approaches do not depend on
breaking a particular encryption algorithm. Encryption is important, but
it is only the key to a door. Unfortunately there are other doors,
there are windows and there are even walls that may be penetrated. The
hacker may not care at all about the weekly report one remote office
sent to the corporate office last Tuesday. But by capturing the report,
he may recover enough information in the plaintext header to gain
access to the corporate office any time he wants.
<p>

<p>
<h2>Existing Network Security Products</h2>
Generally, there are two categories of available products:
<ol>
<li><b>Software products.</b> Products which use encrypted
mail, secured http, one-time passwords, etc., are common. Most of these
encrypt user information at the application or presentation layers,
leaving potentially dangerous information exposed in lower layer packet
headers. These products assume the host computer is, and will remain,
secure -- that they only need to protect user data when it leaves the
corporate network. The "security" they appear to provide is completely
undermined once the system itself has been compromised. 
<p>
What's more, many of these products use inefficient or inadequate
encryption algorithms such as the Data Encryption Standard (DES), or 40
bit encryption keys. One outstanding problem with the DES approach is
the high amount of computing resources taken to encrypt data. In most
cases this would require a dedicated machine to perform the operations.
In addition, according to Bruce Schneier, author of "Applied
Cryptography", many 40-bit ciphers can be broken in as little as 0.18
seconds. This has led to various pipelined approaches for encrypting
data such as triple DES. The current export restrictions from the
Federal NSA limiting encryption keys to 40 bits have contributed to
this problem.
<p>
<li><b>Firewalls.</b> These include products such as Janus and ANS.
Firewalls are hardware/software solutions designed to monitor and
control the flow of information into and out of private networks by
allowing/disallowing requests based on who is attempting the action,
where the request originates, etc.
<p>
Firewalls are expensive, ranging in price from $14,000 to $130,000,
plus the cost of hardware. More importantly, they require a high level
of expertise to install and maintain. The most sophisticated and
effective firewalls require a specially trained technician or engineer
for constant tuning and maintenance. Even when combined with
encryption, firewalls generally operate at the Transport layer (TCP),
which leaves all header information at the Network layer (IP) exposed.
Most firewalls are implemented as full service computers including
operating systems and file systems which may be logged into for
administration and maintenance. However, access by the wrong person
turns them into a liability rather than an aid to security. 
<p>
Firewalls are best used for monitoring and controlling the flow of data
into and out of a company. They are not particularly good for building
VPNs.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>The NetFortress Solution</h2>
<p>
The NetFortress is a hardware/software solution like a firewall, but
is a sealed box that cannot be logged into. Hence, it cannot be
compromised the way a firewall can.
<p>
The NetFortress works at a lower level than firewalls -- the IP layer --
below the level of most hacker attacks. It needs no special
configuration for different network applications and its security
protocols are implemented without human intervention, thus avoiding any
chance of human error.
<p>
<hr size=0>
<p>
<h2>NetFortress Security Protocols</h2>
<h3>NetFortress Set-Up and Configuration</h3>
<p>
The NetFortress comes in two flavors: host and LAN. The host box
provides protection for a single node or client (host computer). The
standard LAN box provides security for up to 254 client nodes on the
same Class C LAN. This means that the LAN version acts as a  gateway
protecting the 254 client nodes from potential security threats.
<p>
Set-up consists of plugging the NetFortress into the single node or
host computer or client LAN, and the open network on the other side.
Its two ethernet interfaces accept BNC (thin coax) or 10BaseT (twisted
pair) connectors.
<p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/bnc.gif"></center>
<p>
Configuration is automatic. When the client
sends its first message through the host box, the NetFortress burns the
client's IP and MAC addresses into memory. This permanently ties the
NetFortress to its host computer. (As an added security feature, the
host box hides its host's MAC address by answering Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) requests with its own MAC address. Outside users do not
see or have access to the host's MAC address.)
<p>
Similarly, the LAN box burns the class C IP address of its LAN into
permanent memory. This ties the LAN box to that Class C LAN, thereby
thwarting any attempt to breach security by moving the NetFortress to a
LAN with a different Class C IP address.
<p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/models.gif"></center>
<p>

<p>
<h3>Secure Key Exchange</h3>
<p>
There are many encryption algorithms, but most fall into two general categories:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Secret key cryptography
<li>Public key cryptography
</ol>
<p>
Secret key algorithms use encryption and decryption keys that are
closely related, usually the same, so are termed "symmetric" or
"common". The sender encrypts a message (m) with the common key (S),
sends the ciphertext (E<sub>s</sub> (m)) to the receiver who decrypts
it using the same, or a closely related, key.
<p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/secret.gif"></center>
<p>
Public key algorithms use two keys which cannot be computed one from
the other. The "public" key is used to encrypt plaintext; the "private"
key is used to decrypt ciphertext, so are termed "asymmetric". The
sender encrypts and then sends a message (m) with the receiver's public
key (P<sub>B</sub>), which only the receiver is able to decrypt using
his private key (S<sub>B</sub>). For both security and authentication
of the sender, double encryption can be used as shown on the diagram.
<p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/public.gif"></center>
<p>
The primary stumbling block with secret key systems is finding a
secure way to get two authorized users to agree on a common key -- the
common key certainly can't be sent as plaintext over the Internet.
Public key systems avoid this problem, but are generally too slow for
encrypting entire messages.
<p>
Often, a hybrid approach is used; public key cryptography is used to
exchange a common secret key which is then used to encrypt the data.
While this is theoretically sound, it is open to attack. 
<p>
At least as important as the encryption algorithm is the "security
protocol". As defined by Schneier,  "A <b>protocol</b> is a series of
steps, involving two or more parties, designed to accomplish a task....
A <b>cryptographic protocol</b> is a protocol that uses
cryptography".
<p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/alice.gif"></center>
<p>
<hr size=0>
<p>
History has repeatedly proven that the most secure encryption
algorithm can be defeated by a poorly designed or implemented security
protocol.
<p>
For example, assume Bob and Alice wish to communicate via the Internet.
Bob sends Alice his public key (P<sub>B</sub>) which Alice uses to
encrypt a common key (k). She sends Bob the encrypted common key which
they both use to exchange messages (E<sub>P<sub>B</sub></sub> (k)).
Even though they have used sound public and common key algorithms,
their communication is open to attack.
<p>
Bob and Alice didn't know Malice had been listening in on their
communication for years. When Bob sent Alice his public key
(P<sub>B</sub>), Malice intercepted the message and forwarded his own
public key (P<sub>M</sub>) to Alice. When Alice encrypted the common
key (k), she unknowingly used Malice's public key. Malice intercepted
the message (E<sub>P<sub>M</sub></sub> (k)), decrypted it to recover
the common key, then encrypted the common key using Bob's public key
and forwarded it (E<sub>P<sub>B</sub></sub> (k)) to Bob who was none
the wiser.
<p>
From this point forward any messages Bob or Alice encrypt with the
common key,  Malice decrypts easily.
<p>
This kind of attack, called the "man-in-the-middle", is common and can
be very effective. Bob and Alice failed to securely communicate because
they did not use a key exchange protocol that would authenticate with
whom they were actually talking.
<p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/malice.gif"></center>
<p>
Several classes of key exchange protocols address this problem. Two
common ones are Key Distribution Center (KDC) and Diffie-Hellman key
exchange.
<p>
Under the KDC protocols, a central, trusted authority maintains a
database of public keys. When Bob and Alice wish to communicate, Alice
contacts the KDC to get Bob's public key. She uses this key to encrypt
the common key and sends the encrypted key to Bob. This protocol
assumes the KDC is absolutely trustworthy. Alice "knows" she is talking
to Bob because she trusts the KDC to give her his public key. Based on
this trust, she "knows" that only Bob will be able to decrypt her
message. Because the KDC family of protocols depend on the absolute
trustworthiness of the key holder, they are technically complex and
expensive to maintain. Moreover, when compromised, any security value
is reversed and they become a security liability.  Only a KDC which
uses an added level of key exchange and encryption, such as DSN's First
Trust, can truly be considered secure.
<p>
Diffie-Hellman is a public key algorithm used for secure key exchanges.
According to Schneier it "gets its security from the difficulty of
calculating discrete logarithms in a finite field, as compared with the
ease of calculating exponentiation in the same field." The
Diffie-Hellman protocol has the additional advantage of being
straightforward to implement.
<p>
Schneier describes it as follows:
<p>
...First, Alice and Bob agree on large primes, <i>n</i> and <i>g</i>,
such that <i>g</i> is primitive mod <i>n.</i></p><p> These two integers
don't have to be secret; Alice and Bob can agree to them over some
insecure channel. They can even be common among a group of users. It
doesn't  matter.	
<p>
Then, the protocol goes as follows:</p>
<ol>
<p>
<li>Alice chooses a random large integer x and sends Bob

		 <center>X = g<sup>x</sup> mod <i>n</i></center>
<li>Bob chooses a random large integer y and sends Alice

		<center>Y = g<sup>y</sup> mod <i>n</i></center>
<li>Alice computes
	
		 <center>k = Y<sup>x</sup> mod <i>n</i></center>
<li>Bob computes

		 <center>k' = X<sup>y</sup> mod <i>n</i></center></ol>

Both <i>k</i> and <i>k'</i>  are equal to <i>gxy</i> mod <i>n.</i> No
one listening on the channel can compute that value; they  only know
<i>n, g, X,</i> and <i>Y.</i>

In the above example, <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> represent the private keys;
<i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> represent the public keys and <i>k = k'</i> is
the common secret key. Notice that in the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange,
the private keys and the common secret key are never divulged.
</p><center><img src="whitegraphics/diffe.gif"></center>

<p><b>NetFortress First Trust.</b> Each NetFortress has a permanent 128
bit private key installed at the time of manufacture. At first power
up, each box computes and stores its own 512-bit permanent public key.
</p><p>

When two NetFortress-equipped sites first attempt to communicate, they
initiate the Diffie-Hellman protocol: they exchange their 512-bit
permanent public keys and calculate a permanent common secret key which
is common to only those two boxes. This key, along with the IP address
of the other NetFortress, is 
permanently stored in memory. </p><p>

The exchange of permanent public keys is the first and last time any
unencrypted communication passes between the two sites, other than
Internet Control (ICMP) or Internet Gateway (IGMP) messages.</p><p>

<b>Dynamic Key Exchange.</b> In addition to the permanent private key,
each NetFortress generates a random, dynamic private key (which is
changed every 24 hours). After the permanent key exchange, the two
NetFortresses perform another Diffie-Hellman protocol using their
dynamic keys. However, this time the protocol is encrypted using the
permanent common secret key with an algorithm called the International
Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA). </p><p>

This new encrypted Diffie-Hellman exchange produces a 128-bit dynamic
common secret key which is again common to only those two
NetFortresses. It, too, is stored in memory and is used with the IDEA
algorithm to encrypt regular network traffic. (See "Secure Data
Exchange" and "Secure Packet Handling" sections below.)</p><p>

Every 24 hours the dynamic keys expire. When the two NetFortresses next
communicate after key expiration, they perform another Diffie-Hellman
protocol, again encrypting the exchange with their 
permanent common secret key. </p><p>

Encrypting the Diffie-Hellman exchange and changing the dynamic common
key every 24 hours foils "man-in-the-middle" attacks because each
renegotiation authenticates the two boxes to each other.</p><p>

<h3>Secure Data Exchange</h3>
<p>Before the 1970s, cryptography was largely the domain of military
and governmental spy organizations-very little was written about
cryptography in public journals or press. As data communication began
to grow, so too did the need for a national encryption standard. After
several years of discussion, The National Bureau of Standards (NBS),
now called the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
adopted the Data Encryption Standard (DES) on November 23, 1976. In the
years since, a tremendous amount of academic work and writing has been
dedicated to examining DES and cryptography in general.
<p>
Almost from the beginning, DES was criticized, due to two factors:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The National Security Agency (NSA) had a hand in its
development and some have postulated  they inserted a trapdoor.
<p>
<li>
DES' short 56-bit key. (In the original design the key was 112
bits; the NSA shortened  it to 56 bits.)
</ol>
<p>
Because of these problems and technology advances since the 1970s,
DES is considered insecure. According to Schneier, one researcher
estimated that a brute-force DES-cracking machine costing 
$1 million in 1993 could find and crack a DES key in an average of 3.5
hours; he also reported on rumors that the NSA was able to crack DES in
3 to 15 minutes with a machine costing as little as $50,000.
</p><p>Because of DES' problems, the NetFortress uses IDEA, a symmetric
algorithm which operates on 64-bit blocks of plaintext, encrypting
64-bit blocks of plaintext into 64-bit blocks of ciphertext. IDEA was
developed without involvement from the NSA and uses a much larger key
(128 bits) than DES. Its first version appeared in 1990 and
subsequently went through a round of revision, improvement and
strengthening. 

</p><p>A. Tannenbaum in his book  "Computer Networks" wrote that "...no
currently known technique or machine is thought to be able to break
IDEA."

</p><p>According to Schneier:</p>

<blockquote>"In my opinion, it [IDEA] is the best and most secure block
algorithm available to the public at this time.<br>
...<br>
IDEA's key length is 128 bits -- over twice as long as DES. Assuming
that a brute-force attack is the most efficient, it would require 2^128
(10^38) encryptions to recover the key. Design a chip that can test a
billion keys per second and throw a billion of them at the problem, and
it will still take 10^13 years -- that's longer than the age of the
universe. An array of 10^24 such chips can find the key in a day, but
there aren't enough silicon atoms in the universe to build such a
machine. Now we're getting somewhere...." (Applied Cryptography, page
323)</blockquote>

<p>IDEA is also faster than DES - about twice as fast - which helps the
NetFortress achieve high throughput speeds of 1.18mbs - 1.72mbs.</p><p>

As mentioned above, attacks on the NetFortress are made even more
difficult by changing the key used with IDEA every 24 hours. Key
renegotiation is automatic and user transparent.</p>
<h3>Secure Packet Handling</h3>
<p>As previously discussed, hackers attack systems in various ways. In
some cases, their interest is not in the content of a particular
message, but in information about the system -- the kind of information
normally exposed in a packet header.</p><p>

To block these attacks, the NetFortress works at the OSI network layer
- lower than most security products on the market. The Network layer
(IP) is the lowest purely software layer in the OSI model; the Data
Link layer below it deals directly with the hardware. Because the
Network Layer is so close to the hardware, its headers expose very
little system data and virtually no user data -- all higher layer
information is encapsulated into the Network payload. Despite the
Network layer's relative security, the NetFortress hides and encrypts
much of its header, in addition to encrypting the entire data payload.
Only essential information needed by routers, such as the source and
destination addresses, is left exposed.</p><p>

<b>Encrypting the IP datagram.</b> When the NetFortress receives an IP
datagram for transmission, the payload is compressed, which can result
in a plus or minus 30% change in its size. The purpose of the
compression is not to save space, but to change and hide the actual
size. (Hackers often want to find out the size of an encrypted message
because this information can be used in some types of attacks.) The
original size, which was recorded in the original IP header, is moved
to the payload for later encryption.</p><p>

The original transport protocol identifier is also moved from the IP
header to the payload. This identifier specifies the transport layer
protocol -- usually TCP -- and can specify other transport protocols
depending on the originating system. Hackers look for this information
to help construct a map of the applications running on a targeted
system or firewall. The transport protocol identifier is replaced with
the Digital Secured Networks Technology (DSN) protocol code which tells
the hacker nothing about the host.</p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/ip.gif"></center>

<p>The compressed IP payload, the original size, and the original
transport protocol identifier are then encrypted with IDEA. The size of
the new, encrypted payload is computed and inserted into the IP header.
If, after compression and encryption, the new datagram exceeds the
allowed size, the NetFortress fragments the datagram before sending and
defragments at the receiving end.
<p>
The new IP datagram exposes no information -- except the source and
destination IP addresses, a payload size that doesn't match the actual
size, a generic transport protocol identifier which reveals nothing
about the originating system, and an encrypted payload that can't be
read.
<p>
The hacker knows only that something was sent from the source to the
destination, but knows nothing else about it.</p>

<h3>NetFortress Options</h3>
<p><b>Standard vs. Segmented NetFortress.</b> The standard NetFortress
configuration rejects data packets received from all non-NetFortress
sources, or which cannot be decrypted using the common key associated
with the originating IP address. This prevents unauthorized access to
the company network. </p><p>

A segmented version of the NetFortress is available which
encrypts/decrypts packets traveling between secured sites and also
provides limited access to sites which are not protected by a
NetFortress.  This model allows NetFortress clients to use IP services
(telnet, ftp, etc.) provided by unprotected sites while 
preventing those sites from accessing these services on the NetFortress
client.  Both secure and segmented boxes allow Internet Control Message
(ICMP) and Internet Gateway Message (IGMP) Protocol  packets to pass
unencrypted. These include "EchoRequest" packets, commonly used by 
"ping" utilities. </p>
<center><img src="whitegraphics/opt.gif"></center>
<p>The segmented version provides a high degree of security, especially
when coupled with a firewall, but it is not the recommended network
topology. When both secured and unsecured use is required, the
preferred topology is to use a standard NetFortress box for secured
access with a separate access point for 
unsecured communication. </p><p>

It is important to note that the Class C LAN box recognizes
transmissions from any of its clients that have already been encrypted
by another NetFortress, and passes this data through with no further
processing. The LAN box thereby protects the entire LAN, while
accommodating NetFortress-equipped individual nodes that need a higher
level of privacy or security. </p><p>

<b>Factory First Trust.</b> To further enhance the First Trust
protocol, two NetFortresses can be locked to each other before
placement in the field. Under this protocol, the two boxes perform
their first-contact Diffie-Hellman exchange in the lab so no
unencrypted communication ever occurs on any public line. This is an
optional protocol which is unnecessary in all but the most extreme
security situations.</p><p>

<b>Company Proprietary Signature.</b> For companies that will never
need a secure line to non-company sites and want an added level of
security, DSN can equip their NetFortresses with an optional
proprietary company signature. This unique company signature is
encrypted and embedded in each IP packet. Company NetFortresses only
accept packets that include their signature and reject all others.

<p>
<h2>Software Structure</h2>
<p>The NetFortress software structure includes:</p>
<ol><li>The operating system:
 	<p>The operating system is an embedded kernel that does not permit
logins. <p><br><li>The networking system:
	<p>The networking code handles communication, key exchange,
encryption, configuration, etc. It also invokes the key computation
application. <p><br><li>The key calculation routines:
	<p>Key computation is implemented as a memory resident module that
receives information from the kernel, although it does not use kernel
resources and is not restricted by usual kernel routine limitations.
<p><br><li> The encryption routines:
 	<p>Encryption is implemented as a module and is replaceable should
a need to upgrade the encryption routine ever arise.</ol>
<p>Because the IDEA encryption is a fast algorithm, and because there
is very little operating system overhead, the NetFortress delivers high
performance-- it can manage communication with upwards of 1000 hosts
simultaneously and can store IP address and key information for tens of
thousands of nodes.
<p>
<hr size=0>
<p>
<h2>Databases</h2>
<p>
The NetFortress maintains one static and one dynamic database. 
<p>
The static database resides in Flash ROM. It holds permanent
information about NetFortress-equipped nodes including each node's IP
address, the time entered into the database and the permanent public
key. The dynamic database contains information about secured and
unsecured hosts. It holds each node's IP address, the time last
updated, a flag indicating whether the node is secured, a flag
indicating whether the node is in transition (in the middle of a key
exchange) and a pointer to the common (secret) key.</p>
<br>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
The NetFortress is a total solution to building Virtual Private
Networks over public media. It integrates hardware protection,
sophisticated key exchange protocols, state of the art encryption and
low level data hiding to block hacker attacks.
<p>
Open systems communication security problems have made this difficult
or dangerous. Due to the increased complexity of corporate networks and
the growing sophistication of hackers' tools and techniques, enterprise
networks over dedicated lines can also be compromised.
<p>
The NetFortress undercuts these problems by implementing sound security
protocols using unbroken encryption methods that protect corporate data
and  hide clues from hackers intent on attacking a system.

	<h4>Comparison Study: Private Line WANS vs. DSN Secured VPN's</h4>

	<font size=+2>N</font>etYears ago, plain old telephone companies operated (and still do) as WANS. They provided standard, high cost network solutions such as Frame relay and T1 leased line services to their clients.  Such solutions  were also perceived as secure.  But the facts are that:
	<ul>
	<li>Traditional corporate networks using such network solutions are expensive to set up, maintain and expand.
	<li>Telecommunications costs historically rise, placing added burden on managers charged with cost reduction.  
	<li>The competitive marketplace forces the telcos to forge alliances to cut costs - passing   corporate private line data across shared network facilities. Control, and security of the data, are virtually impossible to protect.  
	</ul>
	<p>
	How important have the issues of network growth, security, and cost become to corporations and those  who manage their environments?  
	<p>
	Consider the results of a recent Gartner Group survey of Information Technology managers on the following:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Percent of time allocated to network management
	<li>Percent of budget allocated to networks
	<li>Measure of importance: network security
	</ul>

	<font size=+1><b>50% Cost Savings Achieved</b></font>
	<p>
	The DSN NetFortress offers the option of using the public Internet as the data transfer medium between local networks, providing significant cost savings over  private line topologies. How much savings can be achieved? A recent tariff and rates study of long distance carriers and Internet Service Providers (ISPs), indicate 33% - 50%.

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<b>A Secure Intranet Solution</b>
	<p>
	While Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) run over the public Internet backbone can produce dramatic cost savings, they do not necessarily provide a secure solution. And cost savings becomes an insignificant issue - compared to the real cost to a firm, should corporate data be compromised or stolen. 
	<p>
	<b>A  NetFortress Secured VPN</b>
	<p>
	The NetFortress, when placed between two or more points of the VPN, creates a secure path for Internet and Intranet traffic. The NetFortress based secure tunnel provides:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>Powerful 512-bit  network layer encryption - protecting important  network information at lower layer packet levels than other security solutions.
	<li>Public / Private key authentication between client and server - the private key is never divulged over the network, and is changed at automatic intervals.
	<li>Superior secure data exchange - using IDEA" based algorithms which are over twice as powerful, and faster, than traditional DES  encryption. 
	</ul>
	<p>
	<b>Cost Savings - Maintenance</b>
	<p>
	Older generation security solutions and firewall based technology 
	provided limited protection - but also carried a high maintenance price. These included administrative costs, usually in the form of one (or more) technical administration staff. But additional expense, such as software support fees and hardware maintenance fees, add to the total cost.
	<p>
	The NetFortress is also designed with the objective of reducing the cost and effort of labor intensive security solutions. Set up consists of simply plugging the units between the router and the hub. Configuration is automatic and permanent. 
	<p>
	<b>Summary</b>
	<p>
	Businesses MUST take advantage of Intranet  / Web technology just to stay current with their competition. Firms are moving to Web technology as a growing percentage of their technology application portfolios and budgets. A recent survey of I.T. managers and corporate executives indicates that 89% intend to install Intranet technology at an average budget of $2.6 million.
	<p>
	Cost savings can be achieved and security will be enhanced in the development of VPNs.  Savings of 33% - 50% are realistic. But an insecure Intranet is not an assetits a liability. The NetFortress was designed with the limitations of the current generation of security products in mind,  providing powerful,   cost effective security for Intranets and VPNs.

	PC INDUSTRY VETERAN RAY WEADOCK TO HEAD INTRANET SECURITY FIRM
	<p>
 	</font>
	October 28, 1996, Englewood Cliffs, NJ - Digital Secured Network
	Technology, Inc. (DSN), a privately held company with breakthrough
	technology for securing corporate Intranets and enabling electronic commerce
	over the Internet, today announced the appointment of Mr. Raymond L. Weadock
	as president and chief executive officer.
	<p>
	Most recently, Mr. Weadock was vice president and general manager of
	Digital Equipment Corporations personal computer business in the Americas.
	He was responsible for building the unit into a multi-billion dollar
	enterprise, presiding over its growth from 41st to 8th in market share
	within the span of two years.
	<p>
 	"Security is a prerequisite for the new digital economy," said Weadock.
	"I am convinced that DSN has developed data encryption and fortification
	solutions that will be embraced as the global de-facto standard wherever
	information of  value is transported over a network."
	<p>
	With more than 20 years of technology industry experience, Weadock has
	helped build five start up companies and shepherded the development of two
	Fortune 100 company divisions from their inception.  In addition to DEC, he
	has held senior executive positions at Visicorp, Plus Development/Quantum,
	and Conner Peripherals.
	<p>
 	"Ray has a proven track record in managing the growth of emerging
	technology companies and transforming them into thriving enterprises, having
	already participated in growing three companies to over $1billion in sales.
	His proven management skills, unique combination of experience in
	client/server networks, PC distribution and OEM manufacturing fits perfectly
	into our overall strategy of delivering network security solutions from the
	server to the desktop," said Dr. Aharon Friedman, DSN founder.
	<p>
	At DSN, Weadock assumes responsibility for helping the company achieve its
	mission of delivering a new standard for securing corporate information
	resources over both public Internet connectivity and private data networks.
	<p>
	Weadock holds a BSBA in marketing and finance from the University of
	Arkansas and completed the Executive Institute Studies program at the
	Graduate School of Business at Stanford University.
	DSN also announced that it has hired Dr. Jack Kerivan as vice president of
	customer services and technical support.  A network specialist with over 15
	years experience, Dr. Kerivan has held technical and management positions
	with AT&T Bell Labs, Bull Worldwide Information Systems, Cabot Corporation
	and Digital Equipment Corporation. Dr. Kerivan will oversee DSNs customer
	service and technical support operations and assist in product line expansion.
	<p>
	Founded in 1995 by Dr. Aharon Friedman and Mr. Andrew Savas, DSN recently
	released its flagship product, the NetFortress.  Representing a quantum leap
	forward in Intranet security, the NetFortress creates an impenetrable line
	of communication over the Internet to other NetFortress protected hosts.  It
	fully integrates automated and hardware-based:
	<p>
	<ul>
	<li>IP authentication,
	<li>Network layer encryption, and
	<li>Public key exchange
	</ul>
	<p>
	into a seamless plug and play solution.
	<p>
	As a stand alone unit or with a firewall, the NetFortress is platform
	independent, easy to install, and maintenance-free.  It eliminates the
	possibility of IP spoofing, eavesdropping and break-ins.

<font size=6>Info World Article:</font>
<p>
<font size=3>Publication date: September 9, 1996 (Vol. 18, Issue 37)</font><p>
<font size=3>Author: Brooks Talley</font><p>
<font color="#ff0000" size=4>* Encryption hardware</font><p>
<b><font color="#ff0000" size=5>NetFortress effortlessly turns Internet into a secure, low-cost WAN.</font></b><br>
<font size=5>Units can't be used with other machines unless reset by the manufacturer or a reseller.</font><br>
<p>

It's not often that something Internet-related comes in a small black box requiring no configuration, but Digital Secured
Network Technology Inc. offers just such a product. 
<p>
The NetFortress encryption product is a great alternative for those who want to send confidential information over the Internet
instead of using a more costly private network. 
<p>
I greatly appreciated the NetFortress' lack of complexity. I simply plugged in one of the units in front of the router on each side
of an Internet connection, and the system worked flawlessly. 
<p>
The NetFortress works by encrypting everything at the network layer with a unique key so that the outside world can read only
the source and destination IP address. The data inside the packet -- even which TCP/IP port the packet is bound for -- is
effectively turned into gibberish until the packet arrives at its destination. 
<p>
Using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol, NetFortress units can be set up at multiple sites to establish a true WAN using
the Internet. 
<p>
The company burns a unique private key into the boxes when you buy them so that they can communicate only with one
another; therefore, NetFortress units owned by different companies can't decrypt each other's traffic. 
<p>
(You also can get NetFortress boxes configured to either allow or deny traffic that is going to locations without a corresponding
NetFortress.) 
<p>
The boxes generate new public and private keys every 24 hours. 
<p>
When you initially turn on the box, the NetFortress burns the IP address of the machine it's attached to into flash ROM,
rendering the box incapable of working with a machine with any other address. 
<p>
A LAN version of the same box burns the class C address, and the two address types can be mixed together so that a smaller
remote office can use the single-IP NetFortress while the main office uses the LAN version. 
<p>
I examined the packets traveling between two locations using Novell Inc.'s LANalyzer 3.0. Predictably, I could easily decipher
packets captured before installing the NetFortress, and plain-text passwords for Telnet and FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
sessions abounded. 
<p>
After installing the NetFortress, however, I couldn't even tell which service a given packet was from -- everything but the
packet header itself was rendered undecipherable as it traversed the Internet. 
<p>
One downside to the NetFortress is the way it irreversibly burns some information into its flash ROM. Better hope your
network numbers don't change and that you never want to move your NetFortress to another location, because a NetFortress
won't work on any network except the one on which it was first brought up. 
<p>
You can return the box to the company or your reseller and have it reset, but this feature seems a bit heavy-handed. It doesn't
protect against anything other than physical theft of the box, in which case most accomplished technology thieves also would
have made off with the server. At the very least, the network administrator would have the burnt-in private keys for
corresponding units reset.

<p>
THE BOTTOM LINE: VERY GOOD 
<p>
NetFortress 
<p>
This little black box offers serious security for those who want to send confidential data using the Internet as a wide area
network. 
<p>
Pros: Easy setup; extreme security.
<br>
Cons: Complicated to reconfigure once set up.

<font size=3>Author: <A HREF="Mailto:Lauren_Paul@Zd.Com">Lauren Gibbons Paul</a></font><p>
<b><font color="#ff0000" size=5>Tunnel vision</font></b><br>
<font color="#fb334d" size=5>Many companies are eyeing virtual private networks to forge a secure tunnel in the very public Internet.</font><br>
<P>

Buy, don't build. Does that sound familiar? It's the strategy most companies are embracing for application development. But in some circles, that mantra is beginning to apply to corporate networks.<P>
The rethinking is in part due to the explosion of intranet/Internet access, which threatens to wreak havoc on the traffic patterns of corporate LANs and WANs. Hefty monthly telecommunications bills for the private leased lines or frame-relay services that form the backbone of most corporate WANs, along with heightened concerns about security on the World Wide Web, have left many IT execs grappling for a better way.<P>
One fast-emerging option is the VPN (virtual private network). Here, companies with high security needs carve out a piece of the Internet--the "tunnel"--and secure it with firewalls. Sounds simple enough, but what about those companies looking to get out of the construction business entirely when it comes to network infrastructure? For them, a growing number of telecommunications carriers and ISPs (Internet service providers) are offering outsourced VPN services, so remote offices don't miss out on the bounty of the corporate intranet. Either way, CIOs who've taken the VPN plunge are reporting big payoffs when it comes to reduced costs, better security and even improved performance.<P>
<H3>Business case</H3>
For Pat Rauchet, senior director of telecommunications for Simon &amp; Schuster Inc. (the $2.4 billion division of $12 billion entertainment behemoth Viacom Inc.), the decision was purely economic. The New York-based company was looking for a way to bring users at 50 remote international offices into its private network, comprising a dedicated frame relay WAN.<P>
Users at the international offices were not hooked up to the WAN--they had only Lotus Development Corp. cc:Mail LAN E-mail capability and were missing out on key corporate intranet goodies, such as a critical sales-force automation application. But creating the infrastructure would demand a hefty investment in an international leased line or a leased frame relay link, in addition to installing and managing the hardware connections. Rather than break the bank, Rauchet's group looked to InfoNet Services Corp.'s InfoLAN service.<P>
"We determined that, using InfoNet, the costs are about 10 percent of what it would have cost us to build our own dedicated network," says Rauchet. Another bonus: InfoNet's 24-by-7 help desk, which reduces the support head count somewhat, he adds.<P>
Costs might have been the motivator for Simon &amp; Schuster, but other companies are driven to outsourcing VPNs by the huge hype surrounding security on the Internet. Improved protection is one of the biggest attractions, according to Chip Schooler, director of Internet services for InfoNet, in El Segundo, Calif. "In the end, unless you're in the military, you'll always be on a public network. Even on a shared frame relay network, someone can break into it," Schooler says. Because the InfoLAN service is provided on InfoNet's private network--rather than tunneling through the Internet, as is usually the case with a VPN--the risks are fewer, he argues.<P>

<center>Glossary of terms for the brave new world of networking:</center> <P>
<ul>
<STRONG>VPN (virtual private network)</STRONG><BR>
<font size=2>The object of VPNs is to use the Internet as if it were a private network by "tunneling" across the public Internet and through corporate firewalls. The "tunnel" is encapsulated and encrypted to create a secure data path. Companies can outsource to an ISP (Internet service provider) or a VAN for this service or create their own by using a product such as DSN Technology's NetFortress.</font><P>
<STRONG>SVC (Switched Virtual Circuit)</STRONG> <BR>
<font size=2>Some ISPs are offering SVCs and Internet service over the same line. Companies needing a swift, guaranteed, secure pipeline for their intranet traffic can opt for SVC service, which uses frame relay or asynchronous transfer mode technology.</font><P>
<STRONG>RSVP (Resource Reservation Protocol)</STRONG><BR> <font size=2>Enables so-called "bandwidth on demand" by allowing  a receiver to request a specific amount of bandwidth for a particular data stream and receive a reply indicating whether the request has been granted or not. RSVP is in the draft stage of approval with the Internet Engineering Task Force.</font>
</ul>
<P>

<P>
Another consideration for CIOs looking to implement some or all of their intranets on InfoNet's network is performance. Intranet traffic will hit the WAN, where many companies are now running mission-critical applications, such as SAP America Inc.'s R/3 (see <a href="#mix">"It's not all mix and match"</a>), "and that will impact their performance," often in an unforeseen way, says Schooler.<P>
<H3>Safe passage</H3>
If a VPN fits the bill but the idea of outsourcing a key corporate network to an ISP doesn't, companies always have the option of building their own. That's where hiring a security expert or a consultant comes in, or you can assemble your own with one of many products now available.<P>
Digital Secured Networks Technology Inc. offers one, NetFortress, a hardware-based solution that provides black boxes that are placed between two points on the Internet, creating the secure "tunnel." As data is passed through the tunnel, it is encrypted using a heavy-duty 512-bit encryption scheme. The secure tunnel can be further safeguarded by placing firewalls at both ends, if companies already have an investment in them.<P>
DSN founder and Chairman Aharon Friedman maintains that additional security is unnecessary. Because NetFortress' encryption takes place at the network layer of the OSI data-packet model--rather than at the higher layers, as is the case with many firewalls--it is inherently much more secure, says Friedman, in Englewood Cliffs, N.J. Additionally, NetFortress provides automated public/private-key authentication between the two black boxes, with the private keys changing every 24 hours.<P>
Given the package, Friedman maintains NetFortress is not vulnerable to the pitfalls that firewalls are subject to--for example, "IP spoofing," where an intruder changes an IP address to that of a user who has access behind the firewall.<P>
But more than security, Friedman agrees that cost savings is the advantage VPNs have over leased lines. "Cost is a larger issue because their networks are so huge; they're paying a lot of money for those private lines," he says.<P>
Adds Peter Dyson, online editor and analyst at the Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, in Philadelphia: "Once you get into long lines, it's frighteningly expensive to run them yourself."<P>
DSN claims companies can save between 33 percent and 50 percent on telecommunications costs by using NetFortress to create their own VPN rather than going with leased lines. The company paid a consultant to prepare price comparisons for different network topologies. According to the DSN-sponsored study, for example, the monthly AT&amp;T Corp. charges for a T-1 mesh network from Los Angeles to Chicago to New York to Atlanta would be $26,942, vs. $11,280 for a comparable network implemented as an Internet VPN by PSInet, a popular ISP. "By saving on lines, [companies] can invest more in network equipment," says Friedman.<P>
Clark Frederick, chief applications officer for Interactive Broadcasting Systems Inc., an ISP in Madison, N.J., says using VPNs allows companies to get better performance at a lower cost because the traffic goes through a hub at the providers' location. "We are connected through the MFS [Metropolitan Fiber System] nationwide loop, so if you have locations in Arizona and New York, we connect them through our location. That traffic never even hits the Internet," says Frederick. "You get the utility of the Internet, but only the traffic that needs to goes out to the Internet."<P>
Whether the prophecy of some industry wags comes true, and private networks disappear altogether and are replaced by VPNs running over the Internet, remains to be seen. Yet there is unquestionably a transition toward hybrid networks that are part private, part outsourced. "How much of private networks that will get handed off to carriers that have spent billions on network infrastructure is an open question," says Steve Howard, president of network modeling tool vendor Make Systems Inc., in Mountain View, Calif. "But there is a process of migration to a hybrid network. That evolution is occurring now."<P>
David Linthicum, manager at AT&amp;T Solutions, in Vienna, Va., says people are increasingly going to realize they can gain value by connecting into the public network rather than the private network. "Why build it yourself? The third parties have already built their own," he says. "Let them worry about it."<P>

<H3><center><a name="mix">It's not all mix and match</a></center></H3>
So, you're in the process of rolling out a sparkling new intranet and finally getting around to giving Internet access to everyone in the corporation. Congratulations. But if your company is one of the hundreds nationwide that has invested heavily in SAP R/3, PeopleSoft or any other enterprise application suite, you'd better consider this: These tools and intranets don't always mix.<P>
That's the message being evangelized by Steve Howard, president and CEO of Make Systems Inc., maker of the NetMaker X/A suite of application-profiling and network modeling tools in Mountain View, Calif. Howard says if you don't do some advance planning, I-net (Internet/intranet) applications can hog all the bandwidth intended for critical enterprise planning or financial applications. That's not a pleasant thought: critical corporate data being held up in favor of someone in the mailroom checking the scores at the ESPN SportsZone.<P>
It often comes as a surprise to CIOs who are planning or are in the midst of a multimillion-dollar SAP rollout that critical R/3 applications will have to arm wrestle with I-net surfers to get needed bandwidth. That being the case, top IT executives were not initially much interested in tools for profiling Internet applications. "I don't know any CIO who would feel compelled to give you better performance for your [World Wide Web] browser, but for applications like SAP, response time becomes critical," Howard says.<P>
Because R/3 applications have their own dedicated applications and database servers, CIOs often think bandwidth won't be a problem. Not so. Says Howard: "R/3 will get hurt by the Web traffic. The R/3 server farm is usually in one location, but there are users in Europe and other countries. Everyone has to get across the network."<P>
Make Systems offers network resource planning for companies deploying R/3.<P>
Peter Dyson, online editor for The Seybold Report on Desktop Publishing, says he knows of no current product that will reserve bandwidth for a critical application like R/3 while letting Web surfers take the performance hit. "All packets going over the network are equal. If you have 400 users and they're all running Pathfinder, it's going to be like the Callahan Tunnel after a flight gets in at [Boston's] Logan [Airport]," says Dyson, in Philadelphia.<P>
And that means R/3 applications will be clogged up with the rest of the packets trying to make their way to the communications lines until the traffic jam clears up.<P>
<B><center>Nice profile</center><P>
</B><P>
The solution, says Howard, is to treat I-net applications like any other application: Profile them and plan network resources for them. In some cases that may mean something as simple as setting usage guidelines. For example, you could set certain hours of the day--perhaps the afternoon when Web traffic is at a notorious high--during which surfing is verboten.<P>
When planning to turn on an intranet, however, more substantive profiling and network resource planning is warranted, Howard says. "The Internet needs to be controlled. The intranet needs to be managed."<P>

Seybold's Dyson says CIOs with mission-critical applications on the shared client/server network must do network planning and modeling and traffic simulation. "But in reality, most people probably just buy what they can afford. Capacity planning tools are not designed to tell you what you really need, but to help you justify to upper management that you need more money," says Dyson. <BR>

<font size=6>Web Developer Magazine Article:</font>
<p>
<font size=3>Publication date: September, 1996</font><p>
<font size=3>Author: Peter H. Salus</font><p>
<font color="#ff0000" size=4>E N D - T O - E N D &nbsp; &nbsp; S E C U R I T Y</font><p>
<b><font color="#ff0000" size=5>Private Data Across The Internet</font></b><br>
<p>

Picture this: You're the network administrator of a business with three widely separated regional offices, each with its own Local Area Network (LAN). How do you keep them connected? And how can you make sure that the distant workers can share information seamlessly as if everyone was on one Wide Area Network?
<p>
Linking distant LANs via leased lines can be expensive to set up as well as an ongoing budget drain. For businesses with three or more distant LANs, maintaining multiple leased lines becomes even more costly. And for many small businesses, a leased line can be impractical, providing more bandwidth than is needed at too high a price.
<p>
A virtual private network (VPN) is a relatively inexpensive way to solve these problems. A VPN simulates a leased line bridging two LANs by sending inter-LAN data across the Internet. Rather than maintaining an expensive point-to-point leased line, a company can bridge the gap by connecting each LAN to a local Internet service provider, and routing the data through the Internet.
<p>
<strong>Why Bother?</strong><br>
Using a public network instead of a private one to share data within your company may seem odd, but VPNs do offer features unavailable with leased-line Wide Area Networks (WANs). VPNs are not limited to linking two LANs; any number of local networks and nodes can be included in the virtual wide area network. For a company with numerous sites to link, a VPN can mean a significant savings over maintaining far-reaching leased lines.
<p>
Virtual private networks can offer other advantages. For instance, VPNs can be set up to work at speeds slower than possible with leased lines. Not everyone needs 56 Kbps for their WAN; a small company could use 28.8 Kbps modems and cheap Internet accounts to create a worldwide, private network for as low as $40 a month.
<p>
A VPN doesn't necessarily need to be permanent. You can create a dial-on-demand virtual network using analog modems or ISDN. In this configuration, when a user on a LAN needs to access the WAN, a modem or router automatically connects to a nearby ISP and starts sending data across the Internet. On the remote side, the other ISP dials the second LAN to establish the link. Although this means slower connection times, this can be an inexpensive way to link sites that do not need a full-time connection. When dealing with remote contractors (such as graphic artists, programmers, or Web page designers), a temporary VPN may be just what you need to insure both confidentiality and good connectivity.
<p>
Of course, there are a few disadvantages. VPNs may be less stable than their point-to-point counterparts; with a VPN, your WAN is at the mercy of Internet traffic. When Internet slowdowns and brownouts happen -- and they do happen, however infrequently -- your WAN's connectivity will suffer. Traditional leased-line connections also go down, but they can be easier to troubleshoot.
<p>
An Internet-based VPN does not lock you into using a specific program or protocol to transfer data across the WAN: a correctly-configured VPN will let you use whatever clients and servers you already use, such as UNIX-based TCP/IP tools, Novell Netware, or Netscape Navigator.
<p>
If your existing network is not TCP/IP based, you can utilize "tunneling" to send your data over the Internet. Tunneling means using software to encode non-TCP/IP information within TCP/IP packets for routing through the Internet. At the receiving end, software removes the data from the TCP/IP packets for delivery on the LAN. Users of Novell or AppleTalk networks, for instance, can use tunneling to exchange data over the Internet. 
<p>
<strong>Privacy, Please</strong><br>
The key word in "virtual private network" is private. If you're sharing corporate secrets, sensitive Web logs, or payroll records among your sites, you don't want that information moving as plain text across the Internet, at the mercy of every cracker with a packet sniffer. A virtual network needs some form of authentication, and to be secure, it needs encryption. There are several ways to secure a virtual network; cost and difficulty of setup vary from choice to choice.<p>
All LANs that are part of a VPN must be configured to share a common encryption method. Encryption choices include International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Triple DES, and Encapsulated Security Payload. DES is a 20-year old Uncle Sam-approved encryption method, regarded as less secure than more recent encryption systems (Triple DES corrects many of the flaws of the original version). Encapsulated Security Payload encrypts data while using a checksum to verify its integrity.
<p>
Several software and hardware products for encrypting tunnels are available, from Digital Equipment Corp., Morning Star Technologies, PSINet and other firms. For example, Digital offers Internet <a href="http://altavista.software.digital.com/products/tunnel/intro.htm">Digital Tunnel</a>, which uses RSA public key encryption for authentication and RC4-based secret key technology for data encryption. During data transmission, the tunnel client and server regularly pass new encryption keys back and forth to decode transmitted data, making it virtually impossible to break the encryption code.
<p>
Due to United States export rules, international encryption cannot be as secure as U.S.-only communication -- a concern for international VPN administrators, no matter what products they use. In the United States, the Internet Digital Tunnel uses 128-bit key encryption, while the international version uses a (theoretically easier to crack) 40-bit key.
<p>
For the other issue, authentication of users, you'll need a firewall, a word that strikes fear and loathing into the hearts of some network administrators (after all, firewalls can be expensive and difficult to maintain). But firewalls are an easy way to create non-encrypted VPNs: In a simple example, each Internet-connected LAN can have a firewall which keeps out packets from everywhere other than specified sites.
<p>
If your LAN needs Internet connectivity as well as a VPN, you should carefully consider the options. Remember, although a VPN uses the Internet, it is effectively a point-to-point connection. If you need Internet access as well as WAN access, you will probably need a second Internet feed, and you may want to configure that connection with its own, more liberal firewall.
<p>
<strong>The Magic Black Box</strong><br>
A new generation of security products allows creation of a secure VPN without the hassle of creating a traditional firewall. For instance, the NetFortress by <a href="http://www.dsnt.com/hacker.html">DSN Technology Inc.</a> is a hardware product that limits outside access to a LAN to users on other authorized LANs. By placing a NetFortress between each LAN and its Internet connection, the product prevents access from Internet sites that aren't part of approved remote LANs. The system encrypts at the network layer, using a key that changes automatically.
<p>
The NetFortress is as close to plug-and-play as you can get: Connect one to each LAN, open a connection from one LAN to the other to force the units to exchange keys, and that's it -- you've got a virtual private network. You can use the system to easily connect any number of LANs, but at $4,995 per LAN, the NetFortress' ease of use comes at a price.
<p>
Another option is <a href="http://www.telecommerce.com/users/t/telchome/telchome.mw1/PoD.htm">Privacy on Demand (PoD) from TeleCommerce</a>. The company offers a $2,500 hardware package for companies that don't want Internet access, which includes a multi-protocol bridge/router with integrated firewall.  Data privacy using IDEA, DES, and Triple DES is available. Other options are available for companies that want to provide Internet access in addition to a VPN. 
<p>
<strong>Tunneling And Mobile Networking</strong><br>
Having a VPN doesn't even mean that all the nodes have to stay put. A mobile user can be part of a VPN by dialing in from the road and accessing the LAN just as if he or she were sitting in the office. Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is one such system. Proposed by Microsoft, 3Com, Ascend, ECI Telematics, and U.S. Robotics, the new protocol has been submitted to the Internet Engineering Task Force as a proposed standard.
<p>
PPTP is an extension of Remote Access Services in Windows NT and DialUp Networking in Windows 95. When connecting to a LAN through an ISP that is configured for PPTP, Windows NT and 95 users will be able to use PPTP without any additions or changes to the client software they already have. Just dial in, enter a password, and you're on your home LAN. PPTP is multi-protocol, so it doesn't matter if your LAN uses Novell IPX/SPX, NetBEUI, or TCP/IP. The URL for Microsoft's Web page about PPTP is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/pptppr.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/ntserver/pptppr.htm</a>, while the PPTP technical specifications can be found at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/inttech/pptp.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/intdev/inttech/pptp.htm</a>.
<p>
According to Microsoft, PPTP will be a part of Windows NT 4.0 in both server and workstation products, and will be available later for Windows 95. The protocol includes both encryption and compression, though the version to be included in Windows NT 4.0 is designed for mobile workers, not as a site-to-site protocol. Microsoft plans to eventually introduce a server-to-server version in addition to the current client-server implementation.

<p>

Netfortress is a hardware-based approach to intranet security.  As a
standalone unit or with a firewall, it offers point-to-point encrypted
transmissions between the computer or LAN it protects and an outside
network.  NetFortress encrypts the entire application layer and the
transport-layer headers.  This type of network-layer encryption leaves
no information exposed, thus preventing any manipulation of communications
packets' content.
<p>
NetFortress automatically authenticates communications at both ends of
the transmission, eliminating user intervention in the verification
process.  A public-based 512-bit dual key exchange, with keys changing
every 24 hours, ensures that only users with NetFortress boxes are allowed
to access encrypted information.  "User names, priorities and passwords
should be used as additional security because NetFortress binds to the
desktop unit", said Dr. Aharon Friedman, founder, chairman and chief
technology officer of DSN Technology.
<p>
Installed by plugging in two cables, NetFortress automatically finds
and locks onto the host or server's IP/ethernet address.  A plug-and-play
box roughly the size of a VCR, NetFortress is compatible with all hardware
platforms and operating systems.  It also eliminates the maintenance and
monitoring required by firewall products. "It is not a firewall, but the
NetFortress box can serve in tandem with one for increased security", said
Clark Frederick, chief applications officer with IBS Interactive, a high-end
Internet-service provider in Madison, NJ.
<p>
NetFortress, operating at T1-line speeds, can encrypt and secure communications
for companies that now prefer Internet tunneling to leased lines.
It costs $4,995 for a single host and $8,995 for a LAN.

	Networld+Interop in the Georgia World Congress Center, September 18-20.  DSN
	will be in booth 344H.
	<p> 
	"The NetFortress encryption product is a great alternative for those who
	want to send confidential information over the Internet instead of using a
	more costly private network," writes Info World's test center in the
	September 9, 1996 product review section.  "I greatly appreciated the
	NetFortress' lack of complexity...  The system worked flawlessly."
	<p>
	Literally a black box, the NetFortress fully automates hardware-based
	athentication, encryption and key exchange into a plug and play solution.
	It completely eliminates the possibility of IP spoofing, eavesdropping and
	break-ins.
 	<p>
	ommenting on the product's advanced encryption methodology, Info World
	writes, "I examined the packets traveling between two locations...  After
	installing the NetFortress,...  I couldn't even tell which service a given
	packet was from - everything but the packet header itself was rendered
	undecipherable as it traversed the Internet."
	<p>
	DSN will release a white paper on the NetFortress at Interop DotCom.  The
	report will provide technical explanations of the NetFortress'
	authentication, encryption and key exchange procedures.
	<p>
	Members of the press are invited to stop by the booth or make an appointment
	with PR Manager Jo Lee to learn more about the NetFortress.

	DSN's CHAIRMAN URGES SENATE COMMITTEE TO RELAX ENCRYPTION EXPORT LAWS  (<A HREF="june12speech.html">READ THE SPEECH</a>)
	<p>
	Testimony Before Senate Hearings Shows Current Law Threatens America's
	Ability to Compete with Foreign Developers of Encryption Technology Products

	Testimony Before Senate Hearings Shows Current Law Threatens Americas
	Ability to Compete with Foreign Developers of Encryption Technology Products
	<P>
	June 13, 1996. Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  Dr. Aharon Friedman, Founder and
	Chairman of DSN Technology testified yesterday in a hearing before the
	Senate Sub-Committee on Technology, Science, and Space that current
	government restrictions on the export of high-level encryption products
	undermine the competitive position of American companies in this global market.
	<P>
	As an expert cryptographer, Dr. Friedman testified in support S. 1726,
	Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996, or "Pro-CODE".
	<P>
	"Today, we have in our office an executive from a major Japanese company
	who is interested in evaluating our security solution for several large
	installations.  This company is attracted to our product because of its
	advanced encryption technology.  However, existing laws turn the products
	strength into a liability and may force this prospective client to seek a
	solution from a foreign  competitor."
	<p>
	Dr. Friedman dramatically demonstrated how hackers armed with a $400
	computer chip can easily break the encryption, or the keys, of security
	products that American companies are limited to export.  Better endowed
	terrorist governments or criminals engaged in corporate espionage can break
	these keys in less than a second.
	<p>
	"While existing laws deny adequate encryption to companies engaged in legal
	activities, access to more powerful encryption solutions remain available
	for illegal purposes."  Demonstrating this point, Dr. Friedman turned to
	page 637 of Applied Cryptography written by Bruce Schneier, and showed the
	committee members code for an unbreakable encryption program that hackers
	can use to circumvent existing encryption laws.
	<p>
	Testimony in support of the bill was also presented by:
 	<ul>
	<li>Michael Zisman, president and CEO of Lotus
	<li>Jim Barksdale, president and CEO of Netscape Communications
	<li>Jim Bidzos, president and CEO of RSA Data Security, and
	<li>Tim Krauskopf, V.P. and co-founder of Spyglass Inc.
	</ul>
	Full text of Dr. Friedmans speech is available by fax or email.  It is also
	published in full at DSNs web site:  http://www.dsnt.com
	<p>
	Representing a quantum leap forward in Intranet security, the NetFortress'
	unique core technology creates an impenetrable line of communication over
	the Internet to other NetFortress protected hosts.  It fully integrates
	automated hardware-based IP authentication, network layer encryption, and

	Commenting on Visa and Mastercard's Secure Electronic Transactions (SET)
	standard, Dr. Friedman said that "consumers should be extremely careful of
	using their credit cards on the Internet until SET's encryption and
	authentication procedures are radically improved.  While I strongly support
	the idea behind SET, the standard as it is currently proposed fails to
	provide a sufficient level of security to support electronic commerce."
	<P>
	Announced in February by Visa and Mastercard, SET establishes a single
	technical standard for protecting payment card purchases made over open
	networks such as the Internet.  Participants in the SET consortium include
	Microsoft, Netscape Communications Corp., GTE, IBM, SAIC, Terisa Systems,
	Verisign and others.  SET is based on encryption and authentication
	technology from RSA Data Security (recently purchased by Security Dynamics.)
	<P>
	According to Dr. Friedman, "The degree of protection provided by RSA's
	encryption method is very disappointing.  Their encryption method only
	encrypts parts of a communication packet leaving critical information
	exposed."  This info say DSN officials can be used by cyber-criminals to
	corrupt the transaction process.
	<P>
	Set's authentication procedure also carries risks for consumers says Dr.
	Friedman.  "SET's authentication procedure relies on a completely insecure
	medium, namely software, to verify the parties involved in a transaction
	process."  SET designates a third party, called a certificate authority, to
	authenticate the sender and receiver.  This certificate authority is no more
	than a series of software applications, or lines of code that can be altered
	by unauthorized users. Dr. Friedman warned, "Unlike hardware, software
	security solutions are very susceptible to alteration and should not be
	relied on as an authentication mechanism."
	<P>
	Dr. Friedman said that, "A hardware solution that encrypts at a more
	elementary level can be integrated into the overall SET framework."

	Established in 1995, DSN Technology Inc. is a developer of patent-pending
	network security solutions for Intranets and virtual private networks.  The
	company's flagship product, the NetFortress, fully integrates IP
	authentication, network layer encryption and dual key exchange into a
	seamless hardware-based, plug and play solution.

	DSN TECHNOLOGY CLOSES OVER $2.1M IN FINANCING TO SUPPORT
	STRONG DEMAND FOR ITS INTRANET SECURITY PRODUCTS
	<p>
	</font>
	<font size=3>
	April 1, 1996, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.  DSN Technology today
	announced that it has raised over $2.1 million in private
	placement funding from a number of prominent companies
	and venture capitol groups.  Standard Micro Systems (SMC) contributed
	the largest share showing their strong support for DSN's
	patent pending security technology.  Other investors include DST		 	
	Systems, Camelot Capital, Building Capital Partners LP, Gerbino Hedge
	Fund LP, and Mr. Thomas C.K. Yuen.
	<p>
	According to DSN company officials, the private placement was
	significantly oversubscribed.
	<p>
	"DSN's powerful yet easy to use network security products provide
	the missing security link for companies interested in taking advantage
	of the outstanding cost-savings that virtual private networks offer",
	said Dr. Aharon Friedman, DSN's founder and chairman. "This financing
	will enable us to expand our existing operations and implement new programs
	in marketing, product development and customer support to better service
	our customers".
	<p>
	DSN's flagship product, the NetFortress, is a point-to-point, hardware-based
	security solution for corporate Internet or Intranet network systems.
	The size of a small computer, the platform independent NetFortress
	automatically locks on to the IP address of its host (computer or LAN)
	creating an impenetrable line of communication over the Internet to other
	NetFortress protected hosts.
	<p>
	Operating at T1 speeds, the NetFortress is the only product to fully
	integrate IP authentication, 512-bit dual key exchange and network

	Testimony supporting the relaxation of encryption export laws as put forth
	in S.1726, The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996, or "Pro-CODE"
	<p>
	</font>
	
	<i><font size=4>Presented by Dr. Aharon Friedman<br>
	to the Commerce Sub-Committee on Science, Technology and Space</i></font>
	<br><br><br>
	</center>
	June 12, 1996
	<p>
	Chairman and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak
	to you today.
	<p>
	I am here to support "The Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996",
	referred to as Pro-CODE.
	<p>
	Let me begin by introducing myself.  My name is Aharon Friedman.  I am the founder,
	chairman and chief technology officer of Digital Secured Network Technology, of DSN.
	Established in 1995 with headquarters in New Jersey, DSN develops and markets
	encryption and authentication solutions for open network communications, such as the
	Internet.  My previous positions include scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratories,
	senior researcher at SAIC, and professor of electrical engineering at the University
	of Maryland.  I received my Ph.D. Summa Cum Laude in Physical Electronics from
	Tel-Aviv University.
	<p>
	I am here today to discuss how Pro-CODE benefits American cryptography companies
	by relaxing laws that restrict the export of American encryption products.  By
	relaxing these export laws, this bill allows American companies such as DSN to
	compete on an equal footing with foreign competitors.  Loosening these restrictive
	laws dramatically improves our competitive position in both international and
	domestic markets.  Yet Pro-CODE supports American companies without jeopardizing
	national security.  Existing export laws are impractical and unenforceable and
	need to be reevaluated in light of the availability of advanced technologies.
	<p>
	As you probably know, encryption is accomplished by scrambling and de-scrambling
	data with a numeric key.  this encryption process makes it extremely difficult
	and time consuming for anyone other than those with the correct keys to recover and 
	read the original text.  The more sophisticated the mathematical formula and the
	longer the key, the better a product will defend computer systems and information
	against an attack.  According to a recently released report by a panel of leading
	security and cryptography experts, to provide adequate protection against serious
	threats, keys should be at least 75-bits long.&#185;
	<p>
	<font size=4>
	Effect of Existing Export Laws on American Companies in the International
	Market
	</font>
	<p>
	By law, American companies can only export security solutions with a maximum
	key length of 40-bits.  This level of encryption does not in any way provide
	adequate protection against attackers.  The report cited above found that widely
	available $400 computer chips enable hackers to break 40-bit keys in five hours.
	A company spending $300,000 could find the right 40-bit key in an average
	of 0.18 seconds.  Clearly, a 40-bit key solution is not a viable encryption
	product.
	<p>
	Existing laws do allow American companies to export DES encryption products
	with 56-bit keys providing foreign clients are willing to place part of the 
	key in escrow with a third party.  Despite the additional strength of a
	56-bit key, foreign clients will be reluctant to purchase these products
	since expert calculations show that DES is cheaper and easier to break than
	previously thought.  With a $300,000 investment in computer network
	equipment, a legitimate or illegitimate business could find a DES key in an
	average of 19 days using off-the-shelf technology.  With this same
	$300,000 investment, using a custom developed chip, a key can be found
	in 3 hours.  For future reference, I have included a matrix that provides
	more details on the vulnerability of 40 and 56-bit key encryption solutions.
	<br>
	(See <a href="#MATRIX">matrix</a> at bottom of this page).
	<p>
	Please keep in mind, these numbers only refer to the keys used to encrypt
	data (cipher key lengths).  Keys that are exchanged between parties, or
	public keys, require a greater key length.
	<p>
	It's clear that the 40 and 56 bit key encryption will not adequately 
	protect electronic communications.  Foreign companies will not want
	to buy these products.  In order to survive, American companies will
	bypass these laws and develop their products in foreign countries.
	This would be a tremendous loss for America's economy.  A recent study
	commissioned by a group of high-tech CEO's (Computer Systems Policy
	Project) estimates that the opportunity loss to US companies as a
	result of current export policy restrictions in the next four years is
	$60 billion and the loss of 200,000 jobs many of which are high-skill
	and high-paying.
	<p>
	On a personal note, DSN has a steady stream of requests for product information
	frmo foreign companies.  We have also had a number of meetings with a major
	Japanese company interested in evaluating uor security solution for several
	large installations.  This company is attracted to our product because of
	its advanced use of a 512-bit key.  However, under existing export laws,
	the product's strength becomes a liability.  If these policies are not
	changed to allow the export of competitive encryption products, we will
	clearly lose this lucrative contract to a foreign competitor.
	<p>
	<font size=4>
	Effect of Export Laws on the Domestic Market
	</font>
	<p>
	Export restrictions threaten to lock American companies out of our own
	domestic market as well.  Advanced American encryption products can be used
	by an American company, for example IBM, to secure communications to another
	American company.  Yet IBM will not be able to use this same product to secure 
	communications with foreign companies.  For two parties to encrypt their data 
	transmissions, they must use the same keys and protocols at both ends.  
	Under current export restrictions, a foreign company would not be able to 
	encrypt messages to IBM if IBM used a high-end American encryption product.  
	Faced with this dilema, IBM may choose to buy its security product from a 
	foreign company that can sell its products unrestricted on a global basis.
	<p>
	As a matter of fact, NTT has quietly begun selling a powerful data-scrambling
	chip (Triple DES) and has already made sales in 15 countries, including in the
	United States.  It just so happens that one of these companies is IBM.
	<p>
	It should also be noted, that under existing laws an American company developing
	a product based on this NTT chip will not be able to sell the product back to 
	Japan, not even to NTT.
	<p>
	In our opinion, American companies will not purchase encryption products developed by
	American companies because it just doesn't make good business sense.  Export
	laws responsible for this predicament clearly need to be changed.  Start-up companies
	such as DSN have better and more powerful solutions available but we are 
	consistently stymied by government restrictions.  Small businesses have enough problems
	without having to deal with senseless government regulations.  All we want is to be
	on a level playing field with foreign developers of encryption products.  
	Senator Burns' bill does just that.
	<p>
	<font size=4>
	Current Laws Do Not Solve the Problem -- Criminal Elements Can Easily Violate Them
	</font>
	<p>
	Due to the availability of powerful computing capabilities, current laws and
	regulations governing American encryption products are impractical and
	unenforceable.  There is at present no way of stopping terrorist
	organizations and criminals from writing, or hiring someone to write their
	own code based on published unbreakable encryption algorithms.  For example,
	I have with me today a widely available book titled, <i>Applied Cryptography</i>
	written by Bruce Schneier.  On pages 637 through 643, Mr. Schneier provides all
	the source code a hacker would need to write a powerful encryption program.
	A hacker would simply need to scan the text on these pages into his
	computer to circumvent existing export laws.  We can safely assume these
	criminals are not going to register part of these keys in escrow with the 
	government.
	<p>
	Thus we are confronted with an unfortunate irony.  While existing laws deny
	adequate ecryption to companies engaged in legal activities, access to more
	powerful encryption solutions remain available for illegal purposes.  In the
	words of Monday's New York Times editorial, "clearly it is time to revise
	Government encryption policy to fit this new universe".&#178;	
	<p>
	Senator Burns' proposal allows American companies to export encryption products
	that match products available in the international arena.  As a representative
	of a business that markets and develops powerful, state of the art encryption
	products, I can tell you that this bill restores America's competitive
	advantage in a rapidly expanding market.
	<p>
	Once again, thank you for the privilege of speaking with you today.  I hope
	my testimony will be of value to the committee, and I would be happy to
	entertain any questions you might have.

<h5>Thank you for visiting our web page. We appreciate your interest. If this is your first visit, 

<a href="/help.htm">please visit our Site Help page.</a> </h5>

<h5>The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) was founded in 1972. We are a grass roots, 

self-help, support and advocacy organization dedicated to improving the lives of people with severe 

mental illness and their loved ones. NAMI strives to reduce stigma and ignorance of severe mental illness 

to help eliminate discrimination and restrictions on access to essential treatments and life supports such 

as employment, housing, health insurance, and social contact. We have over 1,100 affiliate groups and 

coalition operations in all 50 states, with over 140,000 members. </h5><h5>NAMI membership mainly 

consists of consumers, family members, and friends of people who suffer from severe, disabling brain disorders such 

as schizophrenia, clinical depression, bipolar disorder (manic-depression), panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder,

 and severe disorders in children. If you would like to find out more about becoming a member, 

<a href="/joinform.htm">please go to our membership page.</a> Also, please check out our

<li><h5>Severe mental illnesses are biologically-based brain diseases that profoundly disrupt a 

person&#146;s ability to think, feel &amp; relate to others or to their environment.</h5></li>

<li><h5>Severe mental illnesses are more common than cancer, diabetes, or heart disease.</h5></li>

<li><h5>In any given year, over 5 million Americans suffer from severe mental illness.</h5></li>

<li><h5>1 in every 5 families are affected by severe mental illness in their lifetime.</h5></li>

<li><h5>The treatment success rate for schizophrenia is 60%, 80% for bipolar disorder, &amp; 

65% for major depression whereas the treatment success rate for heart disease ranges from 41-52%.

</h5></li><li><h5>A conservative estimate is that a total of 12% or 7.5 million youths have mental, 

behavioral, or developmental disorders, yet only 1/5 of them receive treatment.</h5></li>

<li><h5>The #1 reason for hospital admissions nationwide is psychiatric disorder.</h5></li>

<li><h5>At any moment, almost 21% of hospital beds are filled by people with mental illness.</h5></li>

<li><h5>In 1990, mental illnesses cost the US $74 billion.</h5></li><li><h5>1/4 of all Social Security 

Disability payments are for individuals with severe mental illnesses.</h5></li><li><h5>Those dealing 

with mental illness have been blamed &amp; stigmatized for their disorders because their disorders 

were so misunderstood.</h5></li><li><h5>Mental Illnesses are biologically-based, no-fault brain 

disorders.</h5></li><li><h5>Some well-known people who suffered from severe mental illness are 

Abraham Lincoln, Beethoven, Van Gogh, Isaac Newton, Winston Churchill, &amp; Michelangelo.</h6></li>

<A NAME="browser"><H2>Why do your pages look odd?</H2></a>



The NAMI Web pages are friendly to all browsers but we recommend using <strong>Netscape 3.0, 

 AOL 3.0, or Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0</strong>.  You can get a copy of the browser at 

<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/comprod/mirror/index.html">Netscape</A> or

<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ie/iedl.htm">Microsoft</a>.  AOL provides directions for updating their browser.

<P>

 A browser that supports tables will display the following as 3 blocks from left to right:

<TABLE BORDER=3 CELLSPACING=5 CELLPADDING=5>

<TR>

<TD>Block 1<BR></TD><TD>Block 2</BR></TD><TD>Block 3</BR></TD>

</TR>

</TABLE>

<P>



<A NAME="slow"><H2>Why is the server slow?</H2></a>

Several problems can cause a slow connection:

<UL>

<LI>Use of an old or beta version browser</a>

<LI>Accessing the Internet during peak hours</a>

<LI>Using a slow modem to access pages with graphics</a>

</UL>

The Internet is too vast to troubleshoot individual communication problems but we will make every effort

to correct known problems.  Review the section above for a <A HREF="#browser">browser</a> recommendation.

<P>



<A NAME="affiliate"><H2>How do I contact a local NAMI affiliate?</H2></a>

 A list of the <A HREF="/about/listo.htm">state alliances</A> is available to help you find a local affiliate.  This list also includes a list of our affiliates with Internet pages.



<A NAME="when"><H2>When will you update your pages?</H2></a>

 We try to update the pages weekly.  Please try using the reload option to access the most recent information.  <B><I>AOL users</I></B> can press ctrl while selecting the reload option to refresh the page.

        the Mentally Ill&#146;s Campaign to End Discrimination</strong>

        is a five-year, nationwide effort to end discrimination against

        people with severe mental illnesses. Mental illnesses are

        brain disorders.  They are every bit as real and deserving of treatment as illnesses

        that affect other parts of the body. &nbsp;</td>

    </tr>

</table>



<p>If people with mental illnesses are to receive the treatment, respect,

and economic opportunities they deserve, we will have to change

the behaviors and public policies of lawmakers and public

officials. We will have to challenge the corporate policies of our nation&#146;s businesses

and the attitudes of our nation&#146;s opinion leaders towards

people with brain disorders. </p>



<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> To improve the quality of

life for people with brain disorders by working to ensure dignity

and by securing non-discriminatory access to quality health care, housing,

education, and all economic opportunities. </p>

<h5>The NAMI <i>Helpline</i> is a toll-free 
information and referral service for people 
affected by mental illness. We offer 
support, information, and referral to local 
and state NAMI affiliates. The <i>Helpline</i> is 
accessible from all 50 states. There are four 
lines which we staff Monday through 
Friday between 10am and 5pm, EST. At 
other times, people may leave their name 
and address on the voice mail system, and 
we will send them information. </h5>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">Why do people call the <i>Helpline</i>?</font> </h4>
<h5>People call with a wide variety of 
situations and problems. Their questions 
may range from a simple &quot;please send me 
information&quot; to urgent requests for help in 
handling an emergency. Although we are 
not a &quot;crisis line,&quot; we sometimes receive 
calls from people experiencing urgent 
problems. Most calls fall somewhere in 
between. Callers come from all walks of 
life, with varying abilities to handle the 
complex difficulties that mental illness 
presents. </h5>
</td><td valign=top width=50%><h4><font color="#FF0000">What does the <em><i>Helpline</i></em> NOT do?</font> </h4>
<h5><strong><u>We do not make specific doctor referrals....</u></strong> </h5>
<ul>
<li><h5>because people's experience with any 
given doctor may vary greatly from 
person to person, and </h5>
</li>
<li><h5>to avoid organizational liability. </h5>
</li>
</ul>
<h5>If you are looking for a doctor, you may 
want to talk to the members of your local 
AMI, who can share their experiences and 
offer suggestions on what to look for. </h5>
<h5><strong><u>We also do not recommend specific 
treatment methods or give advice on 
medication use.</u></strong> While we may give basic 
information about medications, we 
absolutely refrain from communicating 
anything that could be construed as 
medical advice. We are lay people and are 
not trained in the use of medications or 
other treatments. We can encourage you to 
order the books NAMI has for sale on 
psychiatric medications as well as 
encourage you to seek a second opinion if 
you are not satisfied with a doctor's 
handling of your medication. </h5>

<P>
Severe and persistent mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, manic depression or clinical depression, are biologically based brain diseases.  More than one and a half million people's lives are affected in Florida.  State studies report more than 400,000 adults suffer from a severe mental illness and 150,000 children and adolescents are seriously emotionally disturbed.  These, together with family member care providers, add up to more than 1,500,000 Floridians.
<P>
Living with and being responsible for the care of a loved one with a catastrophic mental illness is a physically, emotionally and financially draining experience.
<P>
Due to meager or non-existent coverage in private health insurance policies, most families must rely on a public mental health service delivery system funded to serve only 20% of the need.
<P>
Recent legislative action curtailing the availability of Medicaid funds will further cripple an already seriously inadequate system.
<P>
To be able to cope effectively in this environment, families need resource information, education on treatment therapies, medications and on-going emotional support.  They then can deal more effectively with their family situation and reduce dependency on an already over-burdened system.
<P>
Families are increasingly the primary caregiver, and in too many cases, the sole caregiver.
<P>

<STRONG>Addressing the Problem:</STRONG>
<P>
The Florida Alliance for the Mentally Ill (FAMI) is a statewide nonprofit 501 c (3) organization that represents the largest collective voice of individuals in the state dedicated to improving the lives of people who suffer from a severe mental illness.  We were founded in 1984 by families to provide peer group support, educate the public about these illnesses, and advocate for the creation of strong social and health care support services at the local, state and national levels.  FAMI currently has 1600 families in 39 affiliates across Florida.  We are the state affiliate of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, having 140,000 families in 1,100 affiliates throughout the nation.
<P>
The potential influence of FAMI is enormous in helping to provide a better future for those who are mentally ill.  For family members, that is reason enough.  For others, your support will help lessen a huge societal problem causing billions of dollars in lost work productivity, rising medical costs, increased homelessness, and violence.
<P>
Treatment works!  The mentally ill can recover and lead productive, satisfying lives.  More can with access to proper care.  We have a big job to do.  We will succeed.  We must.

<P>
<STRONG>Program Description:</STRONG>
<P>
The JOURNEY OF HOPE Family Education Program is a 12 session course for families of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  The curriculum focuses on three major psychiatric illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression), emphasizing the clinical treatment of these illnesses and teaching the knowledge and skills family members need to cope more effectively with them.  Each weekly session runs for 2 1/2 hours and the course is taught by trained family member volunteers working in co-leader pairs.
<P>
Classes are held in neutral locations (churches, schools, libraries) to avoid the stigma many families associate with clinics and mental health centers.
<P>
On Our Own:  Family Members Serve As Teachers
<P>
The JOURNEY OF HOPE Family Education Program is the national outgrowth of an innovative family education project developed by AMI-Vermont in 1991.  Now in its fifth year, this successful family-to-family education curriculum taught exclusively by family members themselves.
<P>
From its inception, the program has been dedicated to the principle that family members can teach a course of considerable depth and complexity and can be depended upon to run a first-rate family education program without professional supervision.  Family member volunteers are given intensive training for this task, and after teaching one 12-week cycle of classes they are awarded a Family Education Specialist certificate.
<P>
There are many compelling reasons why we chose to design and use an educational program which empowers family members as teachers:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>We wish to recognize the value of family-based knowledge and skills

<LI>We want family members to be respected as capable, knowledgeable peers in the mental health system

<LI>We believe that individuals who have come through the travail of mental illness in their family make superb teachers and leaders

<LI>We think that family-member teachers represent a standard of self-learning and "know-how" that inspires other families

<LI>We want to be absolutely certain that our teachers reach out to families from the heart
</UL>
<P>

Additionally, we are eager to expand leadership opportunities within local AMI organizations, to identify new leaders around each state, and, encourage younger people to become a valuable part of our AMI work.
<P>
In the final course evaluation from participants across the country, the decision to use family-member teachers has been enthusiastically endorsed by families taking the course.  Teacher ratings are universally positive; many family members taking the course sign up for the next teacher training, providing a constantly growing "staff" of family educators in each state.  As a result of our teaching experience, many of use are getting more involved in education - running high school support groups, teaching university and medical classes, speaking to civic groups and organizing informational workshops for clergy and other interested professionals.  Family Education "on our own" is invigorating AMI state organizations, making us more determined as advocates, raising our level of expertise, and giving us a new sense of entitlement and confidence.

    <li>The November 21 Saturday Night Live featured a skit

        lampooned people with brain disorders by explicitly

        mocking symptoms like auditory delusions, compulsive

        behavior, and hallucinations. The program was in very poor

        taste and was completely inappropriate for television.</li>

        pathetic. Mental illnesses are physical disorders of the

<h4>August 1996</h4>



<p><font size="4">NAMI has learned of a computer game that is due

to be released this fall by Sierra On-Line which exploits the

stigma associated with brain disorders. We are asking that all

NAMI members write, phone, fax, and/or email this company demanding

they to cease the manufacture of this damaging and hurtful

product.</font></p>



<ul>

    <li>Sierra On-Line promotes the game, &quot;<u>Phantasmagoria

        2: A Puzzle of Flesh</u>,&quot; as a &quot;psychological horror

        story of madness, murder, and the blackest depths of the

        human soul&quot; at the <a

        href="http://www.sierra.com/games/phantas2">game&#146;s

        Web page</a> .</li>

    <li>The game is described in a July 1996 article of <i>PC

        GAMES</i> magazine as a CD-ROM computer game in which the

        main character must &quot;escape&quot; from the clutches

        of his &quot;mental troubles.&quot; The character experiences

        auditory and visual hallucinations and relives the memory

        of his mother&#146;s suicide. In addition, the character

        is forced to flee from a &quot;mental institution and the

        sadistic doctor who delighted in torturing him.&quot;

        Eventually, the character, &quot;being pursued by

        madness&quot; is &quot;fingered as the prime

        suspect&quot; in a series of murders.</li>

</ul>



<p>This product is abhorrent and discriminatory. Please help NAMI

tell Sierra On-Line that this sort of stigmatizing stereotyping

is absolutely unacceptable!</p>



<p>NAMI has expressed our concerns and outrage at the &quot;<u>Phantasmagoria

2: A Puzzle of Flesh</u>&quot; computer game. All NAMI members

and friends are encouraged to contact Ken Williams, the CEO of Sierra On-Line,

and let him know that stigma and discrimination against people

with brain disorders is not tolerable.</p>

<p><a name="overview"><b>Overview</b></a><b> of the Science and
Treatment Kit</b>:</p>

<p>This Science and Treatment Kit is designed to help you create
awareness among key audiences in your community that severe
mental illnesses are biologically based brain disorders that can
be successfully diagnosed and treated. </p>

<p>Promoting widespread recognition that brain disorders are
treatable is essential to securing parity and ending
discrimination. Quite simply, why would a state legislator or
insurance company require coverage for these conditions -- such
as schizophrenia or major depression -- if they didn&#146;t believe treatment
was effective? </p>

<p>As evidenced by current federal and state debates around
parity in health insurance for brain disorders, misperceptions
about the effectiveness and cost of treatment continue to emerge
as counter arguments.</p>

<p>At the same time, individuals with a previous history of brain
disorders continue to be dropped from their insurance policies,
barred from securing a new policy, or faced with other types of
serious discrimination (e.g., jobs, housing). The assumption?
Brain disorders cannot be cost effectively treated, and people
never really recover. The insurance industry and major employers also
complain that insurance costs will escalate dramatically with
parity. </p>

<p>The Science and Treatment Kit will help you make strong and
convincing arguments that:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Severe mental illnesses are<i> brain disorders</i> that
        are caused by chemical imbalances in the brain, which is
        one of the body&#146;s primary organs. Brain disorders
        are biologically based medical problems like other physical illnesses.<b> </b></li>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.</li>
    <li>The cost of treating brain disorders is comparable to
        treating many other physical illnesses.</li>
    <li>People with brain disorders can lead healthy, productive
        lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>These messages are key to the success of this campaign.</p>

<p>This Kit is designed to be easy to use. It features practical
outreach ideas and examples from AMI affiliates across the
country, along with a variety of materials you can localize and
use in your communities over the long term. Each part of the kit
available on our site has a Microsoft Word or PowerPoint
version you may download for added convenience.</p>

<p><a name="know"><b>Getting</b></a><b> to Know Your Audiences</b>:</p>

<p>The Science and Treatment Kit will help you target three key
audiences: media, legislators, and the civic/business community.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><b>Media</b> is the primary channel for reaching
    legislators, civic/business leaders, and a broader consumer
    audience with accurate information about brain disorders. You
    can reach these audiences by targeting science/health,
    business, and editorial reporters and public service
    directors. By crafting the right story angles, you can secure
    coverage of brain disorder issues. Provided in this kit are a
    variety of suggested story ideas and activities to help you
    attract the media&#146;s attention.</p>
    <p><b>Legislators</b> at the national and state levels have
    been increasingly involved in the debate about health
    insurance coverage for brain disorders. Even if legislators
    in your area are not currently engaged in this debate, seize
    the opportunity to lay a positive foundation before parity
    and other anti-discrimination issues emerge. Be proactive.
    Provide legislators with the latest cost and treatment information
    available, which demonstrates that brain disorders can be
    treated more cost effectively than many other physical illnesses. Adopt
    legislators, and educate them one at a time. If you can convince legislators
    to take brain disorders seriously, you have begun to shape
    future mental health legislation.</p>
    <p>Most <b>business leaders </b>have probably encountered
    family members or employees with brain disorders. However,
    these employers probably have limited understanding about the
    science and treatment of brain disorders and the need for
    comprehensive health insurance coverage and protection
    against discrimination. Many of your members have valuable
    ties to the business community. Ask them to arrange meetings
    for you to present the science and treatment messages.
    Through outreach to worksites and civic groups, you can
    convince business leaders that brain disorders are serious
    problems which can be effectively treated. Health insurance executives
    are also an important business audience because they play a
    pivotal role in shaping the extent of coverage for brain disorders.
    In addition, local voluntary organizations can lend their support
    to anti-discrimination efforts if they are equipped with information
    about the impact of brain disorders on their members and
    communities.</p>

<p>You may know--or know of--someone who has a &quot;mental
illness,&quot; but you may <i>not</i> know what a &quot;mental
illness&quot; is.</p>

<p>A mental illness is, more accurately, a <i>brain disorder</i>;
and brain disorders--like epilepsy--are <i>biologically based</i>
medical problems. The newest medical technology can take
&quot;pictures&quot; that show differences between brains with disorders
and normal brains.</p>

<p>In any given year, about five million American adults suffer
from an acute episode of one of five serious brain disorders:
schizophrenia, manic depression, severe depression,
obsessive-compulsive disorder, and panic disorder. Even many of
America's children--more than three million--suffer from these disorders.</p>

<p>Untreated, disorders of the brain profoundly disrupt a
person's ability to think, feel, and relate to others and to his
or her environment. Despite age-old myths and misinformation,
&quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused by bad character,
poor child-rearing, or an individual's behavior.</p>

centuries they have been misunderstood, feared, hidden, and often
ignored by science. Only in the last few decades has the first real
hope for people with mental illnesses surfaced, and that hope has
grown from pioneering research that found both a biological basis
for brain disorders and treatments that work. </p>

<p>Brain disorders are treatable. The current success rate for
treating schizophrenia is 60 percent. The success rate for
treating manic depression is 65 percent, and for major depression
it is 80 percent. Mental illnesses can now be diagnosed and
treated as precisely and effectively as other medical disorders.
But the stigma--and the discrimination caused by that stigma--remains.</p>

<p>Yours may be one of the five families in the United States
that is or will be directly affected by a serious brain disorder.
Such families face an unfair system that still treats them as
&quot;less than,&quot; &quot;not as important as,&quot; or
&quot;not equal to&quot; the rest of Americans. <i>All</i>
Americans must help end the stigma and discrimination that linger
despite the scientific proof that makes them groundless.</p>

<p><font size="3">Discrimination against people with brain
disorders makes no sense. No scientific sense. No economic sense.
No political sense.</font></p>

<p>Stigma is an ancient evil. It still limits all aspects of life
for people with brain disorders: housing, education, insurance,
science, research, services, jobs, religion, and personal
relationships. </p>

<p>Stigma is everywhere, but NAMI--the family organization for
people with brain disorders--intends to end it. With its 140,000
members, NAMI has launched a five-year effort to challenge
negative stereotypes, educate the public, confront discrimination,
and demand fair public policies from informed elected officials and
policy-makers. </p>

<p>NAMI's Campaign to End Discrimination will close the gaps
between science and policy. NAMI will demand equal access and
treatment for a group of people who have been denied their
inalienable rights simply because they have schizophrenia instead
of epilepsy, manic depression instead of Alzheimer's, or major
depression instead of Parkinson's disease.</p>

<p align="left">NAMI was started because families needed to come
together to change the widely held and wrong belief that they
were the cause of their loved one's mental illness. They worked
beside scientists and researchers to enlighten Americans, to
verify that disorders of the brain are biologically based and treatable.
NAMI now must teach Americans that it is no longer acceptable to treat
those with brain disorders any differently than they treat those
with diabetes.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most immediate need of persons with brain
disorders is fair and equal access to appropriate health care.
When illness strikes any other organ of the body, insurance
covers treatment. When illness strikes the brain, full coverage
is very rarely available, and the illness becomes a crushing economic burden.
The prevalence rates of epilepsy and schizophrenia are almost the
same, but health insurers fully cover epilepsy and leave tens of thousands
of people with schizophrenia to rely on public assistance for
access to life-saving treatment. This is unfair discrimination.</p>

<p>Two major health insurance plans in the nation's capital are
typical. One requires members hospitalized with brain disorders
to pay a $150-a-day co-payment but requires no such payment for inpatient
care of other diseases. The other plan, offered by an HMO, caps
lifetime mental health benefits but not benefits for other
medical conditions. Such policies are not justified.</p>

<p>&quot;Persons with poor mental health insurance coverage run
out of insurance; they don't run out of illness,&quot; says NAMI
Executive Director Laurie Flynn. &quot;With proper care, many
could go back to work and become productive taxpayers.&quot;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1 - mental illnesses are far more common than cancer, diabetes, heart disease, or 
arthritis </p>
<p>2 - 1/4 of families in the US will face mental illness in a loved one </p>
<p>3 - more hospital beds are occupied by people with serious mental illnesses than 
with any other disease </p>
<p>4 - mental illnesses are not the same as mental retardation which involves 
deficits in learning ability &amp; intellectual processes </p>
<p>5 - mental illnesses are not the result of weak character or bad parenting </p>
<p>6 - serious mental illnesses are biologically-based, no-fault brain diseases </p>
<p>7 - similarly to physical illness, there are various kinds of mental illness with 
many different causes </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Schizophrenia </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - a brain disease involving more than just genetic susceptibility </p>
<p>2 - most often strikes young people between the ages of 16 &amp; 25 </p>
<p>3 - more than 2 million Americans over 18 will suffer it during adulthood </p>
<p>4 - causes hallucinations &amp; delusions </p>
<p>5 - prevents one from being able to distinguish between what is real &amp; what is 
not </p>
<p>6 - it is not the same as multiple or split personality </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Depressive Illness </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - not just a &quot;case of the blues&quot; </p>
<p>2 - a severe &amp; persistent biological disease </p>
<p>3 - unipolar depression/deep, prolonged depression </p>
<p>4 - bipolar or manic depression/cycles of deep depression &amp; inappropriate highs </p>
<p>5 - nearly 10 million Americans over 18 will suffer major depression </p>
<p>6 - nearly 1.3 million Americans over 18 will suffer manic depression </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Treatment for Mental Illnesses </font></p>
<blockquote>

<p>2 - counseling/therapy </p>
<p>3 - rehabilitation programs in hospitals or communities </p>
<p>4 - allows many to function in everyday society, hold responsible jobs, have 
families, go to school, have hobbies, &amp; enjoy life </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Families of Persons with Mental Illness </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - face many stresses/financial burdens, emotional upheaval, practical everyday 
problems </p>
<p>2 - nearly 40% of persons with schizophrenia live with their families </p>
<p>3 - families are not the cause of serious mental illness </p>
<p>4 - most family members can benefit from the support of other family members 
through self-help groups </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Violence </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - violence among the mentally ill is not common </p>
<p>2 - the mentally ill are more often victims of violence than perpetrators of it </p>
<p>3 - horror movies featuring stereotypical &quot;psychotic killers&quot; are not realistic 
depictions of persons suffering from mental illness </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Stigma </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - stigma literally means &quot;damage to a reputation&quot; </p>
<p>2 - refers to the shame &amp; ridicule society places on mental illness </p>
<p>3 - keeps mental illness &quot;in the closet&quot; </p>
<p>4 - prevents people from seeking treatment </p>
<p>5 - stifles funding for services &amp; research </p>
<p>6 - closes minds &amp; fuels discrimination </p>
<p>7 - the words of ex-patients </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. &quot;Stigma is harder to deal with than the disease itself.&quot; </p>
<p>b. &quot;I have internalized stigma to the point that no one has to tell me I 
am a mental patient. I put myself down faster than anyone else 
would.&quot; </p>
<p>c. &quot;Being a person with schizophrenia means that when you are 
released [from the hospital], you will have to face those you know 
with the shame and stigma of having needed to be institutionalized.&quot; </p>
<p>d. &quot;We will overcome the stigma, prejudice, discrimination, and 
rejection. Although it takes time, we can overcome our illness and 
the myths surrounding it.&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Language that Hurts </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - slang words (i.e. &quot;nuts&quot;, &quot;wacko&quot;, &quot;psycho&quot;, &quot;lunatic&quot;) are dehumanizing 
affronts to people suffering from mental illness </p>
<p>2 - clinical or legal terms (i.e. &quot;schizophrenia&quot;, &quot;manic depression&quot;, 
&quot;psychosis&quot;, &quot;insane&quot;) should be checked carefully for accuracy before using </p>
<p>3 - labels (i.e. &quot;loony bin&quot;, &quot;nuthouse&quot;, &quot;funny farm&quot;) are humiliating to those 
who require medical help from psychiatric hospitals </p>
<p>4 - &quot;psychosis&quot; refers to an inability to distinguish real from unreal experience &amp; 
generally responds to antipsychotic medication </p>
<p>5 - &quot;psychopathy&quot; is an antisocial personality disorder in which there exists a 
pattern of irresponsible &amp; often unlawful behavior &amp; does not generally respond 
to antipsychotic medication </p>
<p>6 - it is offensive to depersonalize people who have a biologically-based 
disorder/say &quot;he has symptoms of schizophrenia&quot; rather than &quot;he's a 
schizophrenic&quot; </p>
<p>7 - when referring to mental illness, use standards of accuracy &amp; good taste that 
apply to any serious illness</p>

</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Causes of depression </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - no single, definitive cause </p>
<p>2 - psychological, biological, environmental, &amp; genetic factors </p>
<p>3 - inherited biological make-up makes one more prone/depression runs in 
families </p>

vulnerable </p>
<p>c. stress often falls more heavily upon them </p>

<p>d. blame themselves for their symptoms &amp; are too ashamed to seek 
help </p>
<p>e. worry that treatment is too costly </p>
<p>f. a side effect of some medications often prescribed to older 
people </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>2 - 80% of depressed individuals can be effectively treated </p>
<p>3 - medications/antidepressants </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. tricyclics </p>
<p>b. monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) </p>
<p>c. selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) </p>
<p>d. norepinephrine &amp; serotonin reuptake inhibitors (NSRIs) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>4 - psychotherapy </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. used with patients who have significant life crises, lack social 
support, or lack coping skills to deal with life situations </p>
<p>b. especially useful with the elderly because they often live alone, 
have inadequate support systems, or have no contact with a primary 
care physician </p>
</blockquote>
<p>5 - electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. important because 70% of elderly patients fail to take 25 to 50% 
of their medication </p>
<p>b. commonly given to patients over 61 years old </p>
<p>c. generally underused, unavailable, or burdened with myth &amp;

<p>1 - facts &amp; legal procedures are as 
important to a case as the law 
itself </p>
<p>2 - individuals are most affected 
by procedural steps </p>
<p>3 - it is essential to have a good 
criminal lawyer </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Misdemeanors v. Felonies </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - there is no universal rule 
differentiating between them </p>
<p>2 - misdemeanors are crimes 
punishable by incarceration of one 
year or less </p>
<p>3 - felonies are crimes punishable 
by incarceration of more than one 
year </p>
<p>4 - they have different 
relationships to criminal 
procedures &amp; constitutional rights </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Arrest </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - when the police take one into 
custody in order to charge one 
with a crime </p>
<p>2 - only lawful when an officer 
believes a crime was actually 
committed &amp; was committed by 
the person under arrest </p>
<p>3 - the mentally ill are often picked 
up or taken into custody by the 
police without actually being 
arrested </p>
<p>4 - essential that an officer know 
when he/she has a mentally ill 
person in custody </p>
<p>5 - be aware that informing an 
officer that the person in custody is 
mentally ill may cause the officer 
to view the situation more 
seriously/discuss disclosure with 
an attorney before disclosing one's 
mentally ill status </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Booking </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - the process of fingerprinting &amp; 
photographing a person who has 
been arrested </p>

officer that the person in custody is 
mentally ill may cause the officer 
to view the situation more 
seriously/discuss disclosure with 
an attorney before disclosing one's 
mentally ill status </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Interrogation </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - attempt to prevent police from 
questioning a mentally ill family 
member without a lawyer present </p>
<p>2 - Miranda Rights must be read to 
any individual not free to end 
questioning or to leave the 
premises where he/she is being

questioning anyone who asks for a 
lawyer </p>

<p>1 - no person can be tried or 
sentenced for a crime if he/she 
cannot understand the nature of the 
proceedings against him/her or 
assist a lawyer in preparing a 
defense </p>
<p>2 - a criminal defendant found 
incompetent to stand trial is 
usually subject to civil 
commitment for an indefinite 
period </p>
<p>3 - a criminal defendant found 
competent to stand trial can invoke 
an insanity defense </p>
</blockquote>
</td><td valign=top width=50%><font color="#FF0000">Legal Help </font><blockquote>
<p>1 - competent criminal lawyers are 
almost always available </p>
<p>2 - a limited budget should not 
prevent one from receiving 
competent legal help </p>
<p>3 - if you can't afford a private 
lawyer, use public defender 
services, court- appointed 
attorneys, local criminal defense 
lawyers' associations, or local bar 
associations </p>
<p>4 - as the United States 
Constitution guarantees legal 
representation to every defendant 
in a felony criminal case, the state 
must provide a lawyer to anyone 
charged with a felony who cannot 
afford a lawyer </p>

<p>b. a warrant is usually 
required to conduct 
searches &amp; seizures </p>
<p>c. the Exclusionary 
Rule prevents the 
prosecution from 
placing into evidence 
anything obtained 
unreasonably </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 - the 5th Amendment guarantees 
the right against

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080">Insurance Parity for Mental Illnesses May Become a Reality</font></h4>
<hr>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What do we mean when we talk about achieving insurance parity?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Parity means that under health care reform, mental illnesses would be given the same coverage and benefits as 
physical illnesses. So, if there is a $1 million lifetime coverage limit for treating cancer or diabetes, there would 
be $1 million dollars available over a lifetime to treat schizophrenia, or manic depression, along with other 
serious mental illness. According to the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, until that happens, people with 
severe mental illnesses are facing discrimination.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How can I make a difference?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Senators Pete Domenici and Paul Wellstone want to make a difference, so they have introduced an amendment to 
the Health Care Reform Bill which would make sure mental illnesses were treated the same as other physical 
ones. The U.S. Senate voted an overwhelming 68 to 30 to pass the Domenici-Wellstone amendment on April 18. 
You can make a difference by calling your representative in Congress and letting that person know your opinion 
about parity for mental health under the Domenici-Wellstone amendment! To find out the number for your 
congressperson, call Capitol Hill at (202) 224-3121 or 1-800-972-3524</p>

<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Jim's Story/A Case History </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - 27-year-old Jim left his job as a publications manager due to illness </p>
<p>2 - diagnosed with congenital heart disease </p>
<p>3 - needed temporary hospitalization &amp; medication to stabilize his condition </p>
<p>4 - told that if he was faithful to his medication, his symptoms were controllable </p>
<p>5 - Jim was relieved to know what his condition was &amp; how to control it </p>
<p>6 - Jim wanted his old job back but was rudely told his job had been eliminated </p>
<p>7 - Jim tried to talk to a friend about his experience, but his friend was cold &amp; 
uncomfortable speaking with him </p>
<p>8 - Jim thought the experiences with his former employer &amp; friend were merely 
flukes until he started to experience the same sort of treatment everywhere he 
turned </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. his landlord opted not to offer him a lease renewal </p>
<p>b. all his friends seemed distant &amp; uncomfortable with him </p>
<p>c. job opportunities vanished whenever he mentioned his illness </p>
</blockquote>
<p>9 - Jim felt worthless, hopeless, &amp; confused </p>
<p>10 - this scenario happens to thousands of mentally ill Americans </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Discrimination - An Ugly Side Effect </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - happens when people do not know the truth about mental illness </p>
<p>2 - most think discrimination against the physically ill is wrong while many 
think discrimination against the mentally ill is OK </p>
<p>3 - a 1996 survey shows that 41% of the population feel it is OK for a landlord 
to discriminate based on mental illness </p>
<p>4 - discrimination is a side effect of the stigma &amp; myths surrounding mental 
illness </p>
<p>5 - separating fact from myth is difficult in face of images presented in the 
media </p>
<p>6 - robs people with mental illnesses of the emotional support, housing, &amp; job 
opportunities they need to restore their lives </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Myths </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - mental illnesses are not like physical illnesses &amp; are all &quot;in the head' of the 
sick </p>
<p>2 - the mentally ill are bound to make second rate employees and shouldn't hold 
high level or important jobs </p>
<p>3 - the mentally ill can never really be normal </p>
<p>4 - everyone faces trouble in their lives so the mentally ill must be weaker in 
character than the rest of us </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Facts </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - mental illnesses are brain disorders that alter how people feel, behave, &amp; 
perceive the world, but, like physical illnesses, they are biologically-based </p>
<p>2 - people who suffer from a mental illness can be just as effective as those with 
any other illness (ie. Abraham Lincoln suffered from severe depression) </p>
<p>3 - a surprising number of high level jobs are filled by people who have 
experienced mental illness </p>
<p>4 - many of our great works of art, music, &amp; literature were produced by 
persons with mental illness </p>
<p>5 - while only 40-50% of people with heart disease will recover, 80% will 
recover from depression &amp; 60% will recover from schizophrenia </p>
<p>6 - a person's character has nothing to do with whether they develop a mental 
illness </p>
<p>7 - mental illnesses strike those with all kinds of temperaments, beliefs, morals, 
&amp; backgrounds </p>
<p>8 - the primary factor determining whether a person will develop a mental 
illness is their bio-chemical makeup </p>
<p>9 - a mentally ill person is just as frightened, upset, &amp; physically ill as someone

<h4 align=center>Helpline Fact Sheet </h4>
<p align=center><font color="#000080"><b>PLAN (Planned Lifetime Assistance Network)</b></font></p>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is PLAN? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - a NAMI network funded by a grant from the Center for Mental Health 
Services Community Support Program/U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human 
Services </p>
<p>2 - a network of organizations which function in lieu of families in the long-term 
care of mentally ill persons </p>
<p>3 - a network of organizations which assist families in planning their estates to 
ensure that their child or relative will always live in a comfortable environment, 
have adequate funds, maintain a good quality of life, &amp; have competent, caring 
people to look after him/her </p>
<p>4 - not in lieu of case management, housing, residential, or entitlement services </p>
<p>5 - an organization which advocates for the mentally ill and which monitors the 
services they receive from elsewhere in the mental health system </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How PLAN operates </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - creates a written plan for the future which sets out those activities &amp; services 
which a family wants to guarantee for their loved one </p>
<p>2 - creates a financial mechanism (ie.Special Needs Trust) to pay for activities 
&amp; services the family wants guaranteed after it is no longer able to provide </p>
<p>3 - identifies a service provider &amp;/or trustee to see to it that planned activities &amp; 
services are implemented </p>
<p>4 - ensures that the best possible care from the mental health system &amp; from 
government entitlement benefits is provided to the mentally ill family member, 
either in the community or in a hospital </p>
<p>5 - acts as an advisor to trustees chosen by parents prior to death </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Benefits of using PLAN </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - helps clients be more compliant with their medication regimens </p>
<p>2 - ensures that clients are tapping the mental health system for all it has to offer </p>
<p>3 - helps to ease parental concerns about the future well-being of disabled 
children </p>
<p>4 - helps parents to understand what good planning for future care involves </p>
<p>5 - assumes some responsibility for disabled adult children, thus allowing 
parents to improve the quality of their own personal, family, &amp; social lives </p>
<p>6 - PLAN may take a more objective approach to the child's problems &amp; thus 
provide more consistent responses to them </p>
<p>7 - PLAN assumes responsibility for overseeing tension-producing activities 
like the monitoring of financial resources </p>
<p>8 - provides assurance that siblings will not be unduly burdened in the future </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Special Needs Trusts </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - a means of providing funds to pay out-of-pocket expenses or to hire a social 
worker who will fulfill some of the parental advocacy roles </p>
<p>2 - third-party arrangements </p>
<p>3 - allow parents to channel money for specific uses that do not conflict with 
government entitlement programs </p>
<p>4 - must be drafted by an estate lawyer </p>
<p>5 - ensures money is not directly available to the disabled adult, but is 
administered through a trustee &amp; restricted to uses that supplement government 
services </p>
<p>6 - analyze the child's needs before determining how much to fund the trust </p>
<p>7 - inter vivos trusts </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. established while parents are still alive </p>
<p>b. costs between $1000 &amp; $2000 to set up </p>
<p>c. funds are available immediately after parents die </p>
</blockquote>
<p>8 - testamentary trusts </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. created in a will </p>
<p>b. $500 to set up </p>
<p>c. funds are available only after parents' estate has gone through 
probate </p>
</blockquote>
<p>9 - possible trustees </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. relatives </p>
<p>b. banks </p>
<p>c. charitable organizations </p>
<p>d. parents' groups </p>
</blockquote>
<p>10 - pooled trusts </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. involve contributions from many sources </p>
<p>b. some programs oversee the financial side of the trust while others 
use income from the trust to employ a social worker to monitor care 
services </p>
<p>c. usually operate on a local level </p>
<p>d. contact local disability organizations for information about them </p>
<p>e. require an enrollment fee, yearly expense charges, &amp; a minimum 
contribution (approximately $30,000) upon the parents' death </p>
<p>f. accessible to low-income families because they can be funded 
with proceeds from life insurance policies &amp; pension plans </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How to start a PLAN </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - there is no one right way to start a PLAN </p>
<p>2 - tailor decisions to the needs of the families your PLAN will serve </p>
<p>3 - recruit a board of 6 to 12 persons with a broad range of skills &amp; experiences 
(ie. families, consumers, experts in law, experts in finance, business, marketing) </p>
<p>4 - conduct a survey of local family advocacy groups to determine if they are 
willing to support a PLAN </p>
<p>5 - get support from statewide family advocacy groups </p>
<p>6 - decide whether to establish a new, separate organization or to join one </p>
<p>7 - incorporate your PLAN as a private non-profit organization </p>
<p>8 - look to existing PLANs for models &amp; establish by-laws </p>
<p>9 - determine the geographic area your PLAN will serve &amp; file a 501(c)(3) 
application with the Internal Revenue Service </p>
<p>10 - develop a business plan to include budget, funding sources, &amp; revenue goals </p>
<p>11 - explore &amp; determine sources of revenue to solicit (ie. government contracts, 
client fees, grants, corporate giving programs) </p>
<p>12 - determine the type of services you will provide based on survey information </p>
<p>13 - recruit professional (not volunteer) staff to manage the program 
development </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">General Guidelines </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - stop using medication before trying to conceive </p>
<p>2 - allow for a &quot;safety zone&quot; of at least one month between your last pill &amp; the 
time you try to conceive (most illnesses won't return immediately upon 
discontinuation of medication) </p>
<p>3 - if your physician approves, try to avoid medication during the first trimester 
of pregnancy because it is the most critical time for fetal organ development </p>
<p>4 - use only those medications that have been on the market for at least 20 years </p>
<p>5 - resume medication as soon after delivery as possible</p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Medication Risks </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - any kind of medication exposes a developing fetus to possible risks </p>
<p>2 - sedatives (ie. Valium, Klonopin) should be avoided </p>
<p>3 - anticonvulsants (ie. Tegratoland Depakene) cause neural tube defects like 
spina bifda &amp; anencephaly </p>
<p>4 - strong antipsychotics (ie. Haldol, Prolixin) should be taken only in small 
doses </p>
<p>5 - antidepressants may cause rare cases of infant distress such as muscle 
spasms, fast heart rate, congestive heart failure, &amp; respiratory disease </p>
<p>6 - Lithium </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. carries a particularly high risk of heart malformation, especially 
during the first 3 months of pregnancy </p>
<p>b. may cause lethargic &amp; listless babies with irregular suck &amp; startle 
responses when used near the end of pregnancy </p>
<p>c. may cause newborns to appear bluish due to problems with 
oxygen absorption in the blood </p>
<p>d. associated with congenital hypothyroidism when taken during the 
third trimester </p>
<p>e. safe when used during the second trimester </p>
<p>f. should still be prescribed for severe manic depression because an 
untreated episode may be riskier than the side effects of lithium </p>
</blockquote>
<p>7 - Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. the safest way to treat severe depression in pregnant women </p>
<p>b. can be used during any state of pregnancy, but is the least risky 
after the first trimester </p>
<p>c. may cause short term memory loss </p>
<p>d. may cause some symptoms that are very easy to treat </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>1. headaches </p>
<p>2. muscle soreness </p>
<p>3. nausea </p>
<p>4. adverse reactions to anesthetic or muscle relaxant </p>
<p>5. heartbeat irregularities </p>
<p>6. heart attacks (very rare)</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Breastfeeding </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - women with mental illness have a greater risk of postpartum difficulty </p>
<p>2 - medications can be excreted in breast milk &amp; so pose some risk for nursing 
infants </p>
<p>3 - discuss whether nursing is a viable option with a physician </p>
<p>4 - bottle feeding might be the most appropriate method of nourishment </p>

<p>8 - it is hard for all family members to accept the disorder </p>
<p>9 - acceptance of the disorder is helpful, but it is not necessary </p>

<p>2 - more than 4.2 Americans receive disability benefits </p>

<p>1 - in terms of ability to work </p>
<p>2 - those who are unable to work for a year or more </p>
<p>3 - those whose condition is likely to result in death </p>
<p>4 - disability is determined by doctors &amp; disability examiners at state agencies 
based on clinical evidence &amp; examinations </p>
<p>5 - Earnings/you must make under $500 per month </p>
<p>6 - Severity/your condition must interfere with basic work-related activities </p>

the list in terms of work ability </p>
<p>8 - Type of Work/if you cannot do any type of work that will enable you to earn 
$500 per month </p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How to apply for benefits </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - apply in person at your local Social Security Administration (SSA) field 
office </p>
<p>2 - family members/guardians may apply when one's disability prevents one 
from doing so oneself </p>
<p>3 - you will be given an in-depth interview/this can be difficult for ill applicants, 
thus bringing a family member or friend for moral support is helpful </p>
<p>4 - you will complete a variety of application forms </p>
<p>5 - call SSA to find out what procedure to follow </p>
<p>6 - eligibility is determined jointly by a caseworker from SSA who focuses on 
financial considerations &amp; a caseworker from the state Disability Determination 
Service (DDS) who focuses on medical &amp; functional information </p>
<p>7 - eligibility is determined between 3 &amp; 6 months after application </p>
<p>8 - remember to call periodically to check on the status of your application </p>
<p>9 - be persistent even if rejected after application/2 out of 3 persons receiving 
benefits were initially rejected </p>
<p>10 - appeals process </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. ask for reconsideration by another DDS caseworker </p>
<p>b. if (a) is not decided in your favor, ask for an administrative 
hearing (a formal hearing before an administrative law judge) to 
review the caseworker's decision </p>
<p>c. if (b) is not decided in your favor, ask for a review by the SSA 
Appeals Council of the law judge's decision </p>
<p>d. if (c) is not decided in your favor, appeal a denial of disability 
benefits to U.S. Federal District Court (class action suits are usually 
most successful) </p>

receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) which provides up to $407 per 
month </p>

<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)?</font></p>
<ul>
<li>the most commonly diagnosed behavior disorder in children.</li>
<li>characterized by inattention, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity.</li>
<li>can persist into adolescence and adulthood and these individuals may be vulnerable to antisocial behavior, 
impulsiveness, and educational failure.</li>
</ul>
<p><font color="#FF0000">Symptoms in an ADHD Child</font> </p>
<ul>
<li>is restless and fidgety.</li>
<li>interrupts conversations.</li>
<li>has difficulty completing school assignments, organizing work, and gives the impression he or she has not 
heard instructions.</li>
<li>is easily distracted.</li>
<li>makes careless, impulsive errors.</li>
<li>frequently calls out in class.</li>
<li>has difficulty awaiting his/her turn in groups.</li>
<li>fails to follow through on parents&#146; requests.</li>
<li>is unable to play games for the same amount of time as other children of the same age.</li>
<li>feels socially isolated from peers.</li>
</ul>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">Causes</font></h4>
<ul>
<li>no definitely known cause yet - strong scientific evidence supports the conclusion that ADHD is a 
brain-based biological disorder.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. children with ADHD were found to have lower levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine in 
biochemical studies.</p>
<p>2. deficiencies in a number of neurotransmitters, including dopamine, were found in laboratory 
animal models.</p>
<p>3. successful medications for ADHD affect the levels of several neurotransmitters in the brain. </p>
<p>4. brain imaging studies using PET scanners have shown significantly lower metabolic activity in 
regions of the brain that control attention, social judgment, and movement. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>environmental factors associated with ADHD include low birth weight, hypozia (too little oxygen) at birth, 
and exposure in utero to a number of toxins including alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine. </li>
</ul>
<h4><font color="#FF0000">Treatment </font></h4>
<ul>
<li>comprehensive approach is the most successful. </li>
<li>vast majority of patients benefit from treatment. </li>
<li>medication </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. successful in 67% of ADHD individuals and is best provided by a child psychiatrist.</p>
<p>2. medications include stimulants such as methylphenidate (Ritalin), dextroamphetamine 
(Dexedrine), and pemoline (Cylert), plus antidepressants such as imipramine. </p>
<p>3. medication therapy improves attention span, controls impulses, dampens restlessness, improves 
school performance, decreases aggression, and enhances the quality of family life. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>cognitive/behavioral therapy </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>behavioral modification strategies (the child is offered incentives and rewards for changing 
behavior) and special programs addressing cognitive deficits (plays games and exercises to address 
cognitive deficits) might be useful. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>School-Related </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>1. if possible, parents should work with the school district to plan an individualized education 
program (IEP). </p>
<p>2. formal education testing and an evaluation for speech and language disorders should be 
performed. </p>
<p>3. support and encouragement of avenues to build self-esteem such as sports, art, music, or other 
special interests since academics are frequently difficult for them. Associated Disorders </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>at least 25% of ADHD children suffer from some type of communication/learning disability. </li>
<li>about 40% exhibit signs of conduct disorder (starting fights, lying, stealing) or oppositional defiant disorder 
(disobedience, defiance, and rule breaking). </li>
<li>a strong correlation exists with the neurobiological disorder called Tourette&#146;s syndrome - at least half of 
Tourette&#146;s patients have ADHD. </li>

<p align=center><font color="#FF0000">MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Manic-depressive illness, also known as bipolar disorder, is a brain disorder involving 
episodes of serious mania and depression. The person&#146;s mood usually swings from overly 
&quot;high&quot; and irritable to sad and hopeless, and then back again, with periods of normal mood 
in-between.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Manic-depressive illness usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues 
throughout life. It is often not recognized as an mental illness, and people who have it may 
suffer needlessly for years or even decades.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">At least 2 million Americans suffer from manic-depressive illness. For those afflicted with 
the illness, it is extremely distressing and disruptive.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Signs and symptoms of mania:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Extreme irritability and distractibility</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Excessive &quot;high&quot; or euphoric feelings</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">A sustained period of behavior that is different from usual</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Increased energy, activity, restlessness, racing thoughts and rapid talking</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Decreased need for sleep</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Unrealistic beliefs in one&#146;s abilities and powers</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Uncharacteristically poor judgment</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Increased sexual drive</font></p>

<h4 align=center>Helpline Fact Sheet </h4>
<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Dissociative Disorders: What Are They?</b></font></h4>
<p>Dissociative Disorders are so-called because they are marked by a dissociation from or 
interruption of a person's fundamental aspects of waking consciousness (such as who he is, 
what his personal history is, etc.) Dissociative Disorders come in many forms, the most 
famous of which is dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as multiple personality 
disorder.) All of the dissociative disorders are thought to stem from trauma experienced by 
the individual with this disorder. The dissociative aspect is thought to be a coping 
mechanism--the person literally dissociates himself from a situation or experience too 
traumatic to integrate with his conscious self. Symptoms of disorders, if not one or more of 
the disorders themselves, are seen in a number of other mental illnesses, including 
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. </p>
<p><b><i>Dissociative amnesia</i></b>: This disorder is characterized by a blocking out of critical personal 
information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature. Dissociative amnesia, unlike other 
types of amnesia, does not result from other medical trauma (like a blow to the head). 
Dissociative amnesia has several subtypes: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Localized amnesia</i> is present in a individual who has no memory of specific 
events that took place, usually traumatic. The loss of memory is localized within 
a specific window of time. For example, a survivor of a car wreck who has no 
memory of the experience until two days later is experiencing localized 
amnesia. </p>
<p><i>Selective amnesia</i> happens when a person can recall only small parts of events 
that took place in a defined period of time. For example, and abuse victim may 
recall only some parts of the series of events around his or her abuse. </p>
<p><i>Generalized</i> amnesia is diagnosed when a person's amnesia encompasses this 
entire life. </p>
<p><i>Continuous amnesia</i> occurs when the individual has no memory for events 
beginning from a certain point in the past continuing up to the present. </p>
<p><i>Systematized amnesia</i> is characterized by a loss of memory for a specific 
category of information. A person with this disorder might, for example, be 
missing all memories about one specific family member. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b><i>Dissociative fugue</i></b> is a rare disorder. An individual with dissociative fugue suddenly and 
unexpectedly takes physical leave of his surroundings and sets off on a journey of some 
kind. These journeys can last hours, or even several days or months. Individuals 
experiencing a dissociative fugue have traveled over thousands of miles. An individual in a 
fugue state is unaware of or confused about his identity, and in some cases will assume a 
new identity (although this is the exception). </p>
<p><b><i>Dissociative identity disorder</i></b>, which has been known as multiple personality disorder, is 
the most famous of the dissociative disorders. An individual suffering from DID has more 
than one distinct identity or personality state &quot;surfaces in the individual on a recurring basis. 
This disorder is also marked by memory gaps that vary with the individual's &quot;alters&quot; or 
other personalities. For more complete information on this disorder, write or call NAMI for 
the factsheet on multiple personality disorder. </p>
<p><b><i>Depersonalization disorder</i></b> is marked by a feeling of detachment or distance from one's 
own experience, body, or self. These feelings of depersonalization are recurrent. Of the 
dissociative disorders, depersonalization is one most easily identified with by the general 
public; one can easily relate to feeling as though they are in a dream, or being &quot;spaced out.&quot; 
Feeling out of control of one's actions and movements is something that people describe 
when intoxicated. An individual with depersonalization disorder has this experience so 
frequently and so severely that it interrupts his or her functioning and experience. A person's 
experience with depersonalization can be so severe that h or she believes the external world 
is unreal or distorted. </p>
<p><b>Treatment:</b> </p>
<p>Since dissociative disorders seem to be triggered as a response to trauma or abuse, 
treatment for individuals with such a disorder may stress psychotherapy, although a 
combination of psychopharmacological and psychosocial treatments are often used. Many of 
the symptoms of dissociative disorders occur with other disorders, such as anxiety and 
depression, and can be controlled by the same drugs used to treat those disorders. A person 
in treatment for a dissociative disorder might benefit from antidepressants or antianxiety 
medication. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Treatment </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - behavior therapy</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. not traditional psychotherapy</p>
        <p>b. exposure &amp; response prevention</p>
        <p>c. deliberately expose the OCD patient to a feared
        object or idea, either directly or by imagination, &amp;
        then discourage or prevent the person from carrying out
        the usual compulsive response</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2 - medication can regulate serotonin to reduce obsessive
    thoughts &amp; compulsive behavior &amp; should be used for
    10 to 12 weeks before judging its effectiveness</p>
    <p>3 - clomipramine (anafranil)</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. tricyclic antidepressant</p>
        <p>b. used in Europe for more than 20 years</p>
        <p>c. little evidence of it having long-term negative
        effects</p>
        <p>d. no increased rate of birth defects</p>
        <p>e. may produce side effects (dry mouth, constipation,
        tiredness, fatigue, slight hand trembling, sexual
        dysfunction, severe weight gain, seizures with high dosages)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>4 - fluoxetine (prozac) &amp; sertraline (zoloft)</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. occasional side effects (nausea, weight loss,
        insomnia)</p>
        <p>b. safe &amp; effective</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>5 - fluvoxamine maleate (luvox)</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)</p>
        <p>b. the newest approved treatment for OCD</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p>6 - not psychoanalysis or other forms of &quot;talk
    therapy&quot;</p>
    <p>7 - due to sufferers&#146; remarkable ability to conceal
    symptoms, treatment is often not received until years after
    the onset of the disease, thus making it harder to treat</p>
    <p>8 - essential to seek treatment/OCD will not go away by
    itself</p>
    <p>9 - response to treatment varies from person to person</p>
    <p>10 - treatment usually reduces symptoms by 40 to 50% which
    is often enough to change people&#146;s lives &amp; to
    transform them into functioning individuals</p>
    <p>11 - some people go into total remission</p>
    <p>12 - few find treatment to be a waste of time</p>

    <p>fear of its contamination</p>
    <p>3 - continuous hoarding of junk mail, old newspapers,
    empty milk cartons, etc... </p>

<p align=center><font color="#FF0000">SCHIZOPHRENIA</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that is complex, puzzling, chronic and disabling.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The most striking symptoms of schizophrenia are referred to as &quot;psychotic,&quot; meaning out of 
touch with reality, or inability to separate real from unreal experiences.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Some people have only one psychotic episode; others have many episodes during a lifetime 
and lead relatively normal lives during the interim periods.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">An individual with chronic schizophrenia often doesn&#146;t fully recover normal functioning and 
typically requires long-term treatment, generally including medication to control the 
symptoms. Some people may never be able to function without assistance.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Approximately 2 million Americans develop schizophrenia during any given year. Men and 
women are affected with equal frequency.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The first episodes are often seen in the teens or twenties in men and in the twenties or early 
thirties in women. </font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Schizophrenia is believed to have a genetic basis. The children of a person with 
schizophrenia have about a 10 percent chance of developing schizophrenia. By comparison, 
the risk of schizophrenia in the general population is about 1 percent.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT &quot;SPLIT-PERSONALITY.&quot; There is a common misconception 
that schizophrenia is multiple personalities or a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde syndrome. This is NOT 
accurate. In fact, multiple personality disorder is an entirely different disorder.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">People with schizophrenia may experience:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">&#183; unusual realities</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">&#183; hallucinations</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">&#183; delusions</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">&#183; disordered thinking</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - can be caused by stress, jet lag, or physical
    environment</p>
    <p>2 - may last several days</p>
    <p>3 - can generally be relieved by exercise, a hot bath,
    warm milk, daytime napping, changing bedroom environment</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Short-Term Insomnia </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - result of stress, illness, or bereavement </p>
    <p>2 - may linger for up to three weeks</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Long-Term Insomnia </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - lasts for more than three weeks </p>
    <p>2 - calls for an extensive diagnostic examination by a
    sleep disorder specialist</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Insomnia Related to Another Mental
Disorder </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - more than 1/2 of insomnia cases are related to
    depression, anxiety, or psychological stress</p>
    <p>2 - early morning wakefulness can be a sign of depression</p>
    <p>3 - sudden, dramatic decrease in sleep may be a sign of
    mania or schizophrenia</p>
    <p>4 - poor sleep may suggest obsessive-compulsive disorder</p>
    <p>5 - panic episodes during sleep suggest panic disorder</p>
    <p>6 - alcohol causes numerous awakenings during the night
    for long periods of time</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Insomnia in Children </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - usually from stress</p>
    <p>2 - problem resides within the sleep-wake circuits of the
    brain stem or within neurochemical balances impinging on
    these circuits</p>
    <p>3 - children with insomnia have often been poor sleepers
    since birth</p>
    <p>4 - medication is not recommended for most children</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Insomnia in the Elderly </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - often the result of changes in the body&#146;s
    &quot;internal clock&quot;</p>
    <p>2 - the elderly often experience depression or anxiety
    disorders which can disturb sleeping patterns</p>
    <p>3 - the elderly often suffer from Alzheimer&#146;s disease
    which can affect sleeping</p>
    <p>4 - the elderly are prone to become confused &amp;
    restless at night in the dark</p>
    <p>5 - the elderly are often more sensitive than others to
    medication due to a less functioning liver &amp; a more
    sensitive nervous system</p>
    <p>6 - medication tends to linger for a long time in the
    bodies of elderly patients</p>
    <p>7 - careful assessment is necessary when prescribing
    sleeping pills for the elderly</p>
</blockquote>

<p><font color="#FF0000">Treatments </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>1 - Benzodiazepines</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>a. flurazepam (Dalmane)/long-lasting &amp; may cause
        drowsiness</p>
        <p>b. temazepam (Restoril)/intermediate acting agent</p>
        <p>c. triazolam (Halcion)/short-acting with no sedation</p>
        <p>d. affect memory (learning new information) when taken
        in large doses</p>
        <p>e. should not be used on a long-term basis/decrease in
        efficacy over time</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>2 - tricyclic antidepressants</p>
    <p>3 - talk therapy</p>

<h4 align=center><font color="#0000FF">Effexor</font></h4>
<hr>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What is Effexor?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor (generic: venlafaxine) is one of the newer medications available to treat depression. Structurally 
different from other antidepressants, it affects two neurotransmitters (chemical messengers to the brain) involved 
in depression: serotonin and norepinephrine. Approved for use in the United States at the end of 1993, its novel 
chemical action and low incidence of side effects make it a significant addition to the range of medications used 
to treat depression. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How is Effexor different from other antidepressants?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor is a chemically unique antidepressant medication. Like the newer class of antidepressants known as 
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and setraline (Zoloft), it affects the 
absorption of serotonin. In addition, Effexor acts on the norepinephrine system. No other available medication 
affects both neurotransmitters without causing the side effects of the older tricyclic antidepressants. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Are there other advantages of Effexor?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor is less likely to induce seizures, to have toxic effects on the heart, and to cause lethal reactions. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">For what kind of patient would Effexor be appropriate?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor is recognized as a front line option (that is, first time medication for patients who have recently become 
ill with depression, whether they are hospitalized or treated on an outpatient basis. It can also be useful for 
patients who have had long-standing depressive illness and have not responded adequately to previous 
treatments. Almost 40 percent of so-called refractory patients (those who have not had positive results from past 
treatment) have had success with Effexor. Patients who have benefited from other antidepressants but have had 
less than complete success may want to discuss switching to Effexor with their doctors. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What about side effects? </font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Relatively few side effects have been reported with Effexor. Those that have been noted are dose-related; that is, 
side effects increase as the dose increases. Very few patients have had to discontinue the medication because of 
side effects.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The most common minor side effects during clinical trials include short-term nausea (which can be reduced by 
taking the medication with food), sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, nervousness, sweating, 
weakness, ejaculation/orgasm problems, and loss of appetite.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">A small percentage (about five percent) of patients, usually those taking higher doses, will develop elevated 
blood pressure. Therefore, patients taking Effexor should have their blood pressure checked regularly. Some 
agitation has been noticed at higher dosages. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How long does it take to work?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Like most other medications used for depression, Effexor may take several weeks before it is fully effective. It is 
important to five the medication sufficient time before judging whether it will work for a given person. There is 
evidence, however, that Effexor may take effect more quickly than other antidepressants. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Can Effexor be taken with other medications?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor does not interact significantly with many other medications, including lithium, diazepam (Valium), and 
cimetidine (Tagamet, an anti-ulcer medication). However, patients taking cimetidine who have high blood 
pressure or liver disease or are elderly should use caution in taking Effexor because the interaction can be more 
pronounced when these disorders are present.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Effexor definitely should not be taken at the same time as the MAOIs (such as Parnate or Nardil). Interactions 
with these compounds could be lethal. Patients who have been taking an MAOI and are switching to Effexor must 
allow sufficient time (usually 14 days) for the MAOI to clear out of the body. The same time should be allowed 
if changing from Effexor to an MAOI. However, switching from Effexor to other medications is easy because 
Effexor is quickly removed from the body. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What is the standard dose?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The dose range is generally between 75 and 375 mg per day. The average effective dose is about 125 to 150 mg 
per day. Higher doses are necessary for sicker patients. It is recommended that the total dose be divided into two 
or three doses per day and taken with food. Dosage adjustments for elderly people are not usually necessary. </font></p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Will Effexor work for everyone?</font></h4>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">No. Everyone responds to medications differently. Effexor will work well for some people, and not so well for 
others. It is important to give the medication a trial of several weeks and to be in close communication with your 
doctor about signs of effectiveness, side effects, and personal factors affecting one's response to the medication. </font></p>

<p>1 - is it being used when alternative treatment is possible? </p>
<p>2 - is it truly effective over time? </p>
<p>3 - isn't there potential for misuse &amp; abuse? </p>
<p>4 - is its use a violation of patients' rights? </p>
<p>5 - would curtailing use deprive certain patients of potentially effective treatment? </p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>5 - ECT as treatment for acute manic episode </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. equally effective as lithium </p>
<p>b. superior to hospitalization without somatic therapy </p>
<p>c. when followed by lithium maintenance, no increased risk of relapse </p>
</blockquote>
<p>6 - ECT as treatment for schizophrenia </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. neuroleptics are the first treatment that should be tried </p>
<p>b. effective for those with a short duration of illness, a more acute onset, &amp; more 
intense affective symptoms </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#FF0000">How to maximize the benefits of ECT? </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 - perform a pretreatment medical examination </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. history </p>
<p>b. physical </p>
<p>c. neurologic examination </p>
<p>d. EKG </p>
<p>e. laboratory tests </p>
</blockquote>
<p>2 - when clinically feasible, decrease or discontinue medications that affect the seizure threshold 
before beginning ECT treatment </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. discontinue MAOI 2 weeks before treatment </p>
<p>b. be lithium-free </p>
</blockquote>
<p>3 - get severe hypertension under control before treatment </p>
<p>4 - evaluate &amp; monitor cardiac conditions </p>

<p>7 - use a professional specifically trained &amp; certified in the use of brief anesthetic procedures </p>
<p>8 - include trained nursing personnel on the treatment team </p>
<p>9 - use the lowest amount of electrical energy to induce an adequate seizure </p>
<p>10 - remember that bilateral ECT is often more effective </p>
<p>11 - remember that nondominant unilateral ECT results in shorter confusional periods &amp; fewer 
memory deficits </p>
<p>12 - remember that a brief pulse stimulus results in fewer cognitive deficits than the sine wave 
stimulus </p>
<p>13 - monitor seizures with an EEG or by placing a blood pressure cuff on an arm or leg &amp; inflating 
it above systolic pressure prior to the injection of a muscle relaxer </p>
<p>14 - after treatment, continue patients on antidepressant medication or lithium </p>
<p>15 - include ECT education in medical school curricula </p>
<p>16 - include ECT training in psychiatric residency programs </p>
<p>17 - include questions about ECT in oral &amp; written medical examinations </p>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Lithium--Detailed Narrative</b></font></h4>
<hr>
<p><font color="#FF0000">What is Lithium?</font></p>
<p>Lithium carbonate - a salt - came to be regularly used to control manic depressive illness in 
this country in the 1960's. Today it is the most commonly used medication to treat bipolar 
(manic-depressive) illness. There are a variety of different brands of lithium dispensed in 
tablets, capsule, and liquid form: Lithotabs, Lithane, Lithonate, Eskatlith, Cibalith, and 
Lithobid. Lithium is helpful in 70 percent to 80 percent of bipolar patients, making it one of 
the most effective psychiatric medications available.</p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><b>What it treats: </b></font></p>
<p>Lithium has been most frequently and effectively used to control and prevent manic episodes 
in persons with bipolar disorder. Lithium has been successful in treating depression as well. 
In fact the occurrence of depression in a patient who has been taking lithium is often an 
indication that a higher dose is needed. In some cases, lithium is even a successful treatment 
for patients with unipolar depression, or those who have never had a manic episode. 
Patients who respond to lithium for depression are often people who have not responded to 
tricyclic antidepressants after several weeks of treatment. When given lithium in addition to 
their antidepressants, some of these patients have shown significant improvement. </p>
<p>Lithium has also successfully treated schizophrenia in cases where there is a schizophrenic 
thought disorder accompanied by a change in mood that mimics either mania or depression. 
The similarity between these patients with schizophrenia and those diagnosed with manic 
depression is their affective disorder -- that is the experience of strong emotions not related 
to what is happening in the environment. Patients with schizophrenia not experiencing an 
affective disorder will be unlikely to respond to the combination of lithium and 
antipsychotic medication. </p>
<p>For Lithium to reach its maximum effectiveness, two or even three weeks is often required. 
To control severe mania, doctors often will prescribe an anitpsychotic such as Haldol while 
waiting for lithium to take affect. When the manic symptoms disappear, the antipsychotic 
will usually be discontinued, but the lithium continued. </p>
<p>Physicians using combinations of lithium and anitpsychotics are urged to closely monitor 
patients because of the danger of a toxic reaction to the combination of lithium and Haldol. </p>
<p>Some patients on lithium report having breakthrough depression. These patients may 
respond to an increase in the dosage or the addition of an antidepressant. When depressions 
occur in patients who have been taking lithium and who are able to tolerate a higher dose, it 
is possible that the dosage has been inadequate. </p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><b>Side Effects:</b></font></p>
<p>Common side effects of lithium include nausea, loss of appetite, and mild diarrhea. These 
usually will taper off after the first few weeks. Dizziness and hand tremors have also been 
reported, and tremors can be diminished effectively if the dosage of lithium is gradually 
decreased. Medications that control tremors are Cogentin and Inderal. With Inderal, 
however, there may be a lowering of the patient's blood pressure and heartrate, and sudden 
discontinuation can cause anxiety and tremulousness. </p>
<p>Increased production of urine and excessive thirst are two common side effects that are 
usually not serious problems, but patients with kidney disease should not be given lithium. 
Midamor is a drug that can reduce urinating. Taking the day's dosage of lithium at bedtime 
also seems to help with the problem of increased urination. Other side effects of lithium 
include weight gain, hypothyroidism, increased white blood cell count, skin rashes, and 
birth defects. (See lithium and pregnancy below) </p>
<p>People who are taking lithium should consult their doctor before taking the following: 
Ibuprofen (Advil), acetazolamide, antihypertensives, anti-inflammatory drugs, calcium 
channel blockers, carbamazepine, diuretics, hydroxyzine, inderal, procardia, marijuana, 
muscle relaxants, neuroleptics, table salt, baking powder, tetracycline, tricyclic 
antidepressants, MOA inhibitors, or caffeine. </p>
<p>While on lithium, a patient's blood level must be closely monitored. If the blood level of 
lithium is too low, the patient's symptoms will not be relieved. If the blood level of lithium 
is too high, there is a danger of a toxic reaction. </p>
<p align=left><font color="#FF0000"><b>Lithium and pregnancy:</b></font></p>
<p>A study was done in 1992 to measure the effect of lithium on unborn babies. It was found 
that exposure to lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy might be associated with the 
increased risk of Ebstein's anomaly, a rare cardiac malformation. Otherwise, the rate of 
congenital malformations did not differ between the group that took lithium and the control 
group. Birthweight, however, was found to be significantly higher in the lithium group, 
despite the high percentage of lithium users who were also cigarette smokers (almost twice 
as many as the control group).</p>

    <li>Also, caution should be taken by patients who drive or

        thinking, or motor skills.</li>
</ol>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>Luvox (fluvoxamine maleate) is a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor (SSRI) marketed jointly by Solvay Pharmaceuticals,
Inc., and the Upjohn Company. Luvox has recently been cleared for marketing
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obsessive
compulsive disorder (OCD), a biological illness involving an
imbalance of a brain chemical. </p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What does Luvox treat?</b></font></p>

<p>Luvox has been shown to effectively reduce the symptoms
associated with OCD, an anxiety disorder affecting an estimated
five million Americans. OCD is characterized by obsessions
(unwanted, recurrent and disturbing thoughts) and compulsions (repetitive,
ritualized behaviors that the person feels driven to perform in
order to lessen the anxiety produced by the obsessions).</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>How does Luvox work?</b></font></p>

<p>Current theories suggest that OCD is a biological illness
which may involve an imbalance of a naturally occurring brain chemical
called serotonin, which sends impulses from one nerve cell to another. Luvox
seems to work by improving this imbalance and by reducing the
obsessions and compulsions associated with OCD.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Who can benefit from Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>Physicians and the millions of Americans with OCD have, with
Luvox, a new option in drug treatment. Patients who have not benefitted
previously from medication may respond to Luvox. It may also be
useful as a medication to try first with persons with OCD.</p>

<p>Studies show that Luvox is effective for elderly patients as
well as young persons. The safety and effectiveness of Luvox have not
been established for those under 18 years of age. Luvox should be used cautiously
in patients with a history of mania and/or seizures. Nursing
mothers and women who become pregnant during therapy with Luvox
should consult a physician about continuing treatment.</p>

<p>A recent nationwide survey of more than 1,000 adults found
that over half of the respondents were not aware that medications
exist to treat OCD. Luvox represents a new choice in drug therapy
that may help to clear up this misperception and increase the
number of people being successfully treated for OCD.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>What is the standard dose of Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>The recommended starting dose for Luvox is 50 mg, taken as a
single daily dose at bedtime. The dosage may be increased in 50
mg increments every four to seven days until maximum therapeutic benefit
is achieved. The dosage should never exceed 300 mg/day.</p>

<p>For doses over 100 mg/day, it is recommended that Luvox be
given in two divided doses. If the doses are unequal, the larger
dose should be given at bedtime. Try to be patient the first few
weeks of treatment. Improvement may occur only after several
weeks or months.</p>

<p>It may be necessary for physicians to modify the initial dose
and subsequent dosage increases for older patients.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Can I take Luvox with other
medications?</b></font></p>

<p>There are several medications that should not be taken in
combination with Luvox. These medications include the
prescription antihistamines Seldane and Hismanal as well as any
MAOI (monoamine oxidase inhibitor) medication, such as Parnate, Nardil,
or Marplan. Patients should notify their physicians if they are
taking or plan to take any other medications with Luvox because
there is a potential for harmful interactions. It is also
advisable to avoid alcohol while undergoing treatment with Luvox.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><b>How long should I stay on Luvox?</b></font></p>

<p>The effectiveness of Luvox for long-term use has not been
studied extensively. Therefore, patients taking this drug for extended
periods of time should be monitored closely by a physician and re-evaluated
over time.</p>

<h4 align=center><font color="#000080"><b>Facts About Risperdal</b></font></h4>
<hr>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What is Risperdal?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Risperdal, or risperidone, is the newest medication for treating schizophrenia and psychotic 
disorders. It helps manage schizophrenia's &quot;positive symptoms&quot; such as visual and auditory hallucinations, 
delusions, and thought disturbances. Risperdal may also help in treating so-called &quot;negative symptoms&quot; such 
as social withdrawal, apathy, lack of motivation, and inability to experience pleasure. Side effects are usually 
relatively minor, and blood monitoring is not necessary. Risperdal is the first new front-line treatment option 
in twenty years.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How is Risperdal different from other antipsychotic medications?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Conventional antipsychotics such as Haldol, Stelazine, and Prolixin have treated positive symptoms in many 
patients for several years. However, they do not satisfactorily affect the negative symptoms, and they often cause 
uncomfortable or intolerable side effects. Risperdal is as effective as the conventional medications in treating 
positive symptoms. It also offers the advantages of helping to treat some of the negative symptoms somewhat and 
causing fewer extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) such as restlessness, muscle rigidity, and tremor when taken at 
the manufacturer's recommended dose of 6 mg per day.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Why is Risperdal called a new &quot;front-line option?&quot;</font></h4>
<p align=left>It means that Risperdal could be the first medication prescribed for a person who is newly diagnosed with a 
psychotic disorder. Some medications, such as clozapine, have side effects that may be inconvenient or difficult 
to manage. Such medications may be reserved until after other medications have been tried unsuccessfully. 
Because Risperdal is effective and has relatively few side effects, doctors may consider it one of the first 
medications to try for patients with schizophrenia. It's important to remember that no medication will work for 
everyone, and some patients will have greater success with Risperdal than others.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How does Risperdal work?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Risperdal, like other new antipsychotic drugs currently under development, is designed as a 
serotonin/dopamine antagonist. While its exact mechanism of action is not yet understood, Risperdal seems to 
block the action of serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitter chemicals in the brain. Conventional 
antipsychotics seem to primarily affect only dopamine.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How quickly does Risperdal relieve symptoms of schizophrenia?</font></h4>
<p align=left>The recommended dose is usually reached within three to four weeks, and improvement of symptoms may be 
noticed in some patients relatively quickly. Some adjustments may be necessary to reach the optimal dose for 
each patient. It is normally advisable to give the medication a trial period of at least four to six weeks at the 
optimal dose (6 mg/day) before evaluating its effectiveness, although experience with clozapine suggests that 
improvements may take months to fully emerge.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What are the side effects of Risperdal?</font></h4>
<p align=left>When taken at the manufacturer's recommended dose of 6 mg a day (3 mg twice a day), the incidence of many 
side effects is not significantly greater than for placebo. These side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms 
(muscle stiffness, tremors, and body shakes). At higher doses, extrapyramidal side effects often increase. 
Benztropine (Cogentin) can be prescribed to reduce or eliminate stiffness and tremors, but its use beyond three 
months should be re-evaluated.</p>
<p align=left>More significant possible side effects, affecting some patients but not all, include low blood pressure, dizziness, 
especially when standing up suddenly; heart palpitations; sleepiness; constipation; weight gain; sexual 
dysfunction; and fatigue. Some of these problems can be minimized by following recommended guidelines for 
dosage at the beginning of treatment (gradual increase of dose over a period of several weeks). Patients who 
already have low blood pressure, who have kidney or liver impairment, are elderly, or in a weakened condition 
may require close monitoring and even more gradual dose adjustment.</p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">Does Risperdal cause tardive dyskinesia?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Tardive dyskinesia (TD), a disfiguring side effect that occurs in some patients taking antipsychotic drugs, may 
not be a major risk associated with Risperdal use, although it may take years before researchers can fully 
assess the risk. It is prudent to minimize the risk by using the lowest dose necessary to relive psychotic 
symptoms. Should symptoms of TD develop, such as grimacing, sucking and smacking of lips and other 
spasmodic movements, discontinuation of Risperdal should be considered. </p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">What else should be kept in mind when taking Risperdal?</font></h4>
<p align=left>Risperdal is usually taken twice a day. It can be take before, during, or after meals. Because of its long 
half-life (similar to haloperidol), however, once daily dosing should be considered. Patients should be cautious 
about operating hazardous machinery, including driving, until they are certain they are not adversely affected. 
Women should let their doctor know if they become pregnant or intend to become pregnant. Breast feeding is not 
recommended while taking Risperdal. Because some medications can affect the effectiveness of Risperdal 
when taken at the same time, patients should be sure their doctor is aware of all medications they are taking. </p>
<h4 align=left><font color="#FF0000">How much does Risperdal cost?</font></h4>
<p align=left>At the recommended dose of 4-6 mg a day, Risperdal is expected to cost the patient less than $3,000 a year. 
Some insurance policies will cover the cost. Uninsured outpatients who meet income eligibility standards may 
qualify for low cost or free Risperdal through the manufacturer. Janssen Pharmaceutica also answers questions 
about insurance coverage, and offers assistance in filing claim forms and resolving claims that have been denied.

Program, call 1-800-652-6227.</p>

(olanzapine)--Treatment for</b></font> <a
href="../../../../helpline/schizo.htm"><font color="#000080">Schizophrenia</font></a></h3>

<table border="0" cellpadding="15" cellspacing="15" width="100%">
    <tr>
        <td valign="top" width="50%"><h4><font color="#FF0000">What
        is Zyprexa (olanzapine)?</font> </h4>
        <p>Zyprexa<sup></sup> is manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company.
        It is a new &quot;atypical&quot; antipsychotic medication
        that received FDA approval for the treatment of schizophrenia
        in September 1996.</p>
        <h4><font color="#FF0000">How does Zyprexa work?</font> </h4>
        <p>Research and clinical psychopharmacologists do not
        fully know what causes schizophrenia. It is known, however,
        that several neurotransmitters in the brain are altered
        in persons with schizophrenia. Zyprexa<sup></sup> works
        to reduce symptoms of schizophrenia by blocking various
        serotonin and dopamine receptors. It blocks the serotonin
        (5-HT@A) receptor more potently than the dopamine (D2) receptor.
        In animal studies, Zyprexa<sup></sup> is more potent at
        blocking serotonin and dopamine than Clozaril<sup>.</sup> </p>
        <p>Animal and human studies, however, indicate that
        Zyprexa<sup></sup> may have a greater risk of causing
        extrapyramidal side effects than Clozaril<sup></sup>.
        Extrapyramidal side effects include slowing of voluntary
        movement, expressionless face, rigidity and tremor of arms
        and head, abnormal toxicity of muscle tissues, and
        restlessness.</p>
        <h4><font color="#FF0000">What is the standard dose of
        Zyprexa?</font> </h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Oral doses of 10 mg. daily have been effective
                for most patients in the treatment of
                schizophrenia. Zyprexa<sup></sup> can be dosed
                once a day at bedtime.</li>
            <li>Zyprexa<sup></sup> is available by prescription from
                your pharmacy in 5.0 mg, 7.5 mg and 10 mg
                tablets. </li>
            <li>10 mg has been an effective starting dose in most
                patients.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4><font color="#FF0000">How is Zyprexa different from Clozaril?</font> </h4>
        <p>Zyprexa<sup></sup> differs from Clozaril<sup></sup>
        in side effects. Zyprexa<sup></sup> does not cause
        seizures of agranulocytosis, a serious deficiency of a
        type of white blood cells that could be fatal. Although
        Clozaril<sup></sup> works very well to treat
        schizophrenia, it requires a weekly blood draw and weekly
        prescription refills because of the monitoring for angranulocytosis.
        Weekly blood drawing and refills are not necessary with
        Zyprexa<sup></sup>. </p>
        <p>Zyprexa<sup></sup> also differs from Clozaril<sup></sup>
        in that it does not cause excessive drooling. Zyprexa<sup></sup>
        has not been directly compared to Clozaril<sup></sup>
        in clinical studies in patients, so it is not now known
        which drug will be better for certain patients with schizophrenia. </p>

        <td valign="top" width="50%"><h4><font color="#FF0000">Are
        there other new drugs available to treat schizophrenia?</font> </h4>

                vision or dryness of the mouth, or as frequent
                stiff body movements. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4><font color="#FF0000">How is Zyprexa different from Risperdal?</font> </h4>
        <p>There have been no direct clinical comparisons between
        Zyprexa<sup></sup> and Risperdal<sup>.</sup> Eli
        Lilly and Company is currently conducting such a study,
        however. This study is an international effort, and results
        may be available in the next year. </p>

        <p>Zyprexa<sup></sup> is available from your pharmacy as

        the Mentally Ill&#146;s Campaign to End Discrimination</strong>

        is a five-year, nationwide effort to end discrimination against

        people with severe mental illnesses. Mental illnesses are

        brain disorders.  They are every bit as real and deserving of treatment as illnesses

        that affect other parts of the body. &nbsp;</td>

    </tr>

</table>



<p>If people with mental illnesses are to receive the treatment, respect,

and economic opportunities they deserve, we will have to change

the behaviors and public policies of lawmakers and public

officials. We will have to challenge the corporate policies of our nation&#146;s businesses

and the attitudes of our nation&#146;s opinion leaders towards

people with brain disorders. </p>



<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> To improve the quality of

life for people with brain disorders by working to ensure dignity

and by securing non-discriminatory access to quality health care, housing,

education, and all economic opportunities. </p>

<p>This Media Outreach Guide is designed to provide you with
ideas and tips to help you generate ongoing coverage of science
and treatment issues in your local health/science, editorial,
public service, and business media. Inside you will find: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>(1) science and treatment messages to communicate to the
    media; </p>
    <p>(2) ideas on how to start working with the media; </p>
    <p>(3) science and treatment story ideas; </p>
    <p>(4) proactive and reactive media outreach tips; and </p>
    <p>(5) &quot;tried and true&quot; ideas from different AMI
    chapters. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have also included several sample media materials for you
to adapt and use as you see fit.</p>

<p><b>Messages</b></p>

<p>Through sustained outreach to your local media, you can help
ensure that NAMI&#146;s messages on the science and treatment of
brain disorders are included in health-related reporting. These
messages are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Severe mental illnesses are brain disorders.</li>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.</li>
    <li>The cost of treating brain disorders is comparable to the
        cost of treating many other medical illnesses.</li>
    <li>People with brain disorders can lead healthy, productive
        lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>A message chart with supporting facts for each message is
provided in this folder to help you prepare your AMI staff as
well as other spokespeople.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p><i>Develop a Plan.</i> Before you begin talking with your
local media, develop a brief media outreach plan that will guide
your efforts over the next year. This plan should list your media
goals and objectives, outline story ideas, and propose a time
frame for each activity. (A sample plan outline is included.)</p>

<p>To keep science and treatment issues at the forefront, and to
announce new information, you should plan to <b>proactively </b>contact
the media quarterly. However, you should also have a plan in
place to help you react to or take advantage of current events,
such as a negative brain disorder story or a new advance.</p>

<p><i>Identify Spokespeople. </i>Identify credible spokespeople
whom you can promote to the media for expert opinions and
background information. Spokespeople might include AMI
representatives, university researchers, psychiatrists, AMI
members (both family members and consumers), or local celebrities involved
in brain disorder issues.</p>

<p><i>Train Spokespeople on Messages.</i> To make sure everyone
speaking on behalf of AMI is reinforcing consistent messages,
provide spokespersons with a copy of the message chart included
in this folder. You can adapt it to include any relevant, local
messages. If possible, spend some time with each spokesperson to
practice weaving the key messages into answers to media
questions. </p>

<p><i>Identify Key Media.</i> Different story ideas/angles (or
&quot;pitches&quot;) will appeal to different reporters, depending
on their &quot;beat&quot; (i.e., the subject matter they
regularly cover), type of media (e.g., print, television, radio)
and the type of story proposed (e.g., feature, news item). As you
read your local newspapers, take note of reporters who cover
health-related topics, especially those who write about brain
disorders. Also, do not forget to contact public service
directors at your local media outlets as they can provide free
advertising space to further promote the science and treatment
messages (see enclosed print PSAs).</p>

<p>To reinforce the science and treatment messages from all
angles, you should contact reporters and producers who cover the
following beats. (In parentheses we have noted some relevant
story angles for each outlet.)</p>

<ul>
    <li>Health (severe mental illnesses are brain disorders;
        treatment works; people with brain disorders can lead
        healthy, productive lives).</li>
    <li>Science (severe mental illnesses are brain disorders;
        treatment works; history of research on brain disorders).</li>
    <li>Business (the cost of treating brain disorders is
        comparable to that of treating many other medical
        illnesses; link to insurance parity issue).</li>
    <li>Politics/Legislation (the cost of treating brain
        disorders is comparable to that of treating many other
        medical illnesses; link to insurance parity issue).</li>
    <li>Public Service (severe mental illnesses are brain
        disorders; treatment works; people with brain disorders
        can lead healthy, productive lives; discrimination is a
        continuing problem).</li>
    <li>Editorial (all messages). <i>Most newspapers have an
        editorial section for articles written by the paper&#146;s
        editorial staff. Editorials are difficult to
        &quot;place,&quot; as they typically relate to other -- often
        controversial -- items in the news. However, the
        editorial staff can play a large role in ensuring that
        your science and treatment messages are included in the
        paper&#146;s editorial coverage.</i></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Build Positive Relationships.</i> Once you have identified
your media contacts, start building positive relationships. As
with any working relationship, it&#146;s important to establish
trust and rapport. Getting to know the person behind the
professional will help you be at ease when dealing with him or
her. This can entail arranging individual meetings with
reporters, news directors, and editors to introduce yourself and
provide background information on AMI and brain disorders;
distributing business cards to all media contacts so they know
how to reach you; and establishing a pattern for continuous and regular
contact. Most important, before you approach a reporter, do a
little research, and tailor your messages to suit his/her needs.</p>

<p><i>Evaluate Your Coverage. </i>Assign someone at your
affiliate to monitor your local media, cut out articles from
local newspapers, and obtain video or audio tapes of television
and radio coverage resulting from your media outreach efforts.
(To obtain tapes, ask the station for a copy or -- if you know
when a story will be run -- set a VCR or stereo tape deck to copy
the program yourself.) Periodically review the coverage, and
determine if any refinements in your approach or your messages
should be made. Also, please send copies of your media coverage
to Melissa Saunders Katz, projects manager of NAMI&#146;s
Campaign to End Discrimination.</p>

<p><b>Story Ideas</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the &quot;comparable cost of treatment&quot; message
        to tie brain disorder issues into current events, such as
        state parity legislation or budget battles.</li>
    <li>Suggest a personal health angle, such as a &quot;day in
        the life&quot; or &quot;before/after treatment&quot;
        articles or a series featuring local individuals with
        brain disorders.</li>
    <li>Propose a five-week series on brain disorders, covering
        the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of each of the five
        brain disorders for which we advocate. Offer to work with
        a researcher or knowledgeable psychiatrist in your state
        for expert comment and input into the series.</li>
    <li>Propose a comparison of the origins and treatments of
        different brain disorders -- those with effects on
        physical functioning (e.g., Parkinson&#146;s disease) vs.
        those with effects on mental functioning (e.g.,
        schizophrenia).</li>
    <li>Suggest an article focusing on the major brain disorder
        research advances made in the past five years.</li>
    <li>Propose a <i>Mental Health Treatment and Resource Guide</i>
        for your local newspaper&#146;s health section. Offer a
        list of local resources -- hospitals, physicians,
        psychiatrists, counselors, support groups, etc. -- with
        experience in helping people with brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Media Outreach Tips</b></p>

<p><i><u>Proactive</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Position your AMI affiliate as a leading source of
        science and treatment information. Send local medical/health
        reporters and news assignment editors a background kit
        that positions your local AMI spokespeople as expert
        resources on the science and treatment of brain
        disorders. You can use the fact sheets and charts on the
        five brain disorders that are included in this folder as
        part of your background kit. Also include a list of local
        people with brain disorders who have been successfully
        treated and are willing to talk to the media. </li>
    <li>Conduct a science and health writers&#146; briefing with
        your AMI affiliate and local and/or national experts. Use
        the briefing to update the media on the latest science
        and treatment research and data. Ask for help in building
        public awareness about the biological causes of brain
        disorders as well as the effectiveness of treatment.</li>
    <li>Submit opinion-editorials (op-eds) -- articles written by
        an expert who takes a position on a controversial topic
        -- to your local newspapers. Op-eds are a good way to
        promote your AMI as a credible local resource for
        information on brain disorders. Before submitting an
        op-ed, call the op-ed editor at your local newspaper to
        learn about the submission process. A sample op-ed is
        provided in this folder.</li>
    <li>Try to place your AMI organization&#146;s spokespeople
        and allies on local radio and television news programs,
        such as the morning shows or evening news. Prepare
        thoroughly for such appearances by finding out who the
        other guests will be and the type of questions that will
        be asked. If you need information or guidance, call
        NAMI&#146;s media relations department. (Beware of
        sensationalist talk shows that could exploit you or your
        spokespeople.)</li>
    <li>NAMI will provide you with information on the latest
        science and treatment advances. Please use this
        information to develop <i>Science and Treatment Updates</i>,
        including possible story angles, for reporters covering
        brain disorders. Send <i>Updates</i> quarterly, and
        follow up periodically with phone calls and letters to
        keep the reporters you have met current on science and
        treatment issues. Always suggest one or more story angles
        when following up with the media. </li>
    <li>Send out news releases and advisories, as appropriate, to
        announce important information, such as scientific
        advances in studying the brain. Where possible, take
        advantage of national and local scientific advances by
        incorporating a local angle. A sample news release is
        enclosed in this folder.</li>
    <li>Invite reporters to AMI events, such as a community
        briefing or workshop on brain disorders. If possible,
        invite a local newscaster to host the event. This will
        help ensure that at least the host&#146;s station will
        cover the event.</li>
    <li>Develop an <i>Open Your Mind</i> award for reporters who
        have helped promote the science and treatment of brain
        disorders. </li>
    <li>Mail or deliver slicks of the enclosed print public
        service announcements (PSAs) with a cover letter to the
        advertising directors at local newspapers. Meet with the
        directors to ask for a commitment to run the ads.</li>
    <li>Work with your local television stations to add a local
        tag to NAMI&#146;s television PSAs, which are currently
        running nationwide. Meet with the PSA directors at local
        television stations, and ask for a commitment to run the
        spots.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Reactive</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>When an article or broadcast story on brain disorders
        appears in your local media, follow up with the reporter
        to offer additional information or comment on the story.
        A sample letter to the editor is enclosed in this folder.</li>
    <li>When a scientific advance is announced nationally, issue
        a press release to your local media reiterating the news
        and offering a local spin and local spokespeople for
        comment. A sample press release is enclosed in this
        folder.</li>
    <li>When a positive story about the science and treatment of
        brain disorders appears in your local media, write a
        thank-you note to the reporter or producer who developed
        the story and offer to provide additional information for
        a follow-up.<b>&nbsp;</b></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proven AMI Strategies</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>New York State AMI created a series of 30-second
        pre-recorded radio public service announcements. The PSAs
        featured true stories about individuals with brain disorders who
        were helped by AMI-NYS. Members were asked to flood the
        radio station with phone calls requesting that the spots
        be aired often.</li>
    <li>Each year, Dane County, WI AMI lines up three or four
        half-hour to one-hour talk shows during Mental Illness
        Awareness Week. This enables the affiliate to cultivate
        ongoing relationships with the television and radio
        personalities and to increase awareness of brain
        disorders.</li>
    <li>A small AMI affiliate in Eau Claire, WI, knowing that a
        local reporter has a sister with a brain disorder (she
        had mentioned it in a story), invited the reporter to an
        AMI meeting to learn more about AMI and brain disorders.
        This resulted in an entire &quot;Lifestyle&quot; section
        of the local paper being devoted to brain disorders and
        AMI.</li>
    <li>The most rural AMI affiliate in Wisconsin, spanning four
        counties, has worked with a local newspaper publisher
        each year to publish a brain disorder resource guide. The
        affiliate puts together a newspaper supplement (mainly
        culled from NAMI and AMI-WI publications) and solicits
        business card advertising to pay for the printing. The
        supplement is then inserted in various weekly papers in their
        area. Not only do all the readers get important
        information, but the business community has also learned
        about the issue from its contact with AMI members selling
        ad space.</li>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the
    U.S., or five million Americans, suffer from a severe form of
    one of the following brain disorders: schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
    disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness),
    and major depression.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>It&#146;s no secret that brain disorders are shrouded in
    stigma and discrimination. For centuries they have been
    misunderstood, feared, hidden, and often ignored.</p>
    <p>In the last decade, significant scientific advances have
    provided the first real hope for people with brain disorders.
    Pioneering research has found both a biological basis for brain
    disorders and treatments that work.</p>
    <p>However, 40 percent of people with brain disorders do not
    seek treatment. These individuals are suffering needlessly.<sup>4</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Severe Mental Illnesses are Brain Disorders</b></p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Despite age-old myths and misinformation, severe
    &quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused by bad character,
    poor child-rearing, or an individual&#146;s behavior. A
    severe mental illness is a brain disorder. And brain
    disorders -- like Parkinson&#146;s disease, Alzheimer&#146;s
    disease, and epilepsy -- are biologically based physical
    disorders. &nbsp;</p>
    <p>Brain chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as
    genes, have been identified as among the leading biological
    factors causing brain disorders.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Scientists have identified the brain chemicals serotonin,
    dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors, which
    determine much of our mental and physical activities. Imbalances
    in these chemicals have been linked to brain disorders such
    as schizophrenia and depression.</p>
    <p>The brains of people with brain disorders are structurally
    different from the brains of healthy individuals. Through
    advanced imaging technology and other methods, scientists have
    been able to take &quot;pictures&quot; that show structural
    differences in the brains of individuals with brain
    disorders. Scientists have also detected different
    functioning in regions of the cortex and other areas of the
    brain in individuals with brain disorders.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Further, recent studies indicate genetic links for brain
    disorders. For example, an average child has a one percent
    chance of experiencing schizophrenia in his or her lifetime. However,
    the child of one parent with schizophrenia faces a 10 percent
    chance, while the child of two parents with schizophrenia
    faces a 50 percent chance. Scientists are currently working
    to pinpoint the specific genes linked to brain disorders.</p>
    <p>It is important for all Americans to understand that brain
    disorders have physiological indicators and that they can be
    diagnosed and treated as precisely as many other medical conditions.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Treatment Works</b>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>Like other medical problems, there are many treatments --
    including various types of medications and other therapies --
    that are available to help people with brain disorders live
    healthy, productive lives. In fact, success rates for
    treatment of brain disorders are impressive.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the
    success rates for treating severe forms of specific brain
    disorders with medications and other therapies are: 60
    percent for treating acute symptoms of schizophrenia; 70 to
    90 percent for treating panic disorder; 75 percent for
    treating OCD; 80 to 90 percent for treating bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
    illness); and 70 to 80 percent for treating major
    depression.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These success rates are far better than those of other
    medical conditions. For example, heart disease has just a 45
    to 50 percent treatment success rate.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In addition, the new generation of medications recently
    approved and under development can better target problem
    areas in the brain. This increased precision relieves
    symptoms more effectively and reduces the unintended side
    effects associated with many existing treatments.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>Costs are Comparable</b>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>The cost of treating a brain disorder is comparable to the
    cost of treating many other medical illnesses.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>For example, the total direct cost in 1990 for treating a
    person with severe diabetes was $7,725, compared with $7,158
    for treating a person with schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In Texas, a state where parity health insurance exists for
    state employees, the total cost of treating state employees
    and their family members for brain disorders was one-fifth
    the cost of treating cardiovascular disease in 1994.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 1994, one managed care company in Texas had 12,233
    claimants for cardiovascular disease and 4,617 claimants for
    schizophrenia. The average cost for treating people with cardiovascular
    disease was $2,496, compared to $1,424 for treating people
    with schizophrenia.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>People Treated for Brain Disorders Can Lead Healthy,
Productive Lives</b>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
    <p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the
    U.S., or five million Americans, suffer from a brain
    disorder. Approximately 40 percent of these individuals do
    not seek treatment, despite the fact that effective
    medications and other therapies are available.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Treatment can help individuals lead healthy, productive
    lives. Countless success stories prove it.&nbsp;</p>
    <p><b><i>[If appropriate, insert your own success stories
    here to localize your speech.]</i></b>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Consider Daphne, a 30 year-old woman who had schizophrenia
    for ten years and even attempted suicide. After two years of
    treatment with clozapine, one of the new breakthrough
    medications, she is now teaching public school part-time and
    living independently.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Or talk to Alex, 20, who has obsessive-compulsive
    disorder. His illness caused him to obsess about the idea
    that the CIA was following him. Treatment helped him control
    his thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Philip, a 65 year-old well-known actor, will tell you how
    much his life has improved since he began taking medication
    for panic disorder. Almost immediately after beginning the
    medication, he recovered from the severe panic attacks that
    used to leave him parked alongside the highway, sweating and
    unable to drive.</p>

<p align="center"><b>New Study Advances Understanding of
Biological Basis of Brain Disorders&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b><i>[Date, Location]</i></b> -- Scientists at the National
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) announced today the results of
a new study that advances the understanding of the biological
basis of brain disorders. <b><i>[Insert more detail about the
study/scientific advance.]</i></b></p>

<p>&quot;We are very encouraged by this recent scientific advance
in the understanding of the causes of brain disorders,&quot; said <b><i>[name,
title, affiliation of your local spokesperson]</i></b>. &quot;It
holds the promise of helping the more than <b><i>[insert number]</i></b>
people affected by <b><i>[insert specific brain disorder(s)]</i></b>
in this country, including <b><i>[insert number]</i></b> in our
community.&quot;</p>

<p><b><i>[Insert more detail about the study/scientific advance.]</i></b></p>

<p>&quot;This new study provides further evidence of what
scientists and health professionals have known for some time --
brain disorders are biologically based physical disorders that
can be effectively treated,&quot; said Laurie Flynn, executive
director of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.</p>

<p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of U.S. adults, or five
million Americans, suffer from a severe form of one of the
following brain disorders: schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression. Forty percent
of these people do not seek treatment and, as a result, may be
profoundly disabled by a disruption in the ability to think,
feel, and relate to others.</p>

<p>Researchers have recently been able to identify that several
biological factors -- such as brain chemistry, structure, and
functioning, as well as genes -- are among the causes of brain
disorders. Scientists have isolated the brain chemicals
serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors,
which determine much of an individual&#146;s mental and physical
activities. Imbalances in these chemicals have been linked to
brain disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Further, through
advanced imaging technology, scientists have pinpointed
structural differences in the brains of individuals with brain
disorders when compared to individuals with normal controls.</p>

<p>&quot;Like other medical problems, the symptoms of brain
disorders can be effectively reduced,&quot; said <b><i>[insert
spokesperson name/title]</i></b>. &quot;In fact, success rates
for treatment of brain disorders are impressive. <b><i>[Name of
new scientific advance]</i></b> is likely to further improve
treatment success rates.&quot; </p>

<p>According to the NIMH, the success rates for treating severe
forms of specific brain disorders with medications and other
therapies are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>60 percent for treating acute symptoms of schizophrenia;</li>
    <li>70 to 90 percent for treating panic disorder;</li>
    <li>75 percent for treating obsessive-compulsive disorder;</li>
    <li>80 to 90 percent for treating bipolar disorder
        (manic-depressive illness); and</li>
    <li>70 to 80 percent for treating major depression.</li>
</ul>

<p>By comparison, success rates for treating common medical
problems are often not as favorable. For example, cardiovascular
disease has a treatment success rate of just 45 to 50 percent.</p>

scientific advance.]</i></b></p>

including how long your AMI has been in existence, how many
members you have, what your objectives and goals are, and your

<p><i>Daphne has experienced schizophrenia for ten years and once
even attempted suicide. After two years of treatment with a new
medication, she is teaching public school part-time and living independently.</i></p>

<p><i>Alex, who has obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), was
obsessed with the idea that the CIA was following him. Treatment
helped him control his thoughts. He is now studying accounting in college.</i></p>

<p>These are just two of the many success stories that have been
made possible by recent advances in the understanding, diagnosis,
and treatment of brain disorders.</p>

<p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or
five million Americans, suffer from a severe form of one of the
following brain disorders -- schizophrenia, panic disorder, OCD,
bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major
depression.</p>

<p>In <b><i>[city/town]</i></b> alone, <b><i>[number]</i></b>
people suffer from brain disorders. Left untreated, disorders of
the brain may profoundly disrupt a person&#146;s ability to
think, feel, and relate to others and to his or her environment.</p>

<p>Fortunately, treatment of brain disorders is available, and it
works. In fact, there are impressive success rates for the
treatment of severe forms of brain disorders with medications and
other therapies. According to the National Institute of Mental
Health, the current success rate for treating schizophrenia is 60
percent; panic disorder is successfully treated 70 to 90 percent
of the time; treatment of OCD is successful 75 percent of the
time; bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) has an 80 to 90
percent treatment success rate; and major depression has a 70 to
80 percent treatment success rate. And, as illustrated above,
people who are treated for brain disorders can lead healthy, productive
lives.</p>

<p>For the millions of Americans affected by brain disorders, it
is vital that the public be made aware that brain disorders are
biologically based physical disorders that can be treated. I
would very much like to meet with you to introduce you to the <b><i>[city/town]</i></b>
affiliate of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)
and provide you with additional background information on science
and treatment issues related to brain disorders. </p>

<p>Enclosed for your information are <b><i>[fact sheets on brain
disorders as well as background information on AMI]</i></b>. I
will call you in a few days to see if we can set up a time to
meet. In the meantime, if you have any questions, please
don&#146;t hesitate to call me at <b><i>[insert your phone
number]</i></b>.</p>

<p align="center"><b>BRAIN DISORDERS: BIOLOGICALLY BASED AND

<p>Parkinson&#146;s disease. Alzheimer&#146;s disease. Epilepsy.
Schizophrenia. All four are brain disorders, but only the first
three are covered adequately by insurance. This discrimination
and lack of parity in health insurance coverage for brain
disorders are both inexcusable and based on the profound misperception
that diseases like schizophrenia are behavioral problems, rather
than treatable medical conditions.</p>

<p>Despite age-old myths and misinformation, the brain disorders
schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), and major depression
are not caused by bad character, poor child-rearing, or an
individual&#146;s behavior. They are biologically based physical
disorders that can be diagnosed and effectively treated. Left
untreated, disorders of the brain can be profoundly disabling,
disrupting a person&#146;s ability to think, feel, and relate to
others and to his or her environment.</p>

<p>In any given year, about 2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or
five million Americans, suffer from a severe form of a brain
disorder. Forty percent of these individuals do not seek
treatment, oftentimes because they are either not covered by
insurance or because they do not believe they can be helped.</p>

<p>Thanks to major scientific advances, researchers have been
able to identify several biological factors -- such as brain
chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as genes -- that
are among the causes of brain disorders. Scientists have
identified the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine
and their receptors, which determine much of our mental and
physical activities. Imbalances in these chemicals have been
linked to brain disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.
Further, through advanced imaging technology, scientists have
identified structural and functional differences in the brains of
individuals with brain disorders.</p>

<p>Like other medical problems, brain disorders can be
effectively diagnosed and treated with medications and other
therapies. According to the National Institute of Mental Health,
success rates for treating severe forms of the five major brain
disorders for which we advocate are as follows: schizophrenia, 60
percent; panic disorder, 70 to 90 percent; OCD, 75 percent;
bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), 80 to 90 percent;
and major depression, 70 to 80 percent.</p>

<p>Compare these rates with the success rates for treating other
common diseases, such as cardiovascular disease (45 to 50
percent), and it is clear that the success rates are not only comparable;
they are in many cases far better for treatment of brain
disorders.</p>

<p>But treatment of brain disorders costs more, right? Wrong. The
cost of treating brain disorders is very much in line with the
cost of treating other medical illnesses. For example, the total
direct cost in 1990 of treating a person with severe diabetes was
$7,725, compared with $7,158 for treating a person with
schizophrenia.</p>

<p>When illness strikes any other organ of the body, health
insurance covers treatment. When illness strikes the brain, full
coverage is very rarely available, and the illness becomes a
crushing burden, both personally and financially.</p>

<p>It is no secret that brain disorders are shrouded in stigma
and discrimination. For centuries they have been misunderstood,
feared, hidden, and often ignored. It is time for us to eradicate
this ignorance.</p>

<p>The facts make it clear that health insurance discrimination
against people with brain disorders makes no sense. No scientific
sense. No economic sense. No political sense. No common sense.</p>

<p><i>Tailor the opening sentence of this sample letter to the
editor to reinforce or challenge an argument made in an article
on brain disorders that has been published in your local
newspaper. Once you send this to the editor, make sure to follow
up with a phone call.</i></p>

<hr>

<p>Dear Editor:</p>

<p>In regard to <b><i>[insert reporter&#146;s name]</i></b>
article, <b><i>[insert article title]</i></b>, which appeared on <b><i>[insert
date]</i></b>, I would like to <b><i>[clear up some errors and
misperceptions about brain disorders/applaud (reporter) for
his/her accurate reporting on brain disorders]</i></b>. Contrary
to what many Americans believe, severe mental illnesses are not
caused by bad character, poor child-rearing, or an
individual&#146;s behavior. A severe mental illness is a brain
disorder that, like epilepsy or Alzheimer&#146;s disease, is a biologically
based medical problem.</p>

<p>Thanks to major scientific advances, researchers have been
able to identify several biological factors -- such as brain
chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as genes -- that
cause the brain disorders schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
illness), and major depression. </p>

<p>For example, scientists have identified brain chemicals that
determine much of our mental and physical activities. Imbalances
in the chemicals serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and
their receptors have been linked to brain disorders such as
schizophrenia and depression. New medications have been created
to balance these chemical levels and thus effectively treat
symptoms of brain disorders.</p>

<p>Science has proven that brain disorders have physiological
indicators. Through advanced imaging technology, scientists have
identified structural and functional differences in the brains of
individuals with brain disorders, as compared to those with
normal controls. These disorders can now be diagnosed and treated
as effectively as many other medical conditions.</p>

<p>Citizens of this country need to start learning the facts
about the causes and treatment of brain disorders. Only then will
the stigma and discrimination associated with these disorders be
eliminated.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>This Legislator Outreach Guide has been designed to provide
you with ideas and tips for educating state legislators about
brain disorder issues, such as insurance parity and
anti-discrimination. The more legislators understand about brain
disorders, the more likely they are to take steps to enact supportive
legislation. Inside you will find: (1) science and treatment
messages; (2) ideas on how to start your outreach efforts; and
(3) science and treatment outreach recommendations. We have also included
some proven AMI affiliate strategies, which you can replicate in
your own community, as appropriate.</p>

<p>It is a critical time for advocates of people with brain
disorders. While significant strides have been made in many
states to guarantee equality for people with brain disorders,
many states still continue to deny adequate insurance coverage
and fair treatment to individuals suffering from brain disorders. This
situation is intolerable -- and it is reversible.</p>

<p>This document features a wide range of proven legislative
strategies. Choose the ones that will help you meet your goals,
whether that means modest changes or a major overhaul of laws
governing insurance coverage and anti-discrimination. No one
tactic will achieve everything, so be prepared to try various
methods. And remember, do not get frustrated if you do not effect
radical change at first. Most changes are incremental, but
together they can have a tremendous impact.</p>

<p><b>Messages</b></p>

<p>By working with local lawmakers, you can help ensure that
NAMI&#146;s messages on the science and treatment of brain
disorders are heard during deliberation about health care issues.
These messages are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Science shows that severe mental illnesses are brain
        disorders, no different than other physical illnesses.
        There is absolutely no biomedical justification for
        policies that judge brain disorders as being in any way
        less real or less deserving of treatment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.<br>
        </li>
    <li>The costs of treating brain disorders are comparable to
        the costs of treating many other physical illnesses; it
        makes economic sense to cover these disorders equally.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Legislation must be passed to guarantee health insurance
        parity and put an end to discrimination against people
        with brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p>A message chart with supporting facts for each message is
provided in the Media Outreach Tools folder for your use.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p>The following are the fundamentals of legislator outreach:</p>

<p><i>Develop a Plan.</i> Before you begin outreach to
legislators, develop a brief plan to guide your work. This plan
should include your legislative goals and objectives, target
audiences, proposed activities, and a rough timeline. (A sample
plan outline is included to help you guide your thinking.)</p>

<p>Even if legislators in your area are not currently engaged in
this debate, seize the opportunity to lay a positive foundation
before parity and other anti-discrimination issues emerge. At the
same time, you should also have a system in place for responding
to legislative developments. For example, identify an AMI member
who will be prepared to contact the media about your
affiliate&#146;s position on new legislation.</p>

<p><i>Form a Legislative Committee</i>. Identify members who have
personal connections with legislators. Consider members with a
variety of backgrounds (e.g., consumer, family member, scientist, psychiatrist).
Also identify non-member professionals who are supportive of AMI.
Ask these individuals to serve on a legislative committee, which
will help manage outreach activities. Take the time to train
these committee members; the enclosed questions and answers are a
good way to tackle tough questions.</p>

<p>Provide your committee members with practical tools they can
use to deliver brain disorder messages effectively. Good examples
include legislative updates, in-depth information about specific
pieces of legislation, voting records of legislators, and message
points for both phone calls and letters to lawmakers.</p>

<p><i>Identify Key Legislators. </i>To best maximize resources,
identify legislators with the greatest influence over parity
legislation rather than trying to blanket the entire universe of
politicians. Consider identifying legislators representing the
key undecided (swing) votes on an issue. You might also contact
lawmakers supportive of your issue who can help you educate these
swing voters. Take note of legislators in both parties.</p>

<p><i>Get to Know Your Legislators</i>. Contact legislators, and
request a brief meeting <i>before</i> bills are introduced. This
will help acquaint them with the issues. Learn about their
backgrounds and what constituencies are important to them. Gauge
legislators&#146; personal awareness of brain disorder issues. Assess
what will encourage them to take action (e.g., data,
consumer-driven appeals).</p>

<p><i>Get to Know Your Supporters</i>. Find out which
organizations, individuals, and businesses are supportive of
brain disorder issues, such as the local chapter of the American
Psychiatric Association, researchers at local universities, as
well as other key players in the treatment of brain disorders.
Conduct outreach to these groups, and get them to partner with
you on legislator outreach. Make sure to locate groups you might
not normally partner with but whose issues indirectly relate to brain
disorders.</p>

<p><i>Get to Know the Opposition. </i>Find out which groups and
businesses are not supportive of brain disorder issues. Meet with
them to try to understand their points of view. Use the enclosed
science and treatment information to educate them about brain
disorder issues. Try to find some common ground and persuade them
to support your legislative efforts.</p>

<p><i>Monitor and Evaluate Legislation. </i>Learn about the
legislative process. Identify key committees and subcommittees to
watch. Assign someone in the committee to clip articles about
upcoming legislation and debate on brain disorders. Also make
sure to obtain copies of all relevant legislation so you can carefully
track parity and anti-discrimination issues and plan next steps.
Contact your regional director in the field for more information
about the legislative process.</p>

<p><b>Legislator Outreach Tips</b></p>

<p>There are many ways to indirectly and directly effect
legislative change -- the process is a multi-layered one.
Remember that public opinion, grassroots activity, and media
coverage, as well as direct legislative contact, can all be very
influential factors in policy decisions. (Please see attached NAMI
Legislative Vision diagram.)</p>

<p>Regardless of the activities you undertake, make sure your
timing is right. There are some scheduled events that can help
enhance your outreach, such as Mental Illness Awareness Week or
National Depression Screening Day. There are also important
legislative milestones which you cannot always predict ahead of
time but which can greatly increase your impact, such as
committee and subcommittee hearings, floor debates, and votes on
bills. To the best of your ability, try to time your activities
to coincide with these events.</p>

<p>The following are only a few ideas to help you get started:</p>

<p><i><u>Generating Grassroots Support -- Ring Around the Capitol</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Hold vigils and rallies at your state legislature
        demanding equal treatment for people with brain disorders.
        For example, form a human circle around the capitol. Ask
        everyone but a small percentage of participants to dress
        in black. The others should dress in white and should
        wear placards saying, &quot;I am one of (fill in number)
        people in America who has (choose brain disorder). We are
        everywhere.&quot; </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Conduct marches across town with your allies demanding
        parity legislation. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Contact supportive organizations, like the local chapters
        of the American Psychiatric Association. Ask them to
        mobilize their members to deliver science and treatment
        messages to legislators.<br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Public Education -- Look How Far We&#146;ve Come </u></i><br>
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Work with local colleges and universities to host a <i>Media
        Theater</i> movie/media seminar, featuring selected films
        and other media depicting people with brain disorders.
        For example, show such movies as (or clips from) &quot;My
        Own Private Idaho,&quot; &quot;Benny and Joon,&quot; and
        &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#146;s Nest.&quot; Invite
        a panel of local experts to review the history of how movies
        and other media have portrayed people with brain
        disorders. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Work with your local library to develop an exhibit on
        brain disorders. This exhibit can feature a variety of
        books, movies, and articles on brain disorders, which
        visitors can access while at the library. Provide this
        kit&#146;s brain disorder fact sheets, which visitors can
        take with them.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Cultivating Legislative Allies --We Can&#146;t Do It
Without You</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Use the enclosed talking points to conduct one-on-one or
        group briefings for key legislators. You might arrange a
        meeting prior to a major vote or to update legislators on
        new science and treatment of brain disorders.<br>
        </li>
    <li><i>Adopt-a-Legislator</i>. When you determine which
        legislators are key to brain disorder issues, ask AMI
        members in their districts to build relationships with
        the policymakers. Members should try to meet with their
        designated legislators on a regular basis and inform them
        of all new science and treatment advances.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Conduct <i>Bag It</i> brown-bag lunch sessions or
        legislative breakfasts at the state legislature for legislative
        staff. Provide staff with current science and treatment
        information, and propose ways they can have an impact on
        legislation to guarantee fair treatment of people with
        brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Host events, like town meetings, lectures, or panel
        discussions, and invite legislators to participate. This
        will help acquaint politicians with different
        perspectives and local players in the brain disorder
        debate. You should also present an <i>Open Your Mind</i>
        award to the legislator(s) who has been most supportive
        of brain disorder issues. Be sure to invite the press.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Proof of Consumer/Voter Concern -- Show Our Strength</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a &quot;phone tree&quot; or &quot;e-mail
        tree&quot; (for those with access to e-mail) to mobilize members
        to respond to upcoming legislation. First, provide a
        complete list of AMI affiliate names to your members,
        indicating which five names on the list each member has been
        assigned. Identify and call/write the five people who
        will make the first round of <i>Brain Alerts</i>. Each of
        those five individuals will call or write the five names
        they are responsible for (as per the list), and so on. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Each person should encourage members to call or e-mail
        their legislators and encourage them to support brain
        disorder issues. (Make sure to announce that you live in
        the legislator&#146;s district and are a supporter.)
        Everyone should also provide necessary message points and
        legislative information. These <i>Alerts</i> should
        continue until all AMI members have been contacted. Make sure
        that all critical legislators have been reached; if
        members do not reside in an important district, assign
        someone to cover that area&#146;s representatives.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Lead a <i>Brain Alert</i> letter-writing campaign using
        the strategy above. Each caller should encourage members
        to write their legislators. Try to avoid sample letters,
        which are not as effective as original correspondence.
        For a new twist on this technique, include photos of
        family members with brain disorders in your letters to
        impress upon legislators that this issue has an important
        human element.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Provide legislators with fact sheets on the current
        science and treatment of brain disorders, the cost
        comparison between treating brain disorders and treating
        other medical illnesses, and ways this information might
        help impact the health insurance coverage debate. You
        should also provide copies of recent magazine and
        newspaper articles on brain disorders (e.g., <i>Time</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>).<br>
        </li>
    <li>Call the Secretary of your State Senate or the Clerk of
        your House of Representatives to find out about upcoming
        committee and subcommittee hearings on health insurance
        coverage. Contact the appropriate committees, and arrange
        to provide experts (e.g., celebrities, family members, consumers,
        psychiatrists) to testify.<br>
        </li>
    <li>Produce bumper stickers with the phrase &quot;I have a
        brain disorder, and I vote&quot; or &quot;I have (name brain
        disorder), and I vote,&quot; and distribute to your
        community.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Media Outreach -- Get the Story Straight</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Identify effective spokespeople -- <i>Media Gurus</i> --
        to contact media and respond to parity and anti-discrimination
        debate or legislation. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Use the tools discussed in the Media Outreach Tools
        section (e.g., op-eds, letters to the editor, news
        coverage, feature coverage) to deliver your messages to
        legislators, who rely on print media for much of their
        daily information.<br>
        </li>
    <li>Identify legislators who have a family member with a
        brain disorder; ask if they would be willing to conduct
        an interview with local media about their personal
        experiences.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<i><u>Free Issue Advertising -- Open Your Mind PSA
Campaign</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Mail or deliver slicks of the enclosed print public
        service announcements (PSAs) with a cover letter to the
        advertising directors at local newspapers. These ads can
        help educate legislators and the public about brain
        disorders. (Note that PSAs cannot advocate for specific
        legislative action.)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Work with your local television stations to add a local
        tag (with your phone number) to NAMI&#146;s television
        PSAs. Meet with the public service or community relations
        director at local television stations, and ask for a
        commitment to run the spots, which can help educate policymakers
        about the issues.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proven AMI Strategies</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The New York State AMI has created a booklet of
        step-by-step instructions for running a non-partisan
        voter registration site, including whom to contact in
        your area for appropriate forms, what records should be
        kept and how best to do it, questions most frequently
        asked by voters, and how a voting machine works. These
        booklets are free through AMI-NYS by contacting
        1-800-950-FACT.<br>
        </li>
    <li>Two members of the Wisconsin AMI legislative committee
        &quot;adopted&quot; a state senator, who has a daughter
        with schizophrenia. AMI made several visits to acquaint
        the legislator with brain disorder information and
        successfully encouraged her to sponsor a parity bill.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>AMI of Virginia arranged for a local psychiatrist to make
        a brief presentation to the Virginia General
        Assembly&#146;s House Appropriations Subcommittee on
        Health and Human Resources regarding the
        cost-effectiveness and efficacy of the new generation of
        medications.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The Wisconsin AMI sends its 2,000 members routine
        &quot;alerts,&quot; which provide information about current
        legislation and urge members to contact legislators.
        These &quot;alerts&quot; also feature talking points for
        telephone conversations. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The Oklahoma AMI and other affiliates across the country
        use phone trees to effectively mobilize their members to
        contact legislators about pending legislation.</li>
</ul>

<p>This Civic and Business Outreach Guide has been developed to
provide you with ideas and examples of ways to educate and enlist
the help of civic groups and businesses. These audiences are
important to reach because they can help educate policymakers,
network with other business leaders, shape health insurance
coverage, and demonstrate broad-based support for equal treatment
of people with brain disorders. In addition, these audiences can
offer financial support to your AMI affiliate. </p>

<p>Inside you will find: (1) science and treatment messages; (2)
ideas on how to start your outreach efforts; and (3) science and
treatment outreach tactics. While we have included some
innovative AMI affiliate strategies as examples, we also
encourage you to be creative and develop your own outreach initiatives.</p>

<p><b>Messages</b></p>

<p>Civic and business outreach is divided into two categories:
business executives and civic organizations/voluntary groups like
the Rotary Club, YMCA, and the American Red Cross. Specific messages
for reaching these audiences include:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders works.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The costs of treating brain disorders are comparable to
        the costs of treating many other physical illnesses.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Your business/organization can play a major role in
        helping people with brain disorders lead healthy,
        productive lives.</li>
</ul>

<p>A message chart with supporting facts for each message is
provided in the Media Outreach Tools folder for your use.</p>

<p><b>Getting Started</b></p>

<p><i>Develop a Plan.</i> Before you begin your outreach, develop
a plan listing your civic/business goals and objectives, target
audiences, proposed activities, and an estimated timeline.
(Please see attached sample plan.)</p>

<p><i>Form a Civic and Business Committee</i>. Appoint two or
more people to form a committee responsible for outreach. Look
for people who are articulate and who have experience dealing
with the civic and business communities.</p>

<p>There are a number of ways to generate support for brain
disorder issues among these communities.</p>

<p><i>Get to Know Your Audiences</i>. Do your homework. Which
companies, civic groups, and voluntary organizations are the most
worthwhile to target? Which are most influential in your
community? Among policymakers? What are companies&#146; track
records on providing insurance for brain disorders and protection
against discrimination? Which business executives in each company
are most important to reach, and where is the best place to reach
them -- at work or at civic group meetings? Do your members or
their friends have contacts with any of these audiences? This
information can help you conduct more focused and successful
outreach.</p>

<p><i>Update Your List of Community Resources</i>. Make sure you
have current listings of local AMI support meetings, mental
health providers, and other resources in your area before meeting
with business leaders. If they ask where they can refer employees
for help, you want to be well-informed.</p>

<p><i>Evaluate Civic and Business Cooperation. </i>Find out which
consumer groups carry the most credibility in your community.
Remember to think outside of your natural brain disorder allies.
Reach out to other broad-based partners, such as AARP, YWCA, and
American Red Cross. Work with your local partners to keep a
record of business policies supportive of brain disorders. Also
keep a running tally of business donations and participation in
AMI activities. Identify the best channels and messengers to
reach these audiences -- one-on-one or group meetings; trade
publications; coverage in business press.</p>

<p><b>Civic and Business Outreach Tips</b></p>

<p><i><u>Brainstorming/Developing Your Network</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Hold brainstorming sessions with your members to generate
        a list of business contacts and potential business
        supporters. (Please see the attached sample brainstorming
        questions.) These business people are potential partners
        as you expand the reach of science and treatment messages
        -- they can help mobilize peers and act as positive role
        models.
        </li>
    <li>Hold a brainstorming session with your members to
        generate a list of businesses that have less than
        favorable records on brain disorders and need education
        about science and treatment. (Attached are sample
        brainstorming questions.)
        </li>
    <li>Offer to join the speakers&#146; bureau for United Way or
        Combined Health Appeal (National Voluntary Health
        Agencies Campaign), if you receive funding from these
        sources, in order to have greater access to businesses.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Research</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Research workplace policies on brain disorders. Find out
        about such issues as confidentiality, health insurance
        coverage, and leave policies. Find out if companies fully
        inform employees about these policies. There are several
        possible methods for collecting this information: contact the
        company&#146;s human resources department, and obtain any
        public information; speak with an employee(s) of the
        company; or ask policy-related questions while meeting
        with business executives. (Please see the attached sample
        business questions for ideas.)
        </li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Meetings/Workshops</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Use your personal contacts to secure meetings with
        business people. Encourage them to become AMI board
        members. As board members, they can help devise
        strategies for effecting business and legislative policy
        change.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Visit business leaders and civic groups. The enclosed
        talking points can help you conduct briefings to business
        executives, either one-on-one in the workplace or at
        Rotary Club or other civic group events. Brief the
        audience on the latest science of brain disorders and the cost-effectiveness
        of treatment. Stimulate discussion about workplace issues
        related to brain disorders, such as confidentiality,
        health insurance coverage, and leave policies. Share your own
        workplace experiences.
        </li>
    <li>Conduct briefings with voluntary organizations.
        Familiarize these groups with the issues that have an
        impact on their members. For instance, meet with
        representatives of the local AARP chapter, and explain
        why brain disorders, and health insurance coverage of
        these disorders, are relevant concerns for senior
        citizens. Mobilize them to take action to affect policy
        surrounding these issues.
        </li>
    <li>Conduct one-on-one meetings with local insurance company
        executives, using Kit materials to brief them on the
        latest science and treatment advances, data comparing
        costs of treating brain disorders vs. other medical
        illnesses, and treatment success rates. 
        </li>
    <li>Contact business executives and human resource staff you
        know, and offer to conduct an employee inservice training
        on brain disorders and the services your affiliate can
        offer. Also encourage them to provide information about
        brain disorders and your AMI affiliate phone number to
        employees through newsletters, flyers, or e-mail. 
        </li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Within the Workplace</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Place the print advertisements from the Media Tools
        Outreach section in newsletters at your place of
        employment.
        </li>
    <li>Use company newsletters to highlight businesses with
        solid records of supportive mental health policies.
        </li>
    <li>Work with business executives to set up AMI groups within
        local companies. Contact company EAPs to offer this
        service. These AMIs can give support to employees with
        brain disorders and offer information about joining AMI.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><u>Media Outreach</u></i></p>

<ul>
    <li>Conduct outreach to business media, using some of the
        enclosed media tools, to encourage coverage of the
        business angle of brain disorders.
        </li>
    <li>Issue a press release or plan a media briefing to
        highlight business role models in your community. Target
        business media.
        </li>
    <li>If an employee faces discrimination in a particular
        workplace, use the enclosed media tools (e.g., op-ed) to
        publicize this situation.
        </li>
    <li>If organizations, particularly business and insurance,
        take a policy stand against parity, try to place the Kit
        op-ed in your local newspaper.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Proven AMI Strategies</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>AMI of Greater Milwaukee has many civic and business
        leaders on its board. These board members helped AMI
        network with organizations outside the traditional mental
        health community.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>AMI of Waukesha, WI, enlists businesses to support its
        annual chili cook-off, which last year raised over $5,000
        and helped raise the community&#146;s awareness about
        brain disorder issues.
        </li>
    <li>Many members of AMI-Racine County, WI, are employed by
        the Johnson Corporation, manufacturers of Johnson&#146;s
        Wax. Because employees have talked openly about their
        families&#146; brain disorders, the company has been a
        strong supporter of local and state AMIs.</li>

<p><i>Please use these talking points as a guide in presenting

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>In a given year, five million American adults, or
        approximately four percent of the work force, suffer from
        an acute episode of one of the following brain disorders:
        schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
        disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In the last decade, significant scientific advances have
        provided the first real hope for people with brain
        disorders. Pioneering research has found a biological
        basis for brain disorders and treatments that work,
        helping people live healthy, productive lives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In 1990, the indirect cost to society of brain disorders
        in the U.S. was conservatively estimated at $75 billion.
        This cost includes lost productivity and earnings due to
        illness, as well as lost earnings due to premature death.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Mental Illnesses are Brain Disorders</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>It&#146;s scientifically clear that brain disorders are
        not caused by bad character, poor child-rearing, or an
        individual&#146;s behavior. And it&#146;s morally
        repugnant to &quot;blame&quot; people for being affected
        by brain disorders. </li>
    <li>Altered brain chemistry, structure, and functioning, as
        well as genes, are among the causes of brain disorders.
        For example, imbalances in the chemicals serotonin,
        dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors have
        been linked to brain disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Advanced
        imaging technology and other methods have pinpointed structural differences
        in the brains of individuals with brain disorders. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Treatment for Brain Disorders Works</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders have physiological indicators, which
        allow them to be diagnosed and treated as effectively as
        other physical conditions. </li>
    <li>According to the National Institute of Mental Health, the
        current success rates for treating severe forms of brain
        disorders with medications and other therapies are as
        follows: schizophrenia, 60 percent treatment success
        rate; panic disorder, 70 percent to 90 percent; OCD, 75
        percent; bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness), 80
        percent to 90 percent; and major depression, 70 percent
        to 80 percent.</li>
    <li>By comparison, the overall success rate of some commonly
        used treatments for cardiovascular disease is only 45 to
        50 percent. </li>
    <li>A new generation of medications recently approved and
        under development makes the treatment of brain disorders
        even more effective by targeting problem areas in the
        brain.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The Cost of Treating Brain Disorders is Comparable To or
Less Than the Cost of Treating Many Other Physical Illnesses </b></p>

<ul>
    <li>In 1990, the annual cost of treating a person with severe
        diabetes was $7,725, vs. $7,158 for treating a person
        with schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup> </li>
    <li>The total costs (direct and indirect) of cardiovascular
        disease in 1990 were estimated to be $160 billion, in
        contrast to $148 billion for the brain disorders
        schizophrenia, panic disorder, OCD, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression.<sup>4</sup></li>
    <li>In 1994, one managed care company in Texas -- a state
        where parity legislation exists for state employees --
        had 12,233 claimants for cardiovascular disease and 4,617
        claimants for schizophrenia. The average cost for
        treating people with cardiovascular disease was $2,496, compared
        to $1,424 for people with schizophrenia.<sup>9 </sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b>Americans with Brain Disorders Face Serious Discrimination</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Americans with brain disorders currently face serious
        discrimination, which exacts a significant human and
        financial toll both in the workplace and our communities.</li>
    <li><b>&nbsp;</b>Individuals with brain disorders often
        cannot obtain adequate health insurance coverage. Many insurance
        companies exercise the &quot;pre-existing condition&quot;
        clause, barring people who may have had as few as two
        counseling sessions from obtaining coverage. </li>
    <li>Research indicates that, if you have health insurance, 90
        percent of insurance companies offer lesser benefits for
        brain disorders than for other physical conditions.
        Typically, hospitalization is unlimited for other
        physical disorders, while it is limited to 30 to 60 days
        for a brain disorder. In terms of outpatient treatment,
        visits are unlimited for other physical conditions, while
        visits for brain disorders are often limited to 20 times
        per year.<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Studies show that co-payments are also inequitable --
        usually up to 20 percent for other physical illnesses vs.
        40 or 50 percent for brain disorders.<sup>4</sup> Other
        physical illnesses usually have lifetime maximum benefits
        of $1 million; the maximum lifetime benefits for brain
        disorders are usually $20,000, which barely cover the
        cost of a single hospitalization. Individuals who
        experience first episodes of brain disorders during
        adolescence could easily spend their lifetime benefits before
        reaching adulthood.</li>
    <li>This discrimination and increased financial burden often
        prevent people with brain disorders from getting the
        treatment they need, even though this treatment is often
        more effective than treatment for other medical illnesses. Discrimination
        also results in dumping people into the public sector,
        paid for by taxpayers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Providing Health Insurance Coverage for Brain Disorders is
Affordable </b></p>

<ul>
    <li>According to some estimates, if all adults received
        access to equal coverage for brain disorders (parity),
        the employer-paid premiums would only increase by 1.5
        percent each month, or approximately $2 per month per
        employee, or less.<sup>4</sup></li>
    <li>Many companies that self-insure have seen the economic
        benefits for years. These businesses include Digital,
        Federal Express, and IBM. </li>
    <li>In states with parity for brain disorders, the costs have
        been minimal. In the Texas state employee parity program,
        the total cost for treating employees and their families
        for brain disorders was $2.47 per person per month (1994/5).<sup>9</sup> </li>
    <li>In Rhode Island, the increased premium costs were just 30
        cents per person each month.<sup>9 </sup></li>
    <li>If only 80 percent of people with brain disorders sought
        treatment, the overall costs to society would be reduced
        by $2.2 billion. Premature deaths would be averted,
        restoring lost lifetime earnings to the economy. There
        would also be a ten percent reduction of general medical
        care for people with brain disorders.<sup>4</sup><b>&nbsp;</b></li>

<ul>
    <li>Rachel, 35, has experienced schizophrenia for ten years
        and has even attempted suicide. After two years of

        continually check and recheck figures, spending a week or
        more on a task. Treatment quickly helped him control his
        actions and dramatically increase his productivity.</li>
    <li>Richard, a 45 year-old senior vice president at a major
        corporation, reports his life at home and at work has
        improved since he began taking medication for panic
        disorder. Almost immediately after beginning the
        medication, he recovered from the severe panic attacks
        that used to leave him paralyzed at home, unable to go to
        work.&nbsp;</li>

<p><i>Use this document to prepare yourself and your AMI members
for potential questions about the science and treatment of brain
disorders.</i></p>

<p><b><u>General</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>What are brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders are severe mental illnesses such as
        schizophrenia, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive
        disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression. They are biologically based
        physical disorders that can be chronic and disabling, often
        lasting throughout a person&#146;s adult life. Thanks to
        scientific advances, brain disorders can usually be
        diagnosed and effectively treated.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Can brain disorders be prevented?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders cannot be prevented, but experience shows
        that effective treatment lessens the severity of brain
        disorders and prevents them from becoming even more
        debilitating.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Prevalence</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>How many people suffer from brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders affect a much smaller percentage of the
        population than many other physical illnesses. In any
        given year, 2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or five
        million Americans, suffer from a severe form of a brain disorder,
        while 18 percent (or 32 million) are affected by heart disease.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>At what age do brain disorders strike?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain disorders commonly strike during late adolescence
        and early adulthood, although they can also begin in
        childhood or in late adulthood. They can be chronic and
        affect some people throughout their adult lives.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Causes</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>What are the causes of brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Brain chemistry, structure, and functioning, as well as
        genes, have been identified as key and necessary
        components for developing brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Scientists have identified the brain chemicals serotonin,
        dopamine, and norepinephrine and their receptors, which
        control much of our mental and physical activities.
        Research has found imbalances in these chemicals in people
        with disorders such as schizophrenia and depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The brains of people with brain disorders are
        structurally different than the brains of healthy individuals.
        Through advanced imaging technology, scientists have been
        able to take &quot;pictures&quot; that show structural differences in
        the brains of individuals with brain disorders.
        Scientists have also detected different functioning in
        regions of the cortex and other areas of the brain in individuals
        with brain disorders.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Recent studies suggest genetic links for some brain
        disorders. Scientists are currently working to pinpoint
        the specific genes responsible for these disorders.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Aren&#146;t mental illnesses a sign of weakness and
instability? </i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Despite age-old myths and misinformation, severe
        &quot;mental illnesses&quot; are not caused by bad character,
        poor child-rearing, or an individual&#146;s behavior. A
        severe mental illness is a brain disorder which, like the brain disorders
        Parkinson&#146;s disease, Alzheimer&#146;s disease, and
        epilepsy, are biologically based physical disorders. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>It is important for all Americans to understand that
        brain disorders have physiological indicators, and that
        they can usually be diagnosed and treated as effectively
        as many other medical conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Are brain disorders inherited?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Recent studies suggest genetic links for some brain
        disorders. For example, an average child has a one
        percent chance of experiencing schizophrenia in his or
        her lifetime. However, the child of one parent with schizophrenia
        faces a 10 percent chance, while the child of two parents with schizophrenia
        faces a 50 percent chance. Scientists are currently working
        to pinpoint the specific genes responsible for these disorders.<sup>12</sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Treatment</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>Are brain disorders treatable?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Yes. Like other medical problems, there are many
        treatments that are available to help people with brain
        disorders live healthy, productive lives.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>According to the National Institute of Mental Health,
        medications and other therapies improve the symptoms of
        severe forms of brain disorders for: 60 percent of people
        with schizophrenia; 70 percent to 90 percent of people with
        panic disorder; 75 percent of people with OCD; 80 percent to
        90 percent of people with bipolar disorder
        (manic-depressive illness); and 70 percent to 80 percent
        of people with major depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>These success rates are far better than those of other
        medical conditions. For example, heart disease has just a
        45 to 50 percent treatment success rate.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In addition, the new generation of medications under
        development can better target the cause of a particular
        brain disorder. This increased precision reduces the
        unintended side effects associated with many older treatments.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Are there any new advances in treatment of brain
disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>There are a number of exciting new advances in
        medications. New medications are designed to act with
        greater precision, isolating one particular group of
        brain chemicals. This precision would vastly reduce unintended
        side effects, including muscular tremors, caused by some older treatments.<sup>19</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>The anticonvulsant valproate (Depakote) was approved by
        the FDA for bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness)
        in 1995. It has been found effective for different kinds
        of bipolar disorder and is often combined with lithium
        for maximum effect.<sup>32</sup> Many other medications
        are currently being tested for their effectiveness in
        treating bipolar disorder. Some of the most promising
        medications are calcium channel blockers, which appear to successfully
        treat individuals unresponsive to existing medication
        therapy.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Sertindole (Serlect) and olanzapine (Zyprexa) may win FDA
        approval by year end for treatment of schizophrenia.
        These medications would be the first major new class of
        schizophrenia medications in over 40 years.<sup>19</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>NGD 91-1 is in the early stage of clinical trials for
        panic disorder. The medication is designed to treat
        symptoms of panic disorder without sedating people.<sup>19</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Antidepressants sertraline (Zoloft) and paroxetine
        (Paxil) are now being reviewed by the FDA for treatment
        of OCD.<sup>30</sup> Antidepressant medications still to
        be studied for treating OCD are venlafaxine (Effexor) and nefazodone
        (Serzone).<sup>27</sup> These medications may have fewer
        side effects, such as tremor and sedation, which are
        associated with older antidepressants.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Are brain disorders linked to the increasing rate of
suicide?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>If left untreated, brain disorders such as depression and
        schizophrenia can become extremely debilitating and can
        even lead to suicide. For example, 15 percent of people
        with major depression and 10 to 15 percent of people with
        schizophrenia commit suicide.<sup>15</sup> This is one reason
        why it is so important that people suffering from brain
        disorders get the treatment they need.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Costs</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>Does insurance cover treatment of brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Studies indicate that, if you have health insurance, 90
        percent of insurance companies offer lesser benefits for
        brain disorders than for other physical conditions.
        Typically, hospitalization is unlimited for other
        physical disorders, while it is limited to 30 to 60 days
        for a brain disorder. In terms of outpatient treatment,
        visits are unlimited for other physical conditions, while
        visits for brain disorders are often limited to 20 times
        per year.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>Research shows that co-payments are also inequitable --
        usually up to 20 percent for other physical illnesses vs.
        40 or 50 percent for brain disorders.<sup>4</sup> Many
        other physical illnesses usually have lifetime maximum benefits
        of $1 million; the maximum lifetime benefits for brain disorders are
        usually $20,000, which barely cover the cost of a single hospitalization. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>This discrimination and increased financial burden often
        prevent people with brain disorders from getting the
        treatment they need, even though this treatment is often
        more effective than treatment for other medical illnesses. Discrimination
        also results in dumping people into the public sector,
        paid for by taxpayers.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What do brain disorder medications cost?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost of medications to treat brain disorders is
        comparable to the cost of medications needed to treat
        other physical illnesses.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Isn&#146;t it expensive for insurance to cover the cost
of treating brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost of covering treatment for people with brain
        disorders is comparable to the cost of covering treatment
        for people with many other physical disorders. Studies
        indicate that, if all adults had access to health insurance
        coverage for brain disorders equal to other physical disorders (parity),
        the employer-paid premiums would only increase by 1.5
        percent each month, or approximately $2 per month per
        employee.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>In states with health insurance parity for brain
        disorders, the added costs to employers have been minimal.
        In Texas, the additional cost for treating state
        employees and their families for brain disorders was
        $2.47 per person per month (1994/5). In Rhode Island, the
        increased premium cost for covered individuals was only
        30 cents per person each month.<sup>9</sup> These real-life experiences
        in several states demonstrate that providing equal coverage
        makes good economic sense. <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What are the costs of treating brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>The cost of treating a brain disorder is comparable to
        the cost of treating many other medical illnesses.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>For example, the average total direct cost in 1990 for
        treating a person with severe diabetes was $7,725,
        compared with $7,158 for treating a person with
        schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In Texas in 1994, the total cost of treating state
        employees and their family members with brain disorders
        was one-fifth the cost of treating cardiovascular
        disease.<sup>9</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>In 1994, one managed care company in Texas -- a state
        where parity legislation exists for state employees --
        had 12,233 claimants for cardiovascular disease and 4,617
        claimants for schizophrenia. The average cost for
        treating people with cardiovascular disease was $2,496, compared
        to $1,424 for people with schizophrenia.<sup>9<br>
        </sup></li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>What are the costs of NOT treating brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>There are many indirect costs to society resulting from
        brain disorders, including lost productivity, increased
        use of general medical services, crime/incarceration, and
        use of social welfare benefits. <br>
        </li>
    <li>In 1990, the indirect cost to society of brain disorders
        in the U.S. was conservatively estimated at $75 billion.
        This cost includes lost productivity and earnings due to
        illness, as well as lost earnings due to premature death.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>One study indicated that the cost (direct and indirect)
        of treating brain disorders such as schizophrenia, panic
        disorder, OCD, bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness), and major depression was $148 billion in 1990,
        vs. $160 billion for heart disease.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>However, if only 80 percent of people with brain
        disorders received treatment, the overall costs to
        society would be reduced by $2.2 billion.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Won&#146;t costs skyrocket as more and more people seek
treatment? </i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Actually, costs could be reduced significantly if more
        people with brain disorders sought treatment. If only 80
        percent of the people with brain disorders were treated,
        the overall costs to society would be reduced by $2.2.
        billion per year.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>Specifically, two-thirds of premature deaths
        (approximately 128,000) would be averted, restoring $5.2
        billion in lost lifetime earnings to the economy.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There would be a 10 percent reduction in use of general
        medical care by people with brain disorders. This would
        reduce costs by $1.2 billion per year.<sup>4</sup></li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Costs associated with morbidity, the criminal justice
        system, social welfare, and incarceration would also be
        reduced if only 80 percent of individuals with brain
        disorders received treatment.<sup>4</sup><font size="3"> </font></li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Comparisons to Other Illnesses</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>How effective are brain disorder treatments compared to
treatments for other illnesses?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Treatment of brain disorders is more effective than
        treatment for many other medical conditions. According to
        the National Institute of Mental Health, medications and
        other therapies improve the symptoms of severe forms of
        brain disorders for: 60 percent of people with
        schizophrenia; 70 percent to 90 percent of people with
        panic disorder; 75 percent of people with OCD; 80 percent
        to 90 percent of people with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive
        illness); and 70 percent to 80 percent of people with major
        depression.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>By comparison, heart disease has just a 45 to 50 percent
        treatment success rate.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Policy</u></b></p>

<p><b><i>Why is it important for policymakers to learn about
brain disorder issues?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Policymakers need to understand the latest information
        about the science and treatment of brain disorders
        because millions of Americans with disorders currently
        face serious discrimination and lack of health insurance
        coverage, which exact a significant human and financial
        toll. &nbsp;</li>
    <li>Individuals with brain disorders often cannot obtain
        adequate health insurance coverage. Many insurance
        companies exercise the &quot;pre-existing condition&quot;
        clause, barring people who may have had as few as two counseling
        sessions from obtaining coverage. <br>
        </li>
    <li>Research indicates that, if you have health insurance, 90
        percent of insurance companies offer lesser benefits for
        brain disorders than for other physical conditions.
        Typically, hospitalization is unlimited for other physical
        disorders, while it is limited to 30 to 60 days for a
        brain disorder. In terms of outpatient treatment, visits
        are unlimited for other physical conditions, while visits for
        brain disorders are often limited to 20 times per year.<sup>4</sup> <br>
        </li>
    <li>Studies show that co-payments are also inequitable --
        usually up to 20 percent for other physical illnesses vs.
        40 or 50 percent for brain disorders.<sup>4</sup> Other
        physical illnesses usually have lifetime maximum benefits
        of $1 million; the maximum lifetime benefits for brain
        disorders are usually $20,000, which barely cover the
        cost of a single hospitalization. </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>This discrimination and increased financial burden often
        prevent people with brain disorders from getting the
        treatment they need, even though this treatment is often
        more effective than treatment for other medical illnesses. Discrimination
        also results in dumping people into the public sector,

<p><b><i>What can policymakers do to improve treatment of people
with brain disorders?</i></b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Policymakers can pass legislation supporting health
        insurance parity -- equal coverage for brain and other
        physical disorders. They can help ensure that brain
        disorders and other medical illnesses are treated equally in
        any state or federal health care legislation. They can
        support increases (or resist decreases) in mental health
        budgets and encourage and fund additional research.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Scope of the Problem</b></p>

<p>A small and definable number of Americans suffers from severe
mental illnesses, or brain disorders. In any given year, about
2.8 percent of adults in the U.S., or five million Americans,
have brain disorders, including schizophrenia, panic disorder,
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder
(manic-depressive illness), and major depression. </p>

<p>Fortunately, although there are no cures, there are impressive
success rates for treating symptoms of severe forms of brain
disorders. Schizophrenia has a 60 percent treatment success rate;
panic disorder has a 70 percent to 90 percent treatment success
rate; OCD has a 75 percent treatment success rate; bipolar
disorder (manic-depressive illness) has an 80 percent to 90
percent treatment success rate; and major depression has a 70
percent to 80 percent treatment success rate.</p>

<p><b>Prevalence of Brain Disorders vs. Other Medical Illnesses </b></p>

<p>Brain disorders affect a much smaller proportion of the
population than do many other physical illnesses. For example,
cardiovascular disease affects 18 percent of the population --
nearly six times as many Americans as those who have brain
disorders.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p><b>Costs of Treating Brain Disorders</b> <b>Are Comparable to
Many Other Medical Illnesses </b></p>

<p>The total cost of treating cardiovascular disease was $160
billion, while the total cost of treating five brain disorders
was $148 billion in 1990. (These costs include both direct
treatment costs and indirect costs, such as lost productivity and
excess morbidity and mortality).<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>The cost of treating each person with a brain disorder is
comparable to the cost of treating many other medical conditions.
For example, the cost in 1990 of treating a person with severe
diabetes was $7,725 annually, vs. $7,158 for treating a person
with schizophrenia.<sup>4</sup> </p>

<p>In Texas, a state where parity health insurance exists for
state employees, the total cost of treating state employees and
their families with brain disorders was one-fifth ($6.5 million)
the cost of treating cardiovascular diseases ($30.5 million). In
1994, 12,233 people were treated for cardiovascular disease at an
average cost of $2,496, vs. 4,617 individuals who were treated
for brain disorders at an average cost of $1,424.<sup>9</sup> </p>

<p><b>As an Increasing Number of People Get Treatment, Overall
Costs to Society Will Decrease </b></p>

<p>Studies indicate that if only 80 percent of the people with
brain disorders sought treatment, the overall costs to society
would be reduced by $2.2. billion.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Specifically, two-thirds of premature deaths
        (approximately 128,000) would be averted, restoring $5.2
        billion in lost lifetime earnings to the economy.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>There would be a ten percent reduction in use of general
        medical care by people with brain disorders. This would
        reduce costs by $1.2 billion.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Costs associated with morbidity, the criminal justice
        system, social welfare, and incarceration would also be
        reduced if only 80 percent of individuals with brain
        disorders received appropriate, adequate treatment.<sup>4</sup> </li>
</ul>

<table cellpadding=10 cellspacing=10 width=100%>
<tr><td valign=top width=50%><h3><font color="#FF0000">History</font> </h3>
<p>Each year since 1983, the first full week in October 
has been observed as Mental Illness Awareness 
Week (MIAW). It was originally established by 
Congressional Resolution. To obtain this 
legislation, organizations urge their senators and 
representatives, by phone and letter, to co-sponsor 
MIAW resolutions. The work is hard and 
continuous. </p>
<p>But it is only part of the work. During the Week, 
literally tens of thousands of dedicated mental health 
care professionals, treatment facilities, affiliates of 
the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), 
chapters of the National Depressive and 
Manic-Depressive Association, members of the 
American Psychiatric Association, affiliates of the 
National Mental Health Association, local Mental 
Health Associations, civic groups, officials, 
religious organizations, and concerned citizens join 
in a true grassroots campaign to bring information, 
hope and treatment to millions. They urge state and 
local legislators to pass their own MIAW 
recognitions and they hold mental health fairs and 
candlelight vigils, produce special television 
programs, screen public education films and give 
countless speeches and presentations before 
classrooms, PTAs, local government and civic 
leaders and groups. </p>
<p>What began as an effort to increase Congressional 
awareness has become a nationwide week long 
observance. Judging by the mounting interest during 
each year, MIAW is an effort that will continue.</p>
</td><td valign=top width=50%><h3><font color="#FF0000">Events: October 6 - 12, 1996</font> </h3>
<p>This year&#146;s Mental Illness Awareness Week&#146;s 
theme is &quot;Open Your Mind: Mental Illnesses Are 
Brain Disorders.&quot; The theme emphasizes mental 
illnesses are physical illnesses and highlights the 
biology of brain disorders in order to reduce the 
stigma and discrimination facing people with mental 
illnesses. The artwork and slogan reflect NAMI&#146;s 
Campaign to End Discrimination. </p>
<p>NAMI members across the country will be 
organizing rallys, candlelight vigils, educational 
forums, and awareness events. Each affiliate has 
received a NAMI Mental Illness Awareness Week 
kit. Please contact your local affiliate/state AMI to 
become involved in Mental Illness Awareness 
Week activities. </p>
<p>Mental Illness Awareness Week has <em><strong>suggested</strong></em> 
topics for each day and a <a href="/awareweek/agenda.htm">more detailed agenda</a>: </p>

<p align=left><font color="#000000">Major depression, or unipolar depression, is manifested by a combination of symptoms that 
interfere with the ability to work, sleep, eat and enjoy once pleasurable activities. It is more 
than a passing case of the &quot;blues.&quot; A person with depression cannot just &quot;pull themselves 
together.&quot;</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Approximately 50 to 60 percent of individuals with major depression can be expected to 
experience a second episode. Individuals who have had two episodes have a 70 percent 
chance of having a third episode, and individuals who have had three episodes have a 90 
percent chance of having a fourth episode.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">In any given year, more than 17 million American adults have some form of an affective 
disorder, and roughly 5 percent of Americans suffer from major depression.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Women are twice as likely as men to experience major depression; one in four women, as 
opposed to one in eight men, are likely to experience a mood disorder at some point in their 
lives.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">It takes an average of eight years to get a proper diagnosis of major depression.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Depression is more widespread than coronary heart disease (7 million), cancer (6 million), 
and AIDS (200,000).</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Signs and Symptoms of Major Depression:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Persistent sad or &quot;empty&quot; moods</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism</font></p>

<A NAME = "effex"><H2>EFFEXOR</H2></A>
<P>
What is Effexor?
<P>
Effexor (generic: venlafaxine) is the newest medication available
to treat depression.  Structurally different from any other
antidepressant, it affects two neurotransmitters (chemical
messengers in the brain) involved in depression: serotonin and
norepinephrine.  Approved for use in the United States at the end
of 1993, its novel chemical action and low incidence of side
effects make it a significant addition to the range of
medications used to treat depression.
<P>
How is Effexor different from other antidepressants?
Effexor is a chemically unique antidepressant medication.  Like
the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and
sertraline (Zoloft), it affects the absorption of serotonin.  In
addition, Effexor acts on the norepinephrine system.  No other
available medication affects both neurotransmitters without
causing the side effects of the older tricyclic antidepressants.
<P>
Are there other advantages of Effexor?
<P>
Effexor is less likely to induce seizures, to have toxic effects
on the heart, and to cause lethal reactions.  
<P>
For what kind of patient would Effexor be appropriate?
<P>
Effexor is recognized as an effective front-line option (i.e.,
first-time medication) for patients who have recently become ill
with depression, whether they are hospitalized or treated on an
outpatient basis.  It can also be useful for patients who have
had longstanding depressive illness and have not responded
adequately to previous treatments.  Almost 40 percent of
so-called refractory patients (those who have not had positive
results from past treatment) have had success with Effexor. 
Patients who have benefitted from other antidepressants but have
had less than complete success may want to discuss switching to
Effexor with their doctors.
<P>
What about side effects?
<P>
Relatively few side effects have been reported with Effexor. 
Those that have been noted are dose-related; that is, side
effects increase as the dose increases.  Very few patients have
had to discontinue the medication because of side effects.  
<P>
The most common minor side effects during clinical trials include
short-term nausea (which can be reduced by taking the medication
with food), sleepiness, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation,
nervousness, sweating, weakness, ejaculation/orgasm problems, 
and loss of appetite. 
<P>
A small percentage (about five percent) of patients, usually
those taking higher doses, will develop elevated blood pressure. 
Therefore, patients taking Effexor should have their blood
pressure checked regularly.  Some agitation has been noticed at
higher dosages. 
<P>
How long does it take to work?
<P>
Like most other medications used for depression, Effexor may take
several weeks before it is fully effective.  It is important to
give the medication sufficient time before judging whether it
will work for a given person.  There is evidence, however, that
Effexor may take effect more quickly than other antidepressants.
<P>
Can Effexor be taken with other medications? 
<P>
Effexor does not interact significantly with many other
medications, including lithium, diazepam (Valium), and cimetidine
(Tagamet, an anti-ulcer medication). 
<P>
However, patients taking cimetidine who have high blood pressure
or liver disease or are elderly should use caution in taking
Effexor because the interaction may be more pronounced when these
disorders are present.
<P>
Effexor definitely should not be taken at same time as the MAOIs
(such as Parnate or Nardil). Interactions with these compounds
could be lethal.  Patients who have been taking an MAOI and
are switching to Effexor must allow sufficient time (usually 14
days) for the MAOI to clear out of the body.  The same time
should be allowed if changing from Effexor to an MAOI.  However,
switching from Effexor to other medications is easy because
Effexor is quickly removed from the body.
<P>
What is the standard dose?  
<P>
The dose range is generally between 75 and 375 mg per day.  The
average effective dose is about 125 to 150 mg per day.  Higher
doses are necessary for sicker patients.  It is recommended that
the total dose be divided into two or three doses per day and
taken with food.  Dosage adjustments for elderly people are not
usually necessary.  
<P>
Will Effexor work for everyone?
<P>
No.  Everyone responds to medications differently.  Effexor will
work well for some people, and not so well for others.  It is
important to give the medication a trial of several weeks and to
be in close communication with your doctor about signs of
effectiveness, side effects, and personal factors affecting one's
response to the medication.

<A NAME = "facts"><H2>FACTS ABOUT PAXIL</H2></A>
<P>
What is Paxil?
<P>
Paxil (paroxetine hydrochloride), a new antidepressant
medication,was introduced into the United States in early 1993.  It
is a member of the SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor)
family(along with Zoloft and Prozac).  These new medications
areeffective in alleviating the symptoms of major depression
without causing some of the harmful side effects caused by the
oldertricyclic antidepressants (TCAs).
<P>
What does Paxil treat?
<P>
Depression is a biologically based disorder, although social
and genetic factors may contribute to the illness.  Depression is
associated with a decreased number of neurotransmitters in the
brain (particularly serotonin and norepinephrine).  These chemical
messengers help regulate several functions and thoughts, including
mood.  Paxil blocks the reabsorption of serotonin and normalizes
the brain's chemical supply.
<P>
What are the advantages of Paxil over other antidepressants?
<P>
Paxil is as effective in relieving depression as TCAs such as
imipramine.  However, Paxil causes fewer adverse cardiovascular
and anticholinergic effects (dry mouth, constipation, blurred
vision, urinary retention) than the older TCAs.  It does not
usually cause drowsiness, low blood pressure, or weight changes. 
Paxil has no active metabolites and leaves one's system 24 hours
after it enters.  SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, which makes
Paxil, states that Paxil is the most selective of the
SSRI antidepressants.  This selectivity causes serotonin levels in
the brain to normalize quickly, relieving depression with
relatively few side effects. 
<P>
Who can benefit from taking Paxil?
<P>
Paxil is equally effective in elderly depressed patients as it is
in younger.  Elderly people may turn to Paxil for relief because
it does not cause significant changes in blood pressure,
unlike Effexor and some other antidepressants.
<P>
Paxil is effective in the treatment of anxiety which
accompanies depression in some people.  Those experiencing lethargy
at the beginning of treatment can also take Paxil with positive
results because Paxil does not impair psychomotor function.
<P>
What is the standard dose of Paxil?
<P>
The usual dose of Paxil is 20 mg taken once daily, usually in the
morning.  Paxil comes in either 20 mg tablets (pink) or 30 mg
tablets (blue).  For the depressed elderly, the recommended
starting dose is 10 mg once daily.  Physicians may change the dose
by 10 mg at a time and the dose should not exceed 50 mg per day
(40 mg in geriatric patients).  There should be a one week
interval between dose adjustments. 
<P>
Can I take Paxil with other medications?
<P>
Paxil should not be used while taking any MAOI (monoamine
oxidase inhibitor) medication.  The interaction between the two
could produce fatal results.  Therefore, there should be a fourteen
day interval between stopping the MAOI and starting Paxil, or vice
versa.
<P>
Patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and those taking
lithium should take Paxil with caution.  Other combinations of
medications require consultation with your doctor.  Alcohol
consumption is best avoided while one is taking Paxil.
<P>
What are the most common side effects of Paxil?
<P>
 For the most part, the side effects of Paxil are mild and brief.
The major side effect of Paxil is nausea, which can be reduced
by taking Paxil with food.  Side effects may include
drowsiness, asthenia (lack of physical strength) tremors,
nervousness, dizziness, insomnia, sweating, ejaculatory delay, and
other male genital dysfunction.  There may be a slight weight loss
associated with Paxil.  Only a small percentage of people have had
to discontinue their use of Paxil because of side effects.  
<P>
Women who become pregnant or who are nursing an infant
should iscuss with their doctors the effects of Paxil.  People
with kidney or liver dysfunction should use Paxil with caution. 
<P>
How soon will I feel better?
<P>
Most people will notice improvements within a week or two, but
it may take up to six weeks for the full therapeutic effect to
be realized.  Depressed mood, concentration problems, and
slowed activity improve in the first week, sleep disturbances
within the second week.  
<P>
How long should I stay on Paxil?
<P>
Paxil should be continued as directed by the prescribing physician. 
Paxil is effective in the treatment of both short-term and
long-term depression, and it can be beneficial in preventing
relapse into depression.  Studies have shown that Paxil is easily
tolerated for up to four years.  It is important to be in close
communication with the prescribing physician, and to promptly
report any unusual or distressing symptoms or side effects.
<P>
Is financial assistance available to those who cannot afford
treatment with Paxil?
<P>
The Paxil Access to Care program allows a physician to arrange
no- cost supplies of Paxil for patients who meet specific
requirements.  To be eligible, a patient must have an annual
household income of less than $25,000, have no medical insurance,
and be ineligible for government (such as Medicaid) or private
programs covering prescriptions.  A physician who believes that the
cost of Paxil would pose a significant hardship on a patient or
cause an inability to take the medication as prescribed can call
1-800-729-4544 to receive a Paxil Access to Care kit.

<A NAME = "helpi"><H2>HELPING CONSUMERS ACCEPT MEDS</H2></A>

<P>
Often stigma, side-effects, denial, and psychosis prevent consumers from accepting the treatments that could help.  These tips may help you, your relative, or your friend accept the help of medications and treatment.
<P>
1.  Start with the ill person's own agenda.  Take seriously what he or she says is right for his or her own life.
<P>
2.  Put treatment in the context of the person's life.  Be concrete about what can be gained by taking medications  ("You will be accepted back in school," or "You'll stop hearing those voices.")
<P>
3.  Involve the consumer as much as possible in decisions about his or her treatment.  Provide information about treatment options and resources that patients can use to solve problems and enhance their lives.
<P>
4.  Be concerned about whether he or she follows through with the agreed-on treatment plans.  Ask specific questions that will open dialogue, not put the person on the defensive.  (Don't ask, "Why didn't you take your meds?"  Ask "How much medication do you have left?")
<P>
5.  Make sure consumers, their families, and involved agencies are informed about the treatment options and plans.  Be sensitive to the agendas and prejudices of all persons and try to work with them.
<P>
6.  Be willing to involve friends, families, landlords, clergy, and others as confidentiality allow and as it fits into the consumer's own goals and agendas.  People in support systems have considerable influence over consumers' decisions.
<P>
7.  Be willing to be tenacious when necessary.  Be flexible about how you can engage consumers.  If they decline meds or treatment, focus on "safe" topics first.
<P>
8.  If warranted, connect medication compliance with continued community involvement.  It may be necessary to link medication use with the needs of the consumer, such as obtaining spending money.
<P>
9.  Accept the fact that some people may refuse treatment--or parts of treatment--despite your efforts.  Offer whatever you can--a walk, a talk, a movie, or lunch.  Consumers may be more willing to comply with treatment when a relationship is well established.
<P>
10.  Plan for and anticipate crises.  Use them to build trust. Follow through with promises to strengthen the therapeutic alliance.

<A NAME = "howne"><H2>HOW NEW MEDICATIONS ARE APPROVED</H2></A>

<P>
The following are the steps taken when new medications are approved for physicians to prescribe to the American public.  The information is from the NARSAD Research Newsletter, summer 1994.
<P>
Preclinical testing - A pharmaceutical company conducts laboratory and animal studies to show biological activity of the compound against the targeted disease, and the compound is evaluated for safety.  These tests take approximately three and one-half years.
<P>
Investigational new drug application (IND) - After completing preclinical testing, the company files and IND with the FDA to begin to test the drug in humans.  The IND becomes effective if the FDA does not disapprove it within 30 days. 
<P>
The IND shows results of previous experiments; how, where, and by whom the new studies will be conducted; the chemical structure of the compound; how it is thought to work in the body; any toxic effects found in the animal studies; and how the compound is manufactured.  In addition, the IND must be reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board where the studies will be conducted, and progress reports on clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA.
<P>
Clinical trials, phase I - These tests take about a year and involve about 20 to 80 normal, healthy volunteers.  The tests study a drug's safety profile, including the safe dosage range.  The studies also determine how a drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted, and the duration of its action.
<P>
Clinical trials, phase II -  In this phase, controlled studies of approximately 100 to 300 volunteer patients (people with the disease) assess the drug's effectiveness.  These studies take about two years.
<P>
Clinical trials, phase III -  This phase lasts about three years and usually involves 1,000 to 3,000 patients in clinics and hospitals.  Physicians monitor patients closely to determine efficacy and to identify adverse reactions.
<P>
New Drug Application (NDA) -  Following the completion of all three phases of clinical trials, the company analyzes all the data and files an NDA with the FDA if the data successfully demonstrate safety and effectiveness.  By law, FDA is allowed six months to review an NDA.   In almost all cases, the period between the first submission of an NDA and final FDA approval exceeds that limit.  The average NDA review time for new molecular entities approved in 1993 was 26.5 months.
<P>
Approval -  Once the FDA approves the NDA, the new medicine becomes available for physicians to prescribe.  For some medications, FDA requires additional studies (phase IV) to evaluate long-term effects.

<A NAME = "proza"><H2>PROZAC</H2></A>

<P>
Commonly Asked Questions About Prozac
<P>
Q1. I've heard a lot about Prozac recently. What is Prozac and
why has it attracted so much attention?
<P>
Al. Prozac is a new antidepressant which has quickly become one
of the most widely-prescribed medications on the market.
<P>
It is used primarily to treat serious depressive disorders (which
cause problems in thinking, concentrating, and decision making;
excessive fatigue; loss of self esteem; inappropriate feelings
of unworthiness and guilt; loss of interest and pleasure in usual
activities, and sleep and appetite disturbances).
<P>
It may also be prescribed for chronic depressive disorder
(dysthymia), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), bulimia
nervosa, and panic/agoraphobia syndrome.
<P>
Q2. Why would my doctor think Prozac was better for me than one
of the older, more established antidepressants?
<P>
A2. Prozac is popular because it is effective in relieving
symptoms of depression with fewer, milder side effects than other
antidepressants. It does not cause dry mouth or weight gain, and
may cause a slight weight loss
<P>
A special diet is not necessary as with other antidepressants
(those known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors, MAOIs, e.g. Nardil
and Parnate). Doctors may feel more comfortable prescribing it
because a substantial overdose is not likely to be fatal.
<P>
Prozac may be especially suitable for elderly patients, because
it is less likely to cause sleepiness, irregular heartbeat, or
low blood pressure, which may lead to a fall in an elderly
patient.
<P>
Side effects that may occur -- primarily anxiety or nervousness,
insomnia or drowsiness, headache, diarrhea, and rash -- subside
in a few weeks in some people.
<P>
Agitation usually subsides in 24-48 hours. Sleep problems may be
alleviated by taking the medication in the morning or before 3:00
pm. If this does not work, a sleep medication may also be
prescribed.
<P>
Smaller numbers of people may find Prozac  inappropriate because
it inhibits orgasm or causes craving for alcohol.
<P>
Prozac has been known to trigger manic episodes in people with a
personal and/or family history of bipolar disorder. This is also
true of other antidepressants.
<P>
Q3. I've heard that Prozac causes people to think about suicide.
Isn't this pretty serious?
<P>
A3. Some people claim that Prozac has caused suicide or violent
behavior. Unfortunately, it's difficult to determine whether
Prozac was actually to blame. Clearly, millions of people are
successfully taking Prozac without this effect.
<P>
As with any medication, psychiatric or other, most people will
experience the desired effect, but a few may have an unusual
reaction.
<P>
Doctors and patients must be in close communication about any
adverse effects. Let Your doctor know if you feel worse on Prozac
or experience any symptoms with which you are uncomfortable.
<P>
If Prozac should be unsuitable for you, there are many other
antidepressants with established track records that can be
tried. Most antidepressants can lead a patient to consider
suicide in the early stages of recovery as the depression lifts
and the patient becomes mobilized.
<P>
Q4. How soon after starting Prozac will I feel better?
<P>
A4. You may notice some improvement within a few days.
particularly improved concentration and increased energy. As with
other antidepressant drugs, it may take three to six weeks for
the full effect to be felt.
<P>
The medication should be tried at the prescribed dose for the
full six weeks before evaluating its effectiveness.
<P>
It's important to remember that Prozac is not a cure-all. It can
relieve symptoms of clinical depression in some people, but not
in all people, and it will not make other life problems go away.
<P>
Q5. Is Prozac expensive?
<P>
A5. Prozac costs more than other antidepressants, averaging $1.00
$2.00 per capsule. The usual dose for depression is one to two
capsules a day (20 mg each). Patients with obsessive compulsive
disorder may need up to four capsules a day for relief of
symptoms.

<p align=left>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that is potentially disabling 
and can persist throughout a person&#146;s life.</p>
<p align=left>A person with OCD becomes trapped in a pattern of repetitive thoughts and behaviors that 
are senseless and distressing, but extremely difficult to overcome.</p>
<p align=left>OCD occurs in a spectrum from mild to severe; but if severe and left untreated, it can destroy 
a person&#146;s capacity to function at work, school or in the home.</p>
<p align=left>OCD can be effectively treated.</p>
<p align=left>Studies indicate that at least one-third of OCD cases in adults began in childhood.</p>
<p align=left>OCD affects more than 2 percent of the population. It is more common than such severe 
mental illnesses as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness, and males and females are 
equally affected.</p>
<p align=left>Some obsessions and compulsions experienced by people with OCD are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left>concerns with contamination</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>overconcern with keeping objects in perfect order</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>images of death or horrible events</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>personally unacceptable religious or sexual thoughts</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>excessive or ritualized washing, cleaning or grooming</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>checking lights or stoves continually</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>counting, arranging, collecting, repeating or examining </p>
</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Bipolar disorder is a combination of excessive &quot;highs&quot; or periods of mania 
followed by dramatic &quot;lows&quot; or plunges into depression. In any given year, 2.2 
million Americans suffer from bipolar disorder.*</li>

<p><em><strong>Tuesday	</strong></em><a href="/awareweek/schizo.htm"><em>Schizophrenia</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>This no-fault, biological brain disorder impairs a person&#146;s ability to think clearly, 
manage his or her emotions, make decisions and relate to others. It is often 
accompanied by delusions and voices that make it impossible for the person to 
distinguish reality from fantasy. There are 2 million Americans suffering from 
schizophrenia in any given year.*</li>

<p><em><strong>Wednesday </strong></em><a href="/research.htm"><em>Research on Brain Disorders</em></a></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Mental illnesses are brain disorders. In fact, 90% of what scientists know about 
the brain has been discovered in the past 10 years. Through CAT scans and MRIs, 
researchers have developed photography illustrating the difference between an 
affected brain and a healthy brain. Research brings us newer medication with less 
side effects, better treatments, and insight into the origin of these disorders.</li>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Obsessions are intrusive, irrational thoughts and unwanted ideas or impulses. 
Compulsions are repetitive rituals a victim feels he or she must do or something 
bad will happen. Sufferers experience &quot;pathological doubt&quot; compounded by 
obsessive, negative thoughts and repetitive rituals. OCD strikes 3.9 million

set his or her broken bones or charges enormous copayments. And yet this is 
precisely the case with mental illness, which is no more the patient's fault 
than arthritis or diabetes or heart disease and may be just as chronically 
disabling. </em></font></p>

different from other forms of illness, a moral failing, a matter of good and evil

that the mentally ill have a chance to live reasonably happy and productive 
lives ...&quot;</em></font></p>

<h3 align=left><font color="#000000">Event Instructions</font></h3>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">BEFORE THE EVENT: PLANNING</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Recruit volunteers from your affiliate as early as possible. Decide if you 
want to work with other AMI affiliates in your area. Invite local 
representatives from national mental health/illness organizations to 
participate in the planning: Depressive and Manic Depressive Association, 
the Psychiatric Society, Community Mental Health Center, Mental Health 
Association. Your AMI group is the catalyst for bringing these groups 
together locally.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Meet with participating AMI members and representatives from other 
organizations to plan the event. Describe the theme for the vigil, paint a 
mental picture of the event, outline basic tasks and responsibilities. Give 
people time to brainstorm and incorporate their ideas into the plans. Decide 
which organizations will be cosponsors of the event. What contribution 
will each organization make: volunteers labor, funds, speakers, publicity, 
copying, etc.? What other community organizations might you want to 
include?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Appoint a chairperson, someone who is enthusiastic about the event, has the 
time, talent and energy to rally the troops and supervise organization of the 
event. This person will be responsible for establishing a budget and 
soliciting donations from the community for supplies, props, etc.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Assign members and volunteers to committees with specific tasks:</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Program, Entertainment &amp; Refreshments, Publicity, Decorations &amp; Signs </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Develop an overall event checklist which incorporates checklists and 
deadlines for all committees.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Send invitations to appropriate members of the community: Patients from 
local hospitals/CMHCs, members of area psychosocial rehabilitation 
clubhouses, area doctors and mental health professionals, city council 
members, state legislators, local police department, jail officials, religious 
groups, etc. Follow up these invitations with phone calls.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Decide what symbols you want to incoporate in the vigil to illustrate 
people living with a mental illness. Possibly a display of art by individuals 
with brain disorders, a photo display of faces of an illness/illnesses, or a 
visual of how many lives are touched by an illness.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p align=left><font color="#000000">COMMITTEES: TASKS AND NOTES</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Program Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Pick a good location ASAP. Select a space of appropriate size for the 
candlelight vigil. A group of 10 will look lost in a space set up for 75. A 
central and attractive location, familiar to the media makes a site desirable. 
Most cities have one or two sites that are especially popular, a town 
square, steps of a government building, at a CMHC or state hospital. In 
some cases, it makes good sense to hold the candlelight vigil at an unusual 
site. But, avoid sites that are too far away from downtown. TV assignment 
editors are unlikely to send a crew on a 2-hour journey for a 45-second 
story. If you need advice about desirable locations, ask the local media or 
call a local PR consultant.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Prepare the space. Check for all physical arrangements you may need, such 
as accessibility, PA system, electrical and telephone outlets, restrooms, etc.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Get permits ASAP. Check all local ordinances and get everything in 
writing. Do you need security? Do you need to appoint volunteer 
marshalls?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Find speakers/leaders. Find a multi-cultural mix of speakers, including 
consumers, siblings, young families, interfaith clergy, etc.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Print programs if desired.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Create a checklist of items needed for the day of the vigil, including a mike 
or bullhorn, phone numbers of key volunteers, permits, printed programs, 
etc. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Distribute flyers to encourage people to bring family photos with them to 
the vigil. Do this far enough in advance so that people have enough time to 
get photos ready, but close enough to the actual day that they won't forget! 
Suggested date for distribution: September 1.</font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Entertainment &amp; Refreshments Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Coordinate music for the pre-program and the finale with the program 
committee. How much time is allotted? Are there consumers who are 
willing to perform?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Check noise ordinances. Do you need electrical outlets for equipment?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Be sure that there is (at least) water available for vigil participants. Can 
you solicit a donation from a local vendor for refreshments? </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Publicity Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Create a checklist of tasks. Develop realistic deadlines and stick to them! 
The candlelight vigil is an easy event to plan and publicize if you give 
yourselves enough time. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Make a complete list of prospective media attending such as print media 
reporters and editors, including photo assignment editors, TV and radio 
assignment editors. Photo editors are important since the vigil is such a 
beautiful visual event. They may assign a photographer to cover it instead 
of a reporter. We've seen dozens of fantastic pictures of last year's vigils 
from around the country.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Give proper advance notification. To distinguish your candlelight vigil 
announcement from a news release, label it &quot;media advisory.&quot; A 
fill-in-the-blanks news release and a sample media advisory are included 
in this section. Mail the release a month in advance and advisories at least 
six working days prior to the event. Call all key outlets the day before the 
event. Remember reporters are people with hearts but are often on 
deadline. Be direct and friendly but also aware that may be juggling several 
priorities and may not be able to cover the event. </font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Don't forget the &quot;daybooks.&quot; In many cities, local bureaus of the Associated 
Press (AP) and/or United Press International (UPI) wire services produce 
daily calendars called daybooks, which are read closely by local 
assignment editors and reporters. Even if they haven't responded to earlier 
notices of the vigil, editors may decide to send a reporter or photographer 
after seeing it run in the daybook. Call your local AP or UPI bureau office 
to learn how to file a notice: How far in advance do you need to send the 
media advisory?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Brief your spokespersons. Reporters will want to interview consumers and 
family members for their personal perspectives. Make sure that everyone 
participating knows the key messages that they are to convey when talking 
to the media: Mental illnesses are brain disorders. They are treatable. Your 
local affiliate of NAMI, and other cosponsoring organizations, can help. 
Make sure to get either the NAMI Helpline phone number (800) 950-NAMI 
or the number of your local affiliate out there; this is a prime opportunity to 
attract new members. Also, determine who should be available to assist the 
spokesperson in responding to detailed questions. </font></p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><em>Decorations &amp; Signs Committee</em></font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Prepare candles with holders to catch melting wax and shield flame from 
wind. If you buy candles from a religious supply store, you may find that 
they carry these holders, too.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Prepare large boards for photo album, artwork, and/or visuals. Special 
instructions attached.</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">If you don't already have one, create banner or sign with name of your

<p align=center><font color="#FF0000">MANIC-DEPRESSIVE ILLNESS</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Manic-depressive illness, also known as bipolar disorder, is a brain disorder involving 
episodes of serious mania and depression. The person&#146;s mood usually swings from overly 
&quot;high&quot; and irritable to sad and hopeless, and then back again, with periods of normal mood 
in-between.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Manic-depressive illness usually begins in adolescence or early adulthood and continues 
throughout life. It is often not recognized as an mental illness, and people who have it may 
suffer needlessly for years or even decades.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">At least 2 million Americans suffer from manic-depressive illness. For those afflicted with 
the illness, it is extremely distressing and disruptive.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Signs and symptoms of mania:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Extreme irritability and distractibility</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Excessive &quot;high&quot; or euphoric feelings</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">A sustained period of behavior that is different from usual</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Increased energy, activity, restlessness, racing thoughts and rapid talking</font></p>

<p align=left><font color="#000000">Schizophrenia is a severe mental illness that is complex, puzzling, chronic and disabling.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The most striking symptoms of schizophrenia are referred to as &quot;psychotic,&quot; meaning out of 
touch with reality, or inability to separate real from unreal experiences.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Some people have only one psychotic episode; others have many episodes during a lifetime 
and lead relatively normal lives during the interim periods.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">An individual with chronic schizophrenia often doesn&#146;t fully recover normal functioning and 
typically requires long-term treatment, generally including medication to control the 
symptoms. Some people may never be able to function without assistance.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Approximately 2 million Americans develop schizophrenia during any given year. Men and 
women are affected with equal frequency.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">The first episodes are often seen in the teens or twenties in men and in the twenties or early 
thirties in women. </font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Schizophrenia is believed to have a genetic basis. The children of a person with 
schizophrenia have about a 10 percent chance of developing schizophrenia. By comparison, 
the risk of schizophrenia in the general population is about 1 percent.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">SCHIZOPHRENIA IS NOT &quot;SPLIT-PERSONALITY.&quot; There is a common misconception 
that schizophrenia is multiple personalities or a Dr. Jekyll-Mr. Hyde syndrome. This is NOT 
accurate. In fact, multiple personality disorder is an entirely different disorder.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">People with schizophrenia may experience:</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">&#183; unusual realities</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">&#183; hallucinations</font></p>

<p align=left>Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an anxiety disorder that is potentially disabling 
and can persist throughout a person&#146;s life.</p>
<p align=left>A person with OCD becomes trapped in a pattern of repetitive thoughts and behaviors that 
are senseless and distressing, but extremely difficult to overcome.</p>
<p align=left>OCD occurs in a spectrum from mild to severe; but if severe and left untreated, it can destroy 
a person&#146;s capacity to function at work, school or in the home.</p>
<p align=left>OCD can be effectively treated.</p>
<p align=left>Studies indicate that at least one-third of OCD cases in adults began in childhood.</p>
<p align=left>OCD affects more than 2 percent of the population. It is more common than such severe 
mental illnesses as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness, and males and females are 
equally affected.</p>
<p align=left>Some obsessions and compulsions experienced by people with OCD are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left>concerns with contamination</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>overconcern with keeping objects in perfect order</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>images of death or horrible events</p>
</li>
<li><p align=left>personally unacceptable religious or sexual thoughts</p>

THE HARVARD PSYCHIATRY BRAIN COLLECTION
<p>
        The Harvard Psychiatry Brain Collection has been specifically
trying to collect brain tissue from families with serious mental illness.
There has been a special focus on the membership of the National Alliance
for the Mentally Ill (NAMI), the organization for families with brain
disorders.  Our "Brain Bank" functions as a repository for brain tissue
that is used for scientific investigations of the underlying causes of
neuropsychiatric brain disorders.  Toward this end,  we distribute donated
tissue to qualified investigators throughout the country.
 <p>       For research purposes, it is important that we collect tissue from:
A. Individuals with a psychiatric diagnosis (schizophrenia,
manic-depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder);  B.  First degree
relatives (parents, siblings, offspring) of individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis; and C. "Normal Control" individuals who have no family history
of mental illness.
  <p>      The Harvard "Brain Bank", which is centered at McLean Hospital, is
federally funded to undertake the processing and distribution of donated
brain specimens.  Unfortunately, the government does not provide sufficient
funding to cover the costs associated with brain removal which, may in some
cases be as much as $200-300.  In the past, these costs have generally been
assumed by the family members interested in brain donation.  However,
because of the severe shortage of brain tissue donated by individuals with
a serious psychiatric illness, we have established a special fund in order
to cover the costs of brain removal for individuals with a psychiatric
diagnosis (category A above).  In addition, as long as there is adequate
funding available, we will also cover such costs for the donation of brains
from first degree relatives (parents, sibling, offspring) of individuals
with schizophrenia, manic-depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder
(category B above).  The spouse of an individual with a serious mental
illness, who has no other blood relatives with a serious mental illness,
can donate brain tissue in the category of "Normal Control" (category C
above), and as long as there is adequate funding available, we will agree
to cover the associated costs of donation.
  <p>      Pre-registration for brain donation is encouraged, but not
necessary.  When an individual dies, the surviving family members make the
decision to donate.  We do, however, encourage families to openly plan for
brain donation and to pre-register with the Brain Bank.
   <p>     Brain donation is a personal decision that is made by the surviving
family at the time of death.  In the event of a death, or an impending
death, just dial     1-800-BRAIN BANK any time of the day or night and our
staff will assist you in the donation process.
    <p>    For more information about brain donation, please call 1-800-BRAIN
BANK (1-800-272-4622) and request our "Brain Donation Information"
brochures for your Local Affiliate meeting or a copy of our free video
interview with Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor titled "LifeSpan: Research Takes
Brains".

<P>
"By the 1960s, a horrified backlash--and the advent of new antipsychotic drugs--ended the lobotomy (practice).  But a handful of doctors quietly continued to look for more limited and precise ways to treat mental illness through brain surgery," according to an article in the Wall Street Journal (December 1, 1994). 
<P>
"They focused on a mysterious ring of brain structured call the limbic system, which seems to play a role in emotions such as fear, sadness and pleasure.  At Boston's Massachusetts General Hospital in 1962, H. Thomas Ballantine began trying a pinpoint procedure called a cingulotomy...(and) it appeared to break the cycle of mental illness--without the high mortality and brain damage of lobotomies.  To this day, surgeons are at a loss to explain why cingulotomies work. 
<P>
Because it takes weeks after surgery for patients to respond, Dr. Ballantine suspects the procedure doesn't simply interrupt a brain circuit, but somehow changes the levels of unspecified brain chemicals.  Today, Mass General performs 15 to 20 cingulotomies each year, making it one of the world's only hospitals with a regular psychosurgery practice. 
<P>
Fearful of the lobotomy era's taint, the psychosurgery team takes pains to screen out all but the most desperate cases and deeps an extremely low profile--even though at least a quarter of its patients report improvement in their conditions."

<A NAME = "child"><H2>CHILD AND ADOLESCENT RESEARCH</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Nearly five years ago, at the urging of Congress and based on a report by the Institute of Medicine (IOM), NIMH issued the "National Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders."  Now several IOM members who wrote the original IOM report have prepared the "Report Card on the National Plan for Research on Child and Adolescent Mental Disorders:  The Midway Point." 
<P>
The report card compares the original goals of the National Plan with the achievements thus far described under the following headings:  career development, basic research, clinical research, intramural research, services research, dissemination and advocacy, and leadership.  There has been considerable progress in funding services research and prevention with more progress in clinical research than in basic research.  
<P>
Only modest progress has been made in training new researchers.  Especially troublesome is the lack of progress in funding intramural research and in disseminating information about what has been learned through research.  To obtain a copy of the report card, call the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at 202/966-7300, or write the Academy at 3615 Wisconsin Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20016-3007.

<A NAME = "depre"><H2>DEPRESSION AND THE ELDERLY</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Oregon psychiatrists fear that severe depression can lead some elderly patients to make deadly, inappropriate decisions about continuation of medical treatment, according to a survey by researchers at the Portland Veterans Administration Medical Center reported in the November 1994 American Journal of Psychiatry. 
<P>
More than 75 percent of Americans favor legislation allowing terminally ill patients or their family members to withdraw life-sustaining treatments, but the researchers argue that severe depression may influence patients to reject medical care they might otherwise accept if their depression were treated.  "Hopelessness leads to undervaluing all possible good outcomes for a medical treatment," said Linda Ganzini, M.D., and colleagues.  "
<P>
This study supports the hypothesis that in many depressed persons, hopelessness, pessimism and excessive emphasis on the burdens of treatment temporarily alter the person's personal formula for weighing risks and benefits of medical treatment."   Ganzini's findings offer hope that psychiatrists and other physicians can predict which depressed patients are likely to have stable or unstable preferences regarding life-sustaining therapies.

<P>
Does Clozepine Alleviate Facial Tics, Body Tremors?
<P>
by Allan Safferman, M.D. and Jeffrey Lieberman, M.D.
<P>
Safferman is research psychiatrist at Hillside Hospital, Long
Island Jewish Medical Center, in Glen Oaks, NY. Lieberman is
director of research in the Department of Psychiatry at Hillside
Hospital.
<P>
One of the major concerns associated with the chronic use of
neuroleptic drugs is the development of tardive dyskinesia (TD),
an abnormal, involuntary movement disorder that can affect the
facial region, the trunk, and the upper and lower extremities.
<P>
The incidence of TD varies in different populations: in non-
elderly adult psychiatric patients it occurs in 18.5 percent
after four years of neuroleptic drug treatment, and in 44 percent
after eight years of treatment.
<P>
Among the elderly, the risk of TD has been found to be over 30
percent after 43 weeks of neuroleptic drug treatment.
<P>
Abnormal movements may be caused by a variety of neurological
illnesses, and the clinician should carefully consider and
exclude other reasonable possibilities before making a diagnosis
of TD. 
<P>
The majority of TD cases are mild, and if caught in time, are
reversible.
<P>
But a small percentage of patients may actually pose a medical
risk to the patient. The movements are often cosmetically
disfiguring and may be functionally disabling.
<P>
Patients with TD may be embarrassed by these movements and their
presence may cause anxiety and alarm to patients. These patients
may be shunned by those who are ignorant about this neurological
problem, thereby hampering the patient's efforts to reintegrate
into the community.
<P>
If anti-psychotic medications are discontinued early at the onset
of TD, a significant number of patients will spontaneously
improve and perhaps even remit after a few months.
<P>
Unfortunately, for many patients, neuroleptic discontinuation is
not a viable option as the relapse rate for patients suffering
from schizophrenia exceeds 60 percent and 80 percent after one
and two years of medication respectively.
<P>
Various efforts to treat TD have been met with inconsistent
results. Some of these measures have included: benzodiazepines,
lithium, bromocriptine, tetrabenazine, reserpine, lecithin,
clonidin, and high does anticholinergics, to name a few.
<P>
Some recent intriguing approaches have included the use of
Vitamin E, and selegiline.
<P>
It appears that all medications that block D-2 dopamine receptors
in the brain have the potential of producing extrapyramidal
symptoms (eg, tremor, rigidity) and may cause TD.
<P>
Clozapine is very interesting in this regard. Clozapine has a
very weak affinity for D-2 dopamine receptors, and therefore,
rarely produces significant extrapyramidal symptoms at
therapeutic doses.
<P>
While there have been a few isolated cases of dyskinesias
associated with clozapine, in these instances patients had
received traditional neuroleptic drugs prior to clozapine. To
date, there have been no confirmed case of TD caused by clozapine
alone.
<P>
For this reason, clozapine is a very appealing drug in that it
can effectively control psychotic symptoms and yet has a very low
risks, if any at all, of producing TD.
<P>
It has been observed that moderate to high dozes of clozapine
(between 500 MG to 900 mg per day) may partially or completely
alleviate symptoms of TD -- especially in those patients with
tardive dystonia.
<P>
At Hillside Hospital in New York, we are currently conducting a
study to determine if clozapine is an effective treatment for
patients with moderate to sever tardive dyskinesia.
<P>
Preliminary results indicate that most of the TD patients show
dramatic improvement in their abnormal body movements.
<P>
This project is currently ongoing and we are seeking more
patients for this study to help us determine if clozapine merely
suppresses TD, treats TD, or spares the brain from intense D-2
dopamine receptor blockage thereby allowing spontanwous "healing"
of dopamine neurons in the brain.

mixed up? North and south reversed or confused? How did you 
feel?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Had a funny little tune going through your mind for a couple of 
hours or a whole day, and no matter what you did it still 
bothered you? How would you feel if that same tune went 
through your mind for three days, a week, a month?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Now put three or more of these items together. Say you hadn't 
slept for three days, your heard the same music going on and on

you feel? How would you look? What would you do? How 
would you communicate with others? How would others 
behave toward you?</font></p>

<p align=left><font color="#000000">Imagine that ...</font></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Nothing seems enjoyable or fun anymore. Even your favorite 
activities, spending time with friends, listening to music, or 
going to the theatre, no longer give you any satisfaction or 
pleasure. What would it be like to be unable to enjoy yourself?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You suddenly find it difficult or impossible to remember 
anything you read. You read a page in a book, but when you set 
the book down, you can't remember what you read. How would 
you deal with your work or your studies?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You can't remember anything your boss or teacher says in 
class. You sit through class or a meeting really trying to pay 
attention, but when it is over you can't remember what was 
discussed. How would you feel about going to class or work 
every day? How would you explain your difficulties to your 
boss, teachers and parents?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You live in a black and white and gray world, because all the 
color had faded away. Someone &quot;pulls the plug&quot; on the energy 
in your body, and all but 20% of your energy drains out. You 
feel full of hot, dry sand, too tired to start even the simplest 
task. How easy would it be to do your normal activities?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Simple things you used to do automatically, like deciding what 
to wear or which radio station to listen to, take enormous 
effort. Even after deciding, you aren't sure you made the right 
decision. How would this complicate your daily routine? What 
if you had to handle major decisions like where to go to 
college or big changes like moving to another state?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">You wake up every morning for weeks and can't think of one 
good reason to get up. You wish you had died in your sleep, 
and think the world would be better off without you. How much 
hope would you have for your future?</font></p>
</li>
<li><p align=left><font color="#000000">Put three or more of these situations together. This is the world 
that a person with depressive illness lives in. It is bleak and 
lifeless, without color or humor. </font></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p align=left><font color="#000000"><strong>UNDERSTANDING PEOPLE WHO HAVE MENTAL ILLNESS:</strong></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">This may make it easier for you to understand how a person who is mentally ill might feel. 
They may feel this way all the time. Can you understand why they do not look real attractive 
sometimes? Why they may not comb their hair or change their clothes? Can you understand 
how they must feel?</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000"><font size=3><strong>THE IMPORTANCE OF TREATMENT</strong></font></font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Now imagine how it would feel if you had some medication that helped you handle this. 
Here is a reason why some people with mental illnesses turn to street drugs to help them 
through the day. But imagine if you were on the right medication and these feelings and 
thoughts were much better. Wouldn't it be worthwhile to get to a doctor and give the 
medication a chance?</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Hope exists for people who have depressive illnesses and schizophrenia, because effective 
treatments are available from medical doctors and qualified mental health professionals. The 
important thing is to seek treatment from a qualified professional.</font></p>

<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">MYTH</font><font color="#000000">:	Mental illnesses do not affect the average person.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">FACT</font><font color="#000000">:	No one is immune to mental illness. The National Institute of Mental 
Health statistics show that 5 million adults and 7.5 million children in America 
have some form of mental illness in any given year.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">MYTH</font><font color="#000000">:	A person can recover from a mental illness by turning his or her thoughts positively 
and with prayer.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">FACT</font><font color="#000000">:	Mental illness is a physical, not a moral, condition. Recovery comes 
through receiving the necessary medical treatment and supportive services. 
Highly effective treatments allow many people to resume productive, satisfying 
lives.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">MYTH</font><font color="#000000">:	The cause of mental illness is either poor parenting or poor character.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">FACT</font><font color="#000000">:	Mental illnesses like major depression, manic depression, and 
schizophrenia are no-fault brain diseases, and can strike in any family.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">MYTH</font><font color="#000000">:	A person experiencing mental illness is possessed by an evil spirit.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">FACT</font><font color="#000000">:	Mental illnesses are caused by physical disorders or chemical 
imbalances, not supernatural forces.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">MYTH</font><font color="#000000">:	Mental illness is the same as mental retardation.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">FACT:</font><font color="#000000">	Mental retardation is an intellectual defect at birth, or a result of illness 
or injury during infancy or childhood. Mental illness are brain diseases, physical 
disorders that often strike between the ages of 16 and 25.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">MYTH</font><font color="#000000">:	People who have a mental illness are dangerous.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#0000FF">FACT</font><font color="#000000">:	Most people who have a mental illness are no more violent than 
someone suffering from cancer, diabetes or any other serious illness. More 
often, they are the victims of violence.</font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#FF0000">Outreach to Public Libraries: Suggested Activities</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Books continue to be one of the best sources of public information about mental illnesses. Mental Illness 
Awareness Week is a good time to make sure your library is carrying the latest, most up-to-date books available 
on mental illnesses and their treatments. NAMI's Literature Committee has recommended these books this year 
for a Basic Library on Mental Illness. </font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Steps for Building Your Public Library's Collection</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">1.	Adopt the goal of adding books on the &quot;Basic Library List&quot; to your public library.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">2.	Look through the card catalog and on the library shelves to see what kind of books the library 
already has on subjects related to mental illness.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">3.	Talk to the librarian in charge of recommending books for purchase. Bring the &quot;Basic Library 
List,&quot; and explain that the books listed have been evaluated and recommended by NAMI.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">4.	Suggest which books on the list are a higher priority because they are interesting to read and 
contain current, useful information.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">5.	Follow up by writing a &quot;thank you&quot; note after you meet with the librarian, or after the books you 
recommended are on the library shelves.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Library Exhibit</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">1.	Explain MIAW 1996 to your local librarian or the person in charge of special programs at the 
library.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">2.	Suggest books from the &quot;Basic Library List&quot; to exhibit.</font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">3.	Offer to help select books and plan the display. You may wish to use the MIAW 1995 poster, 
&quot;Treatment Works.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">Educational Program</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">1.	Explain MIAW 1996 to your local librarian or the person in charge of special programs at the 
library. </font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">2.	Suggest an educational program at the library in which family members, consumers, and mental 
health professionals would speak. Use the theme &quot;Treatment Works&quot; focusing on the designated 
illness for the day. Resources on different illnesses are listed elsewhere in this year's MIAW kit. </font></p>
<p align=left><font color="#000000">3.	Offer to help get speakers and publicize the event (e.g., flyers at the library, notices in your local 
newspaper and affiliate newsletter)</font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">The following case study was written by Elliot and Diane Steele in order to be shared with all affiliates 
nationwide. NAMI would like to extend our gratitude to the Steele's for their contribution, and to all the AMIs 
who sent examples of their great work to share. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&quot;End the Mystery&quot; Candlelight Vigil held in St. Petersburg, FL was coordinated by the Steele's and sponsored 
by Pinellas County AMI. The event was held in a public park and featured food, education, music, speakers, 
provider booths and ended with the candlelight vigil. The approximately 700 participants stayed from 4pm until 
sunset and attracted three evening news stories.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Keep in mind that this case study outlines a very elaborate event. Affiliates my wish to pick and choose from the 
recommended activities. Please do not feel as if it is imperative you include every aspect listed here. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">For more information about this event please read the following guide or contact: </font></p>

<p align=center><font color="#000000">PREFACE</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">As we work hard on the Candlelight Vigil, we must always think back on the worst times we and our loved ones 
have experienced, trying to work through the maze of the system and deal with the loss caused by this tragic 
illness. This will reinforce the fact that any sacrifice we make now is worth it. If we can educate people and end 
stigma, thereby opening doors for help, it will be a giant step on the road to equality. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If everyone of our 1100 affiliates can have a public educational event during National Mental Illness Awareness 
Week 1995, it will have a phenomenal impact on the media. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We all must stand up with our heads held high and be proud of our loved ones who are suffering this living hell. 
If we allow the stigma to shame us from speaking out proudly, we can never really accomplish our goal. Take 
advantage of every minute and utilize it as a &quot;moment of opportunity.&quot; </font></p>

</blockquote>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>PURPOSE &amp; GOAL </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The purpose of the event was to educate the general public about neurobiological diseases (mental illnesses) 
and to end stigma. This was accomplished by locating the event in a public place and by inviting and informing 
consumers and families as well as health care providers, friends, politicians, churches and all forms of media. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Remember - the best weapon against stigma is knowledge.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our goal is to have an Candlelight Vigil event in each of the 1100 affiliates in the United States during Mental 
Illness Awareness Week 1995, no matter how large or small it may be.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you feel you can only have a small candlelight vigil by a local church, that would be great, or if you could get 
10,000 people at an event in a large park, that would be even better. Whatever the case, do the best you can - 
most importantly is that you do something. This is our opportunity to show unity throughout the entire United 
States. </font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>PROCEDURE </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Organize Committee </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Contact the people in your local affiliate and start an Candlelight Vigil committee. The committee should contain 
about 8-10 people with various areas of interest. Each member of the main Candlelight Vigil committee will 
chair one or more of the subcommittees. By keeping the main committee at 8-10, you can maintain organization, 
communication and commitment by all members. Each chairperson of the subcommittees must have a strong 
interest in the committees he/she chairs and can influence others to join and contribute.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Pick A Date </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">National Mental Illness Awareness week was the ideal time for such an event. The Sunday Mental Illness 
Awareness week has been designated for Candlelight Vigils nationwide to kick off the event. Try to get the 
mayor of your local municipality to proclaim the week Mental Illness Awareness Week.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Pick A Location </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Any public place would be great. If you are located in a warm climate, a local park would be an excellent 
location for the event. If you are in a large community with a large homeless population, try to locate the event in 
a close proximity to the homeless since many may be suffering with mental illnesses. Keep in mind however that 
you also want to draw a cross section of the community to educate. If an outside event is not possible, a local 
community center, church or school may be an alternative site. Be sure that all agree on exactly what you are 
going to do. Once you set your limits stick to them. If you reached your goals adequately and have time to add 
another aspect to the event, then do it. But don't try to do more than is reasonable because you may jeopardize 
the entire event.</font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>SUB-COMMITTEES </strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">In the beginning have the sub-committee chairpersons meet every 3 weeks and probably weekly during the last 
one to two months to ensure excellent communication among the sub-committees. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">These are the sub-committees we used. You may have many more ideas of your own.</font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">Creative Arts </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This sub-committee is in charge of designing or arranging for posters, flyers, T-shirts, banners, etc. 
End the Mystery T-shirts can be ordered through AMI - Pinellas County. The flyers, posters and 
tickets can be printed at a local print shop.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We distributed flyers wherever possible. We gave them out at work, placed them in hospitals, 
mental health associations, social security and HRS offices, drop in centers and more. Be careful 
with flyers however - don't do anything that might offend someone, e.g., don't place flyers on cars in 
a parking lot which may encourage littering. This may actually be negative advertising. We had 
5000 flyers printed and distributed about 4800.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We placed posters in all the psychiatric hospitals, many psychiatrists' offices, grocery stores, malls, 
places of employment, Laundromats, other health care facilities and many more places. Use your 
imagination. The grocery stores required that the posters state that we are a non-profit organization. 
If possible, place posters around the event site a few days before the event. Try to find a contact for 
billboards.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Food </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is in charge of preparing the meal and distributing the food to all attendees. If you 
choose to serve food, you might want to think about charging admission.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Try to obtain food donations from various sources. Check with restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, 
hospitals and any other food providers you may think of. Spaghetti dinners are relatively easy and 
inexpensive to provide. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Be sure that your selection is not too cumbersome to carry and try to have everything self-contained. 
As people came through the food line, they received a covered meal platter with utensils and napkin 
inside.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">You may want to ask McDonalds. They frequently donate orange drink to events. You may ask Pepsi 
or Coke also for donations.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Children's Activities </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for keeping the children entertained. If the children are happy, their 
parents will stay longer and increase their education. Some suggested activities include story telling 
and reading, face painting, clowns, balloons (if allowed), coloring book and crayons, moon walk 
and paper mache'.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Welcome Committee </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The Welcome Committee is responsible for greeting guests when they arrive and for directing them 
to specific activities.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We also had a raffle with our event. People could sign up (name and address) at the welcome 
committee to win a prize (we had 2 fruit baskets). This gave us a mailing list for future events. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Educational Material </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for having educational material available so the attendees can 
increase their knowledge and awareness about mental illnesses. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We had videos and pamphlets about the major mental illnesses, NAMI, the brain banks and much 
more. We gave away buttons saying &quot;End the Mystery, Ask me about NBD.&quot; We had a dozen health 
care providers in our area set up educational booths under a tent. They were expected to supply 
knowledge rather than solely promote their business. We stressed to providers that education was a 
&quot;win-win&quot; situation for all. We accomplished this by educating as many as possible as to the need 
for health insurance parity and early intervention along with long term care when needed. These 
types of changes will benefit both consumers and providers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Program Organization </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for preparing an agenda of speakers, music and entertainment and 
keeping the program flowing throughout the event. This committee needs to seek qualified 
interesting speakers and arrange a program that will flow well.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Keep the length of the event short enough to keep the people interested until sunset and the 
candlelight vigil. Our event ran from 4 PM until sunset. This 3 1/2 hour event was too long and 
required creativity to maintain their interest. Be prepared to fill in or adjust your agenda if it is 
moving along more rapidly than expected. There may be a fair number of speakers that may not 
show and one must also be prepared to adjust for speakers who must go on at a certain time to 
allow them to leave for another engagement.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We had a DJ, a folk singing group and about a dozen speakers at our event. Our speakers included a 
consumer, family member, psychiatrist, politician, health care provider and many more. We had a 
few wonderful surprises. A consumer spoke out for the first time that he had suffered with bipolar 
disorder for years and never told anyone. Another member of the audience spoke about her daughter 
with an illness that died 8 months before our event. These were our most inspirational speakers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Audio </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for getting the speaker system operating properly for the event. If you 
are in a church, this may be a relatively easy task since audio equipment may already be in place. 
However, it may require someone with knowledge of electronics to know what will be needed in a 
park. Check to see what electrical source is available in your location.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Religious Outreach </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for contacting all churches and synagogues in the area to ask them to 
promote our event in their bulletin and announce it during church services.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We gave each church and synagogue two complimentary tickets for them to give to one of their 
members. These tickets accompanied a letter explaining our event and educational material about 
mental illnesses for their church bulletin board. Try to have each AMI member take this information 
to their place of worship. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Media </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for obtaining media coverage before, during and after the event. This 
can be accomplished through the newspapers, radio and television. Try to contact United Press 
International. Look for any past media contacts and make contact with them again via a press release 
(example in package). Update press releases when closer to the event and follow with a telephone 
call during the final week prior to the event. Do not forget to stress to the media that this is a 
nationwide event with Candlelight Vigil in every state during Mental Illness Awareness Week. 
Contact any newspaper or television community calendar and try to get public service 
announcements on your local radio stations. REMEMBER TO SEND A THANK YOU NOTE FOR 
ANY COVERAGE RECEIVED. THIS MAY INSURE EQUAL OR BETTER COVERAGE NEXT 
YEAR.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We sent out a news release to about 100 different media sources (all radio and television stations, 
newspapers including the small community papers). We sent a second updated press release a few 
weeks later. We found that a follow up telephone call was essential to get the coverage.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We had our event aired on three of the four major television networks on the evening and next 
morning news. We had from 30 seconds to 2 1/2 minutes air time on End the Mystery. We had 
previous contact with the NBC affiliate in our area WFLA, Channel 8. They devoted a few hours of 
a reporter and cameraman's time filming the set up through the candlelight vigil. Our event was 
announced as one of the lead in stories for the evening news.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We maintained a list of all our media contacts and sent them a thank you as well as a thank you to 
their boss. In return we received a personal phone call from one of the reporters to thank us for our 
note and we received a letter from another reporter to thank us for the thank you. We now have a 
great working relationship with these people.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Physical Set Up </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for physically setting up the room, hall or park where the event is 
taking place. This may include setting up tables, chairs, audio system, banners, stage, porta potties, 
tents and whatever else is needed for your particular setting. Make arrangements for trash pick up 
throughout the event. You may want to hire someone for this purpose.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you are having an inside event and you are expected to clean up after yourself, it would be wise to 
draw a map of the location of items before you begin moving them around. This will aid in putting 
things back as you found them.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Clean Up </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for getting everything back to normal after the event. Some facilities 
may require you to pay for cleaning after the event. Others may expect you to clean it yourself. It is 
extremely important that it gets cleaned well to insure you the opportunity of using the facility in the 
future. Again, be sure you know where all items are located before you start to set up for your event 
so everything will be returned to their proper place. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Sponsorship </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This committee is responsible for getting any donations of money, food, services or equipment. The 
first step is to brainstorm your group for any influential/wealthy individual or business which may 
have a family member or close friend who suffers with a neurobiological disease. Get creative and 
don't be afraid to use your resources. One of our members is a Director of Food and Nutritional 
Services at a local hospital. He contacted his vendors, his employees and his hospital and received 
the food, servers, beverages and disposables as a donation. He also received mailing lists/labels 
for media press releases and mental health agencies and clergy from the hospital community 
relations/marketing department and social services department. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">A local tent company erected a 40' x 80' tent (for the cost of their labor) to house mental health 
providers to set up educational displays. We did not charge the first year. However, we will now 
ask a donation or even co-sponsorship because they see our efforts at educating the community as a 
win/win situation for all. Also the fact that we have spearheaded an insurance parity bill with one 
of our State Representatives which when passed will have a trickle down effect to all mental health 
care providers.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The way to get in to a large health care provider's facility is to find out the name of the director of 
community relations/marketing department. Present them with a press release telling them how many 
people you expect at the event and that it is going to happen nation-wide. They may want to do 
depression screening, etc. at the event. If you can find cooperative people you may even be able to 
get media mailing labels from them and they may send out their own press releases.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">We are on the list for the City of St. Petersburg, FL for co-sponsorship. That will give us added 
funds for our event, as well as increased credibility. Many social organizations such as Rotary, 
Kiwanis, Chambers of Commerce, Women's Club, sororities and fraternities can be contacted for 
potential co-sponsorship.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">One of our members sits on the board of the Tampa Marine Institute - an organization which helps 
rehabilitate youth offenders. They have offered their services for set up/clean up of the park as a 
way of paying back to the community some of the good they have received. We can never be afraid 
to ask. Many times when you least expect it, you may run into someone who knows the 
discrimination people suffering with NBD experience, and want to help.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>CANDLELIGHT VIGIL</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our candles are lit for 3 purposes: </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">1) To shed light on dark corners to dispel the stigma </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">2) To bring hope for the future </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">3) In memory of those no longer with us </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">We distributed over 400 glass votive candles rather than candle sticks. We felt this was safer since the wax was 
less likely to spill on anyone. There were 2 drawbacks however. </font></p>
<blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">1) The candles could not be lit by another candle. We used 6 butane candles to light all of them. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">2) The candles would go out easily if tilted a lot due to the building up of melted wax. These 
candles cost about $.60 each.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font color="#000000">If the facility or park where the event is being held requires liability insurance, please don't let that scare you 
from holding the event. One can usually purchase a one million dollar liability policy for a one day event for a 
few hundred dollars.</font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>POST EVENT MEETING</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">The purpose of this meeting is to have fun and congratulate each other on a job well done. Also, this is the best 
time to critique the event. The problem spots are much more obvious now than they will be at any later date. </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Have this meeting as soon after the event as possible. You may want to have the date solidified before the event 
actually takes place, e.g., the Friday following the event.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This meeting is a good time to re-assign committees so everyone can start organizing their thoughts right away. 
It's never too soon to start planning for next year. </font></p>
<p align=center><font color="#000000"><strong>SUMMARY</strong> </font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Our first year we spent $1,666.00 with donated revenues of $1,820.00. This gave us a small profit. However, 
the knowledge, thinking and inspiration we stimulated through our event was priceless. Much of our event was 
donated or our expenses would have been higher. As we get sponsorship as well as increased donations and 
ticket sales, our budget will allow us the opportunity to be more effective. Use your imagination and I am sure 
you will think of bigger and better ideas to share with your sister alliances.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If you are small, don't feel intimidated by some of the larger groups. If getting media or sponsorship seems 
overwhelming for your group, don't let that concern you at this time. Work in your own comfort area now, then 
branch out next year to add another aspect to your event. Whatever you do will be a great achievement for the 
whole picture. We need EVERYONE'S support.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">This is a step in a nationwide campaign of unity to end the stigma. Let's all make it a big success. REMEMBER 
THE BEST WEAPON AGAINST STIGMA IS KNOWLEDGE. </font></p>

<H3>National Alliance For The Mentally Ill And National Task Force Urge Federal Government To Find Housing For 1.8 Million Americans With Disabilities</H3>
<P>
<PRE><I>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<HR>
<CENTER><I>Panel Charges Available Housing for People With Disabilities Will Drop 50 Percent
Due to New Law That Reserves Much Public and Assisted Housing for the Elderly
</I></CENTER><P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--Explaining that people with severe mental illness are facing a critical shortage in safe, affordable housing, NAMI in partnership with the national task force today called on the federal government to take steps to replace the housing lost to people with disabilities due to the creation of "elderly only" public and assisted housing.  Included in their recommendations are a more equitable share of existing housing resources as well as new resources for housing for people with disabilities.
<P>
The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Housing Task Force and the Boston-based Technical Assistance Collaborative project found that as many as 1.8 million people with disabilities may be in need of federally subsidized housing.  This includes people with mental retardation, mental illness, cerebral palsy, and a variety of other physical and mental disabilities.  NAMI Public Policy Director Andrew Sperling serves as a co-chair of the CCD Housing Task Force.
<P>
As the number of people with disabilities grows, the number of available housing units is shrinking, according to the task force report.  As a result, the housing shortage is limiting the ability of people with disabilities to lead full and independent lives within their own communities.  Without access to affordable housing in the community, they face institutionalization or homelessness.
<P>
In <I><A HREF="#open">Opening Doors:  Recommendations For A Federal Policy To Address The Housing Needs of People With Disabilities</A></I>, NAMI and the task force warn that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has significantly underestimated the number of people with disabilities who have priority housing needs.  After carrying out an in-depth analysis of available data, the task force found that the number of people with disabilities receiving Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) benefits who may have acute housing problems is 1.8 million, 10 times higher than HUD estimates.  The tasks force number does not include the many people with disabilities who have income other than SSI but still may be eligible for HUD assistance.
<P>
The CCD Housing Task Force, which has been working on this issue of housing loss for five years, is co-chair by representatives of the American Network of Community Options and Resources, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and the ARC.  Among the task force member groups are the National Easter Seals Society, United Cerebral Palsy Association, National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils, Brain Injury Association, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and others.  Together these organizations represent millions of people with a variety of disabilities nationwide.
<P>
One of the single most important factors in the reduction in housing for people with disabilities was the 1992 decision by Congress to allow "elderly only" subsidized housing.  That legislation permitted both Public Housing Authorities and HUD-assisted housing providers to limit or exclude people with disabilities from living in certain subsidized housing developments by designating that housing as "elderly only."  This problem was exacerbated by legislation passed this year which makes it easier for public housing authorities to designate housing.
<P>
The task force has now been able to quantify the impact of this "elderly only" policy enacted by Congress in 1992 and 1996.
<P>
Because of this policy, the supply of public and assisted housing units that was previously occupied by people with disabilities will shrink by at least 50 percent.  Based on estimates of the number of people with disabilities who will be displaced from subsidized housing and waiting lists, there will be a decrease of at least 273,000 units that would have otherwise been occupied by people with disabilities.
<P>
"People with severe mental illness are losing their housing, and with that they are losing the opportunity to live full and productive lives in the community," said Andrew Sperling of NAMI, co-chairman of the task force.  "We are not suggesting that the federal government stop subsidizing housing for the elderly.  However, they cannot shift 273,000 homes away from people with disabilities to the elderly and just ignore the impact that this has on the lives of people with disabilities.  Congress must replace the available housing units and subsidies that would have been open to people with disabilities under age 62."
<P>
In addition to the "elderly only" housing designation, a myriad of factors have contributed to the shortage of affordable housing for people with disabilities.  The task force cited:
<P>
<UL>
	
<LI>the stigma and discrimination faced by people with disabilities, particularly people with severe and persistent mental illness;
<P>
<LI>the absence of clear mandates within federal housing programs and policies to expand the supply of federally funded housing for people with disabilities; and
<P>
<LI>underfunding of federal tenant-based rental assistance programs</UL>
<P>
Without a clearly articulated housing policy and new monies to address the loss of available housing to people with disabilities, their already acute housing problems will increase.  Using very conservative turnover rates, the task force estimates that by the year 2000:
<P><UL>
<LI>more than 100,000 units occupied by people with disabilities will convert to "elderly only" units;
<P>
<LI>more than 160,000 people with disabilities on waiting lists who would have otherwise been offered a subsidized housing unit will be told that they are no longer eligible to move in; and
<P>
<LI>an unknown number of people with disabilities who would have applied for admission to federally subsidized housing will have no other affordable housing options available.
</UL>
<P>
The major question is:  Where will people with disabilities, many of who have been on subsidized housing waiting lists for years, find alternative housing resources?  What about people with disabilities who were previously eligible to apply for this housing who will now be turned away?  What about people with disabilities living in institutions who should be living in the community?
<P>
In the Opening Doors report, the task force states that "people with disabilities are entitled to an equitable share of federal housing resources, even in an era of federal fiscal constraints."  To address the increasing affordable housing crisis, the task force recommends that the federal government take the following actions:
<P><UL>
<LI>authorize and appropriate funds for 75,000 new Section 8 tenant-based subsidies for people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>redirect the federal law to require that one out of every three Section 8 turnover subsidies be issued to a person with a disability under age 62;
<P>
<LI>redirect at least 50 percent of current Section 202 funding, which designates affordable housing for the elderly, to set aside rental assistance for communities experiencing the greatest negative impact of designated housing policies on available housing for people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>promote the expansion of affordable housing for people with disabilities by creating "thresholds" in the Community Development Block Grant and HOME-formula grant programs.  The HOME program is designed to help states, local governments, and Indian tribes to implement local housing strategies for low- and very low-income Americans;
<P>
<LI>reauthorize the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to expand the supply of affordable housing that can be accessed by people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>create home-ownership demonstrations that target low-income people with disabilities who are typically not included in federally funded home ownership initiatives;
<P>
<LI>create incentives for public housing authorities to maintain "mixed" housing; and
<P>
<LI>expand the Fair Housing Initiative Program to specifically include monitoring of the implementation of designated housing policies.</UL.>
<P>
NAMI, a non-profit organization representing 140,000 people with serious brain disorders and their families, has been leading a grassroots campaign to end discrimination against severe mental illness.  NAMI's 1,400 chapters are active at the state and local levels in all 50 states.
<P>
The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities is a Washington-based coalition of national consumer, advocacy, provider, and professional organizations that advocate on behalf of people of all ages with disabilities and their families.  CCD created the Housing Task Force to focus specifically on housing issues that affect people with disabilities.
<P>

<P>
<b>The CCD Housing Task Force and the Technical Assistance Collaborative, 
Inc. would like to thank the Melville Charitable Trust for the generous support 
provided for the preparation and publication of "Opening Doors", and for their 
commitment to addressing the housing needs of people with disabilities and 
people who are homeless.</b>

<hr>
<P>Today, in virtually every part of the United States, people with disabilities are facing an extreme crisis in the availability of affordable housing which meets their needs and desires.  In cities and towns across the country, hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities are living in seriously substandard housing conditions, paying 50%-75% or more of their limited income for rent, living at home with elderly parents, or are being forced to choose between restrictive congregate settings and homelessness. Many others remain in inappropriate institutional settings because there is no housing available to them that they can afford.

<P>What has caused this housing crisis, and what must be done about it?  These questions are clearly addressed  in this report, <I>Opening Doors:  Recommendations for a Federal Policy to Address the Housing Needs of  People with Disabilities</I> prepared by the Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Housing Task Force and the Technical Assistance Collaborative, Inc. The information and recommendations highlighted in this report are designed to guide the development of future federal housing policy and the use of federal housing funds to address the growing shortage of decent, safe, and affordable housing for people with disabilities.  The critical question before us is whether the federal government and the nation's affordable housing delivery system have the will and the commitment to ensure that people with disabilities receive their fair share of federal housing resources, now and in the future.

<P>People with disabilities are currently the population group most in need of federal housing assistance.  The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) <I>1994 Report to the Congress on Worst Case Housing Needs,</I> states that people with disabilities often have multiple housing problems and are the group most likely to live in severely inadequate housing.  Unfortunately, HUD's 1994 report, and a subsequent HUD report issued in March of 1996, <I>significantly underestimate</I> the number of people with disabilities who have priority housing needs.  Since these HUD reports were issued, the CCD Housing Task Force has estimated that over 1.8 million people with disabilities receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits may be in need of federal housing assistance, an estimate that is 10 times higher than recent HUD estimates.

<P>A myriad of factors have contributed to the extreme shortage of affordable housing for people with disabilities, including:
<P> 
<UL>
<LI>a significant reduction in the number of subsidized housing units available to people with disabilities because of the implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies; <P>
<LI>the stigma and discrimination faced by people with disabilities; <P>
<LI>the absence of clear mandates within federal housing programs and policies to expand the supply of federally funded housing for people with disabilities using the full range of HUD's mainstream housing resources; and<P>
<LI>underfunding of federal tenant based rental assistance programs such as the Section 8  program.
<P>
</UL>
<P>The designation of "elderly only" subsidized housing is the most recent factor which has contributed to the critical housing shortage for people with disabilities.  In 1992 and 1996, Congress passed legislation which permits both public housing authorities and HUD assisted housing providers to limit or exclude people with disabilities from living in certain subsidized housing developments by designating that housing as "elderly only."  These housing developments contain virtually all of the studio and one bedroom federally subsidized housing units in the country and represent over two-thirds of the federally subsidized housing resources that low income people with disabilities were eligible to access prior to the passage of this legislation.  

<P>Despite this significant decrease in the supply of subsidized housing available for people with disabilities, until recently, no replacement resources for people with disabilities were authorized by the Congress and as yet no funds have been appropriated to address this loss.  Even more problematic is that HUD included no additional funds for people with disabilities in its Fiscal Year 1997 budget request.

<P><I>"Opening Doors"</I> reports that, from 1993 through the year 2000, the implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies will result in at least a 50% decrease in the supply of HUD public and assisted housing units that were previously occupied by people with disabilities. Overall, based on estimates of the number of people with disabilities who will be displaced from subsidized housing waiting lists, there will be a decrease of at least 273,000 units that would have otherwise been occupied by people with disabilities.  

<P>Using conservative estimates for the rate of turnover in federally subsidized housing units, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that by the year 2000:
<P>
<UL>
<P>
<li>At least 110,250 units occupied by people with disabilities will convert to "elderly only" units.
<P>
<li>At least 163,704 people with disabilities on waiting lists who would have otherwise been offered a subsidized housing unit will be told that they are no longer eligible to move in.
<P>
<li>An unknown number of people with disabilities who would have applied for admission to federally subsidized housing will have no other affordable housing options available.
<P>
</UL>
<P>Based solely on the impact of "elderly only" designated housing policies, it is obvious that the supply of housing lost to people with disabilities must be replaced. <I>Where will people with disabilities, many of whom have been on subsidized housing waiting lists for years, find alternative housing resources?  What about people with disabilities who were previously eligible to apply for this housing who will now be turned away? What about people with disabilities living in institutions who should be living in their communities? </I>  Without a clearly articulated federal housing policy and new dedicated resources to address the loss of these units to people with disabilities, their already acute housing problems will undoubtedly increase.

<P>People with disabilities are entitled to an equitable share of federal housing resources, even in an era of federal fiscal constraints.  Therefore, in order to ensure a "fair share" approach, the CCD Housing Task Force has developed the following recommendations to address the acute and increasing affordable housing crisis which confronts people with disabilities:
<P>
<OL>
<P>
<li>Appropriation of new Section 8 tenant based subsidies for people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Redirection of Section 8 turnover to people with disabilities by Public Housing Authorities.<P>
<LI>Redirection of Section 202 funding to the Section 811 Supportive Housing Program for People with Disabilities.
<P>
<LI>Creation of "thresholds" within the CDBG and HOME formula grant programs to promote an expansion of affordable housing for people with disabilities.
<P>
<LI>Reauthorization of the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to expand the supply of affordable housing which can be accessed by people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Maximizing the use of HUD McKinney funding for permanent housing and rental subsidies for people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Creation of  "self-sufficiency" housing policies which target people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Creation of home ownership demonstrations which target people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Creation of incentives for Public Housing Authorities to maintain "mixed" housing.<P>
<LI>Expansion of Fair Housing activities to respond to designated housing implementation.<P>
<LI>Increased flexibility in the Section 811 program, which should be restricted exclusively to qualified non-profit applicants.<P>
<LI>Increased technical assistance and training on affordable housing targeted to people with disabilities, advocates, and service providers, including training on participation in the federally mandated Consolidated Plan process.
<P>
</OL>
<P>A major premise of the Americans with Disabilities Act is that people with disabilities will have the opportunity to participate in and contribute to society.  In order to achieve these goals, people with disabilities must have access to decent, safe, and affordable  housing in our communities and neighborhoods.  We must begin to open the doors!

<H3>Opening Doors:  Introduction</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<hr>
Independence, integration and productivity are among the most important values and goals shared by people with disabilities, their families, advocates, and service providers.  Any federal housing policy which affects the lives of people with disabilities must therefore reflect these values and be designed to achieve these goals.  The shortage of available, affordable, and accessible housing is an increasingly serious problem for people with disabilities that has limited their access to independent lives in the community, as well as their access to productive employment and full integration into society.

<P>Like all individuals, people with disabilities have a need for decent, safe, affordable, and appropriate housing.  Like all individuals, people with disabilities vary in their abilities, interests, desires, and needs over the span of their lifetime.  For some people with disabilities, the need for affordable housing directly linked with services and supports lasts throughout their lifetime.  For most people with disabilities, affordable housing simply means generic housing within the community, including rental apartments, condominiums, and single family homes.

<P>During the last decade, people with disabilities have become more empowered in all aspects of their daily lives.  Through the passage of important federal legislation, and with the support of advocates and service providers, many more people with disabilities have been able to rent or purchase a home of their own.  People with all types of disabilities are now living successfully in a variety of housing options, including apartments, cooperatives, condominiums, and single family homes.

<P>In order to afford housing in the community, low income people with disabilities have been seeking various forms of federal housing assistance in increasing numbers.  Unfortunately, at a time when demand is increasing, affordable housing opportunities for people with disabilities under age 62 are decreasing rather than expanding.  This decline is due primarily to the implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies in federally subsidized housing as well as to severe cuts in federal housing programs.  To add to the problem, efforts underway at the state and federal level to restructure public welfare and health systems, such as SSI and Medicaid, are also putting pressure on other funding streams that people with disabilities rely on to help pay for housing.

<P>Given the decline in affordable housing units and funding for health and human services, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that the federal government and the nation's affordable housing delivery system must work in partnership with people with disabilities and advocates to develop and implement a clear and equitable federal housing policy that is responsive to their housing needs and desires.   If we do not move forward immediately, the housing "safety net" for people with disabilities will increasingly be inappropriate and costly institutionalization or the homeless system.  Tragically, people with disabilities are already significantly over-represented as a percentage of the population who live in emergency shelters or on the streets of our communities.

<H3>Opening Doors: Housing Policy For People With Disabilities</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>Public opinion and public policies regarding where people with disabilities can live has changed dramatically through the years.  Originally, large institutions were built because it was thought that people with disabilities should live protected lives and pose no "risk" to society.  Eventually, advocates realized that people in institutions were being denied their basic rights to live in the community and were often subject to intolerable living conditions.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, community facilities commonly referred to as group homes or community residential programs were seen as the solution to these inhumane institutional conditions.  

<P>Unfortunately, many institutional practices were transferred into these community settings, including rigid rules and regulations that continued to restrict an individual's freedom and civil rights.  Paid staff routinely made decisions about all aspects of an individual's life.  The person's right to live in the housing setting was controlled by the staff, rather than by landlord/tenant laws which provide due process and protect all other tenants in the community.

<P>Increasingly, consumers, advocates, and providers of services have cast aside these failed and expensive facility-based models of the past and created a new person-centered approach and service technologies designed to support the desire of people with disabilities to live in their own homes.  This new paradigm of affordable housing and community-based supports and services has enhanced the quality of life of people with disabilities and expanded their housing options.  Access to decent, safe, and affordable housing has fostered greater inclusion in the community for people with disabilities and has increased their access to natural supports (family, friends, co-workers) as well as social and recreational opportunities routinely enjoyed by all Americans.

<P>Every day we are seeing the positive results of these changes through an increase in the number of people with disabilities who are gainfully employed, participating in job training, or supported employment programs.  In fact, we are seeing the beginnings of the next paradigm shift within the disability community, which is based on the economic empowerment of people with disabilities to achieve more financial self-sufficiency through access to mainstream employment, education, and job training.
<P>
<H4>Increased Demand For Affordable Housing By People With Disabilities</H4>

<P>A natural outcome of this paradigm shift in disability policy was a significant increase in the number of very low income people with disabilities seeking access to affordable community-based housing through the federally subsidized housing delivery system.  By 1995, over 550,000 individuals with disabilities were  receiving federal housing assistance through HUD public and assisted housing programs.  Approximately 75% of these individuals were living alone or with another non-elderly adult.  The other 25% were members of elderly households or households with minor children.  It is likely that a million or more people with disabilities are currently on subsidized housing waiting lists.

<P>For the past ten years, advocates and service providers have been aware of the increasing need and demand for affordable housing for people with disabilities.  However, it has been very difficult for the disability community to quantify the full extent of this need.  For example, we know that over 3 million adults with disabilities under age 62 are currently living on SSI benefits which are equivalent to 23% of median income.  HUD studies estimate that 70% of households with incomes below 30% of median income who are not receiving HUD assistance have priority housing problems.  Unfortunately, HUD has never undertaken a study to assess how many people with disabilities receiving SSI or who have other forms of income (i.e. Social Security Disability, Workman's Compensation, earned income) are in need of federal housing assistance.

<P>Even when the housing needs of people with disabilities have been accurately estimated - which has happened in very <B>few</B> communities during the preparation of the HUD mandated Consolidated Plan - the affordable housing delivery system has been resistant to expand housing opportunities for people with disabilities, and rarely directs housing resources to address their needs.  Among the many reasons for this lack of response are a lack of information and understanding of the housing needs of people with disabilities, the stigma associated with having a disability, and continuing discrimination within the affordable housing delivery system.  
<P>
<H4>The Loss Of Supply Of Affordable Housing - Elderly Only Designated Housing Policies</H4>

<P>Since 1992, the already acute housing crisis faced by people with disabilities has been exacerbated with the enactment of Title VI of the  Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-550) and Section 10 of the Housing Opportunity Program Extension Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-120).  With the enactment of this legislation, hundreds of thousands of HUD public and assisted housing units previously available to people with disabilities have been, and will increasingly be, designated exclusively for elderly households age 62 and over.

<P>The direct effect of this legislation is a significant and continuous reduction in the supply of federally subsidized housing for people with disabilities which previously had been available to them.  Since 1992, the reduction in units available in HUD assisted housing developments has fueled the already acute housing crisis experienced by people with disabilities everyday in communities throughout the country.  Until recently, there has been no action at the federal level to deal with this devastating loss of resources. 
<P>

To address this unprecedented loss of housing supply, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that it is essential to move beyond the divisive debate on the designation of "elderly only" housing and move toward the implementation of strategies which will replace the housing which is being lost to people with disabilities.  To that end, in this report the CCD Housing Task Force has collected and analyzed the available data which for the first time quantifies the potential impact of designated housing. This data includes what the CCD Housing Task Force believes to be a more accurate picture of the housing needs of people with disabilities than was contained in HUD's <I>1994 and 1996 Reports to Congress on Worst Case Housing Needs</I>.  The data collected also quantifies the relative impact that designated housing policies will have during the next five years on the supply of housing for both elderly households and people with disabilities.  Based on this information, the CCD Housing Task Force has developed specific recommendations for future federal action.

<H3>Opening Doors: The Housing Needs Of People With Disabilities</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>
<H4>HUD's Reports Significantly Understate The Housing Needs Of People With Disabilities</H4>
<P>

<P>Unfortunately, during this time when people with disabilities are experiencing an increasingly acute housing crisis, the federal government has not accurately quantified their housing needs.  Nor has the federal government made a good faith effort to compare the housing needs of people with disabilities with the housing needs of elderly households.  This comparison is important because elderly households will now have access to more federally subsidized housing units because of "elderly only" designated housing policies.  The lack of accurate information on the relative housing needs of these two population groups is due to the flawed methodology currently used by HUD to collect housing needs data for people with disabilities -- a methodology which has the effect of discriminating against non-elderly people with disabilities because it results in a significant under-reporting of their actual housing needs.

<P>Every other year, HUD issues a <I>Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> to the Congress documenting the magnitude and trends in worst case housing needs among very low income households, categorized as families with children, elderly households, and disabled households.  Households are considered to have worst case housing needs if they are very low income (below 50% of median income) and if they are either (1) paying more than 50% of their income for rent, or (2) living in severely substandard quality rental housing.  HUD's <I>Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> highlights, for the Congress, the implications of federal housing policies and specific legislative proposals and are often cited as federal housing policy and funding decisions are made.

<P>The findings contained in HUD's  <I>Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> have potentially greater significance for people with disabilities given the enactment and implementation of "elderly only" designated housing policies.  Unfortunately, both the <I>1994 and 1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Reports</I> prepared by HUD are flawed and significantly understate the number of people with disabilities who may have worst case housing needs.  

<P>The <I>1994 Worst Case Housing Needs Report </I>relied exclusively on data collected through the American Housing Survey (AHS), a face to face survey of current renters conducted for HUD by the Bureau of the Census.  This methodology is obviously not a valid approach to accurately assess the housing needs of people with disabilities,  many of whom are not current renters and whose housing history may be one of living in institutions, congregate or group settings, or with family during their adult years.  The fact that the AHS considers only current renters means that people with disabilities are seriously undercounted, and that their particular housing circumstances are not taken into consideration in HUD's methodology.  To illustrate, the 1994 HUD report was based solely on a universe of 532,000 people with disabilities who were believed to be in the rental market, even though over 4 million adults of all ages with a disability were receiving SSI benefits at that time.

<P>In the <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> issued in March, HUD discussed relying on incomplete data for people with disabilities from the AHS, admitting that the AHS does not even ask any questions related to disability.  Nevertheless, HUD continued to highlight AHS-based data on the housing needs of people with disabilities in key sections of the 1996 report.  Because of this lack of accurate data, HUD also incorporated a separate data extract from the Social Security Administration (SSA) in the 1996 report which was based on a random audit of 5,000 SSI recipients in 1994.  While the SSA data extract clearly demonstrates the complete inadequacy of AHS data, it was never designed as a tool to measure housing needs.  For example, it specifically excluded people with disabilities in certain settings, such as community residences, residential care facilities, institutions, treatment facilities, educational/vocational training settings, and emergency shelters.

<P>The table below illustrates the discrepancies in recent HUD estimates of the housing needs of people with disabilities:

<h4>CCD Housing Task Force Estimates Of Worst Case Housing Need</h4>

<P>Because of the undercounting of people with disabilities in HUD's reports, the CCD Housing Task Force has collected and analyzed data which provides a more accurate estimate of the number of people with disabilities currently experiencing an acute housing crisis.  

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force estimates that approximately 1.8 million people with disabilities receiving SSI benefits may have acute housing problems.  This estimate is 10 times greater than HUD's AHS 1996 estimate and twice the estimate HUD derived from the SSA audit data.  Significantly, this CCD estimate of housing needs still does not include any people with disabilities with income from sources other than SSI who may also be eligible for HUD assistance.  If these households were included, the total number of people with disabilities with worst case housing needs would undoubtedly increase.

<P>The chart below contrasts CCD estimates of the housing needs of people with disabilities with HUD's AHS estimate contained in the <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I>.

     </TR>
</TABLE>
</center>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force bases its estimate of worst case housing needs on:<P>
<ol>
<li>Generalizable data contained in HUD's 1996 report; 
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Social Security Administration report on all individuals receiving SSI benefits; and 
<P>
<LI>Information obtained from a national study of SSI income levels undertaken in 1992 entitled "A National Study of Housing Affordability for Recipients of Supplemental Security Income."<P>
</OL>
<P>The SSI income study, which was published in the May 1993 <I>Journal of Hospital and Community Psychiatry</I>, documented that, on average, SSI income levels nationally were equivalent to 23.85% of the median one person household income.  Based on this finding, all adults receiving SSI under age 62 are income eligible for HUD assistance and should be considered in a worst case housing needs assessment. 
<P>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force used an SSA report published in the fall of 1995 to calculate that there are approximately 3,125,000 adults with disabilities <I>under age 62 </I> who receive SSI benefits. HUD's <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> states that approximately 70% of unassisted households with incomes below 30% of area median have worst case housing needs.  Therefore 70% of people with disabilities receiving SSI can be considered to have worst case housing needs, except for those already receiving HUD assistance.

<P>HUD's own tenant data used in the 1996 report indicates that 565,000 adults with disabilities under age 62 are currently receiving HUD assistance.  CCD excluded all of these households and then calculated that 1,792,500 people with disabilities (70% of unassisted adult SSI recipients under age 62) have worst case housing needs.  Again, it is important to note that this is an SSI-based estimate and does not include other very low income people with disabilities with other sources of income.  When data is available on these individuals, the total estimate of worst case housing needs among people with disabilities will undoubtedly be higher.

<P>
<h4>The Housing Needs Of Elderly Households And Disabled Households</H4>
<P>The outcome of federal "elderly only" designated housing policies is that the supply of subsidized housing for people with disabilities will decline dramatically.  This decline directly benefits elderly households that will have exclusive access to the subsidized housing units no longer available to people with disabilities.  Given these housing supply dynamics, it is important to compare the housing needs of both groups, and their relative access to existing federally subsidized housing.  This information can then be used to guide federal housing policy and the future allocation of very limited federal housing resources.

<P>Unfortunately, HUD's <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I> is both confusing and misleading when trying to compare the relative housing needs of very low income elderly and disabled households.  By selectively using AHS data and SSA audit data on individuals receiving SSI,  HUD's report both <I>understates</I> the housing needs of people with disabilities using AHS data and <I>overstates</I> their use of federal housing assistance by relying on the SSA data extract.
<P>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has used its more accurate estimate of worst case housing needs among people with disabilities and HUD estimates of worst case housing needs of elderly households to begin to evaluate the impact of designated housing policies.  HUD data is used to illustrate the number of households receiving HUD assistance.

* <fontsize=-1> Only individuals receiving SSI</fontsize>


<P>CCD data indicates that 56% of people with disabilities on SSI have worst case housing needs, as compared to only 34% of very low income elderly households.  This chart also illustrates that elderly households currently benefit much more from federal housing assistance.  According to HUD's own occupancy data for 1995,  33% of very low income elderly households currently receive HUD assistance as compared to only 14% of people with disabilities living on SSI.   Significantly, HUD's <I>1996 Worst Case Housing Needs Report</I>  comments on the housing needs of people with disabilities, stating  that, "persons with disabilities living alone are consistently more likely than other worst case household types to have multiple housing problems because they frequently pay more than half their income for severely or moderately inadequate housing."  The 1996 HUD Report also comments on the housing needs of elderly households stating that, "strong targeting of housing assistance to the elderly and the protection from declines in real income enjoyed by many of these elderly (e.g. indexing of Social Security, SSI, and other pensions) have kept down the growth in worst case needs among the elderly."    

<P>In conclusion, it is clear that HUD has not made a meaningful effort to accurately assess the housing needs of people with disabilities, despite having been directed by the Congress to do so in section 661 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  The CCD Housing Task Force believes that HUD must develop more accurate methods of assessing the housing needs of people with disabilities -- methods which take into consideration their unique housing circumstances.   The CCD Housing Task Force assessment indicates that people with disabilities have a much higher rate of worst case housing needs, yet elderly households benefit much more from federal housing programs.  This disproportionate balance between housing needs and allocation of resources is a serious housing issue that must be addressed by federal housing policy makers as designated housing policies are implemented by public and assisted housing providers.

<H3>Opening Doors: Housing Needs And Housing Policy:An Analysis Of The Impact Of "Elderly Only" Designated Housing Policies</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>

<P>It seems clear that any federal housing policy, if it is to be based on documented housing needs, fairness, and an equitable distribution of resources, must address the critical and increasing shortage of housing for people with disabilities.  During the past few years, despite their documented worst case housing needs, the direction of federal housing policy regarding very low income people with disabilities has been to dramatically reduce, rather than to expand, the supply of federally funded subsidized housing available to them.

<P>Since 1992, tenant selection policies governing all efficiency and one-bedroom HUD subsidized housing resources in assisted and public housing programs (so-called elderly housing) have been modified to exclude or reduce the number of people with disabilities who are eligible and to permit housing providers to designate "elderly only" housing.  Through the implementation of Title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, and Section 10 of the Housing Opportunities Program Extension Act of 1996, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that the number of federally assisted housing units available to people with disabilities in HUD's public and assisted housing may be reduced by 40-50% or more during the next five years. 

<P>
<h4>The Loss Of Federally Subsidized Housing For People With Disabilities</h4>
<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has used HUD 1995 occupancy data to estimate the impact of designated housing policies on the distribution of HUD assisted and public housing units. Assuming a very conservative unit turnover rate of 8% per year, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that between 1994 and the year 2000, 62,250 of the 117,000 units of HUD assisted housing previously occupied by people with disabilities will eventually be occupied by elderly households - a reduction of 53%.  For HUD public housing, the CCD Housing Task Force assumed the same 8% turnover rate but applied it only prospectively from the year 1996 through the year 2000.  Based on these assumptions, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that 45,000 of the 112,500 units of HUD public housing currently occupied by people with disabilities will be occupied by elderly households by the year 2000 - a reduction of 40%.

<P>The table above clearly illustrates that elderly households benefit significantly from "elderly only" designated housing policies, since the supply of housing lost to younger people with disabilities represents an increase in the supply of subsidized housing available for households age 62 and over.  Elderly only designated housing policies result in elderly households increasing their utilization of public and assisted housing by more than 10% - an increase in supply of 120,750 units.  This shift in supply away from people with disabilities and to elderly households comes at a time when, according to HUD's <i>1994 Worst Case Housing Needs Report, </i>"[e]lderly families and individuals were <i>least</i> likely to have worst case needs (34%) and most likely to live in public or assisted housing (36%)."

<P>The shift of federally subsidized housing resources away from the group identified as having the highest incidence of worst case needs, to the group identified as having the lowest percentage of worst case needs, raises serious public policy issues regarding the impact of designated housing policies and the allocation of future federal housing resources.   Moreover, these statistics do not take into consideration the thousands of people with disabilities who were on public and assisted housing waiting lists and who would otherwise have been assisted were it not for designated housing policies.  

<P>
<H4>Adverse Impact On Housing Waiting Lists</H4>
<P>Because HUD does not collect data on the Public Housing Authority (PHA) or assisted housing waiting lists, it is difficult to estimate the number of people with disabilities on waiting lists that have been, or will be, displaced by "elderly only" designated housing policies.  However, the CCD Housing Task Force has used very conservative assumptions to estimate that at least 163,664 people with disabilities will be displaced from waiting lists due to designated housing policies, including 92,820 from HUD assisted housing lists, and 70,844 from public housing lists.

<P>During the "mixing" debate in 1992, PHA officials testified before Congress that one-third to one-half of the households on public housing waiting lists were people with disabilities under age 62.  Given the fact that there are approximately 537,000 units of  public housing for elderly and disabled households, it is reasonable to assume that PHA waiting lists contain at least that number of households, and that one third, or 162,878, are people with disabilities.  Assuming turnover of 8% per year over a five year period, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that 70,844 people with disabilities currently on waiting lists will be deprived of public housing units due to designated housing policies.  [See <a href="/housing/appendix.htm">Appendix</a>]

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has also estimated the impact of designated housing policies on HUD assisted housing waiting lists using slightly different assumptions. Unlike public housing, HUD assisted housing developments operate with project based lists.  As a result, people with disabilities have had more difficulty accessing these units, and their representation on waiting lists is undoubtedly lower.  Assuming that the total number of people on assisted housing waiting lists is at least equal to the total number of units available (663,000), that 25% of the waiting list is made up of people with disabilities, and a turnover rate of 8% since 1994, the CCD Housing Task Force estimates that 92,820 people with disabilities who were on HUD assisted housing waiting lists have been displaced due to designated housing policies. [See <a href="/housing/appendix.htm"> Appendix</a>]

<P>
Taken together, the data on the loss of housing units previously occupied by people with disabilities through turnover, and the loss of housing due to waiting list displacement, results in a conservative estimated loss of 273,954 federally subsidized housing units for people with disabilities.  This substantial loss of housing opportunity, which is a direct result of recent federal housing policies,  requires an immediate response from the federal government.

<H3>Opening Doors: The Federal Response To Date  1995-1996</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>In the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, the Congress and HUD attempted to create some protections for people with disabilities on PHA waiting lists through the PHA Allocation Plan process.  The Allocation Plan was designed to measure the impact that designating "elderly only" housing would have on people with disabilities and to identify alternative resources.  With enactment of the Housing Opportunities Program Extension Act of 1996, the protections for people with disabilities provided within the PHA Allocation Plan process have been virtually eliminated, increasing the likelihood that PHAs will designate housing without ensuring that adequate replacement resources are available.  

<P> As Congress and HUD moved towards this legislation in the fall of 1995, the housing rights of people with disabilities were completely ignored in the interest of expediting "elderly only" designated housing policies.  For example, the first draft of the Senate's version of public housing reform legislation (S. 1260) would have permitted the forced relocation of all people with disabilities under age 62 who were living  in public elderly housing, and who were in compliance with their lease, solely because they were disabled.  This draft was supported by HUD in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee in September of 1995.  Under the original provisions of the bill,  these about-to-be-displaced lease-compliant public housing tenants were also to be denied the protections provided in the Uniform Relocation Act.  

<P>S. 1260 represented the first time in the history of the Housing Act of 1937 that the federal government, absent the need to demolish or rehabilitate housing, was willing to forcibly relocate people from their federally subsidized homes and suspend their entitlement to lawful benefits.  

<P>It is significant that senior HUD officials did not even mention this forced relocation provision in their testimony to the Senate Banking Committee on S. 1260 given on September 28, 1995.  Rather, they indicated HUD's support for the provisions of the bill which addressed designated housing, which was echoed by all of the PHA officials who testified at the hearing.

<P>It remained the responsibility of the CCD Housing Task Force witness, whose testimony came at the very end of the Senate hearing, to point out the irreparable harm that would be caused to people with disabilities if the bill was enacted as drafted.  Once again, the CCD Housing Task Force was the lone advocate for over 112,000 people with disabilities who could have been forced by the federal government to leave their homes solely because they belong to an identified and stigmatized population group.

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force would like to believe that the discriminatory and stigmatizing provisions of the original version of S. 1260 represented the low point in the move to exclude or limit federal housing opportunities for people with disabilities.  The original draft of S. 1260 was an example of how, when inflamed rhetoric rather than good public policy dominates the debate, vulnerable populations can be threatened with irreparable harm.

<P>Other specific examples of the lack of an effective federal housing policy to address the needs of people with disabilities include:

<P>
<UL>
<LI>HUD's continued reliance on a single program (Section 811 Supportive Housing Program for Persons With Disabilities) to meet the housing needs of all  people with disabilities, despite published literature regarding the housing preferences of people with disabilities which demonstrates that they prefer a full range of housing options and to live in non-stigmatizing, integrated, and inclusionary housing. 
<P>
<LI>The disproportionate share of funding which is allocated to elderly housing, rather than housing for people with disabilities.  The FY 1996 HUD budget appropriated by Congress  allocated more than 77% of Section 202/811 funding to the Section 202 Supportive Housing Program for the Elderly and only 23% to the Section 811 Supportive Housing Program for People with Disabilities.  HUD's FY 1997 budget request includes the same inequitable distribution.  This allocation request was made despite the fact that housing for low income elderly households is increasing due to designated housing policies and despite the documented worst case housing needs of people with disabilities.
<P>
<LI>The lack of any effort on HUD's part to document the housing needs of people with disabilities in a 1995 report to the Congress which was required under Section 661 of Housing and Community Development Act of 1992.  HUD's report was poorly conceptualized, poorly prepared, and demonstrated a complete lack of effort on HUD's part to comply with a Congressional mandate to study the extent to which federal housing programs serve people with disabilities in relation to their housing needs.
</UL>
<P>It is time for the Congress and for HUD to confront the negative impact that the "elderly only" designated housing debate has had, and will continue to have, on the quality of life for low-income people with disabilities.  Steps must be taken immediately to:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Address the loss of resources caused by designation.<P>
<LI>Obtain accurate estimates of unmet and worst case housing needs of people with disabilities.<P>
<LI>Eradicate the ignorance, stigma, and discrimination which has characterized the "elderly only" housing debates.<P>
<LI>Develop more enlightened and balanced federal housing policies so that people with disabilities receive their fair share of all new federal housing resources based on their documented housing needs.

<H3>Opening Doors: CCD Federal Housing Policy Principles</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>Principles which guide the development of federal housing policy and the use of federal housing funds must provide clear direction and a comprehensive approach for addressing the housing needs of people with disabilities, as well as ensuring enforceable standards to address the housing discrimination which occurs when people with disabilities seek access to housing or attempt to participate in federally mandated housing planning activities.  

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force believes that it is the responsibility of the federal government and HUD to ensure that <B>all</B> federally funded housing activities emphasize both the civil rights and the housing rights of people with disabilities consistent with the provisions of the; (1) Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, (2) Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 and, (3) the Americans with Disabilities Act.

<P>In addition, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that the following principles should underpin federal housing policy for people with disabilities. 
<P>
<UL>
<li>Equity in Housing Resources - People with disabilities must receive an equitable share of the federal housing resources available within a framework that considers the extent of their unmet housing needs in relation to the existing inventory of housing resources available to them.  <P>
<LI>Expanding Housing Supply - Increasing the supply of affordable housing for people with disabilities should be achieved primarily within the context of a community's affordable housing activities and facilitated through generic and traditional housing providers including community based non-profit groups, as well as for-profit housing developers/managers. <P>	
<LI><B>Inclusion/Integration </B>- People with disabilities must be able to live in and fully participate in all aspects of community living by having the choice of non-stigmatizing housing opportunities that are integrated within communities and neighborhoods.  <P>	
<LI><B>Non-discrimination </B>- People with disabilities have the right to be free from discrimination in housing both in the rental and home ownership markets and in local zoning and land use policies. <P>
<LI><B>Housing Choice </B>- People with disabilities must have a choice of community housing options which reflect their personal values, needs, and housing preferences. <P>
<LI><B>Affordability </B>- Due to their extremely low incomes, people with disabilities must have access to affordable housing.<P>	
<LI><B>Quality, Safety and Accessibility </B>- All housing acquired or created for people with disabilities must be decent and safe.  Federal housing policy should also ensure an adequate supply of accessible housing.<P>
<LI><B>Access </B>- People with disabilities have the right to access housing on a variety of levels: as individuals, as members of communities, and as constituents of the affordable housing delivery system. <P>
<LI><B>Promote Separation of Housing from Services</B> - Federal housing policy for people with disabilities must promote the separation of housing from support services by emphasizing the desire and ability of people with disabilities to assume the roles and responsibilities of  tenants and/or homeowners. <P>		
<LI><B>Empowerment</B> - As housing consumers and customers, people with disabilities, advocates, and service providers, must be empowered to fully participate in all activities related to federal housing programs and policies, including community-based planning, housing development and rehabilitation, and housing management.<P></ul>

<H3>Opening Doors: CCD Federal Housing Policy Objectives</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>The CCD Housing Task Force believes if federal housing policy is to address the housing needs of people with disabilities, it must be responsive to the findings contained in the preamble to the Americans with Disabilities Act, which states:
<P>
<UL>

<I>individuals with disabilities...have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals, and resulting from stereotypic 
assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate and contribute to society."  </i>
</ul>
<P>Given the current intentions of both the Congress and HUD to devolve authority for the utilization of federal housing resources to states, local governments, and local communities, a key issue must be recognized and addressed.  That key issue, unfortunately, is that state and local government officials, housing developers and managers, and community-based housing non-profits lack a basic understanding of disability issues.  They are unaware of the housing preferences and unmet housing needs of people with disabilities, and continue to stigmatize and discriminate against people with disabilities in housing.  

<P>Therefore, the CCD Housing Task Force believes that, without clear policy direction and federal mandates to address the impact of designated housing policies, the issue will largely be ignored at the state and local level.  If this direction is to be provided there must also be a change in approach at the federal level. 

<P>Federal housing policy objectives to address the housing needs of people with disabilities must: 
<P>
<ul>
<li>Provide an immediate response to the loss of subsidized housing being experienced by people with disabilities with the authorization and appropriation of new subsidized housing resources targeted to address their worst case housing needs;<P>	

<li>Redirect to people with disabilities existing subsidized housing resources unaffected by designated housing policies (i.e. Section 8 rental subsidies) to minimize the displacement from subsidized housing waiting lists which has already occurred, and will continue to occur, during the foreseeable future.<P>

<li>Expand the use of new tenant based rental assistance as a quick response to the loss of project based housing within the assisted and public housing portfolios.<P>

<li>Ensure that all consolidated/formula grant funding for housing and community development activities provided to state and local governments include "minimum thresholds" allocated to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities.  In addition to minimum thresholds, specific performance objectives designed to meet the housing needs of people with disabilities should be adapted based on an analysis of the negative consequences of designated housing policies, worst case housing needs data provided by HUD, census data, and other local housing needs information provided by the disability community. <P>

<li>Ensure that within federal consolidated/formula grant funding, additional discretionary funding or bonus funds, are made available for demonstration programs that are designed to address the impact of designated housing policies and which represent innovative partnerships between the affordable housing and service delivery systems.  <P>	

<li>Assess financial penalties, by a reduction in entitlement or formula block grant funds to states and entitlement communities that do not meet minimum federal thresholds for meeting the housing needs of people with disabilities.<P>

<li>Discourage the implementation of housing policies which permit the designation of  "disabled only" housing.  Housing preference survey results clearly indicate that most people with disabilities strongly prefer integrated and inclusionary community-based housing that reduces the pervasive stigma and discrimination still experienced everyday by people with disabilities. <P>

<li>Ensure that federally mandated housing and community development strategic planning activities and processes (i.e. the Consolidated Plan, the Public Housing Authority Plan, etc.) require the full inclusion and active participation of people with disabilities, advocates, and services providers.<P>

<li>Ensure that federally mandated housing and community development strategic plans address the negative impact of designated housing policies through the implementation of strategies which are developed in partnership with the disability community.<P>

<li>Increase funding for fair housing activities that are specifically designed to address the housing discrimination that is experienced by people with disabilities, and that will effectively monitor the implementation of designated housing policies by assisted and public housing providers.<P>

<li>Require that federally mandated housing and community development strategic planning include activities which provide education to government officials and the community on disability issues as they relate to meeting housing needs, particularly "worst case" housing needs.<P>

<li>Fund technical assistance for the disability community on the changes in federal housing policy and the role of people with disabilities in a community's housing strategies - technical assistance must also be provided to enhance the capacity of community-based non-profits to expand the supply of housing for people with disabilities.<P>
	
<li>Ensure that the housing needs of people with disabilities are prioritized within the context of other federal housing policies and programs, including the Community Reinvestment Act, the Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, Farmer's Home Administration programs, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac.</ul>

<H3>Opening Doors: Specific Appropriation And Authorization Recommendations</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>The CCD Housing Task Force believes that during the next five years the total loss of subsidized housing opportunities for people with disabilities will be at least 273,914 units.  This number represents a 40-50% reduction in occupancy from the date of implementation of designated housing policies and a very conservative estimate of the number of individuals on public and assisted housing waiting lists who will have been denied an opportunity to move into public and assisted housing as a result of designation. 
<P>
<h4>Replacement Of Lost Housing </h4>

<P>The specific appropriation and authorization recommendations below are designed to <i>replace</i> units lost, rather than expand the housing supply.  They have been calculated based on reasonable Section 8 turnover projections and budgetary limitations. 
<P>
<OL>
<li>Authorization and appropriation of funds for 75,000 new Section 8 tenant based subsidies from FY 1997 -  FY 2001.<P>
	
<li>Redirection of Section 8 certificate and voucher turnover through a mandatory federal preference which would require one out of every three turnover subsidies to be issued to a person with a disability under age 62.<P>

<li>Redirection of 50% of the current Section 202 funding levels for FY '97 to a set-aside of Section 811 rental assistance to be directed towards communities experiencing the greatest negative impact on people with disabilities from designated housing policies.</ol>
<P>
<h4>Expansion Of Housing Options</h4>
<P>The specific appropriations and authorization recommendations below are designed to <I>expand </i>housing opportunities for people with disabilities based on their worst case housing needs. When considering these recommendations, it is important to emphasize that the CCD Housing Task Force is opposed to housing which is designated as "disabled-only" with the exception of projects for people with severe disabilities that are funded through  the Section 811 program.<P>

<ol>	
<li>Create specific set-asides within any future rental assistance or housing production programs to ensure that at least 33% of the resources are dedicated to meeting the housing needs of very low income people with disabilities under age 62.<P>

<li>Create specific "thresholds" within the CDBG and HOME programs which will ensure that people with disabilities receive their fair and equitable share of new federal housing funding that is targeted to expand the supply of affordable housing.  The CCD recommends a 10% threshold in the CDBG program and a 33% threshold in the HOME program.<p>

<li>Re-authorize the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit Program, which has proven to be an excellent mechanism for expanding the supply of supportive housing for people with disabilities.<P>
	
<li>Maximize the use of HUD McKinney funds for the provision of permanent housing for people with disabilities who are homeless, and encourage the utilization of mainstream service funding for the provision of services and supports.<P>

<li>Create "self-sufficiency" policies linked to federal housing programs that are responsive to the specific needs of people with disabilities.<P>

<li>Create a home ownership demonstration program targeted to people with disabilities on SSI, and other very low income people with disabilities who are typically not included in federally funded home ownership initiatives.   This demonstration program could be linked with Fannie Mae's development of  a mortgage product targeted to people with disabilities receiving SSI benefits. <P>

<li>Provide incentives for PHAs to direct capital funding to increase the number of one-bedroom units for people with disabilities in family public housing which typically only contains two, three, and four bedroom units.<P>
	
<li>Provide "bonus" funding for PHAs who choose to maintain "mixed" housing for elderly people and people with disabilities.<P>

<li>Expand the Fair Housing Initiatives Program to specifically include monitoring of public and assisted housing providers implementing designated housing policies. </ol>
<P>
<h4>Recommendations Regarding The Section 811 Program</h4>
<P>
<OL>
<li>Section 811 program funding should be made available only to non-profit organizations.  The CCD Housing Task Force strongly opposes any attempt to permit PHAs to apply for Section 811 funding  both under its current structure (capital advances and project-based rental assistance) and under any tenant-based rental assistance structure.<P>

<li>The capital advance and long-term project-based rental assistance contract components under the Section 811 program should be maintained as eligible activities. <P>

<li>The activities authorized under Section 811 should be expanded to include the use of long term (5-10 year) project-based rental assistance that is not linked to Section 811 capital advances. <P>

<li>Incentives should be incorporated to encourage non-profit organizations to develop independent housing models with Section 811 funds, including condominium purchases, limited equity cooperatives, and scattered site housing. </ol>
<P>
<h4>Recommendations For Technical Assistance </h4>

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force recommends that a comprehensive affordable housing technical assistance initiative be developed and funded that is specifically targeted to people with disabilities, advocates, and service providers to:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Increase affordable housing opportunities and choices for people with disabilities in local communities through better access and use of federal, state, and local affordable housing resources; and
<P>
<li>Strengthen the capacity of organizations representing people with disabilities to assume a leadership role within their states and local communities on affordable housing issues and strategies, with a specific emphasis on the Consolidated Plan.</ul>

<P>The specific goals of a technical assistance initiative would be to:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Enhance the ability of individuals and organizations representing different disability groups to work together collaboratively and collectively on common housing strategies.
<P>
<li>Increase the disability community's knowledge and understanding of the affordable housing delivery system and the mainstream affordable housing resources controlled by that system that can expand housing opportunities for people with disabilities.
<P>
<li>Assist the disability community to accurately quantify the loss of federally subsidized housing in local communities as a result of "elderly only" designated housing policies.
<P>
<li>Educate the disability community on current and impending changes to federal housing policies and programs, including the federally mandated Consolidated Plan, and how it can be used to ensure that people with disabilities receive an equitable share of federal housing block grant funds, rental subsidies, and public housing resources.
<P>
<li>Facilitate the participation of the disability community in the development of state and local affordable housing strategies within the Consolidated Plan process, so that housing for people with disabilities is included in state and local communities' housing strategies and policies.
<P>
<li>Educate people with disabilities and advocates on how to effectively use the Fair Housing Laws to protect people with disabilities from discrimination in housing programs and policies.</ul>

<H3>Opening Doors: Conclusion</H3>
<H4 align=right><A HREF="/housing/sperling.htm#open">Return to Table of Contents</A></H4>
<HR>
<P>People with disabilities strongly prefer to, and increasingly do, live independent and productive lives in their own homes in our communities.  However, more than any other population group, people with disabilities are most likely to experience acute housing problems - problems of stigma and discrimination, affordability, and access to safe and decent housing.  People with disabilities, particularly those who rely exclusively on SSI benefits, are also among the lowest income households in the country, and often do not have the financial resources to obtain decent and safe housing that meets their needs and preferences.

<P>Recent changes in federal housing policy, namely the designation of federal public and assisted housing as "elderly only," will dramatically worsen the housing plight of people with disabilities.  The profound implications of this policy change which began in 1992 can no longer be ignored by the federal government and the affordable housing system.  Federal housing resources must be reallocated to address the negative consequences that people with disabilities are experiencing from this legislation, consequences that are clearly spelled out in this report.

<P>The CCD Housing Task Force has put forth a series of recommendations that must be implemented to address the acute and increasing housing crisis faced by people with disabilities in this country today.  The recommendations are based on the principle of equity -- that is, people with disabilities are entitled to a "fair share" of the existing and new federal housing resources that are available in communities across the country. 

<P>Even at a time of severe budget constraints, the federal government has an obligation to replace the housing resources that have been taken away from people with disabilities during the past four years and that will continue to be lost to them as the designation of "elderly only" housing expands.  The federal government and policy makers must ensure that federal mainstream housing resources are made available to meet the housing needs.  People with disabilities, along with their family members, advocates, service providers, and the members of the CCD Housing Task Force will continue to urge federal officials, policy makers, and the affordable housing system to "open the doors."

<B>i.</B>A provision was included in P.L. 104-120 to authorize funds for Section 8 tenant-based rental assistance specifically for people with disabilities.  As Opening Doors went to press, the future of this set-aside was in the hands of Congressional appropriators who were considering HUD's Fiscal Year 1997 budget.<P>

<B>ii.</B>  To arrive at a truly valid estimate of the number of  people with disabilities who may qualify as having worst case housing needs, people with disabilities who are not receiving  SSI benefits but have incomes below 50% of median must also be included.  Because this estimate is difficult to obtain without further study, the CCD estimates also represent an undercounting of the total number of people with disabilities who have worst case housing needs.<P>

<B>iii.</B>  It is very likely that a significant percentage of these 565,000 individuals have income from sources other than SSI, however, because it was impossible to determine the exact number of people with disabilities on SSI that are assisted by HUD the CCD Housing Task Force used the 565,000 figure in its calculations.<P>

<B>iv.</B>  "The CCD Housing Task Force takes issue with HUD's use of less reliable data from the SSI data extract to estimate the number of people with disabilities currently receiving HUD assistance.  Based on an audit of only 5,000 SSI recipients (which was never designed nor intended to be used as an accurate measure of federal housing assistance provided to people with disabilities) HUD erroneously concludes that "adults with disabilities are heavily served by housing assistance programs."  HUD's willingness to ignore its own primary data within the MTCS and TRACS systems, which document much lower utilization of federal housing assistance for people with disabilities, could be construed as an attempt to mitigate the negative impact of designated housing policies on people with disabilities and minimize the need to allocate replacement resources."<P>

<B>v.</B>   The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Office of Policy Development and Research reports that recent turnover rates in subsidized housing are in excess of 10%.<P>

<B>vi.</B>    Although public housing authorities have been able to designate housing as "elderly only" for several years, the Housing Opportunities Program Extension Act of 1996 has removed most of the protections provided for people with disabilities in earlier legislation. As a result, public housing agencies are expected to increase their "elderly only" designation activities.</fontsize>

<H3>National Alliance For The Mentally Ill And National Task Force Urge Federal Government To Find Housing For 1.8 Million Americans With Disabilities</H3>
<P>

<HR>
<CENTER><I>Panel Charges Available Housing for People With Disabilities Will Drop 50 Percent
Due to New Law That Reserves Much Public and Assisted Housing for the Elderly
</I></CENTER><P>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--Explaining that people with severe mental illness are facing a critical shortage in safe, affordable housing, NAMI in partnership with the national task force today called on the federal government to take steps to replace the housing lost to people with disabilities due to the creation of "elderly only" public and assisted housing.  Included in their recommendations are a more equitable share of existing housing resources as well as new resources for housing for people with disabilities.
<P>
The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities (CCD) Housing Task Force and the Boston-based Technical Assistance Collaborative project found that as many as 1.8 million people with disabilities may be in need of federally subsidized housing.  This includes people with mental retardation, mental illness, cerebral palsy, and a variety of other physical and mental disabilities.  NAMI Public Policy Director Andrew Sperling serves as a co-chair of the CCD Housing Task Force.
<P>
As the number of people with disabilities grows, the number of available housing units is shrinking, according to the task force report.  As a result, the housing shortage is limiting the ability of people with disabilities to lead full and independent lives within their own communities.  Without access to affordable housing in the community, they face institutionalization or homelessness.
<P>
In <I><A HREF="#open">Opening Doors:  Recommendations For A Federal Policy To Address The Housing Needs of People With Disabilities</A></I>, NAMI and the task force warn that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has significantly underestimated the number of people with disabilities who have priority housing needs.  After carrying out an in-depth analysis of available data, the task force found that the number of people with disabilities receiving Supplemental 
Security Income (SSI) benefits who may have acute housing problems is 1.8 million, 10 times higher than HUD estimates.  The tasks force number does not include the many people with disabilities who have income other than SSI but still may be eligible for HUD assistance.
<P>
The CCD Housing Task Force, which has been working on this issue of housing loss for five years, is co-chair by representatives of the American Network of Community Options and Resources, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and the ARC.  Among the task force member groups are the National Easter Seals Society, United Cerebral Palsy Association, National Association of Developmental Disabilities Councils, Brain Injury Association, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and others.  Together these organizations represent millions of people with a variety of disabilities nationwide.
<P>
One of the single most important factors in the reduction in housing for people with disabilities was the 1992 decision by Congress to allow "elderly only" subsidized housing.  That legislation permitted both Public Housing Authorities and HUD-assisted housing providers to limit or exclude people with disabilities from living in certain subsidized housing developments by designating that housing as "elderly only."  This problem was exacerbated by legislation passed this year which makes it easier for public housing authorities to designate housing.
<P>
The task force has now been able to quantify the impact of this "elderly only" policy enacted by Congress in 1992 and 1996.
<P>
Because of this policy, the supply of public and assisted housing units that was previously occupied by people with disabilities will shrink by at least 50 percent.  Based on estimates of the number of people with disabilities who will be displaced from subsidized housing and waiting lists, there will be a decrease of at least 273,000 units that would have otherwise been occupied by people with disabilities.
<P>
"People with severe mental illness are losing their housing, and with that they are losing the opportunity to live full and productive lives in the community," said Andrew Sperling of NAMI, co-chairman of the task force.  "We are not suggesting that the federal government stop subsidizing housing for the elderly.  However, they cannot shift 273,000 homes away from people with disabilities to the elderly and just ignore the impact that this has on the lives of people with disabilities.  Congress must replace the available housing units and subsidies that would have been open to people with disabilities under age 62."
<P>
In addition to the "elderly only" housing designation, a myriad of factors have contributed to the shortage of affordable housing for people with disabilities.  The task force cited:
<P>
<UL>
	
<LI>the stigma and discrimination faced by people with disabilities, particularly people with severe and persistent mental illness;
<P>
<LI>the absence of clear mandates within federal housing programs and policies to expand the supply of federally funded housing for people with disabilities; and
<P>
<LI>underfunding of federal tenant-based rental assistance programs</UL>
<P>
Without a clearly articulated housing policy and new monies to address the loss of available housing to people with disabilities, their already acute housing problems will increase.  Using very conservative turnover rates, the task force estimates that by the year 2000:
<P><UL>
<LI>more than 100,000 units occupied by people with disabilities will convert to "elderly only" units;
<P>
<LI>more than 160,000 people with disabilities on waiting lists who would have otherwise been offered a subsidized housing unit will be told that they are no longer eligible to move in; and
<P>
<LI>an unknown number of people with disabilities who would have applied for admission to federally subsidized housing will have no other affordable housing options available.
</UL>
<P>
The major question is:  Where will people with disabilities, many of who have been on subsidized housing waiting lists for years, find alternative housing resources?  What about people with disabilities who were previously eligible to apply for this housing who will now be turned away?  What about people with disabilities living in institutions who should be living in the community?
<P>
In the Opening Doors report, the task force states that "people with disabilities are entitled to an equitable share of federal housing resources, even in an era of federal fiscal constraints."  To address the increasing affordable housing crisis, the task force recommends that the federal government take the following actions:
<P><UL>
<LI>authorize and appropriate funds for 75,000 new Section 8 tenant-based subsidies for people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>redirect the federal law to require that one out of every three Section 8 turnover subsidies be issued to a person with a disability under age 62;
<P>
<LI>redirect at least 50 percent of current Section 202 funding, which designates affordable housing for the elderly, to set aside rental assistance for communities experiencing the greatest negative impact of designated housing policies on available housing for people with disabilities;
<P>
<LI>promote the expansion of affordable housing for people with disabilities by creating "thresholds" in the Community Development Block Grant and HOME-formula grant programs.  The HOME program is designed to help states, local governments, and Indian tribes to implement local housing strategies for low- and very low-income Americans;
<P>
<LI>reauthorize the federal Low Income Housing Tax Credit program to expand the supply of affordable housing that can be accessed by people with disabilities;
<P>

<DT><B><I><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>FDA Recommends Approval of
Sertindole</FONT></FONT></I></B></DT>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">On July 15, 1996, the Psycholpharmacologc Drugs
Advisory Committee to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) voted
to recommend that Serlect ( Abbotts Brand Name for sertindole) be approved
for the treatment of psychotic disorders. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Among the data reviewed by the committee were
the results of a seven-arm, multi-center, double-blind, eight week clinical
trial comparing three doses of Serlect (12, 20 and 24 mg/day) to three
doses of haloperidol (4, 8 and 16 mg/day) and placebo. In the study, all
Serlect doses and haloperidol doses showed significant improvement in the
positive symptoms of schizophrenia compared with placebo and in reducing
the total scores on the Positive and Negative Symptoms Scale (PANSS). Only
Serlect at a dose of 20 mg/day improved negative symptoms, as measured
by PANSS Negative Symptom Subscale. On a comprehensive, global scale of
improvement, all doses of Serlect and haloperidol were associated with
significant improvement compared to placebo. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The positive symptoms of schizophrenia include
delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech and behavior. Negative
symptoms include apathy, social withdrawal, and decrease in productivity
of thought and speech. Patients using haloperidol experienced motor side
effects called extrapyramidal symptoms, or EPS, at rates significantly
higher than those given placebo. EPS profiles for Serlect at all doses
were clinically and statistically indistinguishable from placebo. In addition,
patients treated with any of the three doses of Serlect exhibited less
EPS than patients using any of the three doses of haloperidol. Researchers
measured EPS rates by the number of EPS-related adverse events, use of
anti-EPS medication, and three standard movement rating scales. This EPS-profile
is important because EPS can be extremely disabling, can cause severe discomfort,
and may reduce treatment compliance. This is also important because studies
show that, among patients receiving currently available short-term treatment,
as many as 70 percent may have some clinically important EPS side effects.
While recommending approval, the committee discussed the need to make patients
aware of a condition that potentially increases the risk of abnormal heart
rhythms. In clinical studies, approximately 4 percent of patients showed
an increase in QT intervals -- alterations in the hearts usual rhythm.
QT interval prolongation is sometimes a precursor for serious alterations
of heart rhythm. In clinical trials, adverse events with an incidence of
5 percent or more in patients treated with sertindole and at least twice
that of placebo were: nasal congestion, dry mouth, abnormal ejaculation,
and vaginitis. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">In clinical trials, Serlect was administered
once daily in a capsule formulation. It is a novel, limbic-selective antipsychotic
drug. As with other antipsychotics, the exact mechanism of action of Serlect
is not known. However, in pre-clinical studies, Serlect was demonstrated
to be a potent antagonist at dopamine D2 , serotonin 5HT2 and alpha1 receptors
without activity at histimatic H1 or muscarinic receptors. This selectivity
suggests that Serlect mitigates both the positive and negative symptoms
of schizophrenia, but should not produce sedative effects or anticholinergic
effects related to these other receptors. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">A study published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry shows that clozapine leads to a reduction in smoking among patients
with schizophrenia. The prevalence of smoking in this group of patients
runs as high as 90 percent. Several factors may account for these higher
rates of smoking, including alleviation of depressive, psychotic and anxiety
symptoms through the effects of nicotine on relevant neurotransmitter systems.
Smoking also may relieve some of the side effects of psychotropic medications.
Tony George, M.D., a coinvestigator at the Yale University Connecticut
Mental Health Center in New Haven, reports studying 29 outpatients enrolled
in the clozapine clinic of a community mental health center. The most significant
decrease was associated with the heavier smokers. There also are anecdotal
reports linking clozapine to reduced alcohol and opiate craving. </FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">Signed into law by Governor Edgar on December
15, 1995, The Treatment Preference Act will enable those receiving mental
health services to plan for the types of services they may need in the
event their judgement becomes impaired due to their illness. In the Declaration
for Mental Health Treatment, you assign an attorney-in-fact to act on
your behalf, who follows your pre-ordained, written instructions. These
instructions determine whether you are to receive psychotropic medications,
the types of medications you are willing to receive, whether or not you
desire electroconvulsive therapy, and whether you are willing to be admitted
on a short-term basis (no longer than 17 days) to a treatment facility.
The instructions which you include in the Declaration will only be valid
if 2 phsycians, or a court, find you incapable of making treatment decisions.
Otherwise, you will be considered capable to give or withhold informed
consent. You may also revoke the Declaration, either in part or in its
entirety, at any time you are considered capable by a physician to give
or withhold informed consent. Otherwise, the Declaration remains in effect

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0"><FONT SIZE=+1>Lillys Zyprexa (olanzapine)
Cleared for Marketing for Treatment of Psychotic Disorders </FONT></FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#0000A0">The United States Food and Drug Administration
has granted Eli Lilly and Company permission to market Zyprexa (olanzapine)
for the treatment of the symptoms of psychotic disorders. This is the second
major regulatory clearance for Zyprexa. Zyprexa was cleared for marketing
in 15 European countries by the European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA)
on September 27, 1996. Zyprexa has demonstrated a promising therapeutic
profile, including once daily dosing, low risk of drug interactions, no
requirement for blood monitoring and a therapeutic starting dose without
a requirement for titration in most patients. In clinical trials, patients
were assessed using several test instruments, including the Brief Psychiatric
Rating Scale (BPRS), an 18-item inventory of symptoms traditionally used
to evaluate the effects of drug treatment in psychosis. The BPRS score
was extracted from the Positive and Negative Syndrome scale (PANSS), a
30-item rating instrument that evaluates each symptom item on a scale of
1 (absent) to 7 (extreme). The BPRS psychosis cluster assessed psychotic
symptoms, such as conceptual disorganization, hallucinatory behavior, suspiciousness
and unusual thought content. A second assessment, the Clinical Global Impression
(CGI) measures the overall severity of the illness. In addition, patients
were evaluated on the PANSS and the Scale for Assessing Negative symptoms.
In a sic-week, placebo-controlled trial involving 149 patients, patients
received either placebo or a fixed dose of Zyprexa at 1 and 10 mg/day.
In this trial, Zyprexa at 10 mg/day (but not 1 mg/day) was superior to
placebo on the PANSS total score, the BPRS total, the BPRS psychosis cluster,
the PANSS negative symptom subscale and on CGI severity. In a six-week,
placebo controlled trial involving 253 patients, patients received placebo
or one of three fixed dose ranges of Zyprexa (5 &plusmn; 2.5 mg/day and
15 &plusmn; 2.5 mg/day). the two highest Zyprexa dose was statistically
superior to placebo on the SANS. The overall rate of early discontinuation
due to an adverse event was comparable to placebo. Lillys clinical trials
also included a 1,996-patient trial in which patients were given either
Zyprexa or the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic. In addition, Lilly
is currently conducting trials comparing Zyprexa with other new antipsychotics
on the market. Many currently available older antipsychotic medications,
although effective, have been linked to extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) events,
including abnormal muscle spasms, Parkinsons-disease like symptoms, abnormal
jerking or writhing, and an inability to sit still. Clinical studies have
associated Zyprexa with a low incidence of EPS. In clinical trials, treatment-emergent
EPS assessed by formal rating scales occurred at incidences comparable
to placebo. As assessed by these scales, the incidence of EPS did not increase
as the dose of Zyprexa was increased. Given the concern about agranulocytosis,
a sometimes fatal blood disorder associated with other psychotropic compounds,
careful attention was given to the examination of hematologic parameters
in clinical trials. There is no indication of a risk of clinically significant
agranulocytosis associated with olanzapine treatment. Consequently, Zyprexa
patients will not have to submit to weekly blood monitoring tests. As with
all antipsychotics, Zyprexa was associated with some side effects. In acute-phase,
placebo-controlled trials, the most frequently observed treatment-emergent
events associated with olanzapine at an incidence statistically greater
than placebo were somnolence, dizziness and weight gain. The incidence
of elevated hepatic trasaminase levels was greater with Zyprexa; these
elevations were generally transient and asymptomatic. About 1 percent of
patients in clinical trials discontinued treatment due to transaminase
increases. Other commonly observed adverse events associated with the use
of Zyprexa were constipation, personality disorder and postural hypotension;
these event rates were not statistically greater than placebo. In only
one analysis of a placebo-controlled study, only one specific form of EPS,
akathesia, was reported significantly more often with Zyprexa (at 10 &plusmn;
2.5 mg/day or 15 &plusmn; 2.5 mg/day) compared with placebo.</FONT></B>

<HR SIZE=4>
<P>The Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Maryland is a self-help and advocacy group whose members are relatives and friends of persons with serious mental illness, and mentally ill persons themselves.  We are more than 1,700 families in eighteen local affiliates in all parts of Maryland.  Our goals are: </P>

<UL>
<LI>To provide support to families who must cope with the problems presented by serious mental illness;
<LI>To educate our members and the public about serious mental illness in order to change perceptions and overcome stigma;
<LI>To advocate for a comprehensive system of care and treatment for persons with mental illness in every community in Maryland; and
<LI>To advocate for increased support for research about serious mental illness by private institutions and the government.
</UL>
<BR>
<P> 
We are affiliated with the  <A HREF="http://www.nami.org"> National Alliance for the Mentally Ill</A>, a national organization of over 1,000 affiliated groups in all 50 states and Canada.  All NAMI members share the same goals and work to achieve them on the national, state, and local levels.  All of us accept the findings of current scientific research that schizophrenia and the major affective disorders are biologically caused brain diseases.
</P>

<P>AMI of Maryland has 501(c)(3) (non-profit) status with the Internal Revenue Service.</P><BR>

<IMG SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>History and Activities of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Maryland</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>


<P>AMI of Maryland was incorporated in 1983.  Representatives from AMI of Montgomery County and AMI of Baltimore worked together to create a state-wide organization.  The goal was to establish affiliates in all parts of Maryland and to work together to speak with one voice on Maryland public policy issues affecting  persons with severe and persistent mental illness. </P>

<P>Within a few years, there were 18 affiliates across Maryland.  AMI of Maryland formed coalitions with other organizations to work effectively with the State of  Maryland Mental Hygiene Administration and state legislators on issues such as:</P>
<UL>
<LI> the annual Mental Hygiene Administration fiscal budget priorities 
<LI> the rights of mentally ill persons in state facilities
<LI> development of 5 year plans for mental health services
<LI> insurance parity for mental health
<LI> the managed care Medicaid waiver

</UL>

<P>Our annual conventions help educate and inform our members and others interested in the welfare of persons with mental illness in Maryland.  Our conventions usually feature speakers on issues currently affecting those with mental illness, as well as lectures by key researchers on the latest news on advances in research on neurological brain disorders.  Workshops span a wide range of topics of interest.</P>

<P>Other activities include a quarterly newsletter and an annual fund-raising event.  AMI of Maryland usually has several state-wide projects active at any given time. Some of our current  projects:<P>
<UL>

<LI> Support of Care-Givers of Elderly Persons with Mental Illness
<LI> Opening Minds, Improving Lives - Anti-Stigma Campaign
<LI> Medicaid Managed Care/Service System
</UL>

<P>We will be starting the Journey of Hope program in the fall of 1996. The Journey of Hope program trains family members to provide courses on mental illness and advocacy to other family members.  Past projects include outreach to minorities and a project to strengthen our affiliates.</P>

<h1>What is Mental Illness?</h1>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Mental illness refers to a group of disorders causing severe disturbances in 
thinking, feeling, and relating.  They result in a substantially diminished capacity for coping with 
the ordinary demands of life.  Mental illnesses can affect persons of any age -- children, 
adolescents, adults, and the elderly -- and they can occur in any family.  Several million people in 
the U. S. suffer from a serious, long term mental illness.  The cost to society is high due to lost 
productivity and treatment expense.</P>

<P>Mental illness is not the same as mental retardation.  The mentally retarded have a diminished intellectual capacity usually present since birth.  Those with mental illnesses are usually of normal intelligence although they may have difficulty performing at a normal level due to their illness.</P>

<P>A mental illness is not caused by bad parenting and is not a character weakness or flaw.  These 
illnesses are due to biochemical disturbances in the brain -- they are neurobiological disorders.</P>
<BR>
<A NAME="Schizophrenia">
</A>
[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]<BR>
<h4>Schizophrenia</h4>
<P>Schizophrenia is one of the most serious and disabling of the mental illnesses.  It affects 
approximately one person in a hundred, men and women about equally. The onset is usually in the late 
teens or early twenties.  People with this brain disorder usually have several of the following 
symptoms:</P>
<ul>
<li>disconnected, confusing language
<li>poor reasoning, memory, judgment
<li>high levels of anxiety
<li>eating and sleeping disorders
<li>hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not externally real)
<li>delusions (persistent false beliefs, contrary to facts or without evidence)
<li>deterioration of appearance and personal hygiene
<li>loss of motivation, poor concentration
<li>tendencies to withdraw from others
</ul>


<BR>
[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]<BR>
<A NAME="Affective Disorders">
</A>
<h4>Affective Disorders</h4>
<P>Affective disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses. They are also called mood disorders.
Many cases go unrecognized and untreated.  The disorder may be <b>Bipolar</b> (manic depressive) in 
which a person swings between extreme high and low moods, or it may be <b>Unipolar</b> in which a 
person suffers from persistent severe depression.  Without proper medical treatment, such persons 
experience repeated or continuous periods of illness and perhaps hospitalization.  About six percent of  the population suffers from an affective disorder.   These disorders are a major cause of suicide.</P>

<p>
Persons diagnosed as having <b>Bipolar Disorder</b> cycle between manic and depressive phases, and 
usually have several of the following characteristics during a manic phase:
<ul>
   <li>boundless energy, enthusiasm, and need for activity
   <li>decreased need for sleep
   <li>grandiose ideas and poor judgment
   <li>rapid, loud disorganized speech
   <li>short temper and argumentative
   <li>impulsive and erratic behavior
   <li>possible delusional thinking
</ul>
<BR>
<p>
Persons with <b>Unipolar Depression</b>, or the depressive phase of  <b>Bipolar Disorder </b>, may have several 
of the following symptoms:
<ul>
   <li>difficulty in sleeping
   <li>loss of interest in daily activities
   <li>loss of appetite
   <li>feelings of worthlessness, guilt and hopelessness
   <li>feelings of despondence or sadness
   <li>inability to concentrate
   <li>possible psychotic symptoms
   <li>suicidal thoughts or actions
</ul>

[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]<BR>
<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><h1>What causes Mental Illness?</h1>
<HR SIZE=4>
<P>The causes of mental illnesses are not as well understood as other physical diseases, 
but research is providing useful information on the functioning of neurotransmitters and brain 
chemistry that is involved.  Heredity may be a factor as it is in diabetes and cancer.  Stress or use 
of "street" drugs may contribute to the onset of an illness in a vulnerable person.</P>
<p>
<STRONG>Mental illnesses are medical diseases of the brain, and are treatable just as 
heart disease or lung disease.</STRONG>
<p>
The shame and fear once associated with cancer has been largely dispelled by accurate information and 
understanding.  The same will happen for brain diseases -- mental illnesses -- once the facts are 
known and shared.</P>
<A NAME="Can MI be cured or prevented?">
</A>
[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]
<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif">
<h1>Can Mental Illness be cured or prevented?</h1>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Since the causes of long term mental illnesses are not known, there is no effective prevention 
nor cure at this time.  More research is needed to determine causes and strategies for prevention.
However, adequate care and proper treatment, including medication, can substantially improve the 
functioning of persons suffering from these disabling illnesses.

</CENTER>


<P>The following principles of AMI of MD address privacy and confidentiality issues with regard to data collection for the Maryland medical care database by any entities concerned with mental illness/neurological brain disorders.  These principles will guide us as we adopt positions on state and federal legislation and as we review and recommend regulations or regulation changes to existing laws.</P>

<H4>Principle #1:</H4>

<P>We believe that providing management information for use in public policy decisions concerning health is important, but this should only be done with proper safeguards in place to protect privacy and confidentiality.</P>

<H4>Principle #2:</H4>

<P>Entities responsible for collecting data and keeping it secure should have accountability including appropriate consequences for any violations or breaches of privacy and confidentiality which occur with the data or use of the data.  The laws pertaining to data collection of this nature should include provisions for blanket prohibition for use of the data other than its original intended purpose and a review process should be put in place if there is proposed use of the data other than its original intended purpose.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Persons responsible for providing primary care or shelter for an adult person with serious mental illness have a right to certain basic information about the client.  That information must include: diagnosis; behavioral expectations; acknowledgement of admission to or discharge from a treatment facility; the name of the medication(s) prescribed;  possible side effects of prescribed medication(s); aftercare plans for persons who have been hospitalized; and information about community education/support opportunities for the care giver.</P>

<P>Service providers must be required to ask clients to sign a care giver release of information consent form.  If a client refuses to sign a release of information consent form, a primary care giver can submit a written request to a mental health professional providing care and treatment to the client.  The client must be informed of the written request.  A process should be established so that the patient can appeal approval, and a primary care giver can appeal denial of this request.</P> 

<P>The above information is based on a law enacted in Rhode Island in 1993 to help primary care givers work more effectively with persons with serious mental illnesses.</P>

<H1><STRONG>Background</STRONG></H1><BR>

<HR SIZE=4>
<P>The Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Maryland (AMI) advocates on behalf of the nearly 134,000 Maryland families whose relatives suffer from serious mental illness (schizophrenia, bi-polar illness, chronic depression).  AMI believes that services for the mentally ill are fragmented under the current system and that the family provides a vital link between the client, and these uncoordinated services by serving as the constant in the continuum of care.  In a more perfect world, with computer tracking systems and service providers that are fully aware of prior treatment received by the client, family intervention might not be as necessary to obtain proper services.</P>

<P>Since the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960's, families have assumed an increasing role in caring for persons with chronic mental illness.  Recent research data demonstrates the effectiveness of treatment approaches that include the family as part of  the treatment, and supports the concept that families are helpful to the recovery of the ill family member.  Families are unduly burdened when their relative refuses treatment for their illness.  Families may be the first persons to recognize changes in mood and personality, especially if the relative is living with their family.  When persons with a mental illness do not give permission to service providers, confidentiality laws prevent service providers from exchanging helpful information with care providers.  This confidentiality issue impedes the family's ability to best address their relative's needs.  If the family does not have basic information, such as their relative's service provider (psychiatrist, social worker, case manager, treatment team, etc.) then they cannot make initial contact for help, and they must watch their relative deteriorate until there is outside intervention from police, neighbor's complaints, employers, etc.</P>

<P>Community care for many individuals occurs in the family home with relatives assuming the role of care giver.  Many times, the client does not reside in the family home, yet the family is still involved in the well being of the client in the community, such as when the family is payee for their relative receiving entitlement benefits.  Families often take a relative into their homes without a clear understanding of the dynamics of the client's illness and without the benefit of information necessary for the proper care of the client.  In some cases this may cause a danger to the client or other members of the household.</P>

<UL>
<LH><STRONG>Problems of not having basic information about mental illnesses are:</STRONG></LH>

<LI>unrealistic expectations by family members/care givers as to the client's ability to perform tasks put additional stress on client, leading to an exacerbation of symptoms and possible relapse;
<LI>lack of family support/advocacy for their relative and aggravation of already strained family relations;
<LI>the potential for violence toward client or family, especially if families have not developed sound coping skills based on accurate information, i.e., not having a clear understanding of what to expect from the client based on diagnosis.
</UL>
<BR>
<UL>
<LH><STRONG>Benefits of having basic information about mental illness are:</STRONG>
</LH>
<LI>early interventions to avoid hospitalization, reducing cost of care;
<LI>strong community support for client;
<LI>family knowledge and observational feedback to treatment provider(s);
<LI>increased knowledge encourages family to support treatment modalities and medication regimens, and to report changes and concerns to care providers;
</UL>

<P>By allowing certain basic information to be shared with family members/primary care givers, the client will enjoy a continuum of care heretofore not provided under the current system.  When a client is transitioned from an in-patient unit or even from one treating team to another, or if that person changes psychiatrists, if its has been established that this family, friend or care giver has been involved in the person's care, there must be an exchange of basic information to assist that client in the community.  That information must include the name of the treating person or facility responsible for delivering care to the client, diagnosis, medications and possible side effects, and information about where to obtain more information/support for the care provider.</P>

  <H1><STRONG>Managed Care Principles of AMI of MD</STRONG></H1>
<H3>Adopted March, 1996</H3>
<IMG SRC="gif/line_blu.gif"><BR>
</CENTER>

<P>This policy statement by the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of Maryland (AMI of MD) was developed in the context of the rapid restructuring of the public mental health care system.</P>

<P>AMI  of MD's Principles for Managed Care are:</P>

<P>1. Maryland must continue to be accountable for the delivery of treatment and services for persons with severe and persistent brain disorders ("mental illness").  Maryland cannot relinquish this responsibility, even when contracting out the services.</P>

<P>2.The priority population must include all eligible adolescents, adults and elderly persons with severe and persistent brain disorders ("mental illness").</P>

<P>3.There must be continued eligibility for persons who are Medicaid eligible and employed, but cannot obtain health coverage through their employers.</P>

<P>4. Maryland must continue to develop and maintain a comprehensive community support system of treatment and services for the priority population.  Services must, at a minimum, be those required in the State of Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Comprehensive Mental Health Services FY 1995 - FY 1999, "A Consumer-Oriented System Into the Year 2000".  Maryland must continue to maintain short and long-range mental health plans.</P>

<P>5. There must be meaningful participation of consumers and families at every stage of the redesign, implementation, evaluation and monitoring of the Managed Care system.</P>

<P>6. All planning and delivery of services must be culturally sensitive to ethnically diverse populations and the communities in which they are located.</P>

<P>7. Maryland's contract with Managed Care Organizations (MCO's) for the management and / or delivery of Medicaid funded services for the severely and persistently mentally ill must not allow the dropping of chronic heavy users of services for "cost avoidance".</P>

<P>8. Public resources saved by reduced utilization of state hospitals and through other system efficiencies should be reallocated to expand services to the priority population in accordance with the State of Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene,  Comprehensive Mental Health Services FY 1995 - FY 1999, "A Consumer-Oriented System Into The Year 2000".</P>

<P>9. Provider personnel, both administrators and treatment staff, must have an understanding of services and persistent brain disorders.  They must have training to work with the priority population - including training in the family and consumer perspective - and must accept accountability for the quality of services.</P>

<P>10. All treatment or clinical staff must be appropriately credentialed by the State Mental Health Authority.</P>

<P>11. For individuals who meet the priority population definition, a comprehensive array of community support services must be available and open to the incorporation of new treatment modalities.  Community support services must be available but not limited to; new generational medications, inpatient treatment, residential support services, intensive care management, psychosocial rehabilitiation, consumer-run services, vocational rehabilitiation, mobile outpatient services and round-the-clock crisis services seven days-a-week.</P>

<P>12. The Mental Hygiene Administration will adminster the specialty mental health services, through the Core Service Agency (CSA) system, which will be responsible for linkages between housing and other support services.</P>

<P>13. There must be appropriate consumer and family involvement in individual treatment delivery and access to peer support groups.</P>

<P>14. Grievance procedures must be in place that are user friendly and time sensitive to the life threatening nature of psychotic episodes.</P>

<P>15. Maryland must provide a "freely accessible" and "timely" report accounting for the number of recipients who:</P>
<UL>
<LI>fail to present for services;
<LI>are in jail or prison;
<LI>have been placed in a state hospital;
<LI>have died.

<P>I would like to begin my term by expressing appreciation for the good work that out outgoing President, Joe Friend, did at the helm of AMI of Maryland.  His time and efforts aptly provided the guidance and leadership necessary during an important time of change for our organization.  In 1996-1997, AMI of Maryland endeavors to continue moving in new directions to build on the momentum the state board of directors started in 1995-1996.</P>

<P>Several important opportunities present themselves for our Affiliate leaders to help us build the organization to achieve our mission.  We invite your enthusiastic participation in the following 1996-1997 statewide projects:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Journey of Hope Program
<LI>Maryland Campaign to End Discrimination- Bev Hoffberg, Project Coordinator
<LI>Public Policy Committee - Marcia Pines, Chairperson
<LI>Fundraising Committee - Don Boardman, Chairperson
<LI>State Convention Committee
<LI>Managed Care/Medicaid Service System Improvement Grant- Joe Friend, Project Director

</UL>
<P>Without broad affiliate and member involvement we will have difficulty reaching our goals.  I hope we can count on your support this year.  </P>

<P>Janet Edelman spent many hours developing and designing the new AMIMD home page and we appreciate her efforts.   AMI of Maryland is proud to be one of a handful of states that have home pages.  Janet has invited your comments and suggestions regarding the home page. </P>

<P>Thanks to our outgoing AMI of MD board members, Barbara Murry, Dick Kopp, and Harriet Baldwin who contributed many hours of their time and shared exciting ideas.  I would like to welcome our new board members as part of AMI of MD.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"> <H2>NAMI Convention
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

	<P>The 1996 NAMI Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee, July 5th to 9th, drew one of its largest attendances in recent years with an estimated 2000  registrants.  The title of the convention was "Grassroots Jubilee".  The importance of NAMI grassroots was repeated throughout the convention and the need for the grassroots organizations to grow and become stronger was emphasized.</P>

	<P>One of the most important themes of the convention was NAMIs Campaign to End Discrimination which is working for an end to discrimination against people with serious mental illnesses.</P>

	<P>NAMI helped to convene a Fairness Coalition which included many of the major professional organizations.  NAMI together with other members of this coalition developed an open letter to the U.S. Congress, signed by 50 organizations, most of whom were businesses around the country.  A study was commissioned to study insurance premium costs that might result from parity for treatment of mental illness.  Three large data bases showed that claims for mental illness treatment accounted for 1 percent or less of all health claims in private insurance.</P>

	<P>Agnes Hatfield of Prince Georges County received the distinguished service award from the Curriculum
 and Training Committee at the NAMI Convention.  Dr. Harriet Lefley of the University of  Miami presented the award citing Agnes roles in initiating the Curriculum and Training Committee, her pioneering work in the study of family burden in mental illness, and her early work in conceptualizing and promoting family education.</P>

<A NAME="Journey of Hope">

[<A HREF="#top">top</A>]
<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"> <H2>Journey of Hope Overview
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

<P>AMI of Maryland has received a grant from the Mental Hygiene Administration to begin the Journey of Hope Program in November of 1996.</P>

<P>Research studies indicate that 40-65% of adults with severe and persistent mental illness either reside with their families or receive primary care management from their families.  The ability of family members to provide a benign, understanding and predictable environment for their ill relative is a key factor in the capacity of the ill family member to stabilize and remain in the community.  The Journey of Hope not only provides basic education and skill training for families who must cope with the difficulties of their ill relatives, it also gives them the practical and emotional support to sustain them in the role as primary caretakers in the community mental health system.</P>

<P>There are two components to the Journey of Hope - an education element and a support group element.  Together they provide maximum benefit to the family member.  The program is self-selective, however, in that a family member is not required to participate in one component in order to participate in the remaining component.  Families are, however, strongly encouraged to take advantage of both.</P>

<P>The Journey of Hope family education program is a 12 session course for families of individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  These families may or may not be AMI members.  The curriculum focuses on three major psychiatric illnesses (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression), emphasizing the clinical treatment of these illnesses and teaching the knowledge and skills that family members need to cope more effectively with the mentally ill relative.  The courses are taught by trained AMI family member volunteers in a team teaching approach.</P>

<P>The Journey of Hope support group program is an on-going support structure for families.  Again, family members are trained to facilitate as these groups provide family members with an opportunity to reinforce coping skills, to seek emotional support and receive practical help from other family members.  Based on the Ten Principles of Support, the groups guide efforts of individuals to help themselves and each other.  In this family-to-family support group model, families learn they are not alone; that there is hope; that there is information; and that individual family member experience is a powerful tool for help when shared with others.

<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>President's Message  --
   Spring, 1996</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

  <P>   We not only survived a long and unusually tough
winter, we achieved some victories in the legislature
thanks to Janet Edelman, Chairperson for Government
Relations, and other key people including the Affiliate
Presidents, Phil Livingstone, Marcia Pines, Art Tate and
all the members who made calls and wrote letters to state
legislators.  Your actions made a difference in the
passage of Senate Bill 750 on Managed Care and
Medicaid Waiver Reform.  With support from the
Governor, the bill passed with amendments
recommended by DHMH including provisions for
specialty mental health services.  We must now pay
attention as the regulations are developed and as the
structure and operating guidelines are developed for the
managed care companies and traditional providers such
as the Core Service Agencies.</P>

 <P>    Other accomplishments this winter include the
strategic and tactical planning by the AMI of MD Board
of Directors beginning with an all-day Board Retreat
facilitated by consultant, Sherry Welch, in February.  The
Board agreed upon five priority areas (of over 20
considered) to focus upon during the next fiscal year:</P>

<UL>

<LI>     Public Policy/Government                            
            Relations/Legislative Issues
<LI>     Stigma
<LI>     Fundraising
<LI>     Structure, Strategy, Systems, Mission
<LI>     Affiliate Development/Relations
</UL>

<BR>
 <P>    To address these priorities effectively and
efficiently the board reorganized with a simplified
structure designed to focus the board and strengthen
committees.  The board is also developing its goals and
objectives and will present these in a report at the 14th
Annual Convention in June.  Special appreciation to the
following who have either just stepped down or agreed to
serve as Chairpersons of Committees:</P>
<UL>
<LI>  Janet Edelman, Chairperson of Government        
                   Relations (outgoing)
<LI>     Marcia Pines, Chairperson of Government          
                  Relations (incoming)
<LI>     Don Boardman, Chairperson of Fundraising
<LI>     Bev Hoffberg, Project Coordinator, Stigma
<LI>     Carolyn Knight, Annual Convention
<LI>     Gail Livingstone, Annual Luncheon
<LI>     Art Tate, Managed Care

</UL>
<BR>
  <P> 
  We would like to welcome Carolyn Knight,
President of AMI of Montgomery County as a new
appointee to the Board of Directors for AMI of MD. 
She has agreed to fill a vacancy.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>     In this issue we introduce Katasha Smart-Davis, Administrative
Assistant to the staff of AMI of MD.  She works with us full-time while
continuing her studies part-time as a student at Johns Hopkins University. 
You will hear her cheerful voice if you call the office.  Please welcome her
aboard.</P>

 <P>  
  This is the busiest time of the year for AMI of MD with the
legislative season ending and preparation for major events including the
Annual Luncheon with E. Fuller Torrey as the guest speaker and the 14th
Annual Convention.  Additionally, we have gone through a planning process
with the Board and revitalized AMI of MD committees as reported by Joe
Friend, President, in this issue.</P>

<P>     Your state organization has added two new projects, the Stigma
Project (part of NAMI's 5-year campaign) to be kicked off at the 14th
Annual Convention and The Journey of Hope Program scheduled to begin
in the fall thanks to a grant from the Mental Hygiene Administration and
administrator, Donna Wells.</P>

 <P>    We would be remiss not to thank Dr. Agnes Hatfield, Project
Director, and Shirley Jackson, Outreach Worker for their hard work during
the second year of the project for Elderly Caregivers of Persons with Mental
Illness funded by the Department of Human Resources with help from
Catherine Bailey, and Marta Archer  and Sandy Sundeen.</P>

   <P>  
Joe Friend has taken the helm as Project Director of the Managed
Care/Service System Improvement grant and will be attending a conference
in Philadelphia the first week in May.  This grant has enabled AMI of MD
to purchase fax machines for each Affiliate organization which does not
already own one.  This will improve communications as  we move forward.</P>

Part II Conference</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>





	<P>AMI of Marylands "Putting Care Into Managed Care" Part II, a joint conference with On Our Own of Maryland, was held at the Bon Secours Conference Center on October 25, 1996. Over 70 family members, providers and consumers participated in this one-day educational update on the status of Medicaid Reform in Maryland.<P>

<H4>Program Highlights</H4>

	<P>As part of the Keynote Address on Medicaid Reform and the New Public Mental Health System, Barbara Shipnuck, Deputy Secretary for Health Care Policy, Finance and Regulation, Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH), acknowledged that there may be a possible delay in  enrollment in the new system. The current start-up date of January 1, 1997 may be delayed as much as 30 days. In addition, Deputy Secretary Shipnuck announced that DHMH is expecting a letter of acceptance for the 1115 Waiver from the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) any day now and that will make Maryland the fastest state to gain approval. </P>
	<P>Dr. Stuart Silver, Director,  Mental Hygiene Administration, also part of the Keynote Address, provided an update on the role of the Administrative Service Organization (ASO). He outlined the five services that the ASO will provide: Access, Utilization and Management Systems, Management Information Service, Claim Services and Evaluation (includes Outcomes, Satisfaction, Clinical Quality, Provider Information and ASO Performance).</P>
 	<P>Following the Keynote Address, a panel consisting of: Lori Doyle, Director of Public Policy, Maryland Association of Psychiatric Support Services; Marcia Pines, Chair, Public Policy/Government Relations, AMI of Maryland; Frank Sullivan, Director, Anne Arundel County Mental Health Agency; and Laura Van Tosh, Coordinator, Consumer Managed Care Network; responded to and questioned Ms. Shipnuck and Dr. Silver about the new  Public Mental Health System.</P>
	<P>In the afternoon, Elizabeth Edgar, State Relations Associate, National Alliance for the Mentally Ill and Laura Van Tosh, compared Marylands   Medicaid Reform Plans to similar plans in other states. This was followed by participants forming a workgroup to discuss individual concerns, questions and develop possible topics for further training.</P>
<H4>1115 Medicaid Waiver Update</H4>

<UL>

<LI>The responses to the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the Administrative Service Organization (ASO) for Marylands Public Health System are being reviewed. 
<LI>On October 17, 1996, the Department of Mental Health and Hygiene (DHMH) sponsored a Vendors Fair at the Columbia Inn, for managed care organizations (MCOs) and current providers.

<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>Medicaid Waiver Passes:  What will It Mean?
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



	<P>The Medicaid Waiver bill SB 750 passed the Maryland General Assembly just before it came to a close in April, 1996.  AMI members can expect that it will take the next several months to understand just how it will impact consumers on Medicaid and their families.  We will update members as we learn additional information.</P>

	<P>New insights were provided by Dr. Wasserman, Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health and Mental health at a meeting sponsored by AMI of Maryland and On Our Own of Maryland on April 30th.  Dr. Wasserman said there is a general consensus across the country that Medicaid and Medicare must be reduced.  There is only a question of how and when.  Medicaid has been expanding at an unacceptable 9% per year.  There are no really good choices.  We must either limit services, limit enrollment, or limit fees to providers.</P>
	<P>The goals of the 1115 Medicaid Waiver are to improve access and contain costs through the use of Managed Care.  One third of Medicaid recipients are already in Managed Care.</P>
	<P>Oscar Morgan, Deputy Director of the Mental Hygiene Administration, explained how Managed care would work for people with mental illnesses:</P>
	
<OL>
<LI>All individuals on Medicaid will be assigned a primary care provider.  They will all be assessed for mental health needs.  The primary care provider will treat those that they can.
<LI>If the mental health problem is severe, they will be referred to the Core Service Agency (CSAs) in their county which will hook them up with a mental health provider.  Medicaid and Grant dollars will be given to the CSAs.  There will be 24-hour availability.
<LI> The number of providers will expand so there will be choices.
<LI>There will be a seamless bridge between hospital and community.
<LI>Outcome measures will be developed.  Families and consumers will be involved.  Report cards may be used to note:  Who are getting services?  How good are the outcomes?  If not good, why not?  There will also be a grievance system in place.
<LI>Advisory boards must be 50% families or consumers.
<LI>All Managed Care Organizations will be approved by the Mental Hygiene Administration.

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>

   In response to requests from AMI of Maryland members, Maryland State Senator Norman R. Stone introduced SB 157 in the 1996 Legislative Session.  The bill is designed to make access to necessary medical information easier for family members or persons who serve in a caregiver capacity for persons who have mental illnesses/brain disorders.  Bette Stewart and Janet Edelman worked with Senator Stone to develop the bill.  The bill was deferred from the regular session and referred to the 1996 Summer Study Session for further consideration.
   A public hearing is scheduled for September 24, 1996 at 1:00pm in Annapolis before the Senate Economic and Environmental Matters Committee with Senator Paula C. Hollinger presiding.  AMI of Maryland is preparing for the hearing and developing talking points to complement the position paper on confidentiality that was published in the winter issue of this newsletter.  If any AMI members have experiences relating to the lack of access to information that has effected the care of their relatives, please let the AMI of Maryland office know as soon as possible.  Additional copies of the bill are available at AMI of MD office: (410)467-7100.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>
                                    
<P>  
   The legislative session closed on April 10.  Below is a listing of results of legislation followed by
AMI of MD, lead by Government Relations Chairperson, Janet Edelman.   A special thank you to Affiliate
Presidents and all members who wrote letters and contacted your legislators this session.  </P>

 <P>    Our big victory was the passage of  SB750, Managed Care and Medicaid Reform Proposal which
contained the wording that we advocated regarding specialty mental health services.  Noteworthy efforts in
Annapolis were conducted by Joe Friend, Phil Livingstone, Marcia Pines and Art Tate during this process. 
From the local Affiliates, over 300 contacts were made to assist the passage of this bill.  Thank you!!<P>

<P>Senate Bill 157, Mental Health Records- Disclosure to Primary Caregivers, the bill submitted by Senator Norman Stone on behalf of family members, was referred to interim study.  Meetings will be held this year to discuss the contents of this bill and hopefully a compromise will be reached.  The intent of this bill was to put in place a process to allow disclosure of limited mental health information to primary caregivers.</P>

  <P>   Marcia Pines will take the helm as the Chairperson of Public Policy/Government Relations for the
1996-97 year.  If anyone is interested in participating, the group is planning to meet year-round to examine
issues, develop AMI of Maryland position papers, and conduct other activities to influence policy.  Please
contact the AMI of MD office at (410) 467-7100 or e-mail at Amimd@aol.com.<P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>     Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid still pose serious
threats for the elderly.  If Medicaid becomes a block
grant, Maryland's programs for non-nursing home
services are likely to end.  These "Medi-Grant" block
grants would reduce funds by 134 billion over seven years. 
Medicaid would no longer be required to pay the
medicare premiums of low income individuals.  Nursing
homes could require patients under "Medi-Grant" to
make additional payments.</P>

<P> 
    Home and Community-based care would also be
threatened.  These service providers cannot compete
politically with the powerful nursing home industry.  In
addition, there is a real possibility that adult children
could be held financially responsible for the long term
care of a parent.</P>

   <P>  The Older Americans Act which offers an array
of services to older persons has not been re-authorized as
yet.  This Act supports the Senior Care System, meal
programs, and housing and support services.</P>

 <P>    Congress wants to gut regulations for long term
care.  These regulations were designed for the comfort
and safety of elderly persons in nursing homes.</P>

  <P>   Operation Restore Trust is an effort from the
White House to stop fraud and abuse in Medicare.  Five
states are funded for an experimental program in ending
Medicare fraud.  If you know of abuse, call 1-800-HHS-
TIPS to report it.</P>

 <P>    Virginia Thomas, former Maryland Delegate,
now working on the Medicaid Waiver indicated at the
United Seniors meeting in Annapolis that there will be a
second phase to this endeavor which will address long
term care and ways to keep people out of institutions. 
This effort will begin in November.  The goal will be to
integrate acute and long term care.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>


 <P>  In an historic step toward ending discrimination, President Clinton signed into law the VA/HUD Appropriations bill which includes landmark provisions by Domenici and Wellstone requiring insurance plans to provide severe mental illness benefits at the same level of yearly and lifetime coverage as for other medical services.</P>
<P>   President Clinton wrote:  "people with mental illness have faced discrimination in health insurance coverage for too long...it is time we take steps to end this inequity."</P>
  <P>  The Senate voted 82 to 15 for the amendment and the House voted 392 to 17 to instruct VA/HUD conferees to include the amendment.   The bill passed both houses and arrived on the Presidents desk for signature.</P>
  <P>  In August, AMI of Maryland members from Metropolitan Baltimore, Montgomery, Prince Georges and Anne Arundel Counties traveled to Washington D.C. by chartered bus and carpool to hold signs and march with 300 AMI members from 4 other states at a rally in front of the White House.</P>

<P>    The rally drew attention to the fact that parity was left out of The Health Care Reform bill signed by President Clinton.  Senators Domenici and Wellstone did not give up the battle. Successful passage occurred in September.</P>
  <P> The law takes effect January 1, 1998 and expires September 30, 2001.   Highlights include that employers with 50 or fewer employees are exempt from the law and businesses are also exempt if the premium rises one percent or more. </P>
<P>How does the law affect state parity laws and other mental health mandates? State parity laws can override the national parity amendment according to an analysis of the amendment by NAMI Policy and Research Team.</P>
<P>  AMI of Maryland leaders, Adil Shamoo, Marcia Pines and others fought and succeeded in getting Marylands Insurance Parity Law passed in 1994 as the countrys first parity bill with comprehensive coverage.  Marylands leadership along with several other states was important to this first national success in the passage of parity.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>




<H4>Background</H4>

<P>NAMI has been working long and hard (along with MHA, APA, pharmaceutical industry lobby, providers, and other) to get a parity bill passed.  Historically, the closer the bills come to being passed, the more watered down they get, before they are killed altogether.  This time, a bill actually passed thanks to NAMIs continuing efforts.  But the bill did get significantly watered down. </P> 

<H4>What the bill does not do</H4>
<UL>

<LI>The bill does not require employers to provide insurance for NBD (neurobiological disorders, or mental illness).  It merely imposes some "mandates" on those that do by making them end annual and lifetime caps.
<LI>    The bill does not end the practice of requiring higher co-payments for mental health benefits. (ex. My own insurance policy requires a 50% co-pay for mental health services, and a $10 co-pay for all other, non-mental health services.)  That can continue.
<LI>    The bill does not end the practice of having higher deductibles for mental health services.
<LI>    The bill does not become effective until 1/1/98, which gives the business lobby plenty of time to reverse it.
<LI>     The bill does not affect people who work for companies with under 50 employees.
<LI>    And most importantly, the bill starts 1/1/98 and end 9/1/2001, so the limited impact it my have will last a very short time unless extended.
</UL>

 <P>   This bill is only a first step.  NAMI will work hard to make sure it is strengthened, not weakened, and ultimately we get a real parity bill.</P>

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P>   
Anxiety and anxiety associated with other medical and psychological disorders are causes of significant distress, discomfort, dread, and foreboding in older individuals.  The intense distress associated with these symptoms leads people to seek relief either through the use of medical services or through self-medication with substances such as alcohol.</P>
<P>    Anxiety is often found in conjunction with depression.  The two groups of disorders share such symptoms as sleep disturbance, appetite changes, nonspecific digestive or cardiovascular complaints, irritability, and fatigue.</P>
<P>    The reasons for anxiety in late life are multiple.  Elderly individuals may experience sadness due to multiple losses and may fear isolation and death.  Chronic ill health, financial limitations, and diminished functional capacities also take a toll.  Recent advances in neurobiology indicate that four neurotransmitters are involved in the biochemistry of  anxiety disorder,</P>
 <P>   Careful assessment should be made of the factors contributing to anxiety in the older individual.  Family members and other persons familiar with the patient should be included in the assessment process.  Treatments may be psychological or pharmacological or both.  Special care must be used in prescribing medications because of the extra sensitivity of elderly people to these drugs.

<HR SIZE=4>
<IMG  ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gif/bul_bl_d.gif"><H2>The Role of State Hospitals in the Care of Older Adults
</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P>    In many states, functions that are not performed in other parts of the system of care are left to the state hospital.  State hospitals may play a special function for older adults with mental illness.  During this period of rapid downsizing of state hospitals, it is important to know how the elderly might be affected.</P>
 <P>   Older adults were a major component of the state hospital population at mid-century.  However the rise of the nursing home industry and federal reimbursement for long term care outside of the hospital has led to a rapid decline in the number of older adults in these facilities.  Alternative settings
for these individuals, however, are often equally institutional.  Little is known about the impact of these changes on this vulnerable population.  Many of them are being cared for by providers who have financial incentives that may not be in the best interests of vulnerable populations.  Quality assurance programs and accountability may not have been developed well enough to protect the elderly.</P>
<P> 
   These kinds of concerns lead researchers <EM>(Semke, Fisher, Goldman, & Hirad, 1996)</EM> to pose a number of questions for advocates to consider.  Is there a residual function for the state hospital as a direct provider of psychiatric care?  Does it have a legitimate role to play in meeting needs not met in the market?  Are some functions not cost-effective on the local level due to the efficiencies of scale and duplications of effort?  Do older adults who received care in the community experience outcomes and quality of life equal to or better than they would have in the hospital?</P>
 <P>   Older adults are a segment of the state hospital population that currently received little research attention.  Advocates need more data to guide them as they seek to protect the interests of the geriatric population in their communities. <EM> (Semke, J., Fisher, W.H., Goldman, H.H., & Hirad, A., The Evolving Role of the State Hospital in the Care and Treatment of Older Adults: State Trends,  1984 to 1993, October 1996)</EM></P>

<HR SIZE=4>
                                    
 


<P>   While Maryland successfully obtained insurance parity for  treatment of mental illness/brain disorder via the 1994 law enacted by the State Legislature, it is still important to determine the extent of the health insurance coverage benefits which protect you and your family. Examine your policy carefully.  You will find most benefits described in a policy section entitled "medical/surgical benefits," or something similar.  To find your coverage for treatment of a brain disorder, look under " Mental Illness/Substance Abuse."</P>

<UL>

<LI>Check your co-payment requirements.  Many insurance policies will require that your co-payment for brain disorder treatment (your share of the cost of treatment, diagnostic procedure, hospitalization, outpatient visit, or visit to a physicians office) will be almost twice as high as co-payments required for treatment of  physical diseases.
<LI>Check your "lifetime benefits."  Many insurance policies limit the lifetime benefits payable for treatment of mental illness to half (or less) of the lifetime benefits payable for treatment of other disorders.
<LI>Check your hospitalization benefits.  Many policies limit benefits if you are hospitalized for treatment of a mental illness.  These limited benefits may pay half of the actual cost of hospitalization.
<LI>Check your "treatment benefits."  Many policies limit the number of treatments.
<LI>   If you are not sure about the benefits provided in your health insurance policy, check with your employers benefits department with your insurance agent, or with your attorney.  Please do not let what they may think prevent you from checking, or from seeking a policy that provides more inclusive and equitable coverage.

<HR SIZE=4>
                                    



	<P>  Older individuals with mental illness are often in need of both mental health and aging services.  The confusion, according to Allen Jensen, researcher at the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project (IHPP) of George Washington University, is which agencies should provide services to these seniors.  To address this problem IHPP is heading  a three-year project funded by the Administration on Aging to develop community-based partnership models in seven sites across six states.  Baltimore County Bureau of Mental Health/Core Service Agency is conducting one of the model projects.</P>

	<P>IHPP has contracted with Way Station to provide technical assistance to partnership participants.  Another local provider, Montgomery House, is working with the Montgomery County Area Agency on Aging to increase its capacity to serve seniors with serious mental illnesses.  (IAPSRS PSR Connection Newsletter - Issue 2, 1996, submitted by Grady ORear, CEO, Way Station).</P>

<HR SIZE=4>



<P>   Suprisingly little is known about the well-being of persons age 55 and older with schizophrenia who live in the community.  This information is important to families who now have an older relative with schizophrenia and to families trying to anticipate the future of their middle aged son or daughter.  It is also important to the mental health system because the number of older persons with schizophrenia living in the community is expected to double in the next 30 years.</P>

<P>  Carl I. Cohen, director of geriatric psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center, and his colleagues used symptoms of depression as an indicator of well-being in later life.  It is well established that older persons with high levels of depressive symptoms are more at risk for physical illnesses, diminished social functioning, and death.</P>

<P>  Cohen and his co-researchers found that 44% of their 117 persons with schizophrenia had clinical levels of depression.  This three times the level of depression reported in a general sample of older persons in New York City.  Depression was associated with positive symptoms as well as the following nonpsychiatric variables:

<OL>
<LI><U> Low income.</U>  Poverty was strongly associated with depression in later life.  The difference in mean monthly income between those who were depressed and those who were not depressed was $117.  The authors pointed out that it may be possible to produce a decline in depression by as much as $4 a day.  
<LI> <U> Supportive Network.</U> Limited social support networks were related to depression.  This was especially true of a lower level of material support from informal caregivers rather than the formal network that made a difference.  This finding suggested that encouraging more informal network members to provide more material support, perhaps with subsidies, may help alleviate depression.
<LI> <U> Limitations on activity.</U>  Physical disability and depression appear to influence each other with elderly disabled persons who have depression having lower rates of recovery of physical functioning.  Comprehensive medical treatment, home care assistance, improved access to transportation, and the like, may reduce depression in those with physical disabilities.
<LI> <U>  Age.</U>  In this study, the rate of depression went down with schizophrenia, but not for men.  It appears that women in late middle age, rather than very old women may be at more risk for depression or less likely to recover from it or both.

</OL>

<P>   Cohen and colleagues conclude that many of the factors associated with depression could be altered and thereby increase the wellbeing of older persons with schizophrenia.

	<P>Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a nationally known psychiatrist and researcher in the field of mental illness, made some very intriguing suggestions about ways to change the mental health system in his address at the AMI of Maryland Luncheon in Baltimore on April 28th.  Those that attended were in for a treat because Torrey is a powerful speaker and he tells it like he sees it.  Dr. Torrey recommended:

<OL>
<LI> That we develop a system of outpatient commitment.  People would have conditional releases from the hospital to an outpatient setting.  They could be returned to the hospital if they did not cooperate with treatment.
<LI>State law should be changed to make it possible to involuntarily hospitalize people on the basis of need for treatment in addition to the dangerousness to self and others provisions.  Too many people are going untreated.
<LI>There should be wider use of representative payees.  The use of drugs and alcohol among people with mental illnesses is high.  These individuals worsen their conditions by spending their SSI checks on such substances.
<LI> We need to differentiate mental illness from mental health problems.
<LI> The National Institute of Mental health should be abolished and research on mental illnesses be done in a Brain Research Institute.
<LI> Psychiatry and neurology should be merged and the State Department of Mental Hygiene abolished.

</OL>

	<P>Actually it appears to us that the Medicaid Waiver in Maryland will tend to blend mental illness and mental health problems (See article on Medicaid Waiver in this issue.)  The Waiver does not specifically separate the two, everyone would presumably be treated by a general physician and would be referred on  to the CSA if they need a specialty service.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>Maryland has embraced the new national campaign "Open Your Mind", an anti-stigma effort targeted to decision-makers and influentials in all areas of government, business, education and the media.  Lead by the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI's) president, Rona Purdy, and in Maryland by project coordinator, Bev Hoffberg of AMI of Metropolitan Baltimore, the campaign promises to be an exciting endeavor funded by a first-time ever coalition of pharmaceuticals.  Kicked off nationally in Washington, D.C. with a press conference, the 5-year campaign hopes to raise several million dollars to end discrimination in health care, housing, education and all eaconomic opportunities. </P>

<P>In March, NAMI held a weekend training for all state coordinators in St. Louis, Missouri, attended by Brenda Hohman who will be working with Bev Hoffberg.  The training briefed everyone about the campaigns focus in several messages that will be communicated throughout the campaign:<BR>

<UL>
<LI>Mental Illnesses Are Brain Disorders.
<LI>Treatment Works!
<LI>Discrimination Must End.
<LI>Stop Unfair Economic Burden!

</UL><BR>

<P>These important messages will be delivered via three tracks, each with their own activities.  The tracks are 1) the grassroots, 2) science and treatment, and 3) anit-discrimination.  Because of the nature of the three tracks, many activities will overlap.</P>

<P>AMI of Maryland will officially kick-off the statewide anti-stigma campaign at the state convention to be held at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, on June 7 & 8.  This year's convention is lead by Carolyn Knight, president of AMI of Montgomery County.  Each affiliate which does not currently own one will receive a fax machine funded by the Service System Improvement grant from the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to assist with campaign communications.  The affiliates will also receive exciting campaign materials including posters, brochures and buttons and more information to assist local efforts.  We hope to see everyone at this fun-filled and worthwhile event!</P>

<HR SIZE=4>

<P>  
   "It is imperative that we do more outreach
to young families facing the difficulites of raising
a child with a neurobiological disorder,"  Laurie
Flynn stated last winter in The Journal, a
quarterly publication of the California Alliance for
the Mentally Ill.  From its inception, NAMI has
worked to provide support, education, and
advocacy for individuals of all ages with serious
and persistent mental illnesses.</P>

 <P>    Yet, today, in our 16th year, families of
children under the age of eighteen constitute a
relatively small percentage of our organization's
membership.  This is troubling for two reasons. 
The first is what NAMI has to offer young
families.  When looking back to the age of  onset
of their ill family member's symptoms, at least
half of NAMI families admit that their child or
sibling was under eighteen.  Their experinces can
help young families as they face the challenges of
finding services and making the transition from
childhood's school-based systems to the adult-
services sector.  The second reason is that NAMI
membership must give serious consideration to the
long-term prospects of NAMI's existence and its
continued ability to advocate on behalf of persons
with persistent and severe mentally illness.</P>

 </P>    To continue renewing NAMI's fellowship,
the referral of young families and efforts to meet
their unique needs must be a priority.  Unlike
older families who in many instances are retired
and looking primarily for support group services,
young families are in need of a greater array of
assistance from those already experienced in
obtaining services for their family member.</P>

<P>     In particular, young families require
assistance in linking up with experienced
healthcare professionals who will provide a
diagnosis and treatment for their youngster with a
neurobiological disorder.  These families also
need detailed information about how to deal with
the local school systems that significantly impact
the education and related services available to
their child.  They may also require referrals to
local family-service agencies.</P>

<P>    
 Serving families of children and
adolescents with neurobiological disorders is a
challenge for many NAMI affiliates, especially at
the local level.  Active members may feel unable
to provide the level of support and information
young families need.  Addressing this issue,
NAMI's board of directors decided that the
national headquarters should include one staff
member devoted exclusively to young family
outreach.  Mrs. Brenda Souto was appointed in
mid-November as the young family outreach
coordintor.  Mrs. Souto, a professional outreach
specialist, has been active in the child and
adolescent network of AMI of Montgomery
County, Maryland.</P>

<P>     During the next months the new family
outreach coordinator will provide affiliates with
information they can use in answering inquiries
from young families with a child or adolescent
identified with a neurobiological disorder.  She is
developing a NAMI brochure welcoming young
families and a NAMI Rolodex card. (A fact sheet
for young families is already in distribution
through the NAMI helpline)  One of Mrs. Souto's
early efforts will provide affiliates techniques to
increase referrals from healthcare professionals
who see young families.  She also plans to
elaborate on a start-up manual for children and
adolescent groups that will build on the NAMI-
CAN Start Up Kit  Carol Howe developed a few
years ago.  The manual will provide AMI
affiliates with resources to assist young family
groups within affiliates.  This resource is expected
to be available at the July 1996 NAMI convention
in Nashville.</P>

  <P>   The United States Food and Drug Administration  granted Eli Lilly and Company permission to market Zyprexa (olanzapine) for the treatment of the symptoms of psychotic disorders.</P>
   <P>"Zyprexa represents hope to the millions of patients whose lives are devastated by schizophrenia and the manifestations of psychotic disorders," said August M. Watanabe, M.D., Lilly executive vice president, science and technology.  "Schizophrenia puts both an emotional and financial burden on its patients and their caregivers.  Its cost to society is tremendous.  Zyprexa may allow patients to take the first step toward becoming self-sufficient and productive."</P>
<P>    Schizophrenia, a clinical syndrome that affects one  percent of the worlds population, is characterized by the presence of positive psychotic symptoms, such as delusions and hallucinations, and negative symptoms, such as diminished emotions and low motivation.  People with schizophrenia can have difficulty distinguishing fantasy from reality, thinking clearly and managing emotions.  They may lose their social skills, their schooling and jobs, or their ability to communicate.</P>
 <P> 
  This is the second major regulatory clearance for Zyprexa.  Zyprexa was cleared for marketing in 15 European countries by the European Medicine Evaluation Agency (EMEA) on September 27, 1996.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>


<P>    Dr. Paul Janssen, the founder of Janssen Pharmaceutica and Janssen Research Foundation, was recognized for his lifetime achievements in psychiatry research by the National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD).
    NARSAD presented its Pharmaceutical Discoverers Award to Dr. Janssen for his development of ground  breaking pharmaceutical therapies for people with  severe mental illnesses, including schizophrenia treatments Risperdal (risperidone) and Haldol (haloperidol).</P>
 <P>"Over the past four decades, Dr. Janssen has contributed enormously to our understanding of the biological basis of mental illness". said Constance Lieber, President, NARSAD Board of Directors, who presented the award to Dr. Janssen at NARSADs  Tenth Anniversary Gala Awards in New York
   " Thanks to the medicines developed by Dr. Janssen, millions of people have overcome the frightening and debilitating psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia and other severe mental illnesses", said Lieber.</P>
 <P>   Dr. Janssens discovery of Haldol in 1958 marked the first time that medication was able to reduce psychotic symptoms, allowing many people with mental illness to return to society and lead productive lives.  Haldol became the benchmark antipsychotic drug for the evaluation of new treatments for schizophrenia.</P>
<P>    Dr. Janssen changed the lives of schizophrenia patients again with the discovery of Risperdal, the first new first-line therapy for treating the broad population of psychotic patients in more than 35 years.  Unlike conventional therapies, Risperdal relieves both the positive (e.g. delusions, hallucinations, etc.) and negative (e.g., lack of drive or initiative, etc.) symptoms of psychosis.</P>
   <P> Since its introduction in 1994, Risperdal has been used by more than 1 million patients, and has become the most frequently prescribed antipsychotic medication in the United States.
    Today, Dr. Janssen personally holds more than 100 patents and is considered one of the most successful drug inventors of  all time.</P>
 <P>   Other recipients of the Pharmaceutical Discoverers Award include the late Dr. Ray Fuller, Dr. Bryan B. Molloy and Dr. David T.Wong for the development of Prozac, and Dr. Gilbert Honigfeld for the development of Clozaril.</P>

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>



<P> 
   The Maryland Psychiatric Research Center sponsored a conference on September 28th to examine the role of psychosocial treatment in schizophrenia.  National experts in the field from the University of California at Los Angeles, Western Psychiatric Institute of Pittsburgh, the University of Maryland, and the Psychiatric Research Center served as presenters.  The conference focused on why people with schizophrenia have difficulty functioning, the nature of deficit symptoms, and the role of modern medications.</P>
<P>    Presenters at the conference seemed to agree that difficulties in functioning were probably due to deficit symptoms in the illness.  Deficit symptoms include poor insight, poor motivation, and impaired relatedness.  While positive symptoms improve with most neuroleptics, deficit symptoms general do not improve with them. </P> 


 <P> 
  There is something different about the way that people with schizophenia process information.  They have problems of attention, perception, executive functioning, sensory gating, and memory.  It is believed that these differences existed before these individuals were diagnosed with schizophrenia and they are often found in their well relatives.  These deficits can be measured and the results used to:</P>

<OL>

<LI>Match the person to a rehabilitation program
<LI> Anticipate the individuals service needs
<LI>Change the way in which these individuals think
</OL>


<P>    People with schizophrenia have special difficulty in social relationships.  This may be due to social cognitive deficits which  include egocentric understanding of self and others, little ability to take the perspective of another person, difficulty predicting their own and others behavior, and intolerance for complexity.</P>
<P>     It was pointed out that anti-psychotic medications do not cure schizophrenia.  Nevertheless they are considered basic to any psychosocial treatment.  It is hoped that some of the neurocognitive symptoms may be changed through psycho social treatment and/or medication.  Conventional drugs have not impacted on these thinking disorders, although preliminary results suggest that Risperidone may have some effect.</P>
 <P>   We now have data upon which to base rehabilitation treatment.  The difficulty in the field of psychosocial treatments is getting new research into practice. New medications and changing psychosocial treatments with emphasis on specific deficits are expected to improve outcomes.</P>

</H2>
<HR SIZE=4>





<P>    Families with mentally ill children note that mental health policy and practice often diverge in curious ways.  Authorities generally agree that inpatient treatment should be decreased and that children should remain with their families and be served in the community.  When residential care becomes essential, families should be involved and reunification should be the primary goal of treatment.  However in practice, inpatient treatment continues to rise and most residential treatment centers have involved families minimally.</P>
 <P>   Three University of California professors and the director of Devereaux Institute in Pennsylvania elected to survey staff members of three residential treatment centers to determine their support for involvement of families.  They found that staff members were very supportive of more family involvement, however they showed more support of families in the role of service recipients than as decision makers.  Staff preferred relationships with families that put staff in a helper role, providing guidance or therapy to families.  Staff were least supportive of activities that empowered families in decision making roles or in participation in the residential units daily activities.</P>
 <P>   Staff members were generally not supportive of family reunification.  The authorities state that even when reunification is not a goal, the involvement of families in their childrens lives is critical for several reasons--for example, to enhance the childs sense of belonging, to address the childs need for guidance, and to provide advocacy for the childs welfare.<EM> (Baker, B.L., Heller, T.L., Blacher, J., Pfeiffer, S.I.

	<P>  Older individuals with mental illness are often in need of both mental health and aging services.  The confusion, according to Allen Jensen, researcher at the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project (IHPP) of George Washington University, is which agencies should provide services to these seniors.  To address this problem IHPP is heading  a three-year project funded by the Administration on Aging to develop community-based partnership models in seven sites across six states.  Baltimore County Bureau of Mental Health/Core Service Agency is conducting one of the model projects.</P>

	<P>IHPP has contracted with Way Station to provide technical assistance to partnership participants.  Another local provider, Montgomery House, is working with the Montgomery County Area Agency on Aging to increase its capacity to serve seniors with serious mental illnesses.

<HR SIZE=4>



<P>   Suprisingly little is known about the well-being of persons age 55 and older with schizophrenia who live in the community.  This information is important to families who now have an older relative with schizophrenia and to families trying to anticipate the future of their middle aged son or daughter.  It is also important to the mental health system because the number of older persons with schizophrenia living in the community is expected to double in the next 30 years.</P>

<P>  Carl I. Cohen, director of geriatric psychiatry at the State University of New York Health Science Center, and his colleagues used symptoms of depression as an indicator of well-being in later life.  It is well established that older persons with high levels of depressive symptoms are more at risk for physical illnesses, diminished social functioning, and death.</P>

<P>  Cohen and his co-researchers found that 44% of their 117 persons with schizophrenia had clinical levels of depression.  This three times the level of depression reported in a general sample of older persons in New York City.  Depression was associated with positive symptoms as well as the following nonpsychiatric variables:

<OL>
<LI><U> Low income.</U>  Poverty was strongly associated with depression in later life.

<LI> <U>  Age.</U>  In this study, the rate of depression went down with schizophrenia, but not for men.  It appears that women in late middle age, rather than very old women may be at more risk for depression or less likely to recover from it or both.

<P>  Through studying over 1600 individuals with psychiatric illnesses and 80 families, we have now identified regions on chromosomes 22, 8, and 6 which appear to be associated with the expression of schizophrenia.  Over the next few years we hope to identify the specific genes that are involved.  The identification of the genes will permit an understanding of what the genes are doing to cause the illness.  It is our hope that this information will lead to the development of new medication to treat schizophrenia.  In order to find the specific genes, we need the participation of more families in which there are two or more members affected with schizophrenia.  If you or someone you know has been diagnosed with schizophrenia we would like to speak to you.</P>

<H4>The Beast:  A Reckoning with Depression</H4>
<P>

by Tracy Thompson.
<P>
Review by Barbara Pilvin and Harriet Shelter for the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
	"The Beast is back.  It is called depression, and my experiences with it have shaped my life....These days, however, the Beast has been cornered--which is to say that he escapes from time to time, but I have some control over him."  With these words in the prologue, Washington Post reporter and Pulitzer finalist Tracy Thompson starts her fascinating account of a lifelong struggle with this baffling and terrifying disease.
<P>
	A native of Atlanta, Thompson tells about her childhood, adolescence, and newspaper career in an unusually honest manner.  Like all good newspaper writers, she has a clear and graceful style.  She moves rapidly in her story from a near-fatal accident at thirteen that left her with facial and emotional scars, through high school and college at Emory University, and into a successful newspaper career.
<P>
	Her career began at an Atlanta weekly and progressed after two years to the Atlanta Constitution.  At 29, she won a fellowship to study legal affairs writing at Yale Law School, and she finally joined the Washington Post on its federal court beat in 1989.
<P>
	Thompson, who writes candidly about her family and childhood, believes there were many signs of affective illness along the way:  her father's moodiness and inexplicable outbursts, her mother's fundamentalist religion drenched with guilt, her grandmother's whining and demands for attention.  Her relatives simply did not believe in mental illness, and they blamed the entire syndrome on unwise decisions, malingering, and sinful laziness.
<P>
	As Tracy Thompson's career in journalism advanced, her self-esteem lagged, grounded in an old-fashioned view that true happiness could only be found in marriage.  This search for "validation" through marriage led her into a relationship of several years with an older man whose wife had recently died, leaving him with two young children.  Even though he was controlling and an expert at put-downs reminding her constantly that she was "defective," he did recognize the seriousness of her symptoms and steered her into capable professional hands.
<P>
	Thompson's description of her two weeks in the psychiatric ward of Washington's George Washington Hospital will evoke vivid memories from families and consumers.  Her account of self-criticism is, at times, overwhelming, albeit a welcome relief from the many other accounts by depressed persons that dwell on their victimization and the failures of everybody around them.  The author unsentimentally advises depression sufferers to participate in their own treatment, one step at a time.  She is articulate, well-informed, open, and many times quite funny.
<P>
	Now happily married to a physicist, Thompson discussed only briefly at the end of the book her present life on Prozac, with a good therapist, and with daily self-set goals.  This is a polished book, a first-person account of depression with an entirely fresh and valuable outlook on the "Beast."

The Life Planning Workbook--A Hands-on Guide to Help Parents Provide for the Future Security and Happiness of Their Child with a Disability After Their Death, by L. Mark Russell and Arnold E. Grant.
<P>
Review by William Zaccagnino for the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
	This book is a hands-on guide to help parents provide for the future security and happiness of their child with a disability after their death.  In fact, it is also a guide for spouses, siblings, or others who feel a responsibility to provide for a disabled person in their estate.  The book provides excellent service to all of these people.
<P>
	Life Planning is very well written.  The authors ask the relevant questions and give good answers to clarify where there may be doubt.  The details included ensure that the parent or other person filling out the workbook--and those who will later use the information--can have reasonable comfort in dealing with the comprehensive array of issues that are a part of life.
<P>
	The workbook provides the means to develop a letter of intent, perform a financial-needs analysis, prepare for a meeting with an attorney, and organize an estate plan.  It even provides a more advanced section for financial professionals to help them understand the approaches taken by the authors in the various tables included in the book.  Together, these sections provide a comprehensive collection of information covering the medical records, life habits, financial needs, and personal relationships that are relevant to the disabled person's life and to parents, siblings, and his or her children.  The authors avoid assumptions: not every sibling will want the responsibility of caring for a disabled brother or sister; every medicine doesn't work for everyone; and every therapist is not right for everyone.
<P>
	It is important to note, which the authors do, that the book is not a substitute for formal legal or financial preparation by professionals.  The information collected by the reader needs to be assembled into documents that will stand a legal test.  However, the book can serve as a vehicle for the reader to think about the many details of the process, assemble the information in one place, and be fully confident that when he or she visits the professionals, the information will be at hand and the resulting legal documents can be held in similar confidence.
<P>
	This workbook is an excellent tool for parents or others responsible for a disabled person to provide some assurance for that person's future security.  It is also an excellent companion publication to Planning for the Future (also authored by L. Mark Russell, and currently on the NAMI sales list).

<H2>MH CONSUMERS:  WELCOME TO NAMI</H2>

<HR>
<strong>If you are a consumer of mental health services,</strong>
<P>
<strong>Welcome to NAMI!</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>"We care, because we've been there."</blockquote>

<strong>NAMI Consumer Council</strong>
<P>
Thank you for contacting NAMI, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  We hope the enclosed information is helpful to you.
<P>
NAMI is people:  people who care, people who understand, and people who are working to improve the lives of all of us who are affected by serious mental illnesses.  We know what it's like to struggle with symptoms of mental illness and the challenges that go with them because we have the same problems.  
<P>
If you are someone who has difficulties with depression, anxiety, disordered thoughts, or other psychiatric symptoms that have a biological basis, we are glad to hear from you.  We hope you will find help and hope with us.
<P>
<strong>What is NAMI?</strong>
<P>
We're a national network of people working to improve the lives of all of us affected by serious mental illnesses (such as depression, bipolar disorder or manic depression, schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorder).  Our goal is to enable each individual who has one of these illnesses to live the best life possible.
<P>
Most of us have a relative who has an illness or we have an illness ourselves.  We educate ourselves and the public, promote better treatment and support services, and advocate for research into the causes and treatments of these medical illnesses.  Through these means, we are making progress toward that goal.
<P>
<strong>What is Mental Illness?</strong>
<P>
Serious mental illnesses are biological brain diseases.  As diabetes is a disease of the pancreas, mental illnesses are diseases of the brain that disrupt a person's thinking, feeling, moods, and ability to relate to others.  Scientific research has shown biochemical imbalances or other functional problems that interfere with normal brain processes.  
<P>
The causes are not yet completely understood.  Since these disorders often run in families, genetic factors may be involved, creating a predisposition in some individuals.  Stressful life events such as job, financial, or marital problems may then trigger the onset of symptoms.  Mental illnesses are not the result of personal weakness, lack of character, or poor upbringing.  No one is to blame.
<P>
Fortunately, many effective treatments are available.  As a diabetic takes insulin, most of us with serious mental illnesses need medications to help control symptoms.  Supportive counseling and self-help groups assist in managing our day-to-day lives.  Housing, vocational rehabilitation, income assistance and other community services can provide support and stability so we can focus on recovery.
<P>
Although living with these disorders is challenging, many of us have learned to lead productive, satisfying lives. By educating yourself, learning from, and helping others affected by these illnesses, we're confident that you can too.  That's where NAMI can help.
<P>
<strong>How Can NAMI Help Me Learn about My Illness?</strong>
<P>
We have many resources for people living with mental illnesses:<br>

<UL>
<LI>Brochures and fact sheets.  Up-to-date scientific information on different illnesses, medications, and treatments.  (Single copies are free through our 800 Helpline.)

<LI>A resource catalog of books, tapes, and posters. (Also available through the Helpline if one is not enclosed.)

<LI>A network of local and state affiliates (AMIs) that offer educational meetings, family support groups, advocacy, and information about local services.  Some affiliates sponsor consumer self-help groups or can refer you to the closest one.  

<LI>A bimonthly newsletter, the NAMI Advocate, full of timely, practical information:  legal and legislative updates, research findings, book reviews, fact sheets, and more.  (Sample copy free; subscription comes with membership.)

<LI>Annual convention.  Consumers and family members from around the country meet together to network, hear the latest developments in scientific research and community services, and renew their enthusiasm for advocacy.  Consumer scholarships are often available through local affiliates.
</UL>
<P>
<strong>What are the Opportunities for Consumers in NAMI?</strong>
<P>
 Consumers participate in all levels of the NAMI organization:<br>
<UL>
<LI>We belong to local affiliates, and attend educational meetings and support groups  to learn to manage our illnesses better.

<LI>We participate in advocacy activities to improve mental health services. 

<LI>We serve as support group leaders, public speakers, board members, and Helpline volunteers.  

<LI>We testify at congressional hearings and speak to the media about our experiences.  
</UL>
<P>
In other words, if NAMI's doing it, consumers are a part of it!
<P>
NAMI's Consumer Council brings consumers together to share concerns and to promote positive consumer involvement in NAMI and in society.  
<P>
Each state selects a representative and alternate to the Consumer Council.  Every three years the Council elects a representative to serve on the NAMI Board of Directors.
<P>
The Consumer Council meets annually at the NAMI convention to share news and handle business.  We encourge all consumers to attend the convention and participate in the meeting.  
<P>
<strong>How Can I Get Involved?</strong>
<P>
The local AMI affiliate in your area is a place to meet and learn from others, and to let others learn from you.  Call for a schedule of activities, and attend those of interest to you.  Educational meetings present information about illnesses, treatments and services.  Advocacy and public education activities offer opportunities to develop new skills.  Volunteer your time and assistance.  There is always plenty to do for those willing to help.
<P>
Call the Consumer Council representative in your state for information about consumer activities.
<P>
Attend the NAMI annual convention, or your state AMI's annual convention.
<P>
(A list of affiliates in your state and the name and address of your state's Consumer Council representative is included with this brochure, or you may call the NAMI Helpline at 1-800-950-NAMI.)
<P>
<strong>How Can I Join NAMI?</strong>
<P>
You can become part of NAMI by either joining the local and/or state affiliate or by joining NAMI directly.  Local and state groups set their own membership dues; many have a low-income or consumer rate.  If you choose to join at the national level, the annual dues are $25.  Low-income consumers are invited to join by paying whatever they can (minimum of $1).
<P>
<strong>A Few Words from Two of Our Consumer Members</strong>
<P>
<blockquote>"NAMI gave me a lot of support as I worked through my recovery from mental illness.  Through consumers and family members working together in partnership, NAMI has been in the forefront of legislative efforts around the country on behalf of people with mental illness."

-- Bryce Miller, Topeka, Kansas (Treasurer of Kansas AMI and member of NAMI Board of Directors)</blockquote>
<P>
<blockquote>"Support and education from the local Alliance for the Mentally Ill (AMI) group is so therapeutic and helpful.  As an AMI volunteer you begin to help other people, and that is a great leap toward recovery.  It's fun to go to meetings to see people who have become friends, to feel camaraderie and mutual respect, and to share a mission with them.  When I went to the NAMI convention in San Antonio, I felt like I had come home."

-- Donna Orrin, Ann Arbor, Michigan
(Board Member and Public Relations Chair, AMI of Washtenaw County) </blockquote>

Educational Rights of Children With Disabilities: A Primer For
Advocates by Eileen L. Ordover and Kathleen B. Boundy. Available
from the Center for Law and Education, 955 Massachusetts Ave.,
Cambridge, MA 02139, (617) 876-6611.  
<P>
This book is designed for advocates -- parents, other volunteers,
or professionals. It analyzes the rights of children with
disabilities under two federal statutes, the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and Section 504 of the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  
<P>
Though the book is not written particularly for advocates of
children with neurobiological disorders or mental illness,
considerable attention is given to the concerns of this
population.
<P>
The review of both IDEA and Section 504 make it appropriate for
persons advocating for youngsters who have a handicapping
condition but who do not meet the requirements for special
education.  
<P>
The book provides a framework for understanding federal
regulations. The authors emphasize from the start that it must be
read in conjunction with each state's statutes, regulations and
judicial decisions regarding the education of children with
disabilities.
<P>
The book is aimed at a wide audience and it provides a coherent
description and analysis of the provisions of the federal laws it
considers. The authors have done an excellent job of pulling out
and organizing the essential core of what often appear to be
incomprehensible regulations. After an initial general overview
of these laws, specific sections address:                        
<P>
-- what is meant by "appropriate" education, "benefits," and
"free" with regard to services required under both IDEA and
Section 504; 
<P>
-- issues regarding "related services" required for children
diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, including residential
treatment and psychotherapy;
<P>
-- rights, procedures and safeguards surrounding educational
evaluations and placement of students;
<P>
-- individualized educational plans, including requirements for
parent participation, review, and placement decisions;
<P>
-- discipline of students with disabilities, including the right
not to be punished when the behaviors for which measures are
being taken are related to the child's disability;
<P>
-- early intervention services for infants and toddlers.
<P>
I highly recommend this book to anyone representing a young
person in the educational system. The major drawback I found was
the absence of an index for use in finding specific topics.
<P>
To overcome this obstacle, I recommend that readers purchase a
package of sticky tabs to label pertinent sections for quick
reference.

<P>
An often overlooked source of information about mental illness is the agency
set up to inform and advise members of Congress, the Office of Technology
Assessment (OTA).  Available through the US Government Printing Office, its
publications "explore the physical, biological, economic, social and
political impacts that can result from applications of scientific knowledge."
NAMI members should know about two recent OTA publications.
<P>
The first, THE BIOLOGY OF MENTAL DISORDERS, explains clearly and
comprehensively recent developments in neuroscience. It was published in 1992
and remains a best buy ($8.50) for information on genetic and environmental
contributions to the causes of mental illness, how it is treated, and
implications for public policy.
<P>
While clearly written and generously illustrated with diagrams and charts,
The Biology of Mental Disorders does not talk down to the reader.  It is both
comprehensive and authoritative in explaining the major mental illnesses
(schizophrenia, mood disorders, and anxiety disorders); how individuals are
affected; how the diseases are treated; public attitudes toward mental
illness; what the cost to society is; what current research tells us.
<P>
It also discusses how current research is impacting treatment and attitudes
of the public, Federal and private funding for research, and the implications
of the information learned.
<P>
The chapter titled "Mental Disorders and the Brain" includes explanations and
diagrams of neurons, synapses, and the functional parts of the human brain,
complete with PET and MRI scans.  
<P>
Genetics and genetic counseling are explained, as well as other promising
directions in the search for causes of mental illness.  
<P>
The authors address the cost of severe mental disorders (estimated at $136.1
billion in 1991) and state that "Dollar figures alone, however, no matter how
large, do not convey the toll that mental disorders take....Data show that
approximately one third of the homeless population and 10 to 15 percent of
individuals incarcerated in jails and prisons have a severe mental disorder
such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder...."
<P>
The book's summary begins with a statement dealing with the negative effect
of stigma:  "While the last 30 years have seen an improvement in the public's
knowledge of and attitudes toward mentaldisorders, stigma still
abounds....negative public attitudes contribute to discrimination research
support, treatment availability, financing of care, housing, and employment."
<P>
The summary goes on to point out that "The OTA identified several ways in
which the data from biological research into mental disorders and perceptions
of that data can affect public attitudes and policy."
<P>
The other OTA publication, PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES, EMPLOYEMENT AND THE ADA,
provides a look at the medical, social, legislative, and policy events that
led to and continue to shape the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990 with regard to psychiatric disabilities and employment. 
<P>
This manual describes how requirements of the ADA affect both employees with
psychiatric disabilities and their employers, and it offers guidance for
using the law to expand employment opportunities for mental health consumers.
It includes an update from current literature about psychiatric disabilities,
offers suggestions for reasonable accommodations in the workplace, and
explains the role of federal agencies in providing guidance for
implementation. 
<P>
One important piece of information in the report is the fact that
approximately 60 percent of disabled workers  most of them mental health
consumers  are unaware of the ADA and are, therefore, not likely to use its
protection in securing their full entitlement in employment.  The OTA report
suggests that questions should be raised about the responsibility that
government agencies such as Social Security and the Equal Employment
Opportunities Commission have to educate people with disabilities about the
ADA.  (It also would be important to include employers.)

<P>
Medicine and Mental Illness by Marvin E. Lickey and Barbara
Gordon. W.H. Freeman & Co., New York: 1991. 459 pp. NAMI Price:
$18.
<P>
This book could serve as an excellent text in a family training
class, as well as up-to-date reading material about the brain and
nervous system for mental health professionals in need of
continuing education. 
<P>
"Until the early 1970s, we had not paid much attention in our
research and teaching to the medical application of neuroscience,
supposing psychiatry (to be) a rather unscientific, not really
medical profession whose responsibility was to look after
helpless people who were not medically ill," write the authors,
both professors of psychology at the University of Oregon.
<P>
The first impetus in writing the book was the authors' students,
who challenged their aloofness in the use of medicine to treat
mental illness. The second impetus was the experience of a
colleague who suffered a severe episode of mental illness.
<P>
"After nearly two years of floundering with ineffective
therapies, misdiagnosis, and inappropriate drugs, our friend
finally consulted a psychiatrist, who gave the correct diagnosis,
an effective drug treatment, and effective psychotherapy. His
recovery was so dramatic that in an earlier age it would have
been called a miracle."
<P>
The authors sought to better understand the reasons medical
treatments can produce such beneficial results, and this textbook
was one product of their deeper understanding. 
<P>
Designed to teach basic principles of psychopharmacology to
students in the fields of psychology and neuroscience, this book
can be read easily by educated family members, patients, and
professionals who do not have extensive scientific training.
<P>
The original version, published about a decade ago, offered
in-depth chapters on schizophrenia, mood disorders, drugs, and
side effects. The authors have added new information on
agoraphobia, panic, and obsessive compulsive disorders. 
<P>
Noting that much progress has been made in the last decade in
understanding the biological basis of psychiatric disorders, the
authors are optimistic about the effectiveness of many
medications.
<P>
They describe current developments in drug therapy in detail, but
they do not neglect to mention treatment failures and problems.
They also discuss the value of psychotherapy, especially for
depressed individuals.
<P>
The authors draw from recent medical research to compile and
expand their bibliography. Each chapter ends with many helpful
references for readers who want to explore a topic more
thoroughly.
<P>

<A NAME = "publi"><H2>PUBLICATIONS ON EMPLOYMENT</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In addition to the OTA report on employment and the ADA, three additional
publications have recently been published which also address the subject of
employment of persons with mental illnesses. 
<P>
The first to be published was MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS IN THE WORKPLACE, a 40
page booklet published in 1992 and available for $6.95 from the Bazelon
Center for Mental Health Law, 1101 15th Street, NW, Suite 1212, Washington,
DC  20005.  
<P>
It offers a guide for consumers and families regarding legal protections
against employment discrimination.  It briefly discusses "reasonable
accommodations," but does not include the useful lists of examples found in
other sources.
<P>
Another publication is THE ADA AND PEOPLE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS: A RESOURCE
MANUAL FOR EMPLOYERS, published by the American Bar Association with the
National Mental Health Association (NMHA).  Itis available for $35 from the
NMHA, 1021 Prince Street, Alexandria,VA  22314.  
<P>
While the title indicates that the manual was written for employers, it
stresses the importance of employers and employees working together for their
mutual benefit.  The book recommends viewing the consumer as a dynamic
individual who should not only be protected by provisions that prevent or
accommodate relapse, but who also should have accommodations that will allow
for advancement. 
<P>
Sections on prevalent illnesses, with their symptoms and treatments, were
contributed and reviewed by doctors from the National Institute of Mental
Health (NIMH).  These sections should be helpful to the uninitiated in
developing accommodations and in removing stigma associated with mental
illness. 
<P>
In addition to easily read charts with examples of reasonable accommodations,
the book also includes a chart of potential barriers.  It adds that
addressing discrimination in employment is particularly important "...because
employment is key to independence and a feeling of self worth, and also
because 66 percent of unemployed working age people with disabilities say
that they would like to have a job."
<P>
Still another useful manual, especially for mental health consumers who are
employed or seeking employment, is one published in 1993 bythe California
Department of Mental Health, 1600 9th Street, Room 250, Sacramento, CA
95814.  CASE STUDIES ON REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR WORKERS WITH
PSYCHIATRIC DISABILITIES, by Laura Mancuso, is based on interviews with
workers with psychiatric disabilities and with their employers.  
<P>
The book explores the implications of a number of issues related to
employment, starting with the very real one of disclosure of the disability.
As one employee put it, "The day may dawn when I feel like telling the whole
world I have mental illness.  But for now it's too risky.  I don't want to be
ostracized."
<P>
This manual describes functional limitations that may be experienced by
workers and gives a number of useful examples of reasonable accommodations
for those limitations.  The most frequent accommodation mentioned was a
flexible or part time schedule. Because it focuses on real life problems, it
is an especially practical guide to the subject.  
<P>
The author concludes with the opinion that people with psychiatric
disabilities need the anti discrimination protections of the ADA more,
perhaps, than any other group.  She adds, "This study shows that reasonable
accommodations have been, and will continue to be, made for a variety of
reasons.  Most important, employers willingly make accommodations to increase
the productivity of valued employees."

The Depression Workbook: A Guide for Living With Depression and
Manic Depression by Mary Ellen Copeland. New Harbinger
Publications: 1992. 302pp. NAMI Price: $13.27
<P>
This book should be put in the hands of anyone who suffers from a
mood disorder. It offers a real tool in moving toward wellness
and stability. 
<P>
The author has an affective disorder herself. Before writing the
book, she surveyed 120 persons with mood disorders from around
the country to learn their thoughts and insights. 
<P>
Too often, people who have a mood disorder see themselves as
victims who can only be rescued by medications and therapy. This
book places the task of getting well squarely on the shoulders of
the consumer.
<P>
Chapter after chapter challenges the reader to examine all
aspects of one's life, to take responsibility, experiment and
make changes.
<P>
"I don't believe there is one answer for everyone," the author
writes. "Controlling the symptoms must be dealt with first, then
each individual must explore his or her own problem. Different
people respond differently to different approaches. There's bound
to be something that will work -- it just takes time to find it."
<P>
The reader is encouraged to make a chart of moods in order to
learn early warning signs. The book teaches how to build a
support system, how to address negative thinking, how to relax.
Diet and exercise are shown to be very important. 
<P>
Chapters explore the experiences of depression and mania,
possible causes of mood disorders, coming down from mania, ways
out of depression, finding support and appropriate health care
professionals, developing a lifestyle that enhances wellness, and
preventing suicide.
<P>
But the greatest feature of this book is the way it interacts
with the reader. In the section on exercise, for example,
questions are followed by spaces for the reader to fill in.
<P>
"What could you do for yourself that would make it easier to
exercise when you are depressed?" is one question. "What are your
early warning signs that you are on a downward spiral?" is
another question, followed by a checklist.
<P>
Editing and layout are an improvement over the original
spiral-bound version. While the resource list in the back
includes some helpful books people might otherwise miss, it also
includes titles only tangentially related to mood disorders.
<P>
The section on medications lists mainly older books from around
1980.  This is a serious drawback in view of recent rapid
advances in treatment. All in all, however, this is an empowering
book.  
<P>

<A NAME = "treat"><H2>TREATMENT OF OCD </H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
This volume is one in the series, Treatment Manuals for Practitioners, edited by David H. Barlow.  It
is written by Gail Steketee, one of the world's experts on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  The
book will be particularly useful to clinicians who work with persons who have this disorder.  It will
also be useful to OCD and family support groups.
<P>
The focus of the book is on behavioral treatments, but the section on psychopharmacology is
excellent and up-to-date.  It is important that these tools be understood as completely as possible
because they really work, which cannot be said of the traditional psychotherapeutic methods. 
Research studies are documented throughout the book as a basis for the various aspects of
treatment.  The book also makes available a number of handouts and forms in the appendix, including
symptom check lists, which may be copied without permission.

<A NAME = "twone"><H2>TWO NEW BOOKS ON SCHIZOPHRENIA</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Surviving Schizophrenia:  A Manual for Families, Consumers, and Providers, third edition, by E. Fuller Torrey, M.D. 
<P>
Coping With Schizophrenia:  A Guide for Families by Kim T. Mueser, Ph.D., and Susan Gingerich, M.S.W.
<P>
Veteran readers of the literature for lay persons about serious mental illness say that "more books are published every year" and that "the quality of many of them is excellent."  The books reviewed here illustrate this phenomenon.
<P>
When Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's book, Surviving Schizophrenia, was first published in l984, there was nothing like it in print.  It became the Bible of NAMI members, and NAMI sold thousands of copies.  Revised in l988, it still stood alone in the marketplace. 
<P>
Now the third edition is available, updated to cover the effect on perceptions and treatment of schizophrenia of a decade of research in science, pharmacology, services, and treatment.  And, lo and behold, another book stands beside it:  Coping with Schizophrenia:  A Guide for Families, by Kim T. Muesner, Ph.D., and Susan Gingerich, M.S.W.  Dr. Torrey's third edition and the Muesner and Gingerich book are comprehensive, authoritative, compassionate, and understandable.  
<P>
Both offer practical, realistic help for those dealing with the problems schizophrenia raises.  Both seek a higher quality of life for schizophrenia sufferers and their families, and both share the hope Dr. Torrey expresses in his preface:
<P>
"There is now more hope than there ever has been--hope for research breakthroughs, hope for better treatments, hope for better lives.  Such hope will drive us forward until it is realized. (p. xiv)"
<P>
Dr. Torrey is a Washington-based clinical and research psychiatrist.  He is well known to many NAMI members and has spoken at many NAMI conventions and affiliate meetings.  Dr. Muesner is an associate professor of psychiatry and community and family medicine at Dartmouth Medical School. 
<P>
 Ms. Gingerich is a research associate at the Medical College of Pennsylvania.  All three have specialized in the treatment of schizophrenia, and all three view it as a no-fault brain disease.  Dr. Torrey has led a recent major study of schizophrenia and twins.
<P>
As the subtitle of Dr. Torrey's book states, the third edition is for consumers and providers as well as families.  In the first section of the book, he describes the enormity of schizophrenia as a national public health issue.  The next section deals sensitively and in depth with the experience of schizophrenia "from the inside," by quoting what consumers say about their suffering.  "If a worse disease than schizophrenia exists, it has not yet come to light," Dr. Torrey writes.
<P>
The next sections tell readers what schizophrenia is and is not and discuss the prognoses of the disease.  The author then moves on to discussions of the causes of schizophrenia, its treatment (psychiatry, hospitals, and medication), and rehabilitation. 
<P>
Perhaps the most practical parts of the book are the chapters that deal with six major problems and ten questions that arise with schizophrenia.  Newcomers to Surviving Schizophrenia may want to begin with these chapters.  
<P>
In the final chapter, "How to be an Advocate," Dr. Torrey draws on his experience with NAMI's program of education, support, and advocacy.  His specific suggestions reflect the activities of NAMI affiliates.
<P>
Additional reading is suggested at the end of each chapter, and there are four appendices.  The first is an annotated list of l5 books about schizophrenia (all of them were sold at one time by NAMI, many of them are sold today) and the l5 worst books on the subject.  The second appendix is a list of videotapes.  
<P>
The third lists resources available to readers:  good journals to keep them up-to-date, NAMI networks and other groups with specific interests related to schizophrenia, courses and training programs, and addresses of exemplary clubhouses and continuous treatment teams.  The final appendix lists NAMI's state affiliates and phone numbers.  There are notes for each chapter that are interesting to read, but difficult to correlate with chapter texts.
<P>
Coping with Schizophrenia:  A Guide for Families covers much the same territory as Dr. Torrey's book, but in a somewhat different style.  Tables, worksheets, and short summaries of topics enhance readability, as do the frequent subdivisions of chapter sections.  Part I is an overview that defines the disease, discusses diagnosis, and reviews symptoms. 
<P>
Part II, entitled "Preventing Relapse," deals with treatment.  Part III suggests ways in which families can create a more supportive environment, and it includes a helpful section on problem-solving techniques.  Part IV deals with specific problems, including alcohol and drug abuse. 
<P>
And Part V, entitled "Looking Ahead," includes a chapter on sibling relationships.  A "Resources" section lists agencies and organizations that may be helpful to families and includes an unannotated bibliography that is extended in a chapter-by-chapter list of additional books.
<P>
Which book does the NAMI Literature Committee recommend?  It recommends both, and NAMI will sell both.  The Torrey book is longer and deals in greater detail with the dimensions of the schizophrenia problem, the experience of schizophrenia, rehabilitation, and advocacy.  Its appendices are much more extensive than the resources section of the Muesner and Gingerich book.
<P>
Dr. Torrey occupies a special place in NAMI's history and NAMI's heart.  His new book demonstrates his wide-ranging knowledge and wisdom.  We are delighted to place another how-to book on schizophrenia beside Surviving Schizophrenia on the NAMI bookshelf.  That the two were published almost simultaneously is a cause for rejoicing among NAMI members.  More books about serious mental illness are published every year, and the quality of many of them is excellent.  We have come along way since we began.

been interested in hearing more development of the characters and
issues involved.  This surprised me, given their young ages.
<P>
"My oldest daughter immediately requested that she be allowed to
take the book for 'sharing day' with her first grade class.  The
book was apparently well received by the class as well.  The
teacher took the opportunity to participate by sharing that she
herself had diabetes, and that she also knew people with
schizophrenia.  
<P>
"When I told them that one of my young patients in the hospital
had schizophrenia, my youngest daughter seemed moved.  She wanted
to do something for him.  She drew a 'birthday card' for me to
give to him.  She has since asked if I needed any more cards for
patients. 
<P>
"The concise and simple format of the book has advantages.  I
would like to see future books similarly written for young
children which elaborate further on issues confronting patients
with serious mental disorders."
<P>
This book fills a unique spot.  It will be welcomed by parents,
teachers, and others who are faced with the challenge of teaching
young children about serious mental illness.

<P>
"Schizophrenia from Mind to Molecule" is a collection of thirteen
essays--some highly technical--that provides a comprehensive and
authoritative picture of the current state of schizophrenia
research.  It is divided into five sections dealing with human
experience, phenomenology, neurobiology, treatment, and the
molecular basis for the disease.
<P>
Although most of the book will be of primary interest to 
psychiatrists and brain scientists, the first three chapters
are quite accessible to family members.  Dr. Martin Willick
writes movingly from the perspective of a psychiatrist who
is also the parent of a schizophrenic son; Laurie Flynn of NAMI
succinctly summarizes the enormous social, economic, and family
costs of schizophrenia and proposes policy solutions aimed
at providing appropriate care and treatment; and Dr. John Strauss
looks at the need for balance between the psychosocial and
neurobiological aspects of the disease.
<P>
Although most of the remaining ten chapters go into considerable
detail about the specialized research underway in the primary
areas addressed in the five sections of the book, "Schizophrenia
from Mind to Molecule" is recommended as a resource for affiliate
libraries.
<P>
Note:  This book can be purchased through your local bookstore or
may be on loan through your public library.

<A NAME = "thema"><H2>"THE MAD AMONG US"</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
Complete Title:  "The Mad Among Us:  A History of the Care of
America's Mentally Ill<P>
Gerald Grob, professor of the history of medicine at Rutgers
University, is the leading historian of the treatment of mental
illness in the United States.  "The Mad Among Us:  A History of
the Care of America's Mentally Ill" draws on a lifetime of
research and four earlier volumes that cover various periods and
aspects of his subject.  Authoritative (with extensive notes for
each chapter) yet readable, the entire book will be interesting
to NAMI members with a flair for history.  The last third,
however, covering the period from the end of World War II to the
present, is "must" reading for those who want to understand the
system we deal with in our daily lives.  Throughout, the book is
humane and compassionate as it illustrates the irony of deep
social concern coexisting with the unmet needs of persons with
serious mentally illnesses.
<P>
The first two-thirds of the book covers care of the mentally ill
in families in colonial times; notes the first mental hospital
that opened in Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1767; and discusses the
development of asylums and public mental hospitals in the 19th
century.  Institutions soon came to be understaffed and
overcrowded, and patients were often neglected and badly treated.
<P>
Mental hospital reform was a continuing issue in public policy,
spearheaded by Dorothea Dix in the l850s to l870s.  As psychiatry
developed, it long remained associated with mental hospitals and
became independent only in this century.  Treatment theories
informed the practice of care:  always professionals searched for
a treatment that would cure patients and allow them to leave
hospitals and lead normal, independent lives.
<P>
NAMI members' interest in "The Mad Among Us" will probably
quicken in the last third of the book, which traces developments
since 1945 when the locus of treatment shifted from the hospital
to the community.  The central theme is the key role of the
federal government.  The Social Security Act of 1935 was amended
in 1965 to set up Medicare and Medicaid; in l956 to provide
disability benefits (SSDI); and in l972 to provide income support
(SSI). These amendments soon covered the mentally ill and infused
large amounts of federal funds into their care and treatment.
Other legislation provided federal leadership in shaping the
concept of community care: the National Mental Health Act in
1946, the Mental Retardation and Community Mental Health Centers
Construction Act of 1963, and its extension in 1975.  The Mental
Health Systems Act of October 1980 was repealed in 1981 and block
grants to the states were initiated--reversing "nearly three
decades of federal involvement and leadership" (p. 287).  As a
result, the care and treatment of the mentally ill became
fragmented.
<P>
NAMI members know well the failures of the community care
concept. Levels of funding for community health centers were
always low, and the centers were slow to accept the need for
supportive services for the mentally ill that must accompany
treatment.  In addition, as the centers expanded their work with
persons with emotional problems, those with serious mental
illnesses were crowded out.  
<P>
In the l960s, l970s, and l980s, mental hospitals discharged
increasing numbers of patients to communities that were usually
poorly equipped to help them.  Some became homeless.  By the late
1970s, large numbers of young mentally ill persons--never
hospitalized--were suffering also from alcoholism and drug abuse.
<P>
NIMH's Community Support Program in 1977 and the State
Comprehensive Mental Health Service Plan Act in 1986 supported
efforts by the states to integrate federal entitlement programs
and community services for seriously mentally ill persons.  Other
privately funded efforts have been undertaken nationally; and, as
NAMI members know, innovative programs that combine treatment and
psychosocial services have proliferated in states and
communities. Such programs often reduce the need for
hospitalization and foster a better quality of life.  The author
applauds the advocacy of NAMI in the 1980s and 1990s in support
of these developments in services.
<P>
A minor theme interwoven with the central theme is based on the
changes since 1945 in the theories that underlie treatment. 
Seldom seen today is the practice of making early interventions
in emotional difficulties that was based on a "continuum theory"
of mental disorders (meaning that they begin with emotional
difficulties and end with chronic mental disease).  The advent of
psychotropic drugs and the findings of brain research have
challenged psychoanalytic theory and given treatment leadership
to biological psychiatry.  Increasingly, treatment deals with the
psychiatric and the human needs of the seriously mentally ill.
<P>
These reviewers feel that Professor Grob does not give adequate
emphasis to the giant leap forward in scientific research into
the brain that has revolutionized the understanding of serious
mental illnesses in the last decade.  This research is largely
the result of the impact of the research budget of NIMH.  The
author thus inadvertently understates the role of NAMI's
advocacy, inasmuch as we have been a leading advocate of brain
research.  The policy debate is still going on, but NAMI members
can be heartened that today biological psychiatry gives the
debate a scientific foundation.
<P>
What does all this history teach us as we continue to grope as a
nation for wisdom when dealing with serious mental illness?   Two
lessons are clear:  we must be more realistic in our anticipation
of what public policy can achieve, and we must be more humble
about our knowledge of the complex issues serious mental
illnesses raise.  The following are some thoughts of Professor
Grob:
<P>
The community mental health policy proved no less problematic
than its institutional predecessor.
<P>
If American society is to deal effectively, compassionately, and
humanely with the serious mentally ill, we must acknowledge that
this group includes individuals with quite different disorders,
prognoses, and needs, the outcome of which varies considerably
over time.
<P>
We must also confront the evidence that serious mental disorders
are often exacerbated by other social problems of a nonmedical
nature--poverty, racism, and substance abuse.  Although
psychiatric therapies can alleviate symptoms and permit
individuals to live in the community, there is no magic that will
cure all cases of serious mental illnesses.[Mental illnesses] can strike at any time and among all elements
of the population.  The ensuing impact on the individual, family,
and society is immense, for it often leads to disability and
dependency.  Treatment does not necessarily eliminate the
disorder.[We must not be discouraged in our efforts] to find ways to
alleviate some of the adverse consequences of illness...[and to
assist] seriously ill persons in coping with and managing their
condition.
<P>
The severely mentally ill have a moral claim upon our sympathy,
compassion, and, above all, upon our assistance.

Adverse Effects of Psychotropic Drugs by John M. Kane, MD,
Jeffrey A. Lieberman, MD, and Oliver G. Cameron, MD, PhD
Published by Guiliford Press, 1993.  511 pp  $60.00
<P>
Twenty years ago, Shader and DiMascio edited "Psychotropic Drug
Side Effects."  A great deal has happened in psychopharmacology
in the intervening 20 years (for example, development of the
specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors,and recognition of the
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and tardive dyskinesia), and a new
book on side effects, adverse effects of psychopharmacological
agents is very timely.  Thus, the recently published edited
volume by Drs. Kane, Lieberman, and Cameron is quite welcome.
<P>
This is a book written for and by physicians, mainly clinical
psychopharmacologist; over 90 percent of the contributing authors
are MDs or DOs.
<P>
The subject matter and level of detail are directed at
practitioners who are specialists in the therapeutic use of
psychotropic agents.  Most of the authors are from the United
States, especially from New York and Massachusetts, but a few are
from the United Kingdom and Ireland.
<P>
There are 3 major sections in the book, titled "General Issues,"
"Side Effect Profiles of Psychotropic Drugs," and "Special
Populations."
<P>
The general issues section focuses on pre- and post-marketing
evaluations of drug safety, drug-drug interactions, abuse
potential, and informed consent, while the section on special
populations addresses problems primarily related to children and
geriatric patients.
<P>
In the section on side effect profiles, there are 5 subsections:<br>
(1) "Behavioral Effects," <br>
(2) "Neuromuscular Effects," <br>
(3) "Cardiovascular Effects," <br>
(4) "Convulsive Effects," and <br>
(5) "Endocrine Effects." <br>
<P>
The chapters in the subsection on behavioral effects are arranged
around types of drugs--antidepressants and lithium, neuroleptics,
benzodiazepines, and psychostimulants.
<P>
Most of the neuromuscular side effects of psychotropic are due to
the antipsychotics; however, there is also a welcome chapter
included on these effects due to antidepressants and lithium.  
<P>
The cardiovascular effects subsection focuses on the effects of
antidepressants -- heterocyclic and monoamine oxidase inhibitors,
while the subsection on convulsive effects deals with several
classes of drugs in a single chapter.
<P>
The subsection on endocrine effects actually deals with more than
just endocrine issues, and is thus somewhat inappropriately
named; in addition to chapters on endocrine, metabolic, and
nutritional effects, and on reproductive and sexual, there are
chapters on hematologic, immune system, gastrointestinal and
hepatic and genitourinary.  
<P>
The authors provide the reader with numerous useful tables,
figures and references. The 15-page index is very helpful. 
Because of its focus, length and detail, the subsection on
neuromuscular effects might be the best and most useful in the
book, especially since these adverse effects are often very
problematic and not as routinely recognized by clinicians as they
should be.
<P>
The typical member of NAMI is likely to find this book not "all
you wanted to know," but much more than that, and at a level of
technical detail which is likely to make many parts of the volume
not understandable to someone not clinically trained in this
area. 
<P>
But knowing that this information is now easily available in an
up-to-date version is important to anyone who has an interest in
the optimal care of individuals on psychotropic medications.
<P>
You might not read this book yourself, but you will want to know
where you can find the wealth of knowledge contained in it, and
you will want to be sure that the prescribing physician does too!

<A NAME = "anint"><H2>AN INTERVIEW WITH DR. TORREY</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
An interview with E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., author of Surviving Schizophrenia:  A Manual for Families, Consumers and Providers, Third Edition.  
<P>
How is your new edition of Surviving Schizophrenia different from the previous ones?
<P>
The third edition of Surviving Schizophrenia is as different from the second edition as its green cover is different from the orange cover on the older edition.  Even the subtitle of the book has been changed from "A Family Manual" to "A Manual for Families, Consumers and Providers."
<P>
I have especially reorganized the practical aspects of the book so that readers can more readily pick out what they are looking  for. For example, Chapter 9 is entitled "Six Major Problems" and has sections on 1) Cigarettes and Coffee; 2) Alcohol and Street Drugs; 3) Sex, Pregnancy, and AIDS; 4) Medication Noncompliance; 5) Assaultive and Violent Behavior; and 6) Suicide.
<P>
Chapter 10 is "Questions Asked by Consumers and Families," and it has sections such as "Should People with Schizophrenia Drive Motor Vehicles?" "How Can Relapses Be Reduced?" and "How Do Religious Issues Affect People with Schizophrenia?"
<P>
I have also included more practical information on resources.   There is a six-page listing of the most useful videotapes, compiled by Mrs. Katie Petray, as well as a listing of available courses forgetting education on schizophrenia.  
<P>
My favorite section continues to be the annotated "Readings on Schizophrenia," which has been expanded to include "The 15 Best and the 15 Worst."   Some old favorites and unfavorites are joined by new nominees, including some outstanding books and also some that are truly dreadful.
<P>
What are some of the positive changes that have taken place in the last 12 years in how we view and treat this disease?
<P>
The two most exciting changes that have taken place in the past 12 years have been advances in research and a decrease in stigma.   We know much more about schizophrenia as a brain disease, as I summarize in Chapter 6, "What Causes Schizophrenia?"  
<P>
Increased research funds from NIMH, NARSAD, the Theodore and Vada Stanley Foundation, and the Scottish Rite have merged with rapidly improving technology for studying the brain to produce a veritable stream of research developments, and this stream is accelerating.   It is really an exciting time from a research point of view.
<P>
The decrease in stigma has come largely through public education..  NAMI members at the local level (for example, teaching a class at a local school) and at the national level are largely responsible for this decrease in stigma.  
<P>
However, the single largest factor in decreasing stigma has been the willingness of individuals who have been affected with schizophrenia to go public and talk about their experiences in newspaper interviews, books, radio, television, and videotapes.  We owe a great debt to these individuals, such as Fred Frese, Lori Schiller, Esso Leete, Carol North, Brandon Fitch, and the others.
<P>
Is anything surrounding this disease or its treatment actually worse now than it was a decade ago?
<P>
There is no question that public services, overall, are worse than a decade ago.  More individuals with schizophrenia are living in public shelters and on the streets; more of them are in jails (usually on misdemeanor charges); more of them are living in very marginal group homes; and more of them are living in questionable nursing homes. 
<P>
For many reasons, which I detail in Chapter 1, "Dimensions of the Disaster," deinstitutionalization has been carried out very poorly and is the largest single failed social experiment in twentieth-century America.  We are so used to the mediocre services that we forget how bad they are.
<P>
For that reason I included a new section in the book on "Examples of Good Services" and listed (with an accompanying map) the best clubhouses, the best continuous treatment teams, and the best community mental health centers and comprehensive treatment programs.
<P>
The other troublesome question that has recently arisen--and which I discuss in the book--is whether the incidence of schizophrenia is increasing in the United States.  There is recent data suggesting that it may be.  If this is indeed true, then our problems with services are going to get even larger.
<P>
How will consumers and families be helped by your book?  Overall, what does it offer them that they have trouble obtaining otherwise?
<P>
Surviving Schizophrenia offers families, consumers, and providers one-stop shopping.  In a single book an answer can be found to almost any question that may arise, from the history of schizophrenia to a list of the best journals to read to keep up on the research developments.  
<P>
My model for the book is Dr. Benjamin Spock's Baby and Child Care, which is so widely used because it tells mothers everything they need to know in a single volume.  The third edition of  Surviving Schizophrenia has a markedly expanded table of contents (five pages) and index (17 pages) so that readers can quickly find whatever they need.  
<P>
In that sense, Surviving Schizophrenia is the type of book that you keep around and pick up to read specific sections.  It's not a book that you read once through then put on the shelf.
<P>
What is the most often asked question about schizophrenia from someone such as a family member who has just learned that a loved one has the disorder.  What is your answer?  The most often asked question is the obvious one:  What can be done?  And my response to it is to emphasize the importance of finding a competent psychiatrist and the importance of starting antipsychotic medication as quickly as possible.  I detail this in Chapter 7, "The Treatment of Schizophrenia."  
<P>
The next most often asked question is frequently asked indirectly:   "Did I cause my relative to become sick?"  Those of us who are familiar with research on schizophrenia sometimes forget how many people are not familiar with it.
<P>
Family members often assume that they played some role in causing their relative's disease.  I explain that they played no more role in causing the schizophrenia than they would if their relative had developed Parkinson's disease or multiple sclerosis--in other words, no role whatsoever.
<P>
If the family of a person with schizophrenia remembers just one major point made in your book--holds onto just one message--what would you like it to be?  If the consumer remembers just one point, what would you like it to be?
<P>
For the family, I would ask them to read Chapter 2, "The Inner World of Madness," and realize how difficult life is for individuals with schizophrenia.  People with schizophrenia are often heroic in their efforts to control their voices and delusional thinking and to lead normal lives.   
<P>
For the consumer, I would ask him or her to read Chapter 11, "How to Be an Advocate," and parts of Chapter 10, such as "How Can Consumers Survive Schizophrenia?"  If they remember just one point, I would like it to be the increasing role that consumers themselves are playing in advocacy efforts and in delivering services to other individuals who are affected with this disease.  
<P>
Perhaps the best examples are the consumer provider (also called consumer case manager) training programs listed in Appendix C.  Consumers are playing an increasing role in services, and this is exciting progress.

<HR>
<H4>An Unquiet Mind:  A Memoir of Moods and Madness</H4>
<P>
by Kay Redfield Jamison
<P>
Reviewed by Diane T. Marsh, Barbara Pilvin, and Judith Tydings, for the NAMI Literature Committee.
	<P>
	In An Unquiet Mind, psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison has written an extraordinary account of her experience with manic-depression (the term she prefers to bipolar disorder).  For more than three decades, Dr. Jamison has lived with this "quicksilver" illness, with its mercurial moods, and with its "peculiar kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror."  No reader will be untouched by her memoir, which is inarguably one of the most powerful, insightful, and eloquent depictions of life with this illness.
	<P>Dr. Jamison is professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and coauthor of the standard medical text on manic-depressive illness.  Thus, it is with fascination that we read of her struggle against lithium, the drug that would ultimately save her life.  She writes about her belief that she should handle her illness without "crutches" such as medication and about the severe side effects she experienced.  Dr. Jamison also shares her deep resistance to relinquishing the exhilarating highs of the illness--"the intensity, glory, and absolute assuredness of my mind's flight"--for a life that seemed restrictive, less productive, and "maddeningly less intoxicating."  Ultimately, she made peace with lithium only when it was clear that the alternatives were death or insanity.
<P>	The book also offers a compelling description of her recovery process.  She acknowledges the value of medication, of psychotherapy, and of the many people in her personal and professional lives who have provided essential--indeed, lifesaving--support.  Readers will also witness her personal resilience in a struggle that took her to the "blackest caves of the mind."  In her words, "One of the advantages of having had manic-depressive illness for more than thirty years is that very little seems insurmountably difficult."
<P>	The book's arrangement is essentially chronological, beginning with Dr. Jamison's childhood and adolescence.  She describes the emergence of the disorder, its relentless course, and its increasing hold on her life.  She details her severest symptoms of depression and mania, her visual hallucinations, and her deliberate--and nearly fatal--lithium overdose.  From the dual perspectives of patient and professional, she places these experiences in the context of her own life and of the larger professional territory.  There are also some wonderful philosophical and humorous passages.
<P>	Given Dr. Jamison's multiple roles as a consumer, professional, and family member, as well as her gifts as a writer, this book is likely to appeal to the widest possible audience.  At the same time, readers may respond differently to a number of themes in the book, as did NAMI reviewers.  The three reviewers agreed on the overall value and importance of the book.  They responded differently, however, to Dr. Jamison's discussion of the positive aspects of this disorder, including the relationship between bipolar disorder and creativity, which was explored in Jamison's earlier book, Touched With Fire.  One reviewer, a psychologist, family member, and painter, felt that the emphasis on the creativity and contributions of people with bipolar disorder offers a valuable corrective to the widespread tendency to define people in terms of their illness and to ignore their strengths, talents, and potential for recovery.
<P>	On the other hand, a second reviewer, who has bipolar disorder herself, remarked on the level of courage required to write such a personal memoir, but reacted negatively to Dr. Jamison's mention of the positive aspects of this disorder--as if she were trying to convince herself (and her readers) that it is truly worth having.  The third reviewer, who has a brother with bipolar disorder, pointed out that Dr. Jamison has been very fortunate in spite of her illness, as the author herself acknowledged when addressing the NAMI convention last summer.  Through her writing and television productions, she focuses on the giftedness of painters, musicians, and others like herself who enrich our lives despite their illness.  This reviewer was concerned that the emphasis on giftedness would deflect attention away from those who are not particularly gifted and, in fact, are ravaged by this illness.
<P>	 An Unquiet Mind will remain with you long after you have put it down.  Far more than a memoir of moods and madness, the book is also a journey into the heart of our humanity through the lens of this volatile illness.  Dr. Jamison has charted this journey with grace, candor, and humor.  Hers is an important and moving story, told by a distinguished scientist who has a poet's sensibility.

<P>

Two members of the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New Mexico provide consultation for the American Indian Family Advocate Project, part of New Mexico's Service System Improvement Grant, which is funded through Community Support Programs of the Center for Mental Health Services. 

<P>

In its second year of a three-year funding cycle, the project relies on the New Mexico AMI consultants to develop advocate training; provide consultation on grass roots support, education and advocacy activities; coordinate revision of family-education materials; develop other culturally appropriate materials; make regular site visits to the advocates; and consult with Indian Health Service personnel. 

<P>

For more information about the project, call the Alliance for the Mentally Ill of New Mexico, 1-800-953-6745.

<P>

<A NAME = "grant"><H2>Grant Grows Job Search Skills</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

A Grass Seed Grant--a one-time grant designed to support grassroots development and advocacy by NAMI volunteers in areas such as employment, outreach to special populations, and membership development--resulted in a job-search-skills workbook and program for the Oklahoma AMI that may be reproduced for use by other NAMI affiliates. 

<P>

The Job Search Skills Workbook and a companion leader's guidebook offer tips, explanations, strategies, examples, and hope to those attempting to overcome the stigma attached to mental illness as they prepare to enter or reenter the workforce. 

<P>

Written by William D. Young, Ed.D., of Career Development Services, Inc., and executive director of the Oklahoma AMI, the workbook and guide are intended for use with groups with relatively equivalent occupational objectives, whether they are looking for minimum-wage jobs or top corporate positions. 

<P>

For copies of the workbook and leader's guide--which are looseleaf-bound, suitable for reproduction, and available for $25 (includes shipping and handling)--write to Oklahoma AMI, c/o Bill Young, Executive Director, 1140 N. Hudson Ave., Oklahoma City, OK 73103, or call 405/239-6264. 

<P>

<A NAME = "whoca"><H2>Who Calls the NAMI Helpline?</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

More than 12.5 million families in our neighborhoods and communities are affected by severe mental illnesses, and 175,000 individuals have picked up the phone to call the NAMI Helpline since it began in October of 1990. 

<P>

Records show that--of those that were identified--about 33 percent of the calls are from consumers, 17 percent from siblings or adult children; 15 percent from parents of an adult with mental illness, 11 percent from professionals, eight percent from other relatives, seven percent from parents with a child with mental illness, six percent from a spouse, and three percent are from students or teachers.   

<P>

About 50 trained volunteers staff the operation to answer these 40 thousand to 50 thousand calls a year and mail printed responses.  Those who take the calls listen carefully to people who need to know they are not alone and that help is available.  Callers are mailed information about mental illnesses and are given the phone numbers of their local and state NAMI affiliates.  The information most often requested is about depressive disorders and schizophrenia.

<P>

Diana Ross and Larry King have both referred audiences to the NAMI Helpline, and so have such magazines as Parade, U.S. News and World Report, Time, Reader's Digest, Ladies Home Journal, Essence, Family Circle, Self, YM, and Sassy.  Television programs--especially movies such as Out of Darkness or Call Me Anna--result in the greatest number of calls, but many are also prompted by newspapers, magazines, NAMI publications, and books.

<P>

<A NAME = "irisp"><H2>IRIS Project Raises Awareness</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

The AMI Iris Project--AMI of Wisconsin's grassroots public education and fund-raising effort--continues to grow throughout the country, and it serves as a model for similar projects members may want to launch.

<P>

The Iris Project involves the distribution of lapel-sized, silk irises with a tag explaining that the iris is a symbol of hope for AMI affiliates.  The irises may be sold, exchanged for donations, or given away as a public-education tool.

<P>

Since the project began a year and a half ago, more than 80 AMI affiliates have participated and ordered 70,000 flowers.  AMI of Wisconsin hopes to someday see the iris on as many lapels as the veterans' poppy or the AIDS ribbon.  Affiliates of any size and budget can make an impact in their community and raise money simultaneously. 

<P>

Most affiliates find the average donation for an iris is $1--a 350 percent profit.  Three Wisconsin affiliates netted between $800 and $1,400 during the 1993 Mental Illness Awareness Week with permission from stores for volunteers to stand at entrances with baskets of irises.  The top money-maker--AMI of Waukesha, an affiliate of 80 members in a town of 58,000--earned that $1,400 in one day by targeting two WalMart stores.  Customers donated more than $1,000 for 900 irises, and the store contributed $400.

<P>

Why not ask a garden club or retailer to help promote the project?  Many donors ask questions about the AMI or take brochures or talk of their own experiences.  Use irises at conferences, awards dinners, legislative days and rallies or during May, Mental Health Month.  AMI of Wisconsin has the silk irises, collection canisters, and a marketing guide. 

<P>

Irises must be ordered in multiples of 100, and they cost $.30 each for 100 to 900 and $.28 each for 1,000 or more.  For information, call AMI of Wisconsin, 1410 Northport Drive, Madison, WI 53704.  608/257-5888.

<H2>Psychotoxic Drugs: Legal and Illegal</H2>
<HR>
Psychotoxic Drugs: Legal and Illegal is a new booklet by Jean K. Bouricius, a member of the AMI of Western Massachusetts, the organization that published her work.  In her introduction, Bouricius writes, "Because a very large proportion of persons with serious or persistent mental illness also have problems with substance abuse, it is important that the patients, and those who care about them, understand as much as possible about the effects of the abused substances and about possible treatments....This booklet has been prepared to provide some of the basic information about the major substances of abuse and how they can interact with mental illnesses and with medications.  The possible treatments discussed are primarily those involving medications."  Bouricius has also completed the third edition of Psychoactive Drugs and Their Effects on Mentally Ill Persons, which will be published shortly by NAMI.  To purchase Psychotoxic Drugs, send $2.00 for the booklet plus $1.30 for mailing (as many as three booklets can be mailed for that price) to AMI WM, Inc., 717 Main Street, Agawam, MA 01001.

<P>



During Harris County's tenth annual Mental Illness Awareness Programs the Houston VA Medical Center (VAMC) and the Harris County Alliances for the Mentally Ill (HCAMI) sponsored an all-day workshop:  "A Partnership Among Survivors of Mental Illness:  Veterans, Families, and Treatment Staff" on Saturday, October 15th. 



<P>



Sixty-four consumers, family members, and treatment staff attended with an even mix of the groups.  We heard each other's perspective, joined together as a united team, and began developing a vision for a brighter future.



<P>



The program consisted of: 1) an introduction to members of the treatment team--nurses, physicians' assistants, psychiatrists, psychologists, and social workers; 2) an introduction to nine self-help resources within our community; 3) four concurrent sessions on dual diagnosis, education and employment opportunities, housing, and questions about mental illness and psychiatric emergencies; and 4) two keynote speakers who shared their personal experiences from the consumer and family perspective.



<P>



The first keynote speaker, Bruce Stohr, was extremely powerful in describing painful experiences associated with hospitalizations, failed medications, traumatic efforts at employment, suicide attempts, and his struggle within the Marines. 



<P>



Yet with his family support, alcoholics anonymous sponsors, supported education, and Alliance for the Mentally Ill and consumer support groups he has maintained sobriety, found a medication that works, formed support groups for persons with dual diagnosis, become valedictorian for his college class, and received promotions within his employment with Harris County Mental Health and Mental Retardation Authority.  Bruce emphasized the critical need for hope and mutual support. 



<P>



The second speaker, Diane Ammons, inspired us with her perspective as the wife of a veteran who copes with schizophrenia and as the daughter of a woman who struggled with depression, hospitalizations, and suicide.



<P>



She brought to life the terrible stigma of mental illnesses, which often leads people to avoid talking about these physical illnesses, promotes isolation, and has encouraged professionals to blame families.  Diane encouraged every professional, family member, and consumer to join AMI, to take advantage of educational programs such as Journey of Hope, and to continuously include families and consumers as members of treatment teams.



<P>



At the Houston VAMC we are already working toward future workshops, a Journey of Hope course, and the formation of a VA Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  Our local "re-inventing" of the VAMC involves veterans and their families in planning and program presentations.  As AMI often states:  "Together we will make a difference."

<A NAME = "onbei"><H2>ON BEING A BOARD MEMBER</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>



<P>



As a new member of the NAMI board taking office last July, I felt prepared for the responsibility due to my local, state, and State Presidents' Council experience.  I already knew some of the board and staff and had worked with them, which helped tremendously in my orientation to the board.  In my opinion, candidates for the NAMI board should have broad experience working at the local level and state AMI level.



<P>



I have found that reading is one of the primary skills used daily as a NAMI board member.  Weekly packets of information to read and respond to are mailed from the NAMI office.  I try to respond promptly to the material, read and share the news clippings sent in the packets with my local and state AMI president, and maintain a good filing system so I can retrieve material later as needed. 



<P>



Communications with the other board members and NAMI staff via fax and phone are an almost daily occurrence.  It is a great advantage if you can use a computer to do your own word processing or have someone who can help you with it.



<P>



The NAMI board is a working board, and while it is an honor to be able to serve our grassroots members on the board, the position is not an honorary one.  A "team spirit" attitude, flexibility, and willingness to work hard on assigned tasks are important. 



<P>



One can expect to serve on two or more committees, to be assigned as liaison to one or two councils and networks, and to serve as contact person for four or more states.  Board meetings require travel four times a year (counting the NAMI convention meeting), and it can require two or three work days to attend each meeting.



<P>



It is very important to be knowledgeable about how non-profit boards operate.  The bulk of the work is done by committees.  Running the business of NAMI is very much like running any other business, and having business experience can be helpful.  Fundraising is a board function, and--as a board member--you should be prepared to assist in this area.



<P>



Being a "single issue" board member can be frustrating to both the board member and the rest of the board.  The board sets priorities, and the list of issues and programs is long.  It is also important that board members understand that the only staff member that the board supervises is the executive director, who in turn supervises the rest of the staff.



<P>



My most memorable moment as a board member came in October during our board/staff retreat in which we shared our experience with mental illness as a family member or consumer.  Some of the more poignant stories came from staff; a reminder that they, too, have a personal dedication to our mission.



<P>



I have enjoyed my first six months as a NAMI board member, but I have worked hard.  If you think you would like to join us, please consider this description very carefully.  Then get on board.  We need good workers like you.

<P>



<strong>Why does NAMI have a Literature Committee?</strong>



<P>



The founding members of NAMI adopted three goals:  support for its



members, education of members and the general public, and advocacy



for research and better services.  The Literature Committee



was NAMI's first committee, and it was formed to implement the goal



of education.  The task of the committee was to identify



high-quality, non-technical books about serious mental illness, its



treatment and needed services, and to recommend them to NAMI



members and the public.

<H2>For Siblings &amp; Adult Children</H2>
<HR>
Anguished Voices: Siblings and Adult Children of Persons with
Psychiatric Disabilities, edited by Rex M. Dickens and Diane T.
Marsh.  
<P>
He Was Still My Daddy, by Laurie Samsel Olson.
<P>
Searching for Mercy Street:  My Journey Back to My Mother, Anne
Sexton, by Linda Gray Sexton.
<P>
Review by Rex Dickens, Ann E. Hunt, Margaret Moorman, Kathy Nealen,
and Betsy Samuelson Greer, the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
In these three books, persons with a sibling or parent who is
mentally ill find realistic, well-written accounts of the experience
of growing up in a family whose emotional energies are focused
on dealing with the mentally ill family member.  Personal narratives
by members of NAMI in Anguished Voices, as well as autobiographical
accounts by Laurie Samsel Olson and Linda Gray Sexton, illustrate
how the lives of these very different individuals followed a similar
pattern as they are radically changed by their experience.
<P>
The editors of Anguished Voices compare the common thread in narratives
written by siblings and adult children to common themes in ancient
myths:  Separation, struggle, and return.  Indeed, the personal
narratives--short, direct and poignant in their portrayal of the
pain each author suffered--embody these same three stages. 
<P>
First, separation from life's normal relationships and expectations,
and--to protect a fragile self from further shock-- separation
also from others.  Next, the struggle to find oneself and regain
the ability to share emotions with others, and finally the return
of wellness through knowledge and understanding of an illness
that so overwhelmed them.
<P>
The stories told in Anguished Voices enable other siblings and
adult children to understand that they are not alone, that their
feelings are normal, and that they are not responsible for the
illness of their parent or brother or sister.  Each essay describes
a unique experience, and yet, with courage and honesty, the various
narratives weave a common thread.  Initially, there is an awareness
that &quot;something is not right&quot; at a crucial point in
the authors' lives, &quot;something&quot; they cannot understand.

<P>
There is overwhelming loss, but no comforting support for the
grief.  Much as they love their family member, they are not able
to provide the support that person needs.  They blame themselves
for their failure, and assume guilty responsibility for the ill
family member.  Eventually, through NAMI, each of the writers
learns about mental illness and its devastating effects.  They
can cope, seeing the family member in a new perspective and with
a new understanding.  
<P>
Each of these narratives is different, but each portrays a similar
emotional experience.  As Laurie Olson writes of her family experience
in He Was Still My Daddy, &quot;If we had only been able to share
our feelings about Daddy's illness, perhaps the changes in Daddy
and in our life in general would not have seemed so overwhelming.
 As it was, we were of no help to each other.  We didn't know
we should be.  So we each endured the traumas alone.&quot; 
<P>
When Olson was 16 years old, her 53-year-old father became actively
psychotic.  The illness took away her loving father and left in
his place a stranger who suffered from delusions and deep depression.
 Her older sister and younger brother seemed to cope better than
she at resolving their anger about the incredible impact this
had on their lives.  Her parents' marriage failed, the family
home had to be sold, and a continuing downward economic drift
resulted.
<P>
Olson's own way to cope was by keeping her distance physically
and emotionally from her family.  She was--finally, 15 years later--beginning
to reach out to her father when he died suddenly during surgery.
 Her book has been part of the process of resolving the guilt
she felt over her anger and detachment.  It is a book of hope
and wisdom that other families may &quot;look to one another (and
others) for support and strength instead of suffering in silence
and isolation as my family did.&quot;
<P>
There are many similarities to the account by Olson in the way
Linda Sexton describes how she reacted to her mother and her mental
illness in Searching for Mercy Street.  Both felt betrayed, and
each tried to withdraw from her parent. 
<P>
Sexton evokes the scared feeling of a three-year-old snatched
from her loving, caring mother; the ill-at-ease teenager who wanted
to share her home with friends, but who didn't dare because she
didn't know how her mother would greet them; the anxious child
seeking solitude, but never able to have it with a mother prone
to sudden, irrational outbursts.  She had to cope at an early
age, but without explanation or an understanding of what or why.

<P>
Sexton's famous mother, poet Anne Sexton, left her daughter the
legacy of skill in using words, and as a result the daughter's
powerful prose graphically portrays the early years of separation
and the effect it had on her.  She tells how she learned to avoid
confrontation with her mother and how she yearned for a &quot;normal&quot;
home that was never there.  Reliving her relationship with her
mother allows Sexton to finally understand and forgive.
<P>
These three books, while telling the stories of siblings and adult
children, are also publications for mental health professionals
and other family members.  Anyone--professional, parent or consumer--who
continues to accept at face value the often-polished surfaces
of those who are well, but have grown up with severe mental illness
in their families, should read these books to see what an immense
price is paid for the appearance of success.
<P>
These books are also a reminder of the crushing impact that mental
illness has on &quot;well&quot; family members.  Unintentionally,
as energies are invested to cope with the ill family member--as
a spouse focuses on his or her ill mate or as parents focus on
the ill child--&quot;well&quot; family members are slighted. 
Too often it is the child, the young sibling.  These narratives
tell us not to forget him or her.

<STRONG>The Life Planning Workbook--A Hands-on Guide to Help Parents Provide for the Future Security and Happiness of Their Child with a Disability After Their Death, by L. Mark Russell and Arnold E. Grant.</STRONG>
<HR>
Review by William Zaccagnino for the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
	This book is a hands-on guide to help parents provide for the future security and happiness of their child with a disability after their death.  In fact, it is also a guide for spouses, siblings, or others who feel a responsibility to provide for a disabled person in their estate.  The book provides excellent service to all of these people.
<P>
	Life Planning is very well written.  The authors ask the relevant questions and give good answers to clarify where there may be doubt.  The details included ensure that the parent or other person filling out the workbook--and those who will later use the information--can have reasonable comfort in dealing with the comprehensive array of issues that are a part of life.
<P>
	The workbook provides the means to develop a letter of intent, perform a financial-needs analysis, prepare for a meeting with an attorney, and organize an estate plan.  It even provides a more advanced section for financial professionals to help them understand the approaches taken by the authors in the various tables included in the book.  Together, these sections provide a comprehensive collection of information covering the medical records, life habits, financial needs, and personal relationships that are relevant to the disabled person's life and to parents, siblings, and his or her children.  The authors avoid assumptions: not every sibling will want the responsibility of caring for a disabled brother or sister; every medicine doesn't work for everyone; and every therapist is not right for everyone.
<P>
	It is important to note, which the authors do, that the book is not a substitute for formal legal or financial preparation by professionals.  The information collected by the reader needs to be assembled into documents that will stand a legal test.  However, the book can serve as a vehicle for the reader to think about the many details of the process, assemble the information in one place, and be fully confident that when he or she visits the professionals, the information will be at hand and the resulting legal documents can be held in similar confidence.
<P>
	This workbook is an excellent tool for parents or others responsible for a disabled person to provide some assurance for that person's future security.  It is also an excellent companion publication to Planning for the Future (also authored by L. Mark Russell, and currently on the NAMI sales list).

<H2>Just Between Us</H2>
In this column, I'm going to tell you a story full of unnecessary suffering and grief.  It's been a nightmare to remember and to write about.
<P>
The problem is words. Incredible power is compressed into words. Too many words and notions applied to consumers are poisoned by prejudice.  Stigma insinuates such subtly degrading lies and masquerades in such seductively simple half-truths.
<P>
Wherever the truth about mental illness is more complex than the words regularly used to describe it, that's where consumers suffer helplessly and too often needlessly.  The suffering is because no one sees accurately what's really happening to us or is willing to work with us to stop the tragedies before they happen.  
<P>
The heart of my story is a friend, a friend from the knob country of the rural South, quiet, honest, hard-working, and for parts of his life caught in the iron grip of unreasoning terror.
<P>
He could be painfully shy, withdrawn.  Even those who loved him aren't sure just when he slipped silently into paranoia.  He never graduated from school.  He was too ill.  
<P>
In the grip of driving terror he believed he'd be killed if he didn't defend himself.  He lashed out in explosive violence and killed.  He was found not guilty by reason of insanity and was remanded to a forensics facility where he was treated successfully and released.
<P>
I met him on the bus.  He was lost.  It was a bitter winter and he was wearing a short-sleeved cotton shirt.  Miraculously, he let me give him my sweatshirt and welcomed me as friend. 
<P>
We met more on the phone than in person.  We saw each other regularly on the bus to the local mental health center.  The second time I saw him he told me his story.  He astounded me by his halting openness, his absolute honesty.  Simply, with no evasions, no excuses, he told his tale.  To share that took incredible courage.
<P>
Over time it was clear:  his meds just weren't working as well as they once had.  He was slipping away.  I asked if he'd told his therapist.  He had.  He did again.  He hoped to see a psychiatrist about a meds change.  The available appointment was just too far in the future.  His life was getting scary.
<P>
We urged him to visit emergency intake so he could perhaps access a psychiatrist without the endless wait.  Or, we thought, he'd end up admitted to our local state hospital where he'd been before.
<P>
The mental health center where he went for treatment relies more on counseling than on state-of-the-art meds work.  Come the annual budget crunch, the director is famous among consumers for cutting psychiatry hours rather than talk therapy.  Again my friend tried to schedule a meds visit, but all he could get was another therapy appointment in a few days.  He was deteriorating, becoming volatile and agitated.
<P>
A neighbor, concerned and frightened, took him the next morning to emergency intake.  All he got was words. 
<P>
Later, a family down the street found him wandering, disoriented, and called the police.  The police talked to the neighbor who'd taken him to the center that morning, then took him back to emergency intake.  The person who saw him apparently didn't assess the acuity of the situation, even though my friend's complete records were at the center, and they included details of the not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity verdict.
<P>
Late that evening, after he left the center, the police arrested him for the death of his neighbor, the very person who had taken him to the center in the morning looking for help and care.
<P>
Headlines shrieked, "Mentally Ill Killer Let Loose in Suburban Neighborhood," "Psychotic Killer Strikes Again."
<P>
We saw him in jail awaiting trial.  He wasn't on medication.  He talked word salad.  He was clearly psychotic.
<P>
A mental health professional characterized my friend to the press as a treatment-resistant, uncooperative case.  No one questioned that description or the appropriateness or the effectiveness of the treatment he actually received from that mental health center.
<P>
He was found guilty of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.  He has yet to receive effective medication or appropriate treatment, and he is too ill to avoid the predators inside the bars.
<P>
Our extremely conservative governor mentioned him as a killer who would be kept off our streets by the Republican initiative to build 27 new prisons.  The governor wants to "privatize," or sell, our state mental hospitals to pay for the 27 new prisons.  
<P>
What has this to do with words?  I'm desperate to know, Was all this suffering inevitable because my friend was treatment-resistant and uncooperative?  Or did the treatment system catastrophically fail my friend, his neighbor, and our community?  What about the right to timely, humane, effective care?
<P>

<P>

-- Nearly 90 percent of all brain research is supported by NIMH.

based services including housing and rehabilitation for mentally

ill people. Most NAMI members have used up their private funds

<P>

-- There are about 8 million Americans afflicted with severe

mental illnesses.  Schizophrenia strikes over 1 percent of the

total population; depressive illness disables 5 - 7 percent.

illness are living at home with their families, often without

adequate services.

<P>

-- Nationwide, an estimated 90 percent of all mentally ill people

are unemployed, though many are blessed with both education and

skills.

For many, the stigma attached to mental illness is as painful as

the symptoms of severe psychiatric disorders.

<P>



<A NAME = "namis"><H2>NAMI'S MISSION AND GOALS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A>

<P>

As stated in our bylaws the mission of the National Alliance for

the Mentally Ill is "to eradicate mental illness and improve the

quality of life of those affected by these diseases."

<P>

In the NAMI Long Range Plan, adopted by the Board of Directors in

1988, the mission was further developed as specific goals and

objectives for the organization were defined.

<P>

GOAL:  NAMI will be recognized as the primary source for

information and helpful referral on all aspects of mental

illness.

<P>

GOAL:  The general public will understand that mental illnesses

are no-fault, biologically based, treatable, and may eventually

be curable. The general public will be exposed to and understand

possible solutions and alternative approaches to

services/treatment for mentally ill people.

<P>

GOAL:  Educators and care-givers will incorporate current

research into mental illness practice.

<P>

GOAL:  Mental illness will receive its fair share of government

resources and entitlement based on its incidence and effect on

society.

<P>

In 1990 the Board adopted 7 key priorities to guide our program

planning.  Below is the current list of priorities:

<P>

<OL>

<LI>We place continued emphasis on scientific research so that we

learn causes and develop cures as soon as possible.



<LI>We work to accomplish a major turnaround in the quality,

quantity and accessibility of services to people with mental

illness.



<LI>We work to exercise a profound influence on the development

and implementation of professional/provider education.



<LI>We increase our outreach to men and underserved populations

such as young families with children under 18, minorities and

high and low income families.



<LI>We increase our membership to at least one million families by

the year 2000.



<LI>We work to greatly improve our responsiveness to needs and our

ability to communicate with one another.



<LI>We do more to directly empower ourselves, with particular

emphasis on developing leadership and management skills.

</OL>

<P>

<A NAME = "histo"><H2>HISTORY OF NAMI</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A>

<P>



NAMI is a unique organization.  It began when 254 persons met in

Madison, Wisconsin in September, 1979 to consider how to help

themselves and their mentally ill relatives.

<P>

In one emotional and unforgettable weekend, these pioneers formed

a true grass roots family movement. Although there were a number

of concerned and caring professionals and providers in

attendance, the founders were determined to make NAMI an

organization governed for and by families and consumers.

<P>

(The term 'consumer' is used to describe those who suffer from

mental illness; it is used because, as 'consumers' of various

health and support services, they must be involved in the

development and management of those services, as well as the

underlying research).

<P>

By 1980 NAMI had achieved incorporation, received non-profit tax-

exempt status, and elected an initial Board of Directors.   Early

efforts centered on making connections with small family support

groups across the nation.  An annual conference was planned and a

newsletter was published. We were really on our way!

<P>

From the beginning, NAMI was focused on the unmet needs of people

suffering from the most severe and disabling forms of mental

illness -- schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness and severe

depression.

<P>

These are the persons most in need of long term help and support.

<P>

Severe mental illnesses are very stigmatized in American society;

for decades parents were blamed as the cause of their relatives'

mental disorder.

<P>

NAMI families found courage and hope in joining together to

advocate for needed changes in public policy and attitudes.

<P>

NAMI is persuaded by current research that major mental illnesses

are biochemical brain diseases which can affect anyone, and which

are without known prevention or cure.

<P>

These are not rare disorders; NIMH research has shown that as

many as 8 to 10 percent of all Americans suffer from severe

mental illness, and as many as 1 in 5 families are affected.

<P>

NAMI opened  its first office in Washington DC in 1982 and began

the work of influencing Congress, the Administration and key

decision-makers.  We filled an important gap.

<P>

In a "mental health" community NAMI was exclusively concerned

about mental illness.  In a field long dominated by physicians

and other professionals and service providers, NAMI brought the

long silent voice of caring families and consumers.

<P>

Early leaders spoke out boldly for greater attention to those

afflicted with schizophrenia and affective disorders.  And we

began to ask for accountability from a government that was not

making a significant investment in either research or services

focused on mental illnesses.

<P>

Thousands of families have come "out of the closet" to join NAMI

and embrace our mental illness agenda. Today we number over

140,000 members and approximately 1000 affiliates in all 50

states! 

<P>

Growth brought diversity to the NAMI membership.  In 1985 we

formed a Consumer Council to ensure stronger representation of

those who have suffered with psychiatric illnesses.

<P>

Networks have also been created as a way for members who share a

special identity or focus to meet and work together. By the end

of the 1980's state Alliances had been formed in 46 states.

<P>

As the NAMI membership has grown, so too has the size of

the staff that serves them.  In 1985 we moved our offices to

Rosslyn and in 1988 we moved again to our present location at

Court House.  

<P>

As we continue to expand our organizations size and services, we

see the wisdom of the founding members.  NAMI is truly a family,

united in the belief that by working together we can make a

difference in the lives of our loved ones.

<P>

To that end we have built the organization on four cornerstones: 

SUPPORT, EDUCATION, ADVOCACY and RESEARCH. All across the

country, the family movement is working to bring hope and

progress to thousands of people with severe mental illnesses.

<P>

<P>

Please understand that I am not opposed to involuntary treatment and do not want to convey that impression.  However, here are the thoughts I want to share on the subject.  D.J. Jaffe has presented a cogent argument for changing the statutes for involuntary commitment; but as a sage has said, "For every complex problem there is a simple solution, and it is usually wrong."  

<P>

Every state has some kind of involuntary commitment statute on its books.  The problem is that the interpretation and application of the laws are idiosyncratic.  Tinkering with these laws may tune them up, but it will not address the major issues. 

<P>

Jaffe offers some specific and detailed suggestions that civil rights lawyers and some consumer groups will vigorously oppose.  At best, Jaffe's recommendation is a short-term fix for a longstanding irritant.  It delays grappling with the major public health problems that communities must face now.

<P>

Historically, involuntary commitment to psychiatric hospitals for persons with severe and persistent mental illnesses has been the last resort to safeguard society from aberrant, frightening behaviors and to protect very ill persons from their own poor judgement.  It has failed to do both in many cases. 

<P>

In addition, hospitals and jails are expensive sites to treat persons with severe mental illnesses.  Many psychiatric hospitals are understaffed and unsafe.  Who will clean them up?  Little wonder many consumers are afraid of them.  Prisons, jails, and detention centers that house many court-committed mentally ill persons are dangerous for even healthy people. 

<P>

The political mood is to build more jails for more people.  It is estimated that 10 percent of occupants are seriously mentally ill.  Health care is sparse and non existent in many criminal justice sites.  Jailers are begging for help with this population.  If involuntary commitment to these expensive places doesn't accomplish the objectives of keeping society safe and the person well, we must look for other alternatives.

<P>

A catalog of research studies has shown that involuntary hospitalization is no guarantee that those hospitalized will return for continued treatment, take prescribed medicine, or change violent behaviors.  Ask any psychiatric practitioner about the most common problem in treating persons with schizophrenia and bi-polar disorder and the overwhelming majority will say it is noncompliance with medication. 

<P>

When persons are asked why they stop taking the maintenance medications that control their symptoms, they will answer that the side effects of drugs made compliance intolerable, or that cost of the drugs were prohibitive, or that they had no transportation to procure the medication.  Others will deny their illness and therefore see no need for medication.

<P>

Upon discharge from an involuntary commitment site, a large number of persons will revert to previous lifestyles and high-risk behaviors.  Granted that--for the duration of confinement to acute care settings--society is protected and the ill person may receive state-of-the-art treatment.  But what happens after discharge? 

<P>

With injectable medication regimes the person soon improves and returns to his community where often a fearful, exhausted family waits to deal with his anger.  For those without willing families, it is often the "same old, same old" routines until the next relapse repeats the cycle.

<P>

In Dr. E. Fuller Torrey's excellent article in Hospital & Community Psychiatry (July 1994), he cites the high incidence of violent acts in a subsection of the population who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia.  This reality has frustrated families and communities who have a legitimate concern for their own safety and freedom from harm. 

<P>

Are persons with schizophrenia and manic depression to be considered mad or bad when they commit violent acts?  Science and mental health advocates answer that madness from a state of physical illness of the brain drives the erratic and irrational behaviors of some persons.  The question is what to do about this illness-related outcome of violence in the small number of untreated persons? 

<P>

Equally important is the basic question of how to protect a person from the results of illness-related lack of insight into a life-threatening, deteriorating illness?  The cruelest blow to parents who have raised a child through childhood and adolescence is to witness the slide into self-neglect and confusion.

<P>

As healthcare costs escalate, hospital stays for mental illnesses are often reduced to four or six days.  Responsible public-sector managed care planners look to community care to provide less costly alternatives.  Research on effectiveness of forms of treatment will be used more often in the future to guide decisions about how and where to treat sick people.

<P>

I propose that we use our energy and resources to push for the following long-term approaches.  All follow public health prevention concepts.

<P>

1. Guaranteed health care for all citizens within each state that is individualized, affordable, and of high quality.

<P>

2. Mandatory, state-of-the-art continuing education for all healthcare providers.  Science-based, it must include consumers and families as well as practitioners on faculty teams.

<P>

3. Certification in mental disorders education as a requirement for all judges, lawyers, and justice personnel who work with mentally ill persons.

<P>

4. Education of all citizens early in their lives about warning signs and symptoms of major mental illnesses.  Public school curriculums of elementary and high school health classes should be required to routinely present this information in discussions and materials.  Early self-identification of people at risk could be presented as intelligent healthcare promotion.

<P>

5. Delivery of ongoing continuing public education to local communities about mental illnesses being treatable, common disorders that affect all kinds of people.  Information about where affordable treatment sites are located and how to access them should be routinely given.  Public libraries could be used in this effort.

<P>

6. Increased private and government funding for research into services to persons with severe mental illness.  Knowledge from such research should be given widespread public and professional dissemination without delay.

<P>

7. Pressure to redesign in each state, by law, the present fragmented mental health delivery systems so that emphasis is on early case finding through outreach to community.  Persuasive case management teams can be the ongoing contacts with persons identified as in need of treatment.

<P>

8. The standard expectation of best practice guidelines for all diagnostic and treatment centers.  Monitoring and incentives for compliance should be instituted by all funding agents.

<P>

9. Insistence that all persons with these mental illnesses be tracked by responsible providers to monitor their healthcare status at systematic intervals for the duration of their lives.  Funding could come through capitation grants or similar prepaid plans to replace fee-for-service mechanisms.

<P>

10. Institution of public health mandates, similar to tuberculosis control measures, to provide continuous treatment in the community for persons with a history of violence related to mental illness.

<P>

11.  Requirement that public healthcare authorities provide state-of-the-art dual-diagnosis treatment to all persons identified as having a severe mental illnesses and a substance abuse disorder.

<P>

12.  Advisement to caregivers of persons with severe and persistent mental illness of their rights for support and education with information about access in their geographical area.

<P>

13. Encouragement of the development of new, "clean" pharmacological agents with fewer side effects to treat schizophrenia and other severe disorders by private and public entities.

<P>

14. Proposal and passage of federal legislation that gives all disabled persons the right to an individual treatment plan of care in their community.  It would be comparable to the legislation that mandates a individual education plan for all children with disabilities.  This would supplement the State Planning Act for Comprehensive Services for Mentally Ill Persons.    

<P>

<hr>
<P>

If mental healthcare consumers had voluntary access to a continuous and comprehensive range of services and treatments, that access could dramatically reduce the need for involuntary treatment and commitment.  And if involuntary treatment laws were invoked only when they are in the consumer's best interest, that would also cut down on usage.  Laws should not be used to increase hospital profits, provide respite for parents, introduce a form of social control, get votes, or "clean up" streets for visiting conventioneers.

<P>

While it is vital to respect the right of consumers to make their own decisions, we must also recognize that in neurobiological disorders (NBD) the diseased organ is the brain, and the judgement of consumers is sometimes so affected by the disease that they are unable to make the decisions they would make if their judgement was unimpaired. 

<P>

 Severe impairment of judgement happens only to a minority of individuals with NBD, but this minority is often the group most in need of treatment--and the actions of this minority often tar the majority of consumers who never become a danger to themselves or others.  In fact, dangerous actions can make communities less likely to welcome community-based facilities that would help everyone.  In light of this, the following are principles I believe must be incorporated into any involuntary treatment law.

<P>

1. An independent review must be guaranteed in all involuntary treatment determinations.

<P>

To protect the rights of consumers, some form of independent administrative review or judicial review by individuals knowledgeable in the medical issues surrounding NBD must take place.  If a decision is made to involuntarily commit or treat, it should be periodically reviewed.

<P>

2. The definition of dangerous must be broadened.

<P>

Dangerous must be interpreted more broadly than "imminently" and/or "provably."  We must be able to help individuals before they are holding a knife to their own or someone else's throat.

Add a "grave disability" standard.  The concept of dangerousness should be interpreted to include the "grave disability" standard. 

<P>

This would allow the treatment, voluntarily or involuntarily, of a person with NBD who is "substantially unable, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for any of the person's basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health or safety causing substantial deterioration of the person's ability to function on the person's own."

<P>

Add a "substantial deterioration" standard.  The "substantial deterioration" standard would potentially include for commitment someone who "as a result of NBD, is likely to cause harm to himself or others or to suffer substantial mental or physical deterioration if he is not given inpatient or outpatient treatment."  Kansas provides a good model for this.

<P>

Creating a better definition of dangerous will not mean there automatically will be facilities to care for all those needing treatment.  But the constricted standard means that even when treatment facilities are available, care cannot be provided.

<P>

3. Government has a parens patriae obligation, in addition to police-power obligation, to provide care.

<P>

When acutely ill, individuals with NBD can be among the most vulnerable members of society.  They may be imprisoned by their psychosis and unable to make the decisions they would otherwise want to make.  As with children and the developmentally disabled, the state has an obligation to exercise its parens patriae powers and step in to assist those "who as a result of their NBD are unable to fully understand the treatment being proposed and its likely courses and outcomes and/or to provide for their own welfare."

<P>

Add a "need for treatment" standard.  The "need for treatment" standard would allow the treatment of someone "who is suffering from a mental disorder as a result of which he is in need of treatment or care and supervision that can be provided only in an inpatient or outpatient facility."

<P>

Add a "lack of capacity" standard.  The "lack of capacity" standard would allow the treatment of someone "who as a result of the mental disorder is unable to fully understand and to make an informed decision regarding his need for treatment or care and supervision."

<P>

4. The questions of commitment and treatment should be decided expeditiously in a single hearing.

<P>

In many states individuals receive one court hearing to decide whether or not they are dangerous and should be involuntarily hospitalized.  In cases where they resist treatment, they undergo a second hearing to decide whether or not they should be involuntarily treated.  Because these hearings often occur weeks apart, individuals may be hospitalized but not allowed treatment.

<P>

Collapsing the determinations of commitment and treatment into a single hearing would prevent consumers from being warehoused unnecessarily and would also allow advanced directives to become operational earlier.  The treatment determination should be flexible enough to allow adjustable client-centered treatment.

<P>

5. Past activity should be considered in determining the future course of illness.

<P>

Medical science has shown that past activity and historical progression of the illness are the best predictors of future activity and progression of the illness.  Many consumers exhibit predictable stages of deterioration. 

<P>

Yet courts often rule this evidence of past progression of the illness as inadmissable.  Consumers, families, providers, doctors, and other interested individuals must be allowed to submit historical information to the current doctors and courts for their consideration.

<P>

6. Allow involuntary outpatient treatment.

<P>

Right now in many states, when the court finds that an individual is "dangerous to self or others" and needs involuntary treatment, it can only order the most expensive and most restrictive form of treatment, inpatient hospitalization.  The hospital administers medicines and releases the individual.  The individual soon becomes "dangerous" again and needs re-hospitalization.

<P>

Involuntary outpatient treatment would make it possible to offer a less restrictive, less expensive, and often more beneficial alternative for individuals with NBD.  It would cut down on the need for inpatient hospitalization.  Individuals with NBD and a history of dangerousness would be allowed to live in the community by court order only if they agreed to take the medicines and/or follow the treatment plans that can control the illness (much like TB patients). 

<P>

Individuals who fail to comply with the outpatient commitment order could be treated immediately, despite their objection--no additional court hearing would be required--or they could be hospitalized involuntarily if they meet the standards.  Individuals with NBD would participate in developing their own client-centered outpatient commitment order.

<P>

The ability of judges or independent administrative bodies to order client-centered outpatient treatment would provide communities with the incentive (and obligation) to develop appropriate treatment facilities.  So we must reject the argument that the lack of facilities makes outpatient treatment unworkable.

<P>

7. The state should not have to meet standards and burdens of proof that were established for criminals.

<P>

In many states an officer cannot transport someone to a hospital and a judge cannot order involuntary treatment unless he or she has "clear and convincing evidence" or "evidence beyond a reasonable doubt" that the person meets the dangerousness standard.  This usually means the officer has to actually observe overtly dangerous behavior. 

<P>

These standards--which may be appropriate in criminal cases--are inappropriate when deciding whether or not an individual needs medical care.  They are simply too difficult to meet.  If an individual needs medical care, an officer should be able to transport him or her if the decision is based on "information and belief" or "probable cause"--if the officer thinks the individual is a danger to him- or herself or others or needs medical help. 

<P>

Likewise, the court should be able to order treatment if it has "a preponderance of evidence" (more evidence for than against) indicating the individual is a danger to him- or herself or others and needs psychiatric care.  Lowering the burden of proof in this way would ensure that more people who need care receive it.

<P>

8. Include mechanism and funding for judicial education.

<P>

Many AMI members report that there is a great deal of deviation when different judges interpret the same law.  In addition, when the law changes many judges proceed as if it did not change.  For these reasons, any bill dealing with involuntary treatment or commitment should include a mechanism to inform the judiciary of the change in law and its implications.

<P>

I believe if state AMIs lead the way in implementing these changes, we will help eliminate violence, reduce stigma, and make more communities welcome facilities.  I also believe we will help those who lack insight into their illness and are wandering helplessly, hopelessly on our streets.  We should not require individuals sick enough to need help to be well enough to recognize it.  NAMI must not forget those who can't help themselves.  We must have compassion.

<P>

<H2>TENNCARE Fixes Problems</H2>
<HR>
Tennessee's state-based health care reform program has been in effect for less than a full year.  It has already been through severe implementation strains in implementing services to persons with severe and persistent mental illness (spmi).
<P>
The Tennessee Alliance for the Mentally Ill (TAMI) has been active throughout this transition, maintaining communication with the legislature, the governor, and his administration to be sure that the needs of persons with spmi are met.  Gradually the various problems in the implementation of this program are being overcome.
<P>
TennCare is at its core a Medicaid program operating under a waiver from the federal Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to the state of Tennessee.  The federal law that defines Medicaid contains provisions that permit "waiving" of exact compliance with all its details so that a state con operate the program more flexibly than the original law specifies.
<P>
The driving motivation for operating the Medicaid program differently is the opportunity to control overall costs, to cover populations Medicaid traditionally does not consider eligible, and to support necessary services outside the bounds of traditional medical insurance programs.  Tennessee targeted all of these objectives in its development of TennCare. 
<P>
Persons who were uninsured or uninsurable have been added to the list of those already served through Medicaid.  Individuals have the opportunity to choose one of several managed care organizations (MCOs).  The list of available providers depends on this choice, so some persons may have to change doctors.  (See managed care article, this issue.)  Providers may lost some of their previous Medicaid patients.  the Tennessee Medical association brought suit to halt TennCare (not precisely on these grounds), but lost in court.
<P>
For the past several years TAMI has worked actively with the Tennessee Department of Mental Health (DMH) and with consumers and providers to implement the goals of PL 99-660.  The federally required planning council took a strong hand in the development of a master plan for services to persons with spmi.  This plan called for an ambitious array of new community services funded by making significant reductions in the number of inpatient institute beds available.
<P>
When plans for TennCare were first announced, services for persons with spmi were not to be included.  Funds were to be "carved out" so that DMH would administer them, and services would continue to be improved as prescribed by the master plan.  HCFA, however, found the state's matching funds to be insufficient, and they required the DMH dollars to be transferred to TennCare before the waiver would be granted. 
<P>
At the same time the state's agreements with the MCOs were modified to require them to contract with DMH to provide services for each person with spmi.  DMH would presumable continue to support those community providers (CMHCs and other agencies) that had been expanding services under the master plan.
<P>
In several conferences with state administration officials, TAMI was assured that the expansion of services to persons with spmi would continue under TennCare.  But faced with a change of administrations after the 1994 elections, TAMI decided to put legislative force behind these assurances.  They introduced legislation that restated the special status of persons with spmi and the community services that they require. 
<P>
The bill ultimately passed both chambers of the legislature without a single dissenting vote.  The resulting statute defines the role of DMH in identifying individuals with spmi, specifying services, setting standards for these services, and evaluating the results based on outcomes for the persons involved.
<P>
TennCare is still in flux.  Most of MCOs have not yet signed the contracts that would require them to pay DMH for services, so the administration has been providing money to DMH from a special fund.  Recently the governor announced a 28 percent increase in the per capita funding to the MCOs that will be tied to their participation in model plans for services to persons with spmi.
<P>
The experience in Tennessee has shown that, even when progress appears to have been made, families cannot relax and assume that it will continue.  In ongoing dialogue with DMH, the legislature and administration, and with the providers, TAMI keeps reminding all concerned of the effectiveness of good services for persons with spmi.

Undercurrents: A Therapist's Reckoning with Her Own Depression
<P>
by Martha Manning
<P>
Review by Jerilynn Brezil Hoy, Froma Lippmann, and Kyle Wheeler for the NAMI Literature Committee.
<P>
	Undercurrents, an autobiographical account of a woman's encounter with major depression, is one of those rare books that manages to be funny, intense, and frightening all at once.  Although her subject matter is serious, the author, Dr. Martha Manning, views the vagaries of life with a wry sense of humor that leavens the frightening story she tells.  When depression descends on Martha, a psychotherapist living near Washington, D.C., she falls down the slippery slope as helplessly as anyone.  Undercurrents describes her journey into despair and the dramatic steps she took to save her own life.
<P>
	This eminently readable book chronicles 20 months of Martha's life through a series of journal entries.  Early on, hints of her impending depression creep into her entries.  She begins to experience sleep disturbances; she loses interest in doing things; overall, as she describes it, she feels as if her "transmission is slipping."  Remarkably, her entries continue, even in her darkest moments.
<P>
	Manning's family is also ravaged by the effects of her illness.  Martha vividly describes the frustration of her husband_-also a psychotherapist_-who can do nothing to "fix" her.  Her daughter, on the cusp of adolescence, observes her mother's descent into depression with bewilderment and anger.  In her journal, Martha describes with great pain the several miscarriages she's had and mourns her inability to have more children. 
<P>
	Martha starts seeing a therapist herself, Dr. Kay Jamison, who has written a book about her own struggles with manic-depression.  She describes a time when she is both therapist and patient, helping others and seeking help.  She also meets regularly with a psychopharmacologist who prescribes antidepressants.  Martha has many problems with the antidepressants, and she and her doctor try to find the right medication and dosage.  All this intervention is not enough, and Martha continues to decline.
<P>
	The depression becomes so debilitating that Martha finally considers electroconvulsive therapy (ECT).  Obsessed with thoughts of dying, she feels she has no choice but to try it.  Even through her hospitalization and six ECT treatments, she continues to write.  Martha's description of her emergence from darkness as the pain of depression slowly recedes is extremely moving.
<P>
	A year after the treatment, Martha still has problems, not only with depression but also with short-term memory loss.  Her writing reveals an understanding that she will never be the person she was before her illness and an acceptance of that fact.
<P>
	Throughout her remarkable journey, Martha writes in a style that is a pleasure to read.  For those of us who seek to understand depression, Martha Manning has done a great service by writing a beautiful, honest, and ultimately hopeful account of her own illness.

An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited by the Publications Committee of IAPSRS.
<P>
Readings in Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited by William Anthony and LeRoy Spaniol. 
<P>
Review by Helen Hill for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	Psychiatric rehabilitation has become such a popular buzz word--or buzz phrase--in the 1990s that its meaning has become diffused.  An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited and published by the International Association of Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services (IAPSRS), clarifies the meaning.
<P>
	The book has seven sections, each with a collection of essays written by both professionals and consumers.  The sections are:  "What Is Psychiatric Rehabilitation?"; "Experiencing Psychiatric Rehabilitation"; "Implementing Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; "Training Psychiatric Rehabilitation Staff"; "Managing Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; "Evaluating Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; and "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Outcomes."  The usefulness for professionals is obvious.  Anyone working today with people recovering from a brain disorder needs to understand the principles underlying psychiatric rehabilitation: the importance of encouraging independence rather than mere compliance and the importance of work-with-support as an essential part of the recovery process.
<P>
	But parents and consumers need to understand these principles, too.  Parents, other family members, and consumers who want to advocate for better mental health services need to be well informed about the possibilities.  Consumers can gain understanding by sharing the experiences of others who have written about themselves.
<P>
	Joan Nobiling's introduction to the chapter "Experiencing Psychiatric Rehabilitation" makes a point that fits the whole book.  "Psychiatric rehabilitation," she says, "is not something that is delivered to an individual, but rather it is accomplished through the individual's active participation in a process that includes choice and decision-making."  Knowing what the options are is essential if we are to help our family members or ourselves lead better lives.  This book goes a long way toward showing how that is possible.
<P>
	Readings in Psychiatric Rehabilitation, edited by William Anthony and LeRoy Spaniol, covers much of the same ground as An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation.  Both books draw heavily from the Journal of Psychiatric Rehabilitation, which is published jointly by the Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation and IAPSRS.  The chief difference is that, though not inaccessible to the general reader, Readings is designed primarily for the social work student or professional who is interested in rehabilitation.  Essays are grouped in eight chapters:  "An Introduction to the Field"; "Introduction to Research"; "Philosophy, Process, and Technology"; "Implementing the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Approach"; " "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Personnel"; "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Programs"; "Psychiatric Rehabilitation Systems"; and a final chapter called "Changing Toward the Future," which includes two essays on managed health care and an essay by Anthony, "The Guiding Vision of the Mental Health Service System in the 1990s."  Each chapter includes its own rather full list of bibliographical references for further readings.
<P>
	This is a book to recommend--particularly to professionals--but IAPSRS's book, An Introduction to Psychiatric Rehabilitation, is of broader interest for the general reader.

An Unquiet Mind:  A Memoir of Moods and Madness
<P>
by Kay Redfield Jamison
<P>
Reviewed by Diane T. Marsh, Barbara Pilvin, and Judith Tydings, for the NAMI Literature Committee.
	<P>
	In An Unquiet Mind, psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison has written an extraordinary account of her experience with manic-depression (the term she prefers to bipolar disorder).  For more than three decades, Dr. Jamison has lived with this "quicksilver" illness, with its mercurial moods, and with its "peculiar kind of pain, elation, loneliness, and terror."  No reader will be untouched by her memoir, which is inarguably one of the most powerful, insightful, and eloquent depictions of life with this illness.
<P>
	Dr. Jamison is professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and coauthor of the standard medical text on manic-depressive illness.  Thus, it is with fascination that we read of her struggle against lithium, the drug that would ultimately save her life.  She writes about her belief that she should handle her illness without "crutches" such as medication and about the severe side effects she experienced.  Dr. Jamison also shares her deep resistance to relinquishing the exhilarating highs of the illness--"the intensity, glory, and absolute assuredness of my mind's flight"--for a life that seemed restrictive, less productive, and "maddeningly less intoxicating."  Ultimately, she made peace with lithium only when it was clear that the alternatives were death or insanity.
<P>
	The book also offers a compelling description of her recovery process.  She acknowledges the value of medication, of psychotherapy, and of the many people in her personal and professional lives who have provided essential--indeed, lifesaving--support.  Readers will also witness her personal resilience in a struggle that took her to the "blackest caves of the mind."  In her words, "One of the advantages of having had manic-depressive illness for more than thirty years is that very little seems insurmountably difficult."
<P>
	The book's arrangement is essentially chronological, beginning with Dr. Jamison's childhood and adolescence.  She describes the emergence of the disorder, its relentless course, and its increasing hold on her life.  She details her severest symptoms of depression and mania, her visual hallucinations, and her deliberate--and nearly fatal--lithium overdose.  From the dual perspectives of patient and professional, she places these experiences in the context of her own life and of the larger professional territory.  There are also some wonderful philosophical and humorous passages.
<P>
	Given Dr. Jamison's multiple roles as a consumer, professional, and family member, as well as her gifts as a writer, this book is likely to appeal to the widest possible audience.  At the same time, readers may respond differently to a number of themes in the book, as did NAMI reviewers.  The three reviewers agreed on the overall value and importance of the book.  They responded differently, however, to Dr. Jamison's discussion of the positive aspects of this disorder, including the relationship between bipolar disorder and creativity, which was explored in Jamison's earlier book, Touched With Fire.  One reviewer, a psychologist, family member, and painter, felt that the emphasis on the creativity and contributions of people with bipolar disorder offers a valuable corrective to the widespread tendency to define people in terms of their illness and to ignore their strengths, talents, and potential for recovery.
<P>
	On the other hand, a second reviewer, who has bipolar disorder herself, remarked on the level of courage required to write such a personal memoir, but reacted negatively to Dr. Jamison's mention of the positive aspects of this disorder--as if she were trying to convince herself (and her readers) that it is truly worth having.  The third reviewer, who has a brother with bipolar disorder, pointed out that Dr. Jamison has been very fortunate in spite of her illness, as the author herself acknowledged when addressing the NAMI convention last summer.  Through her writing and television productions, she focuses on the giftedness of painters, musicians, and others like herself who enrich our lives despite their illness.  This reviewer was concerned that the emphasis on giftedness would deflect attention away from those who are not particularly gifted and, in fact, are ravaged by this illness.
<P>
	 An Unquiet Mind will remain with you long after you have put it down.  Far more than a memoir of moods and madness, the book is also a journey into the heart of our humanity through the lens of this volatile illness.  Dr. Jamison has charted this journey with grace, candor, and humor.  Hers is an important and moving story, told by a distinguished scientist who has a poet's sensibility.

Review of General Psychiatry, 4th Edition
<P>
Edited by Howard H. Goldman, M.D., M.P.H., Ph.D.
<P>
Review by David Seaman for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	Most of the 58 contributing authors of this psychiatric textbook practice and teach psychiatry at leading medical centers around the country; some are in private practice.  The chapter on psychiatric diagnosis, by Dr. Goldman, includes a glossary of psychiatric signs and symptoms that lay readers will find particularly helpful.  The book incorporates the complete diagnostic criteria as listed in the DSM-VI, which makes it especially useful for diagnosis and classification of the various disorders.  While written for medical students, most of the book's content is readily accessible to the informed lay person.  Review of General Psychiatry, 4th Edition would be an excellent reference for AMI affiliates, and it should also be available in public libraries. 
<P>
	Review of General Psychiatry, 4th Edition is published by Appleton and Lange (1995).  It is available at bookstores.  $32.95.

A Pragmatic Approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation:  Lessons from Chicago's Thresholds Program
<P>
Edited by Jerry Dincin, Ph. D.
<P>
Review by Charles P. Cotton, C.C.S.W.; Richard Greer, and Victoria Conn, R.N. for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	A Pragmatic Approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation:  Lessons from Chicago's Thresholds Program provides a readable and comprehensive overview of psychiatric rehabilitation.  Jerry Dincin, who edits this volume, uses his extensive experience as director of Chicago's Thresholds Program to provide practical examples of rehabilitation approaches.  The contributors, also, are all people who have hands-on experience and important roles in this organization.
<P>
	Dincin believes that there are three basic components in psychiatric rehabilitation:  The biological basis of mental illness and the importance of medication, the rehabilitation relationship between staff and consumers, and the rehabilitation program efforts.  The central importance of accepting a biological understanding of mental illness is clearly expressed.  There is an excellent presentation of the staff/consumer relationship as the "glue of rehabilitation."  Clear descriptions of the specific services that make up the comprehensive Thresholds program are included.
<P>
	Readers will also learn about other programs for special populations, which include consumers with coexisting issues such as substance abuse, homelessness, motherhood--any populations such as the deaf and the elderly.  Included in Dincin's book is an interesting presentation of research results supporting the effectiveness of the Thresholds' services and a brief discussion of emerging issues in the filed of psychiatric rehabilitation.
<P>
		A Pragmatic Approach to Psychiatric Rehabilitation:  Lessons from Chicago's Thresholds Program is excellent.  It illustrates not only what psychiatric rehabilitation approaches can provide, but also why they are so important in the lives of those with serious brain disorders.  It is a valuable resource for anyone who deals with mental illnesses--consumer, family member, or professional.  And the subject is timely, given the current uncertainty surrounding the future of community mental health in our country.

Media Madness:  Public Images of Mental Illness
<P>
By Otto F. Wahl, Ph.D.
<P>
Reviewed by William Zaccagnino, Rupert B. Hurley, and Jim Howe for the NAMI Literature Committee
<P>
	Media Madness:  Public Images of Mental Illness is an outstanding book.  While the subject of the treatment in the media of those with brain disorders may at first seem to beg the question of "Isn't this just another case of political correctness?" the rampant inaccuracies about mental illnesses in newspapers, magazines, movies, and books makes it clear that this is not merely stereotyping, but rather a pervasive ignorance.  
<P>
	Dr. Wahl's book goes far to explain where the errors are and to educate and sensitize the reader to the frequent inaccuracies.  In addition, this book is very readable.  It is well researched and it isn't patronizing or accusatory toward those who write the newspaper stories and novels, script the movies, draw the cartoons, or create the advertisements that are built on the inaccuracies that so frequently are the public's body of knowledge about mental illness. It's possible some readers might feel the author is too kind, considering the number of inaccuracies in the media.
<P>
	Dr. Wahl gives his readers many mainstream references in his text and illustrations:  The Far Side, Kudzu, Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, Friday the 13th (and its many iterations), Rozanne, M*A*S*H, and many more that indicate the common belief that mental illnesses are fair game for humor, an excuse for murderous behavior, and an explanation for diminished intelligence.  The danger in all of this, of course, is that the media provides the base of knowledge for children and reinforces the beliefs of others who have long been exposed to such erroneous references.  Of equal or even greater danger is the plethora of inaccuracies present in the print and electronic news media.  Here the reader/viewer expects that the information is not altered as a means of entertainment, but reported objectively.  If the information reconfirms established beliefs, unfortunately the reader/viewer easily assumes that these inaccuracies are facts.
<P>
	Dr. Wahl shows that those with mental illnesses are frequently presented as their illness:  they are schizophrenics, manic depressives, or multiple personalities rather than persons with an illness or disorder.  Wahl points out that similar characterization is not applied to those with cancer, diabetes, and other physical illnesses.  And any psychiatric treatment in a person's past is deemed relevant to any story, regardless of whether or not it is relevant to the point of the story--especially when violence is involved.
<P>
	In addition to the excellent text and illustrations, Dr. Wahl includes extensive notes representing his thorough research.  He has included three appendices listing movies, television shows, and books that have mental illness or psychiatric references, many of which are inaccurate and disparaging.
<P>
	Media Madness is recommended highly.  It can easily serve as one of the references for NAMI's current anti-stigmatism campaign.  And it is "must reading" for every journalism student, active journalist, writer, screenwriter, marketing student, and ad copy writer and artist.  Consumers, family members, and other interested parties would also learn much from reading the book.

<P>

	And Media Madness is also a call to action.  Wahl assures his readers that one voice, one letter, one call can actually make the media change its path.  He maintains that most media people don't intend to offend or mislead their audience and that helpful, correcting information in many cases will be welcomed.

<H2>POLICY ON INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT</H2>

<HR>
POLICY ON INVOLUNTARY COMMITMENT AND COURT ORDERED TREATMENT
<P>
The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) believes that
all people should have the right to make their own decisions about
medical treatment. However, NAMI is aware that there are certain
individuals with biological brain disorders (also known as severe
mental illnesses) such as schizophrenia and manic-depressive illness
who, at times, due to their illness, lack insight or judgement
about their need for medical treatment.  NAMI is also aware that,
in many states, laws and policies governing involuntary commitment
and/or court ordered treatment are inadequate. 
<P>
NAMI, therefore, adopts the following policy:
<P>
1. The availability of effective, comprehensive community-based
systems of care for persons suffering from biological brain disorders
will diminish the need for involuntary commitment and/or court
ordered treatment. 
<P>
2. Methods for facilitating communications about treatment preferences
between individuals with biological brain disorders, family members
and treatment providers should be adopted and promoted in all
states.
<P>
3. Involuntary commitment and court ordered treatment decisions
must be made expeditiously and simultaneously in a single hearing
so that individuals can receive treatment in a timely manner.
 The role of courts should be limited to review to ensure that
procedures used in making these determinations comply with individual
rights and due process requirements, and not to make medical decisions.

<P>
4. Involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and court ordered
treatment should be used as a last resort and only when it is
believed to be in the best interests of the individual in need.
  
<P>
5. States should adopt broader, more flexible standards which
would provide for involuntary commitment and/or court ordered
treatment when an individual: 
<P>
(A). Is gravely disabled, which means that the person is substantially
unable, except for reasons of indigence, to provide for any of
his or her basic needs, such as food, clothing, shelter, health
or safety, or
<P>
(B).Is likely to substantially deteriorate if not provided with
timely treatment, or
<P>
(C).Lacks capacity, which means that as a result of the brain
disorder the person is unable to fully understand or lacks judgment
to make an informed decision regarding his or her need for treatment,
care or supervision.
<P>
6. Current interpretations of laws which require proof of dangerousness
often produce unsatisfactory outcomes because individuals are
allowed to deteriorate needlessly before involuntary commitment
and/or court ordered treatment can be instituted.  When the &quot;dangerousness
standard&quot; is used, it must be interpreted more broadly than
&quot;imminently&quot; and/or &quot;provably&quot; dangerous.
<P>
7.State laws should also allow for consideration of past history
in making determinations about involuntary commitment and/or court
ordered treatment, since past history is often a reliable way
to anticipate the future course of illness.
<P>
8. An independent administrative and/or judicial review must be
guaranteed in all involuntary commitment and/or court ordered
treatment determinations.  Individuals must be afforded access
to appropriate representation knowledgeable about biological brain
disorders and provided opportunities to submit evidence in opposition
to involuntary commitment and/or court ordered treatment.
<P>
9.Responsibility for determining court ordered treatment should
always be vested with medical professionals, who, in conjunction
with the individual, family and other interested parties, must
develop a plan for treatment.    
<P>
10 The legal standard for states to meet in order to justify emergency
commitments for initial 24 to 72 hours should be &quot;information
and belief&quot;.  For involuntary commitments beyond the initial
period, the standard should be &quot;clear and convincing evidence.&quot;
 Involuntary commitments and/or court ordered treatment must be
periodically subject to administrative or judicial review to ascertain
whether circumstances justify the continuation of these orders.
<P>
11. Court ordered outpatient treatment should be considered as
a less restrictive, more beneficial, and less costly treatment
alternative to involuntary inpatient treatment.
<P>
12. Efforts must be undertaken to better educate justice systems
and law enforcement professionals about the relationship between
severe biological brain disorders and the application of involuntary
inpatient and outpatient commitment and court ordered treatment.
<P>
13. Private and public health insurance plans must cover the costs
of involuntary inpatient and outpatient commitment and/or court
ordered treatment.

<H2>NAMI Resolution</H2>

<HR>
The following resolution was passed by the NAMI board of directors on 
February 5, 1996:
<p>
	The NAMI board of directors believes that the mission of the National
 Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) should be, first and foremost, the support
 of research on severe brain disorders such as schizophrenia and affective
 disorders in adults and children. We are deeply concerned that the breadth 
of the NIMH research activities has detracted from this mission.  Therefore,
 we resolve to take the requisite steps to ensure that NIMH will 
significantly increase its leadership and the proportion of its funding for
 research on the above illnesses in fiscal year 1997, including testimony 
before the U.S. Congress concerning NIMH's inadequate focus on research on 
the above illnesses.  We will further direct advocacy for the most 
appropriate federal policies and administrative structures to increase 
research on the above illnesses, including the following: 1) renaming the 
NIMH; 2) changing the NIMH mission statement to reflect a strengthened focus
 on the above illnesses; 3) changing the NIMH advisory council so that the 
majority of the council's members are experts or advocates for the above 
illnesses and so that the council includes family members and individuals 
with these illnesses; 4) adding the requirement that 85 percent of the NIMH 
budget be devoted to the above illnesses; and 5) supporting congressional 
suggestions that all NIMH research grant applicants be required to indicate 
how their proposed research is relevant to the above illnesses.

<H2>The Journey Of Hope:  View From The Field</H2>
by Joyce Burland, Ph.D., and Donna Mayeux, National Program Directors
<HR>
Last July NAMI became the sponsor of The Journey of Hope Family Education 
and Support Group Program (JOH), a family-to-family project that has swept
across NAMI grass roots in the past three years.  Developed independently by
AMI-Vermont and Louisiana AMI and joined in 1993 to form a national program,
the 12-week course and structured support group sessions are conducted
exclusively by trained AMI family-member teachers and facilitators working
in co-leader pairs.  Some 31 states and municipal AMI organizations now 
offer ongoing classes and support groups for family members in their
communities.  Five more states are already scheduled to start the JOH in
1996.  Across the country, family members new and old are flocking to this
program by the thousands, testimony that the JOH experience has helped them
immeasurably in dispelling the trauma and despair of coping with loved ones
who are suffering from serious brain (or mental) disorders.
<p>
It would miss the mark entirely to interpret the success of the JOH as 
any kind of commentary on established professional programs in the field.  
Given the millions of families seeking guidance, there can never be enough 
education and support in the world to go around.  Every program serving to 
educate and support families is a precious resource.  Rather, the JOH must 
be understood as a natural corollary to existing programs.  The JOH 
represents a new dimension in family education and support--a legitimate 
venture in self-help that reflects the maturing of the family movement 
itself.  
<p>
Think about it:  Can anyone imagine, 15 years into our mission, that we 
would fail to recognize that a nationwide program of family education and 
support was absolutely essential?  That we would not acknowledge the wisdom 
and strength AMI members gain through long years of struggle?  That we would
fail to capitalize on their potential to help others in this way?  Or miss
the opportunity to entitle our members to direct such a program?  Not on 
your life.  The JOH "phenomenon" speaks to the natural evolution of the 
family movement, to our members staking claim as full-fledged educators and
facilitators and collectively meeting this enormous community need as a 
progressive step in family leadership.
<p>
The national JOH project is conceived as an ongoing community-service 
program that can be offered by AMI affiliates.  The course is free, the 
"staff" of volunteer family-member teachers and facilitators agree to serve 
for two years as a condition of their training, and new family members 
taking the course are urged to join the local affiliate and support the 
NAMI mission.  The support group is open to all families in the community 
who want to come, regardless of membership, and it is accepted that family 
members will go in and out of the group according to their own personal 
needs.  Affiliates in the JOH report that their membership is expanding 
rapidly, that younger people are coming on their boards and work committees,
and that mental health departments are readily providing service contracts 
to run these community-based classes and support groups.  Fully two-thirds 
of the state AMI organizations now in the JOH are receiving direct state 
funding to sustain and expand the program.
<p>
The JOH support-group model follows a distinctive format that helps 
facilitators guide the group discussions in ways that are constructive and 
hopeful for the families who attend.  Through practical problem-solving and 
group focus on specific principles of self-care, family members are 
encouraged to develop proactive skills and attitudes for assisting their 
ill relative while giving attention to their own needs as well.  
Seasoned AMI support-group facilitators tell us that using this structured 
approach enables them to keep the discussion process from falling into the 
kind of gripe sessions known to discourage newcomers to the group.
<p>
Although the JOH family-education curriculum includes comprehensive 
psychoeducational and clinical information, an equal emphasis is placed 
on the emotional issues families and consumers face as they struggle to 
regain their balance and come to terms with this intensity of life 
misfortune.  The course addresses the critical needs families have in each 
stage of coping and assists families in self-care by interpreting their 
feelings of frustration, grief, disillusionment, and guilt as normal 
responses to a catastrophic illness process.  Family members who "take the 
Journey," often relate that this experience has radically reframed the way 
they regard their ill family member and has positively affected their 
relationships.  
<p>
The Journey of Hope is a crucial mission whose ideal can now be fully 
realized.  Let's give others what we needed when we started down this 
long road.  Let's bring them into our movement with our special brand of 
knowledge, compassion, and hope.  It is an idea whose time has come.  
That's why the program has met with such enthusiasm in the grass roots; 
that's why a consumer-directed education and support program based on JOH, 
developed by Tennessee AMI, will soon follow; that's why families and 
consumers are jointly teaching a JOH-based course for professional 
providers in public agencies piloted by AMI-Vermont and why AMI-Illinois 
has won a grant to translate the program into Spanish.  These developments 
signify the advent of family/consumer empowerment.  At last, the 
not-so-meek-anymore are inheriting their rightful place in the lexicon 
of providing vital, effective service.
<p>
At the NAMI Convention in Nashville this July, we will offer the first 
full-day Journey of Hope Institute.  Join us there to celebrate the superb 
job 1,500 AMI members are doing to expand the world of education and support
for families coming into our movement.

<H2>NAMI And Young Families</H2>
<HR>

"It is imperative that we do more outreach to young families facing the 
difficulties of raising a child with a neurobiological disorder," Laurie 
Flynn stated last winter in The Journal, a quarterly publication of the 
California Alliance for the Mentally Ill.  From its inception, NAMI has 
worked to provide support, education, and advocacy for individuals of all 
ages with serious and persistent mental illnesses.  
<p>
Yet, today, in our 16th year, families of children under the age of eighteen
constitute a relatively small percentage of our organization's membership. 
This is troubling for two reasons.  The first is what NAMI has to offer 
young families.  When looking back to the age of onset of their ill family 
member's symptoms, at least half of NAMI families admit that their child or 
sibling was under eighteen.  Their experiences can help young families as 
they face the challenges of finding services and making the transition from 
childhood's school-based systems to the adult-services sector.  The second 
reason is that NAMI needs young families to continue its work of advocacy 
and support into the future.  An aging NAMI membership must give serious 
consideration to the long-term prospects of NAMI's existence and its 
continued ability to advocate on behalf of the persistent and severely 
mentally ill.
<p>
To continue renewing NAMI's fellowship, the referral of young families and 
efforts to meet their unique needs must be a priority.  Unlike older 
families who in many instances are retired and looking primarily for 
support-group services, young families are in need of a greater array of 
assistance from those already experienced in obtaining services for their 
family member.
<p>
In particular, young families require assistance in linking up with 
experienced healthcare professionals who will provide a diagnosis and 
treatment for their youngster with a neurobiological disorder.  These 
families also need detailed information about how to deal with the local 
school systems that significantly impact the education and related services 
available to their child.  They may also require referrals to local 
family-service agencies.
<p>
Serving families of children and adolescents with neurobiological disorders 
is a challenge for many NAMI affiliates, especially at the local level.  
Active members may feel unable to provide the level of support and 
information young families need.  Addressing this issue, NAMI's board of 
directors decided that the national headquarters should include one staff 
member devoted exclusively to young family outreach.  Mrs. Brenda Souto was 
appointed in mid-November as the young family outreach coordinator.  Mrs. 
Souto, a professional outreach specialist, has been active in the child and 
adolescent network of AMI of Montgomery County, Maryland. 
<p>
During the next months the new family outreach coordinator will provide 
affiliates with information they can use in answering inquiries from young 
families with a child or adolescent identified with a neurobiological 
disorder.  She is developing a NAMI brochure welcoming young families and 
a NAMI Rolodex card.  (A fact sheet for young families is already in 
distribution through the NAMI Helpline.)  One of Mrs. Souto's early efforts 
will provide affiliates techniques to increase referrals from healthcare 
professionals who see young families.  She also plans to elaborate on a 
start-up manual for children and adolescent groups that will build on the 
NAMI-CAN Start Up Kit Carol Howe developed a few years ago.  The manual will
provide AMI affiliates with resources to assist young family members and to 
grow the young family groups within affiliates.  This resource is expected 
to be available at the July 1996 NAMI convention in Nashville.

<H2>HOMELESS AND MISSING SERVICE</H2>

<hr>
People who are mentally ill cannot always communicate their thoughts
clearly or understand what others are saying to them.  In confusion,
some will retreat.  Others have grandiose ideas and cannot make
sound judgments.  Sometimes they leave home or other secure surroundings,
and they become homeless or missing.  They can be gone for days,
weeks, months, or years.  Often they leave behind distraught families
who are desperate to return their loved ones home or to a safe
place.
<P>
What is the Homeless and Missing Service for Persons with Mental
Illness?
<P>
The Homeless and Missing Service for Persons with Mental Illness
is a program of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI),
a national, grassroots, self-help advocacy organization for families
and friends of those suffering from severe mental illnesses and
those persons themselves.  The purpose of the service is to try
to locate persons with mental illnesses who are reported missing
by families, loved ones, or friends.  It was created to provide
assistance and support to families and people who are mentally
ill and missing or homeless and to reunite them when possible.
<P>
How do I report a missing person with mental illness?
<P>
The Homeless and Missing Service operates an emergency hotline
to assist all families and friends who have a missing relative
or friend.  The number is 912-328-3555 (fax number is the same),
and it is monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
<P>
When you contact the Homeless and Missing Service, you will be
asked to complete and have notarized an application and send it
with a clear photograph of the missing person to the national
chairman or to a state coordinator.  The national office keeps
a complete file of all missing persons' cases, and all files are
confidential.
<P>
What does the service do once it receives my application and photo?
<P>
When the service receives a request for assistance, it verifies
the name, address, and telephone number of the person making the
request and verifies the name, sex, and general description of
the missing person.  It then determines where the person disappeared
from and for how long he or she has been missing.  Both the national
and state offices work with this information.
<P>
You will be asked to send copies of guardianship papers, court
orders, or doctors' letters (if you have them) attesting to the
mental and physical condition of your missing loved one.  The
service will ask for your permission to obtain information about
your loved one, prepare and distribute missing person flyers,
and provide information for radio and television broadcast.  The
national or state office will keep you informed about its progress.
<P>
The service does not just work for the families and friends of
the missing person.  In most cases, it is also working directly
with and for a missing person with a mental illness.  The service
is concerned with the missing person's interests and welfare,
including his or her individual rights.  Most missing or homeless
persons who are mentally ill are unable to help themselves and
need the service's assistance.
<P>
What is it the service cannot do?
<P>
The service works to help you locate a missing person with mental
illness; however, it does not have the responsibility of returning
that person home or referring him or her to a hospital for observation
or treatment.  When your loved one is located--and when he or
she does not object--the service will immediately notify you of
his or her location and general physical and mental condition.
 If the person is 21 years old or older and objects to your being
informed of his or her location, the service cannot tell you where
he or she is--but it will tell you about the person's general
condition.  If, however, your loved one is a danger to him- or
herself or to others, the service will
<P>
--notify you immediately of the person's location and condition;
<P>
--notify the local law enforcement office, police, or sheriff
in the county where the person is; and
<P>
--notify the mental health state agency in the county where the
person is.
<P>
The service does not have the authority to commit a person to
a medical facility or decide any legal transaction, but it will
give you advice and assistance when possible.
<P>
Is there a charge for the services of the Missing and Homeless
Service?
<P>
This NAMI program does not charge anything for its services because
those working the cases are families and friends of individuals
who are mentally ill and homeless and missing.  The service does
not solicit donations, but it accepts them to help with expenses.
 All donations are tax-deductible.
<P>
How can I find out more about NAMI?
<P>
To find out more about NAMI--what it offers and how to join--call
the NAMI Helpline at 1-800/950-NAMI.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Depression To Rise Worldwide, Says WHO</H2>
</font>


	The World Health Organization (WHO) took part in a 
comprehensive survey of the health of the world's population and 
reported that depression will rise from the world' fourth most 
serious health threat in 1990 to the second most serious health 
threat in the year 2020.  The top three diseases that shorten life 
or cuase disabilities are still infectious, but fourth is now 
clinical depression, which will increase as the world's population 
over age 45 increases in the coming years.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>"Living with Schizophrenia" Consumer Education Program</H2>
<H4>by Maggie Scheie-Lurie, NAMI Consumer Outreach Coordinator
</H4></font>
<hr>

	An exciting new NAMI consumer-education program--premiered at 
NAMI's annual convention in Nashville last July--is now available 
for presentation in multiple settings.   Divided into two sections, 
the "Living with Schizophrenia" program offers consumers a message 
of hope, scientific information about brain biology and treatment, 
and suggested coping strategies that support recovery.  Although it 
specifically addresses schizophrenia, the program is suitable for 
people who have other diagnoses, for people with any serious brain 
disorder.
<P>
	The program materials, available from NAMI, were designed in a 
flexible, two-session format--a video and a slide presentation--
that can be presented in a variety of settings, such as at local 
and state AMI meetings, support groups, hospitals, and community 
mental health centers.
<P>
		The opening video features four role-model consumers sharing 
their personal experiences in six segments:  Dark Days, Acceptance, 
Medications, Coping, Success, and Hopes and Dreams.  Time should be 
allocated so that discussion can follow the video presentation. 
<P>
		The second session is based on a set of slides that cover 
current understanding of schizophrenia as a brain disorder, the 
importance of treatment, and aspects of recovery discussed in the 
video.  Take-home material reinforces the messages of both the 
video and slides, but discussion time should be scheduled after the 
slides in this session, too.  A brief presentation on N/AMI 
membership immediately following the program offers audience 
members an opportunity to join the organization. 
<P>
	An essential feature of "Living with Schizophrenia" is that it 
is to be presented by consumers.  This is because: 1) consumer 
presenters serve as role models for other consumers; 2) people 
recovering from brain disorders are often more comfortable with and 
receptive to others who have a similar disorder; and 3) public 
speaking gives consumers an opportunity to develop new skills and 
build confidence.
<P>
		The "Living with Schizophrenia" program serves multiple 
functions:  it educates consumers about living successfully with 
brain disorders, it promotes consumer and professional membership, 
it supports awareness of AMI in the community, and it provides a 
vehicle for consumers wanting to do outreach and public speaking.
<P>
		A limited number of kits is available.  State AMIs have been 
asked to sponsor the program in their states and to coordinate 
presentations.  AMI members interested in bringing this program to 
their local area should contact their state AMI office to make 
arrangements.
<P>

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">AMI CARE, A Place For Consumers</font>
<P>
		Affiliates seeking to offer support to people with brain 
disorders should consider starting an AMI-CARE group.  Created by 
AMI of McHenry County in Illinois more than two years ago, AMI 
CARE--CARE stands for Consumers Advocating Recovery through 
Empowerment--provides a simple format for AMI-sponsored consumer 
peer-support groups.   These groups welcome people with all 
diagnoses and address issues common to most consumers regardless of 
diagnosis:  social isolation, lack of self-esteem, and the effects 
of stigma.  
<P>
		Depression, bipolar disorder (manic depression), 
schizophrenia, and anxiety disorders are only some of the diagnoses 
of individuals who have found a supportive place within AMI CARE.  
AMI CARE meetings provide the same type of warmth that the caring 
and sharing meetings have given to so many family members over the 
years.  They provide a safe place for individuals to talk about the 
say-to-day challenges of living with a brain disorder.
<P>
		The mission of AMI CARE is:  "We are a fellowship of 
individuals who share a common goal of recovery and the ability to 
maintain mental and emotional stability.  We help ourselves and 
others through sharing out experiences, strength, and hope with 
each other.  No matter how traumatic our past or how despairing our 
present may be, there is hope for a new day with AMI CARE.
<P>
 	Members of AMI CARE groups learn about treatment methods from 
each other and find much-needed support so they are better able to 
cope.  As they grow within the group, many members become involved 
in educationa and advocacy through their local and state AMIs and 
stand with others to end stigma and discrimination.
<P>
		AMI CARE  start-up kits, available from NAMI, include:  a 
facilitator leader's guide, a manual on First Steps in Starting a 
Support Group for Primary Consumers within a Local AMI Affiliate, 
and a sample brochure to use in promoting the group.  To obtain the 
kit, please fill out and return the form below.
	<P>	
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Seeking Input From Existing AMI CARE Groups</font>
<P>
		Local affiliates and state organizations already using AMI 
CARE material are asked to notify  NAMI's consumer outreach 
coordinator, Maggie Scheie-Lurie (see form).  An expanded, updated 
start-up kit is in development, and we want suggestions from 
current groups regarding possible revisions.  Additionally, we want 
to determine the number of existing AMI CARE groups and identify 
group leaders.

<H2>DR. TORREY ON NAMI'S FUTURE</H2>

<hr>
Future efforts of NAMI should focus on working toward solutions
to three major problems that have created the current mental illness
mess:  ideological, economic, and legal.
<P>
The ideological problem arose from the fact that serious mental
illnesses--which are now known to be diseases of the brain in
exactly the same way as multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,
and Alzheimer's disease are diseases of the brain--were subsumed
early in this century under the spectrum of mental health.  The
mental health spectrum includes a vast array of personal problems
and social issues with serious mental illnesses being merely one
end of the spectrum.  Mental health includes the problems of Woody
Allen, in psychotherapy for 33 years, and also the problems of
individuals who believe they have been abducted by space aliens
and are being treated by Harvard psychiatrist John Mack.
<P>
Mental illnesses have suffered significantly from being linked
to mental health.  Because of its interest in social reform, mental
health is strongly associated with liberal political causes and
carries with it heavy political baggage.  Seen most clearly during
the Nixon and Reagan administrations, such politicalization has
inevitably spilled over to mental illnesses.  In fact, there should
be no more political connotations to schizophrenia, severe depression,
or obsessive-compulsive disorder than there are to Parkinson's
disease.  These brain diseases affect individuals irrespective
of political beliefs.
<P>
Mental illnesses have also suffered from being linked to mental
health because treatment and research resources that were originally
allocated for mental illnesses have been usurped by mental health.
 This reallocation is why the Community Mental Health Center (CMHC)
program, originally conceived as an alternative treatment system
for individuals in state mental hospitals, has been such a failure.

<P>
Only about 25 of the 789 federally funded CMHCs have focused their
resources on individuals with serious mental illnesses.  Usurped
resources is also why the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), which was originally funded to find the causes of serious
mental illnesses, has spent so much of its research resources
on social problems.
<P>
One part of the solution to the ideological problem is for NAMI
to withdraw from the mental health community and instead join
the mental illness community.  NAMI's natural allies are groups
associated with brain diseases, such as the Parkinson's Disease
Foundation, not with groups associated with personal or social
problems. 
<P>
Another part of the solution is for NAMI to take the lead in combining
the research resources of the National Institute of Mental Health
and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke
into a new National Institute of Brain Research.  Research on
serious mental illnesses would progress much faster in such a
milieu.
<P>
The final part of the solution to the ideological problem is for
NAMI to support reimbursement parity for all brain diseases, but
not for all mental disorders.  Professional and treatment resources
that treat serious mental illnesses--including rehabilitation
service--should be reimbursed under private or government medical
insurance in exactly the same way it is for other brain diseases.

<P>
Reimbursement parity for all mental disorders, as recommended
by President Clinton's Mental Health Work Group, includes individuals
who have been abducted by space aliens (they qualify under the
diagnosis of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder, DSM-IV 309.81) and
is a bottomless pit.
<P>
The economic problem is not, as many people assume, that too little
money is available.  That is a problem in some states, but a bigger
problem in all states is cost-shifting.  Cost-shifting arose from
the increasingly large role that the federal government has played
in funding mental health services.  In 1963 state dollars constituted
approximately 96 percent of all dollars for support and services
for individuals with mental disorders. 
<P>
Then Medicaid, Medicare, SSI, SSDI, food stamps, HUD housing,
and other federal programs were implemented.  In 1993, state dollars
had decreased to approximately 40 percent of the total while federal
dollars had increased to at least 50 percent.  A huge federal
carrot had been created, and it encouraged states to shift their
costs to the federal government.
<P>
The consequences of cost-shifting have been inappropriate discharges
of patients from state mental hospitals with homelessness and
jailing for many; the forcing of readmissions of seriously mentally
ill patients to psychiatric wards in general hospitals, many of
which are neither adequately staffed for nor interested in this
patient population; the transinstitutionalization of thousands
of mentally ill individuals from state hospitals to nursing homes.
 
<P>
Many of which offer less care and are more restrictive than the
hospitals; disjointed and uncoordinated aftercare with revolving-door
readmissions because of reimbursement rules; the inappropriate
placement of thousands of emotionally disturbed children onto
SSI; and demands by states that parents relinquish custody of
their mentally ill children so that states can be federally reimbursed
for residential care.  In short, the federal fiscal carrot, not
patients' needs, is driving the system.
<P>
The solution to the economic problem is some type of single-source
funding.  This can be partially accomplished through Medicaid
waivers, but it ultimately will require federal block grants or
a Canadian-style health system.  Managed care is likely to make
things worse because it merely puts a lid on costs without addressing
the underlying economic problems.
<P>
Finally, the legal problem arose because we have trained too many
lawyers, but given them too little education.  Those who have
specialized in mental health law have made it difficult to get
seriously mentally ill individuals involuntarily hospitalized
and easy for these individuals to refuse medication. 
<P>
The lawyers have ignored evidence of brain diseases and the fact
that approximately half of seriously mentally ill individuals
have impaired insight or understanding of their need for treatment.
 Legal initiatives have also changed confidentiality statutes
so that families, who are the main care providers, often are not
given needed information about treatment.  In short, the legal
profession has successfully established and defended the right
of mentally ill individuals to remain ill.
<P>
Solutions to the legal problem involve educating state legislators,
judges, and lawyers about mental illness.  NAMI should take the
lead in establishing a right to get well and should encourage
state AMIs to challenge outmoded laws in the courts.   AMIs at
all levels should use the media to publicly confront mental health
lawyers with the frequently tragic consequences of their legal
actions.  Indeed, if it were known how many homeless mentally
ill individuals or premature deaths have been directly attributable
to the actions of civil liberties lawyers, they would be forced
to close their doors.
<P>
In summary, a better way for NAMI's future is aggressive advocacy
on ideological, economic, and legal issues that contribute to
the current mental illness mess.  Hope and patience alone are
not going to change the system.  We have been quiet for much too
long.
<P>
by E. Fuller Torrey, M.D.
<P>
NOTE:  Dr. Torrey is a research psychiatrist and author of Surviving
Schizophrenia, among other books.  His newest book, The Mental
Illness Mess, will be published in 1996. 
<P>
NOTE:  In fact, there should be no more political connotations
to schizophrenia, severe depression, or obsessive-compulsive disorder
than there are to Parkinson's disease.  The lawyers have ignored
evidence of brain diseases and the fact that approximately half
of seriously mentally ill individuals have impaired insight or
understanding of their need for treatment.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Effects Of Dietary Intake On Psychiatric Medications</font>
<P>
	Because neurotransmitters are synthesized primarily from 
dietary amino acids and neuronal electrical charges are governed 
primarily by minerals, our basic diet can have profound effect on 
the ability of a medication to have a therapeutic effect on mood, 
thinking, and behavior.  Conversely, medications can have an 
equally profound effect on the way our body uses food.  It is 
critical that anyone taking any psychiatric medications have a 
balanced diet using the new food pyramid as a guide.  It is 
impossible to document all the possible drug and food interactions 
in this article, but I have listed a few of the common ones.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Salt</font>
<P>
	Salt is needed for all nervous system functions.  Lithium is a 
naturally occurring mineral with an electrical charge similar to 
salt.  Therefore, the level of salt in the body automatically 
affects the action of lithium.  Once the lithium level reaches 
therapeutic range, it can be altered by subtle changes in daily 
salt intake.  For instance, a person who normally doesn't eat much 
salt can have a decreased lithium level by eating salty foods such 
as pizza, tomato juice, or canned soups.  People eating too much 
salt may be accused of not taking their lithium when actually they 
have been very compliant.  Conversely, losing sodium by sweating, 
diarrhea, or vomiting can cause the body to retain lithium.  
Lithium toxicity can occur in this way.  Please consult a dietician 
if you are interested in more information about salt.  Do not go on 
a salt-restricted diet or add salt supplements without consulting 
the person who prescribes medication for you.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Sugar</font>
<P>
	Sugar is needed by every cell in the body, particularly those 
in the brain.  The brain has an absolute requirement of 100-150 
grams (1000-1500mg) of glucose per day with the resting state 
consuming 20-30 percent.  It is best to keep glucose levels 
constant, not fluctuating.  One 12-ounce can of a cola-type soda 
has 40 grams of carbohydrate in the form of sucrose, or table 
sugar.  A two-liter bottle has 64 ounces--more than 200 grams of 
sugar!  Obviously this amount can give the brain quite a jolt.  
Excessive sugar also stresses the pancreas by causing it to produce 
extra insulin to handle the extra sugar.  The result is fluctuating 
blood-sugar levels that will obviously affect the brain.
<P>
	Sugar also affects mood.  Sugar in the form of simple 
carbohydrates (table sugar) stimulates insulin release that 
increases tryptophan-to-serotonin (a mood chemical) conversion on a 
short-term basis.  Complex carbohydrates such as bagels, pretzels, 
and oatmeal facilitate a long-term conversion causing a sort of 
time-released serotonin.  Many people who have a serotonin 
imbalance actually increase the imbalance by erratic eating 
patterns.
    <P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Chocolate</font>
<P>
	Chocolate is a sugar/fat combination.  Fats stimulate the 
release of endorphins (natural pain killers) and sugar stimulates 
serotonin.  Chocolate also contains phenylethylamine (the chemical 
reported to be released when a person falls in love), theobromine 
(a mild stimulant), and caffeine. 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Caffeine</font>
<P>
	Pharmacologically speaking, caffeine is singularly the most 
devastating legally available stimulant anyone can ingest.  More 
than 225mg (the amount in two cups of brewed coffee or four cans of 
soda) is considered excessive.  Some of the known actions of 
caffeine include: ( "<B>+</B>" = increase and  "<B>-</B>" = decrease) 
<ul>
<li>	<B>+</B> free fatty acid mobilization (raises level of blood lipids) 
that ultimately <B>+</B> blood-sugar levels.
<li>	<B>-</B> lithium levels, even when you take it faithfully, by <B>+</B>
urinary excretion due to diuretic effects.  
<LI>	<B>-</B> effectiveness of antianxiety medications by competing with 
the same receptor sites.
<LI>	<B>-</B> gastric absorption of antipsychotic medications, especially 
haloperidol and fluphenazine.
<LI>	Leads to irregular heartbeats and <B>+</B> blood pressure with 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors.
<LI>	Does not improve thinking if you are intoxicated, only combats 
the depressant effect.
<LI>	If you are already taking a stimulant such as cocaine, 
caffeine can lead to death.
<LI>	If you have a panic disorder, caffeine can precipitate 
attacks.
<LI>	May alter the desired mood effects of traditional tricyclic 
antidepressants
<LI>	<B>+</B> the risk of anxiety and restlessness if taking SSRIs
<LI>	High caffeine users in general require higher doses of 
antipsychotic drugs.
</ul>
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Nicotine And Smoking</font>
<P>
	Nicotine has been under particularly close scrutiny lately.  
It has long been known to be extremely addictive, but only recently 
has research begun to uncover what it can do to prescription 
medications.  Many people taking psychiatric drugs are addicted to 
nicotine.  Nicotine is known to increase the release of dopamine in 
the brain.  This is thought to be one of the reasons why many 
consumers with schizophrenia end up needing such high doses of 
medications--the nicotine may actually counteract drugs like 
risperidone, haloperidol, and others.  Because nicotine is also a 
stimulant, it may also reduce the drowsiness caused by neuroleptics 
and antianxiety agents.
<P>
	Smoking sets up another problem.  When people smoke they 
ingest compounds called arial carbons.  These carbons induce 
powerful liver enzyme systems into action.  Liver enzymes are 
chemicals responsible for the breakdown of drugs and toxins so the 
body doesn't become toxic.  These enzymes also metabolize many 
psychiatric drugs.  Smoking in general can create interactions with 
other drugs by affecting their metabolism.  The simple act of 
smoking can raise the dose required to create a therapeutic 
responses from antipsychotic medications.  Often the required dose 
is so high it creates unpleasant side effects.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Conclusion</font>
<P>
	My intention for writing this article is to create an 
awareness of a few of the many reasons why people taking 
psychiatric drugs may not be getting the full benefit of these 
miraculous compounds.  Generally speaking, a small amount of 
medication can cause the brain to undergo profound changes.  In 
many circumstances more drug can actually equal less therapeutic 
response.  Most people taking psychiatric drugs do not require the 
high doses that can cause disabling sedation and movement 
disorders, but because of poor health the body cannot respond 
properly to the prescribed drug.  I cannot emphasize strongly 
enough how critical it is for everyone taking a psychiatric 
medication to begin the process of detoxifying the body of 
addictive substances and restore healthy organ system functioning 
with proper nutrition so the body can function in harmony with 
medications.  When the body is healthy and rested, the mind will 
function much more efficiently.  To borrow a famous quote, "The 
mind is a terrible thing to waste."

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>AMI Settles Fair-Housing Suit</H2>
<H4>by David Rose, AMI of DuPage County, Illinois</H4>
</font>
<hr>
	As reported in the May/June 1996 Advocate, AMI of DuPage County, 
Illinois, won a fair-housing suit against the city of Naperville, 
Illinois, in the U.S. District Court.  The city's initial response 
to the court's order to reach a settlement was to file an appeal in 
the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.  But after several months of 
intensive negotiations, a settlement was reached in which the 
Naperville city council agreed:
<P><ul>
	<LI> to withdraw its appeal;
	<LI> to apply to our group home the city's 1990 zoning code, under 
which such facilities are deemed "permitted uses" in all 
residential zoning districts;
	<LI> to pay AMI of DuPage $90,000 in penalties and damages;
	<LI> to appoint by name and Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) 
and fair-housing enforcement officer who will be responsible for 
training and educating staff and community organizations and 
investigating alleged violations of the ADA and the Fair Housing 
Act within the city; and, finally,
	<LI> to send a formal letter of welcome, in the name of the city of 
Naperville, to the residents of the group home.
</ul>
<P>
	In a joint news release, both parties expressed their satisfaction 
with reaching an amicable resolution of a two-year-long dispute.  
As is typical in such settlements, the city did not admit that its 
actions had violated any law.  Nevertheless, the Naperville city 
manager stated, "As far as we are concerned, the matter has been 
resolved, and we are pleased that a mutually acceptable solution 
has been achieved."  As advocates, we are especially gratified to 
have the legitimacy of our group home acknowledged.
<P>
	Although our suit in Federal District Court was focused narrowly 
on the heightened life-safety code the defendants were attempting 
to impose on our group home, our suit has much broader 
implications.  Our civil rights attorney, Jeffrey L Taren, stated, 
"This controversy never should have happened, and we are pleased 
that the city sat down with AMI to resolve it.  The settlement is 
an important step toward removing barriers to fair housing 
everywhere.
<P>
	The money received by AMI, after payment of legal fees, will be 
dedicated to promoting services for and to improving the lives of 
people with brain disorders throughout DuPage County.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Who Should Be a NAMI Member?</H2>
<H4>by Annie Saylor, NAMI President
</H4></font>
<hr>
	First we might ask, why make NAMI membership a priority?  
Consider the population of the U.S.--248.7  million according to 
the 1990 census.  Assume a prevalence rate of 1 percent for the 
brain disorders known as serious mental illness.  (A very low 
estimate.)  That means there are nearly 2.5 million people who have 
these disorders.  Each of those people has at least 2.5 close 
family members who have also been affected by brain disorders.  
That gives us a total of 8.75 million people who should be NAMI 
members.  And we are content with a membership of 140,000?
<P>
	Consider the clout of AARP with its 33 million members.  The 
recent parity effort shows us that NAMI packs its own punch, but 
we're the "little engine that could," working our hearts out to end 
the discrimination.  What could we accomplish with one million 
members?  How can we get there?
<P>
	Let me make it clear that I do not advocate that we give up 
our governance by family (and that means all family members, 
including the consumer) at the local, state, and national levels.  
We must maintain the decision-making authority, but we need to find 
ways to grow the organization. 
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to broaden our concept of membership.</font>  I came to NAMI 
via the traditional route:  found a local NAMI affiliate for 
support and information, joined that local group, which in turn 
sent a portion of my dues to the state and then to NAMI.  And that 
is how I continue to be a NAMI member.  However, more people in the 
90s generation want good information quickly and have less time and 
need for that "traditional" membership, for making the same 
commitment of time and energy as we do.  We need those people for 
membership.  We need to show that we value them as members even if 
they are unable to be active members.  We must be like a fast-food 
service.  We must welcome those who want to use the drive-through 
just as much as those who want to come in, sit down, and dine. 
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to gladly receive professionals as members.</font>  Not only 
are professionals more likely to have a multiplier effect on our 
membership, professionals also have a higher incidence of brain 
disorders within their own families.  Those "pro-sumers" themselves 
have nowhere to go in many cases because of the stigma that still 
exists within their own ranks.  This category includes 
psychiatrists, psychologists, therapists, care managers, social 
workers, nurses, school counselors and teachers, and pastoral 
counselors.
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to market our membership.</font>  This month NAMI kicks off 
our second annual membership contest.  (See article in NAMI News 
section.)  Every affiliate is eligible to participate in this 
contest; therefore, every affiliate has the opportunity to win a 
cash award.  The contest also offers a wonderful opportunity for 
you to recruit new affiliate members.  The more new members you 
recruit, the greater the chances your affiliate will win a cash 
award--money that you can use for local programs.  It may seem 
obvious, but think of it:  If every NAMI member recruits just one 
new member, we will double our membership.  
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We need to make it easier to become a member.</font>  Have you ever 
considered the steps it takes to become a member?  First one must 
learn about a local group and then get the courage to seek them out 
and to go to a meeting.  Then, depending upon the effectiveness of 
the local affiliate's membership outreach, one may or may not be 
asked to join.  Finally, should one choose to become a member, the 
process by which one's name finally reaches NAMI and gets into the 
database is laborious.  We need to streamline that process.
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">We must actively seek out ethnic and minority population 
members. </font> We must not do lip service to this effort, but genuinely 
work to engage those people in our communities from ethnic and 
minority populations.  We must review and renew our outreach 
efforts.  Projections are that by the year 2005, the Spanish-
speaking peoples will be the largest minority group in America.  
And not too many years after that the "minority" populations will 
be in the majority.
<P>
	<font color="#FF0000" size="3">So who should be a NAMI member? </font> The person being treated for 
depression down the hall where you work?  The mom and dad whose 
child has a disorder?  The child's school counselor and teachers?  
Those siblings, offspring, and partners whose lives have been 
affected but have never reached out?   Your co-workers who have no 
experience with brain disorders, but who would support the cause 
due to your involvement?  The student who finds the NAMI web site 
during an Internet search?  The person who calls the NAMI Helpline? 
 My ill sister's case manager?  Her psychiatrist?  
<P>
	Yes, yes, yes!  To all of these, and more.  We must seek them 
out and make it easy to join.  As we win the fight against 
discrimination and stigma, our membership should grow.  It should 
be just as natural to support our cause as it is to support the 
American Cancer Society, the Heart Association, or any other 
organization of this kind.  
<P>
	So what can you do?  Take those names and addresses to your 
local affiliate.  Follow up with these people as well as with the 
people who attend your local support group meeting.  Ask them to 
become members.  And don't forget to forward those names 
immediately to your state office.  The sooner we get those members 
in the database, the sooner we can begin providing them with 
services and mailing them the Advocate. 
<P>
	Think of it:  a million NAMI members by the year 2000.  Can we 
do it?  You bet!

The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) offers its heartfelt condolences to the family of John 
Salvi III, who suffered from a severe mental illness and committed suicide in Cedar Junction prison, 
Walpole, MA, on Friday, November 29.  Salvi was serving a life sentence for killing two workers at an 
abortion clinic in December 1994.
<P>
"This tragedy is yet another graphic illustration of the consequences of failing to treat people with severe 
mental illnesses in the criminal justice system," said Laurie Flynn, executive director of NAMI.  "John 
Salvi's parents will bury a son, just as his victims were buried two years ago.  In this age of effective 
treatment for brain disorders, neither tragedy should have occurred."
<P>
Approximately eight percent of all prison inmates suffer from brain disorders such as schizophrenia and 
manic-depressive illness (bipolar disorder).  This rate is four times greater than that occurring in the 
general population.   According to a NAMI study by E. Fuller Torrey, MD, of St. Elizabeth's Hospital, 
prisons and jails have become substitute treatment facilities due in large part to inadequate outpatient and 
community-based care.
<P>
"Regardless of a person's crime, correctional facilities are obligated both morally and constitutionally to 
provide appropriate treatment," said Laurie Flynn. 
<P>
NAMI is a family and consumer organization advocating for the rights of people who suffer from brain 
disorders commonly known as severe mental illnesses.  Established in 1979, NAMI has over 140,000 
members in 1,100 affiliate groups with state offices in all 50 states.   Through the Campaign to End 
Discrimination, NAMI continues to provide support, education and advocacy to improve the lives of 
persons with serious brain disorders such as schizophrenia, manic-depression (bipolar disorder), clinical 
depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and severe childhood disorders.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>The Stanley Foundation Research Programs</H2>
<H4>by E. Fuller Torrey, M.D.</H4>
</font>
<hr>
	Since 1989, when the Stanley Foundation and NAMI began to directly 
support research, the Stanley Foundation--along with the National 
Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), the National Alliance for 
Research on Depression and Schizophrenia (NARSAD), and the Scottish 
Rite Schizophrenia Research Program--has become a major source of 
support for research into schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.  In 
fact, the Stanley Foundation is presently supporting approximately 
half of all research taking place in the United States directly 
related to bipolar disorder.  This issue's column provides an 
overview of Stanley Foundation research programs.  Subsequent 
columns will describe specific research programs in more detail.
<P>
	The Stanley Foundation research programs began in 1988 when Ted 
and Vada Stanley approached Laurie Flynn and me and asked what they 
might do to support research on schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. 
<P>
 The Stanleys own MBI Inc., a company in Connecticut that sells 
leather-bound books, collectibles such as Roger Tory Peterson 
songbird plates, commemorative items, World War II leather flight 
jackets (like the one worn by Tom Cruise in Top Gun), and other 
items by direct mail.  These items are advertised in magazines and 
newspapers and sold by various companies under MBI Inc., including 
the Danbury Mint and Easton Press.  In addition to their support of 
psychiatric research, the Stanleys have been longtime supporters of 
many humanitarian causes, including Third World refugee-relief 
efforts and the Habitat for Humanity, associated with former 
president Jimmy Carter.
<P>
	Among the initial programs supported by the Theodore and Vada 
Stanley Foundation were the research-awards program and the Stanley 
Scholars program, and they provide a NAMI staff person to evaluate 
and oversee NIMH research efforts.  The research awards program 
began in 1989 with awards granted to seven out of 35 applicants.  
We were very fortunate to have on the professional committee that 
selected the awardees outstanding scientists such as Nobel Prize 
winners Drs. Julius Axelrod and Carleton Gajdusek and noted senior 
psychiatric researchers such as Dr. Seymour Kety.
<P>
	By 1996 the awards program had grown so that one- or two-year 
awards were given to 50 of 253 applicants.  Another 46 researchers 
received second-year funding based on their 1995 awards, so that 
altogether this year the Stanley Foundation is supporting 96 
research projects under its program.  Awards are for a maximum of 
$75,000 per year for research involving human subjects and $50,000 
per year for laboratory-based research.  Almost all awards are for 
research related to the causes or treatment of schizophrenia and 
bipolar disorder, although a few awards have been made for other 
brain disorders such as autism.  Almost 40 percent of the research 
awards go to researchers in other countries, currently including 
Canada, England, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, 
Japan, Taiwan, Australia, India, and Ethiopia.
<P>
	Columns in the next two issues of the Advocate will describe two 
other cornerstones of the Stanley Foundation research program:  the 
Stanley Neurovirology Laboratory at Johns Hopkins Medical Center, 
under Dr. Robert Yolken, and the Bipolar Treatment Network, 
coordinated by Dr. Robert Post at NIMH.  Later columns will 
describe other parts of the research program, including the Stanley 
Scholars program, the European Research Centers program, the 
Stanley Foundation Brain Collection and Neuropathology Consortium, 
the Career Researchers program, and the recently announced Bipolar 
Disorders Research Centers program.  All of this work has been made 
possible through the remarkable generosity and support of Ted and 
Vada Stanley.

<H2>The Scientific Case for Parity</H2>
<H4>by Laura Lee Hall, Ph.D., NAMI Deputy Director of Policy and Research</H4>
</font>
<hr>

	Who would have believed ten years ago, ten months ago, even 
ten weeks ago that the U.S. Congress would pass a law signaling an 
initial step toward ending insurance discrimination against people 
with brain disorders/mental illness?  Yet here we are, several 
weeks after the Rose Garden signing of the Domenici-Wellstone 
amendment into law, the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996.  
<P>
	It is proper that we pause and examine the case for parity,  
not only because this modest little policy step is historic, but 
because we run the risk of a pyrrhic victory ignored, defied, and 
overturned.
<P>
	Science helped us get here today and will help us fight the 
good fights of the future.  There is no question that improved 
diagnoses and treatments for brain disorders are a fundamental 
building block in the argument for parity.  There is no question 
that improved understanding of the biological underpinnings of some 
severe mental illnesses shatters the conceptual barrier between 
physical and mental illnesses.  There is no question that the 
economic analyses of parity's impact helped in the passage of this 
law and will be necessary for its future implementation and 
expansion.  Indeed, all of these data are the currency by which we 
will convince the idea-shapers and business leaders of the 
importance and practicality of parity.
<P>
	So, yes, science is important.  But in fact, this victory 
represents the strength of a multi-textured fabric, interwoven 
threads of science, political heroism, and advocacy by consumers 
and families.  
<P>
	We would not sit here today, still in the fresh-blush victory, 
if it weren't for the courageous and steadfast leadership of 
champions in the Congress, especially Senator Pete Domenici.  It 
was Senator Domenici who, all alone, offered several years ago his 
first parity bill in the Congress.  And it was Senator Pete 
Domenici who, at the midnight hour, refused to capitulate.  His 
standing, fortified by his dedication, made him a hero who couldn't 
be faced down.
<P>
	What accounts for the dedication of Senator Domenici, Senator 
Wellstone, and others?  As NAMI members, you know what creates this 
undying dedication and advocacy.  People with serious brain 
disorders and their families will never give up, be they U.S. 
Senators or ordinary citizens.
<P>
	You know the scenario too many families have faced.  A middle 
class family.  Parents both work.  They have private health 
insurance.  An adolescent son or daughter begins his or her descent 
into severe mental illness; symptoms of psychosis emerge, perhaps, 
and grow worse.  Intensive medical intervention, indeed 
hospitalization, is required.  That's when the parents learn that 
their insurance has a devastating gap.  They exceed their lifetime 
limit on coverage--$50,000, $20,000, even $6,000--far less than the 
$1 million cap typical for other serious illnesses.  In short, 
their insurance runs out long before their illness does.  Homes are 
remortgaged.  Savings accounts are wiped out.  Family vacations and 
the college education of children are jeopardized.  A lifetime of 
public welfare programs become the rosiest future.  The alternative 
is homelessness, jailing, suicide.  
<P>
	All because of a brain illness--and discrimination.  All in a 
country with a proud tradition of insuring, in the private sector, 
against the financial disaster that catastrophic illness can pose.
<P>
	This is--or has been--the fate of families facing serious 
brain disorders.  This fate has continued, even with treatment 
advances, new and more effective medications, and an incredible 
sense of hope among patients and their families for a better and 
productive life, recovery.
<P>
	Despite public ignorance.  Despite stigma.  Despite pervasive 
discrimination.  American families who live the reality of serious 
brain illness will get up every morning and fight.  We will be the 
little engine that could, and could, and could.  Because this is 
America, where ultimately there is no room for injustice.  Science 
provides proof of the discrimination.  People provide the passion.
<P>
	Many of us worry that this new law is a step so modest, so 
tentative, so insecure, that its only effect will be the 
mobilization of our opponents.  Many still harbor false images of 
mental illness and its treatment.  Many, in the business community, 
harbor concerns about the costs.  Many also bristle at the first 
signs of erosion in the protection against federal regulation that 
self-insured employers cherish.  
<P>
	But even as Rosa Parks in quiet dignity said "NO" to 
discrimination--and in all likelihood was surprised that her brave, 
simple act became a pivotal point in history--this small victory 
against discrimination can be a turning point as well.  But we must 
be smart and dedicated to continued progress, as the civil rights 
leaders in America were.
<P>
	We must make sure that:
<ol>
	<li> this small step is not repealed.

	<li> this law is implemented and enforced in a way that 
is real and not simply a shifting of discriminatory 
barriers to treatment with prohibitive increases in co-
pays and limits in doctors' visits and hospital stays.

	<li> that this step is expanded upon by expanding the 
federal parity provision to be real parity for people 
with serious brain disorders; by working stridently for 
state parity laws (after all, the Domenici-Wellstone 
amendment does not mandate mental health coverage; it 
excludes employers with fewer than 50 employees; and it 
only covers annual and lifetime limits); and by working 
to end discrimination against people with brain 
disorders in all areas of public life--private 
insurance, public-sector programs, managed care 
organizations and HMOs, housing, and employment.  
</ol>
<P>
	We have won the first struggle in a titanic battle between two 
strongly held ideas:  freedom from government mandates versus an 
end to discrimination.  We must bring to victory the cause of 
justice and anti-discrimination.
<P>
	Our science will be necessary to support this historic battle. 
 We need continued research and dissemination of this research to 
the public so that we better understand the underpinnings of 
serious brain disorders, their diagnoses, and their treatment.
<P>
	We must also get our economic house in order.  The federal 
parity battle cloaked itself in a war of numbers.  And while we 
performed well, some of the gaps in the data were surely alarming. 
 For example, analyses of the impact of state parity laws were 
quite sparse.  
<P>
	We must also work with the business community in implementing 
and expanding non-discriminatory policies.  Stigma and 
discrimination are partly at the root of the business communities' 
opposition to parity.  After all, you heard no public outcry 
against the 48-hours mandate for newborns and their mothers.  Nor 
was there an outcry about the Kassebaum-Kennedy law.  It was the 
mental illness "mandate" that was attacked and fought.  In one of 
the business communities' analyses of the cost of the Domenici-
Wellstone amendment, they protested the shift of costs for treating 
people with severe mental illness from the public sector to 
employers, including jail and prison costs.  In other words, they 
implied that it is more appropriate for a person with schizophrenia 
to be put in jail than to be treated in the mainstream healthcare 
system.
<P>
	Yes, there were signs of prejudice and discrimination.  But 
some American employers are trying to do the right thing.  They 
offer generous coverage for serious brain disorders.  We must work 
with them, educate them about these illnesses, and help them 
understand that these are physical illnesses like epilepsy, 
Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.  We must work with 
them to best manage and control the costs of coverage for these 
brain disorders.   
<P>
	Be proud of your vigorous and courageous advocacy during the 
many years you have worked to improve the lives of people with 
serious brain disorders.  Even this modest law would never have 
passed without your dedicated work for so long.  We have reached a 
threshold of success.  We are headed toward a complete end to 
injustice and inhumane treatment of people with serious brain 
disorders.
<P>
It is proper that we pause and examine the case for parity,  not 
only because this modest little policy step is historic, but 
because we run the risk of a pyrrhic victory ignored, defied, and 
overturned.
<P>
As NAMI members, you know what creates this undying dedication and 
advocacy.  People with serious brain disorders and their families 
will never give up, be they U.S. Senators or ordinary citizens.
<P>
Yes, there were signs of prejudice and discrimination.  But some 
American employers are trying to do the right thing.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3">
<H2>1997 Key Legislative Priorities</H2>
<H4>February 5, 1997</H4>
</font>
<hr>
				
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) </font>- NIMH is the principal federal 
agency in charge of funding biomedical research into brain disorders.  Through its $701 
million budget, NIMH supports and conducts an integrated program of basic and clinical 
research and research training in biology, neuroscience and epidemiology.  Research 
initiatives include programs in major brain disorders such as schizophrenia, major 
depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder.  Over the 
past two years, NIMH has received important increases in funding through the bipartisan 
leadership of Representatives John Edward Porter (R-IL) and Louis Stokes (D-OH) and 
Senators Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Tom Harkin (D-IA).  <STRONG>NAMI strongly supported 
these efforts and pledges to work to enact similar increases in FY 1998 in order to 
ensure that there are adequate resources for promising research into brain disorders 
and genetics and support for initiatives focused on neural receptors, receptor 
subtypes and modulators. </STRONG> The 105th Congress is expected to consider legislation 
reauthorizing NIMH.  <STRONG>NAMI supports changes in the NIMH mission that will place 
greater emphasis on the most serious brain disorders, including schizophrenia, 
major depression and bipolar disorder, in its research portfolio.
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Managed Care</font> - Faced with mounting insurance costs, more and more employers are 
choosing to administer coverage of serious brain disorders through managed care.  Many 
of these managed care organizations (MCOs) administer plans that have discriminatory 
treatment limits and out-of-pocket limits for mental illness.  Passage of the Domenici-
Wellstone Mental Illness Parity Act in 1996 marked a major step forward in ending 
discrimination in insurance coverage.  However, much more needs to be done.  A major 
concern for NAMI members are the methods used by for-profit MCOs to limit access to 
medically necessary treatment.  The shift toward managed care in both private and public 
health insurance systems does offer much promise for expanding access to treatment, 
particularly for families and consumers who previously did not have access to mental 
illness coverage.  In addition, managed care offers tremendous potential for uncovering 
effective treatment through outcome measures.  However, the shift toward managed care 
must also be watched closely to measure its impact on individuals with the most serious 
illnesses.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts to make managed care more accountable through 
improved outcome measures and more open to input from families and consumers. </STRONG>
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">FDA Reform & Access to Pharmaceuticals</font> - Reform of the process by which 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
is a major concern for Congress.  Even though legislation was not passed in 1996, FDA 
reform is certain to remain high on the legislative agenda in 1997.  The FDA regulatory 
process and access to new medications is a major concern for NAMI.  Recent advances in 
pharmacology and drug therapies offer tremendous promise for individuals with 
schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, panic disorder and obsessive-
compulsive disorder.  Unfortunately, many of these new drugs have taken years to get 
through the FDA regulatory process and are prohibitively expensive for individuals and 
families that do not have access to health insurance coverage.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts to 
maintain the FDA's traditional role of ensuring the safety and effectiveness of all 
prescription drugs in the marketplace.  NAMI also supports efforts to streamline the 
FDA approval process in order to accelerate research and development of new drugs 
and ensure that the promising therapies reach consumers and families as quickly as 
possible.  NAMI also supports development of a new federal program designed to 
finance purchase of drugs for serious brain disorders such as schizophrenia, where 
the costs of new medications (e.g., risperdal and clozapine) is prohibitively expensive 
for people without access to insurance coverage.   
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Medicaid</font> - Medicaid is a joint state-federal program that meets the health care needs of 
persons on SSI cash assistance and other low-income families.  Medicaid is also an 
important source of funding for critical outpatient services for people with severe mental 
illness.  Over the past few years, states have moved to reform their Medicaid programs by 
contracting out mental illness coverage to MCOs through managed care "carve outs."  In 
many cases, these "carve outs" have improved the availability of services in the public 
mental health system.  However, in some cases, these programs are posing great danger to 
the public treatment system as for-profit companies drain precious resources and impose 
dangerously low "capitation" rates on providers.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts at the federal 
level to impose standards on Medicaid managed care plans to ensure adequate 
treatment resources for people with serious brain disorders, greater accountability 
and improved consumer and family input.  NAMI is encouraged by recent 
projections which show Medicaid spending growing at its lowest rate in over a 
decade (down to 3.5% in FY 1996) and is hopeful that this progress will eliminate 
the need for reforms that would limit treatment for people with brain disorders.   </STRONG> 
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Medicare </font>- Medicare is an important program for individuals with brain disorders 
receiving SSDI cash assistance.  While it finances both inpatient treatment and physician 
services, it does not pay for outpatient prescription drugs.  <STRONG>NAMI supports changes in 
the current Medicare program to improve the package of mental illness benefits 
available to beneficiaries and make it more consistent with recent advances in 
psychiatric treatment.  NAMI also supports efforts to maintain the stability of the 
Medicare Part A Trust Fund, but opposes any effort to unfairly increase premiums 
and deductibles for moderate and low-income beneficiaries.  
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Health Insurance For Children</font> - As part of his FY 1998 budget proposal, 
President Clinton is asking Congress to pass legislation to expand health insurance 
coverage for the nearly 10 million children have no health insurance (80% of whom have a 
parent in the workforce.  The President is proposing expansion of Medicaid to include 
children of working families.  A number of alternative congressional proposals would offer 
vouchers and other incentives that utilize the private health insurance market to cover 
more children.  Neither the President's plan, nor the congressional alternatives, currently 
mandate that proposed "children only" health plans offer parity for treatment for child and 
adolescent brain disorders.  <STRONG>NAMI supports inclusion of mental illness parity as part 
of any legislation to expand coverage for uninsured children of working parents.    
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Employment, Work and Income Supports for People With Brain 
Disorders </font>- People with brain disorders want to achieve work and independence.  
Unfortunately, the current public systems of income supports, vocational rehabilitation 
(VR) and training have not been responsive to their needs for long-term supports and 
services that can empower them to compete in the workplace.  NAMI recently released a 
report documenting the inability of the federal-state VR system to serve people with 
severe mental illnesses.  Congress is expected to consider legislation reforming the VR 
program through the Rehabilitation Act.  In addition, Senator James Jeffords (R-VT) and 
Representative Jim Bunning (R-KY) are expected to propose bills that would eliminate 
current disincentives to work in the SSI and SSDI programs.  <STRONG>NAMI supports efforts to 
open up the current VR system to competition and alternative providers that better 
understand the unique needs of people with brain disorders and allow innovative 
approaches that stress long-term supports and services and ongoing monitoring.  
NAMI also urges Congress to address the basic unfairness in the SSI and SSDI 
programs that penalize beneficiaries for work and take away health insurance 
coverage once earned income rises above certain levels.    
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Patient Confidentiality </font>- The Kennedy-Kassebaum Health Insurance Portability Act 
of 1996 (P.L. 104-191) contains "administrative simplification" provisions designed to 
improve the "efficiency" of the health care system by encouraging the development of a 
uniform, nationalized information system.  It requires HHS to develop "standards and 
requirements for the electronic transmission of certain health information."  The new law 
does not contain a requirement to computerize information, but does mandate new 
standards for electronically transferred patient information.  <STRONG>NAMI is very concerned 
about the impact of these provisions in cases where health plans require providers to 
transmit sensitive patient information (including psychiatrists notes and other 
"encounter information" electronically. </STRONG> Under the new law, HHS has 18 months to 
develop standards for electronic transmission, after which health plans will have 24 months 
to bring themselves into compliance.  HHS is supposed to submit to Congress 
recommendations designed to protect patient privacy.  However, if Congress does not act 
on these recommendations within 3 years, HHS will then be required to promulgate final 
rules.  While these new federal standards are supposed to preempt existing state laws, 
current state protections relating to "privacy of individually identifiable health 
information" are not preempted, and are subject to whatever Congress passes in the future 
to protect privacy.  NAMI is currently working to ensure that legislation now being 
drafted by Senator Robert Bennett (R-UT) and Representative Gary Condit (D-CA) 
provides adequate protections to ensure privacy of patient information.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Education </font>- Congress has already begun work on legislation reauthorizing the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Representatives William Goodling 
(R-PA) and Frank Riggs (R-CA) have introduced IDEA reauthorization legislation that 
would overhaul the current due process system to promote mediation, instead of litigation 
over a child's placement and need for services.  The bill provides parents with the right to 
access all of their child's records and participate in any decisions on placement.  The bill 
also includes controversial provisions related to student discipline and "cessation of 
services" for certain students (including a requirement for IEP teams to determine whether 
a child's action were a "manifestation" of his or her disability).  <STRONG>NAMI is very concerned 
about proposals that unfairly target for "cessation" or expulsion children with brain 
disorders such as autism and pervasive developmental disorder.   NAMI also 
supports efforts to protect recent increases in funding for special education. </STRONG> 
Congress added $783.7 million in federal Special Education funds in FY 1997.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Housing </font>- Access to decent, safe and affordable housing remains a tremendous 
challenge for people with serious brain disorders.  Recent cuts in federal funding and 
changes in federal policy (especially new rules that allow public housing authorities 
[PHAs] and assisted housing providers to designate housing as "elderly only") have 
limited housing opportunity for people with severe mental illness.  In addition, proposals 
to restrict enforcement of the Fair Housing Act could make it more difficult to combat 
"NIMBYism" that results from stigma and discrimination faced by group homes and other 
community-based housing options.  In 1996, NAMI worked closely with allies in 
Congress, including Senator Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Representative Rodney 
Frelinghuysen (R-NJ), to add $50 million to the HUD budget for tenant-based rental 
assistance for people with disabilities who have been (and will be) adversely impacted by 
"elderly only" public and assisted housing designation.  This effort was in response to new 
rules signed into law in 1996 (Section 10 of P.L. 104-120) that are making it easier for 
PHAs to designate housing and limit low-income housing options for people with 
disabilities.  People with serious brain disorders are especially vulnerable in the "elderly 
only" housing designation process because of the stigma associated with their illnesses.  
<STRONG>NAMI will continue to push for additional tenant-based rental assistance linked to 
the emerging housing designation crisis and adequate funds for HUD Section 811, 
Shelter Plus Care and programs under the McKinney Act serving homeless persons 
with severe mental illness.  
</STRONG><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">SAMHSA </font>- The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 
(SAMHSA) is the principal federal agency funding services for people with serious brain 
disorders through its Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS).  CMHS's principal 
program is the Mental Health Services Block Grant ($275.4 million) which directs funds 
to state mental health agencies for community-based services.  These fund represent a 
small, but important, source of funds for state mental health agencies.  Other CMHS 
programs include PATH ($20 million), Childrens' Mental Health ($69 million) and PAIMI 
($19.8 million).  CMHS also directs "demonstration" funds through its Knowledge, 
Development and Application (KDA) program ($58 million).  In 1996, Congress failed to 
reauthorize SAMHSA as a result of controversy over eligibility of faith-based non-profit 
providers for SAMHSA programs.  Thus, reauthorization legislation must be written in 
1997.  <STRONG>NAMI supports changes in SAMHSA programs that will focus greater 
attention on the needs of persons with the most serious brain disorders.

<H2>Disability Insurance</H2>

<H4>Copyright 1995 National Alliance for the Mentally Ill</H4>
<HR>
The following information was taken from the Committee on Ways and Means, U.S. House of Representatives' "Overview of Entitlement Programs, 1994 Green Book: Background Material and Data on Programs within the Jurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means," U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., 1994
<P>
What is the Disability Insurance Program?
<P>
The Disability Insurance (DI) program provides monthly cash benefits for disabled workers under age 65 and their dependents.  Benefits were provided to disabled workers age 50 or older by the 1956 Social Security amendments; benefits for their dependents were provided by the 1958 Social Security amendments; and benefits to disabled workers under age 50 were provided by the 1960 amendments.
<P>
In 1993, there were 5.2 million persons in current payment status.  Twenty-six percent were disabled by reason of mental illness.  
<P>
Many provisions of the DI program are identical to those of the Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI), commonly referred to as Social Security.  The purpose of both OASI and DI benefits is to replace income lost when the wage-earner is no longer able to work.  The DI program insures against the loss of income due to the worker's physical or mental disability.
<P>
What is the definition of disability?
<P>
Generally, disability is defined as an inability to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of a physical or mental impairment.  The impairment must be medically determinable and expected to last for not less than 12 months or to result in death. 
<P>
Claimants may be determined to be disabled only if, due to such an impairment, they are unable to engage in any kind of substantial gainful work, considering their age, education, and work experience, which exists in the national economy.  The work need not exist in the immediate area in which the claimant lives, nor must a specific job vacancy exist for the individual.  Moreover, no showing is required that the worker would be hired for the job if he or she applied.
<P>
What are the DI benefits?
<P>
In general, DI monthly cash benefits are paid and computed on the same basis as in the OASI program.  Benefit amounts are related to the past earning of the insured worker.  Medicare is provided to disabled workers, widow(er)s, or adult children after they have been entitled to disability benefits for 24 months.  In December 1993 there were 5.2 million DI beneficiaries in current-payment status.  The total monthly benefits paid out were $2.6 billion.  Table 1 summarizes various types of beneficiaries of the DI program currently receiving benefits, average benefit amounts, and the number of new awards during 1993.
<P>
What are the major benefit types relevant to persons with mental illness?
<P>
The major benefit types include:
<P>
1.  Disabled-worker benefit -- A monthly benefit payable to  a disabled worker under age 65 insured for disability.
<P>
2.  Disabled adult child's benefit --  A monthly benefit payable  to a disabled person aged 18 or over--a son or daughter or eligible grandson or granddaughter of a retired, deceased, or disabled worker--whose disability began before age 22.
<P>
What is Supplemental Security Income?
<P>
The Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program is a means-tested, federally administered income assistance program authorized by title XVI of the Social Security Act.  Begun in 1974, SSI provides monthly cash payments in accordance with uniform, nationwide eligibility requirements to needy aged, blind, and disabled persons.  In 1993, nearly six million persons were receiving SSI.  Of these, 1,471,000 (or 28.1 percent) were disabled by a mental disorder other than retardation.
<P>
What has been the trend in SSI recipients?
<P>
The number of recipients on SSI has risen from nearly 4 million in 1974 to nearly 6 million in December 1993.  From 1984 through 1993, the disabled population on SSI grew at an annual average rate of about 9.2 percent.  The monthly federal benefit rates for individuals and couples rose from $140 and $210 in 1974 to $446 and $669 in 1994, respectively.
<P>
The proportion of SSI recipients receiving Social Security benefits declined from nearly 53 percent in 1974 to about 40 percent in 1993.  The fraction of SSI recipients receiving some other type of unearned income rose from about 11 percent in 1974 to 13 percent in 1993, and the fraction with earnings jumped from about 3 percent to 1974 to more than 4 percent in December 1993.
<P>
What about children and SSI payments?
<P>
In June 1993, 732,000 blind and disabled children were eligible for SSI payments.  These children made up 12.6 percent of the over 5.8 million SSI recipients in June, and they represent a fast-growing segment of the SSI population. 
<P>
To be eligible for SSI payments as a child, an individual must be under age 18 (or under 22 if he or she is a full-time student, unmarried, and must meet the SSI disability, citizenship/residency, and income and resources criteria (applicable to adults).  The Zabley Supreme Court decision required "individual functional assessments for children, not just conformity to one diagnosis in the adult listings.
<P>
In June 1993, almost 61 percent of the SSI children were 12 years old or less, and an estimated 20 percent of the children were under age 6.  About 28 percent (or about 199,000) were between the ages of 13 and 17.
<P>
More than half (61 percent) of the SSI children were medically eligible based on a mental disorder, and most of these (43 percent) were mentally retarded.  The remaining 18 percent (61 minus 43)--or 131,760--are eligible based on mental disorders other than retardation.

<H2>SSDI--Beneficiaries To Lose?</H2>
<hr>



by Robert Bohlman, Director, NAMI Government Relations
<P>
	The House Ways & Means Committee Subcommittee on Social Security has held a hearing on the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) program.  The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Jim Bunning (R-KY), is expected to go forward with legislation that would limit the time beneficiaries would have in the program without re-application.<P>
	The initiative is the result of the rapid and continuing rise in the number of cases found eligible and because success in getting these beneficiaries into (or back into) the workforce has been dismal.  (NAMI agrees, but believes that, in large part, the poor success rates reflect the strong disincentives for disabled persons to leave their safety net behind.)  Benning's proposal is to put recipients off the rolls after three years, but allow them to reapply.<P>
	This design turns the current system on its head.  Now there are "continuing disability reviews" that the Social Security Administration is supposed to conduct on multi-year schedules specific to disability categories.  (Acknowledgedly, these are not performed anywhere near as extensively as called for.)  The burden is on the agency to demonstrate that a person no longer meets the strict Social Security definition of disability.  The effect of the proposal would be to shift the burden to the individual, who would have to prove every three years that he or she is still disabled.  Some persons would not be inclined to reapply, and others with cognitive or socialization deficits would have a very difficult time applying all over again.
	<P>Once it gets to the full Ways & Means Committee, the proposal may well be extended to Supplemental Security Income (SSI).  This could have an immediate effect on housing for persons disabled by a severe brain disorder.  Many SSI recipients turn over their SSI checks to the group home where they live.  Interruption in the checks could cause many group homes to close.
	<P>It is still a possibility that Rep. Bunning's bill could distinguish by diagnosis certain disabilities that are irrefutably lifetime disorders.  These disorders, then, could be excluded from the requirement of a three-year limit and reapplication.

<H2>Get Ready For The Fall Elections</H2>
<hr>


	November brings us the chance to choose our elected officials 
again from the President down to many city council members.  The 
entire House of Representatives, a third of the U. S. Senate, in 
most states half the state Senate, and the entire assembly will be 
up for election.
<P>
	Even though November seems far off, the candidates are already 
thinking about it.  As they attend functions, sit in on call-in 
radio, and sponsor town meetings, they should be asked their 
positions regarding persons with severe mental illness.  Before 
they're sworn in next January, we should know where they stand on 
the public-sector safety net issues as well as on publicly funded 
research into severe brain disorders.  Be active.

<H2>Supreme Court Decides Important Case</H2>
<HR>
Zoning ordinances that limit housing in particular communities to single-family residences frequently function as barriers to group homes and other types of congregate housing arrangements for persons with severe mental illness.  However, a recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court will limit the extent to which communities will be able to use single-family zoning ordinances to prevent group homes in the future. 
<P>
The case decided by the Supreme Court, City of Edmonds v. Oxford House, involved a group home opened for 10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction in the city of Edmonds, Washington.  The city sought to block the group home, citing the local zoning code rule that limited housing in the particular neighborhood to "single-family dwelling units." 
<P>
Under this rule, single-family dwelling units can be occupied only by "two or more persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer persons who are not related by genetics, adoption, or marriage."  Since this particular group home was opened to house at least 10 persons, the city argued that it did not conform to the code and therefore could not be opened. 
<P>
Oxford House asked the city to provide a reasonable accommodation by allowing it to remain in the dwelling it had already leased and opened.  The city declined and filed a lawsuit against Oxford House seeking a declaration that the Federal Fair Housing Act does not prohibit cities from acting to prevent the operation of group homes in areas zoned as single family only. 
<P>
The Fair Housing Act declares it unlawful "to discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of...that buyer or renter."  The city asserted that the single-family requirement in its zoning code was a permissible exception to the general prohibitions against discrimination in the Fair Housing Act.  That act creates an exemption for "reasonable...restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a building."  
<P>
Oxford House argued that the city's restrictive single-family requirement did not fall within permissible exceptions to the Fair Housing Act.  Additionally, Oxford House counterclaimed, charging the city with failure to provide a reasonable accommodation permitting it to keep the group home open, in violation of the Fair Housing Act. 
<P>
The District Court ruled in favor of the city, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth (federal) Circuit reversed, thereby ruling in favor of Oxford House.  Because the Ninth Circuit's decision conflicted with an Eleventh Circuit decision in a similar case, the Supreme Court accepted jurisdiction to resolve the conflict. 
<P>
 The Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal's decision. The court acknowledged that rules restricting the maximum number of occupants who may occupy a dwelling ("maximum occupancy restrictions") are exempted from the Fair Housing Act.
<P>
That is, these rules are permissible, even if their effect is to impose limitations or restrictions on group homes.  However, these rules must be narrowly written to "protect health and safety by preventing dwelling overcrowding."  Moreover, these rules must apply "uniformly to all residents of all dwelling units."
<P>
In this case, the court characterized the city's zoning ordinance as a "land-use restriction," rather than a "maximum-occupancy restriction."  These types of rules, the court explained, which are intended to "preserve the character of neighborhoods,"  do not fall within the absolute exemption contained in the Fair Housing Act.  Therefore, these rules, which have the effect of restricting or prohibiting group homes and other housing for persons with disabilities, violate the anti-discrimination requirements of the Fair Housing Act.
<P>
The court's decision was influenced by its awareness that the limitation in the zoning ordinance on the maximum number of persons who could reside in one dwelling (five) applied only to unrelated persons.  There was no similar limit on the number of people related by "genetics, adoption, or marriage" who could reside in one dwelling.  Consequently, it seemed clear to the court that the primary intent of the ordinance was to preserve the character of the neighborhood, not to protect the health and welfare of the community by protecting against overcrowding within dwellings.  
<P>
The Edmonds decision represents a significant victory for advocates for community-based housing for persons with mental illness and other disabilities.  As a result of this decision, opponents of group homes will find it far more difficult in the future to use restrictive zoning ordinances or rules as a legal basis for their opposition.  Supreme Court decisions establish national precedent binding on all other courts. 
<P>
Therefore, NAMI advocates encountering opposition to group homes based on restrictive zoning ordinances should not hesitate to request immediate review to determine whether the particular ordinance or rule complies with the principals set forth in the Edmonds case. Legal assistance in fair-housing cases is frequently available through local legal aid societies or through the State Protection and Advocacy Agency.  Additionally, assistance may be obtained through state and local fair-housing enforcement agencies. A list of these agencies is available from the NAMI Office of Legal Affairs.  
<P>
Please notify Ron Honberg at NAMI (202/524-7600) if restricted ordinances are proposed in your local area.

<H2>RI Investigation Yields Sanctions Against Managed Care Company</H2>
by Ron Honberg, Director, NAMI Legal Affairs
<hr>

	The investigation of a private, for-profit company responsible for managing mental health services to subscribers of a large health insurance plan in Rhode Island has resulted in the imposition of severe sanctions against that company.  These sanctions are apparently the most drastic penalties ever imposed by a state against a managed behavioral health care company.    
<P>
    	The investigation was conducted by the Rhode Island Department of Health after numerous complaints were filed by consumers, family members, and advocates about the practices of United Behavioral Systems (UBS), a subsidiary corporation of United Health Plans of New England.  These complaints specifically articulated concerns about arbitrary restrictions imposed on inpatient and outpatient care and treatment for severe brain disorders such as schizophrenia, manic-depressive illness, and major depression as well as other mental health and substance abuse disorders.  Upon completion of its investigation, the Department of Health issued a lengthy report detailing improper practices and recommending revocation of UBS' right to operate in the state.  
<P>
	According to the Providence Journal, the report cited numerous deficiencies and improper practices by UBS, including denial of medically necessary treatment based on inadequate information, bonus payments to UBS' medical and executive directors for denying care, decisions to deny care by non-physicians, withholding of information about appeals procedures from patients whose requests for care were denied, and inconsistent application of "medical necessity" criteria.  Many of these practices were direct violations of state law.  Consumers, family members, and advocates praised the report, stating that it highlighted UBS' practice of erecting bureaucratic roadblocks for vulnerable individuals with critical treatment needs and thereby discouraging all but the most assertive individuals from pursuing their rights under their health insurance policies.  
<P>
	The health department's investigation was conducted under the authority of a state law regulating utilization review practices in Rhode Island.  That law requires the certification of all companies and agents conducting utilization review in Rhode Island and sets forth certain requirements for certification.  The law also authorizes the health department to impose sanctions, including monetary penalties and revocation of certification, for failure to comply with the standards in the statute and implementing regulations.  
<P>
	In July 1995, UBS entered into a consent agreement with the Department of Health.  Under the terms of this agreement, UBS may continue to provide services in Rhode Island on a one-year, probationary basis.  In return, UBS agreed to pay $100,000 in fines to the health department, $50,000 of which has gone into a study to ascertain "best practices" for providing managed mental health and substance abuse services.  Additionally, UBS agreed to terminate the contracts of their medical and executive directors.  
<P>
	According to Bill Emmet, executive director of the AMI of Rhode Island, the investigation and resulting sanctions have facilitated more cooperative, patient-oriented attitudes on the part of UBS.  However, Emmet is quick to note that the rest of the managed care industry in the state has not necessarily gotten the message.  "UBS seems to understand that it needs to be accountable to the consumers it serves.  However, this is not necessarily true for the entire managed care industry in Rhode Island."    
	<P>
	Following issuance of its report, the health department held public hearings on managed mental health and substance abuse care in Rhode Island with the intent to ascertain how best to regulate this industry.  Most of the speakers at this hearing were consumers, family members, and treatment providers.  According to the Providence Journal, treatment providers have "shied away" from criticizing insurance companies.  However, the health department's report and recommended penalties encouraged many of these providers to come forward and articulate their concerns about managed care practices.
<P>
	Interestingly, a number of speakers at the hearing expressed their belief that a 1994 law that requires coverage of severe brain disorders in health insurance policies equal to that of other physical disorders prohibits utilization review practices by managed care providers that single out people with severe brain disorders for discriminatory or inequitable treatment.  According to Bill Emmet, this highlights the value of insurance parity laws as anti-discrimination measures.  "It is now evident to most people in this state that the managed care companies have indeed treated people with mental illnesses unfairly, and as they look for ways to rectify that situation, many are citing the parity law."  (See article on New Hampshire and Rhode Island parity bills in the July/August 1994 Advocate.)      
<P>
	The sanctions imposed on UBS in Rhode Island illustrate the importance of laws that regulate the way managed care companies conduct their activities.  According to the Intergovernmental Health Policy Project, a number of states have enacted laws regulating certain aspects of managed care practices during the past few years.  For example, in 1995 at least three states--Maryland, Arizona, and Indiana--enacted laws regulating utilization review practices.  These were added to similar laws passed in four states--Kansas, Vermont, Maine, and California--in 1994.  The 1994 Vermont law was enacted specifically to address mental health services in managed care plans.      
<P>
	Additionally, legislation addressing protections for patients in managed care plans was considered in twenty states in 1995 and enacted in two of these states, New Hampshire and Maryland.  These laws, modeled after legislation developed by the American Medical Association, address issues such as certification requirements for managed care plans, managed care standards, notification and appeals procedures, and other aspects of patient rights.  A patient protection act was also passed in 1995 by the Texas legislature, but was subsequently vetoed by Governor George Bush, Jr.

</strong>
<HR>
<A NAME = "eeocc"><H2>EEOC CHANGES GUIDES</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
People with mental illness have often been victimized by questions on job applications or in job interviews about past treatment or hospitalization for mental illness.  Guidelines recently published by the U.S Equal Employment Opportunities Commission (EEOC) establish that private employers with 15 or more employees who ask such questions prior to a formal job offer are violating Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
<P>
Although the ADA statute expressly prohibits employers from inquiring about disabilities prior to an offer of employment, the specific legal parameters of what employers can and cannot ask and what types of tests can and cannot be administered before an employment offer have been unclear.  Published on May 19, 1994, the EEOC guidelines are intended to provide technical assistance to EEOC investigators for these important ADA issues.
<P>
As a general rule, the guidelines establish that pre-job-offer questions or tests that are reasonably expected to elicit or reveal information about the existence of a disability cannot be asked; therefore, direct questions about current or past treatment for mental illness would clearly violate the ADA.  Additionally, questions about prescription drugs would violate the ADA because responses would tend to reveal information about specific conditions or disorders. 
<P>
The guidelines allow employers to ask questions about an applicant's general ability to perform the essential functions of the specific job for which he or she is applying. For example, an employer may ask if an applicant is able to meet the attendance requirements of a specific job.  The employer may also inquire about the extent of leave taken in a previous job, although questions about why leave was taken are prohibited. 
<P>
The guidelines further prohibit employers from asking a series of questions likely to elicit information about the presence of a disability, even if one of the questions--by itself--would be permitted.  For example, an employer may ask pre-offer questions about ability to handle stress if coping with stress is essential to successful performance of the job being applied for. 
<P>
However, if this question were followed by a question concerning the impact of stress on the applicant's health, this series of two questions would probably be viewed as violating the ADA because of the likelihood that certain responses would elicit information about the existence of a psychiatric disability.  
<P>
The guidelines make an exception for questions about current or past use of illegal drugs.  Such questions are expressly permitted in the ADA statute, and tests for illegal drugs prior to tendering employment offers are also permitted.  However, questions about the extent of current or past illegal drug use are not permitted because they are viewed as eliciting information about disability.
<P>
If an applicant voluntarily discloses information about his or her disability, the employer is nevertheless precluded from asking for further information about the disability prior to a job offer.  For example, an employer may not ask an applicant to provide details about his or her mental illness even if the applicant has voluntarily disclosed that he or she suffers from mental illness. 
<P>
The EEOC guidelines also prohibit all pre-job-offer medical examinations.  Medical examinations (as defined in EEOC guidelines) include all "procedures or tests that seek information about the existence, nature or severity of an individual's physical or mental health impairment."  Therefore, psychiatric and psychological evaluations would appear to be prohibited because these elicit information about psychiatric disabilities. 
<P>
 Certain types of aptitude tests may be permissible as long as they are narrowly constructed to evaluate the ability to perform essential functions of the particular job applied for. 
<P>
After an applicant receives a bona fide offer of employment, the employer is permitted to inquire into the candidate's medical and psychiatric history or to require the candidate to complete a test or medical examination as long as all candidates in the same job category are subjected to the same inquiries, tests, or examinations. 
<P>
However, an employer who withdraws an offer of employment based on post-offer inquires or tests must prove that the decision to do so was based on evidence that the candidate would be unable to perform the essential functions of the job in question.
<P>
Although the guidelines are extensive (approximately 50 pages) and offer numerous examples intended to clarify their meaning, specific issues or controversies that are not clearly addressed are certain to arise and will have to be determined on a case-by-case basis.
<P>
Even though people with mental illnesses certainly continue to face discrimination in employment and in all areas of community life, these guidelines are a significant step toward protecting them from being victimized by the types of pre-employment questions and inquiries that have historically helped preclude them from appropriate employment opportunities. 
<P>
The EEOC guidelines were published in the May 19, 1994, issue of the Federal Register.  Copies can be obtained by writing to:

<H2>INFO ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</H2>
<hr>
When persons with mental illness--or their families--are confronted
with the criminal justice system, the pressure and intimidation
can be overwhelming.  This fact sheet offers some pointers, and
more detail can be found in the NAMI publication, A Guide to Mental
Illness and the Criminal Justice System.  To order a copy of this
guide, send $5 (plus 21 cents tax if you live in Virginia or 30
cents tax if you live in Washington, DC) plus 10% for handling
to NAMI RDS, 200 North Glebe Rd., Suite 1015, Arlington, VA 22203-3754.
 The item number is R407. 
<P>
What should you know first about criminal law?
<P>
In criminal law, the outcome of a case depends as much on the
facts of the case and the procedures followed in developing that
case as it does on the actual substantive law.  Individuals involved
in criminal cases will be most affected by the procedural steps
 governing these cases from the time of arrest to the end of the
case.  It is, therefore, essential to have a good criminal lawyer
to direct you through any encounter with the criminal justice
system.
<P>
What is the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?
<P>
Criminal violations come in two varieties, misdemeanors and felonies.
 There is no universal rule among the states to determine what
constitutes a misdemeanor and what constitutes a felony.  Generally,
crimes that are punishable by incarceration of one year or less
are misdemeanors, and crimes punishable by incarceration of more
than one year are felonies.  Beyond the maximum period of incarceration,
whether a crime is a felony or a misdemeanor is significant because
it will have a bearing on criminal procedures and constitutional
rights.
<P>
When does an arrest take place?
<P>
An arrest occurs when the police take a person into custody in
order to charge that person with a crime.  To make a lawful arrest,
a police officer must believe that a crime was committed by the
person to be arrested.  This is important in the context of mental
illness because an arrest does not occur every time a person with
mental illness is picked up or taken into custody by the police.
<P>
What is booking?
<P>
Booking is the process of fingerprinting and photographing a person
who has been arrested.  In some instances, it may be important
for the police to be notified quickly that they have a person
with mental illness in custody.  However, families should be cautioned
that the disclosure that a person has a mental illness can make
the police view the situation more seriously.  Therefore, whenever
possible, before family members make disclosures to the authorities
concerning the psychiatric history of a mentally ill family member,
they should discuss it with their attorney.
<P>
What should the family do during the interrogation?
<P>
Family members should try to prevent the police from questioning
a family member with mental illness without a lawyer present.
 Any person who is questioned by the police and is not free to
end the questioning and leave the place where he or she is being
questioned must be given a Miranda warning. (The right to remain
silent, etc.)  The police must immediately stop questioning anyone
who asks for a lawyer.
<P>
How do you find a lawyer?
<P>
Competent criminal lawyers are almost always available, even if
your budget is limited.  The first place to seek a lawyer if you
cannot afford to pay a full fee for a private lawyer is through
public defender services, court-appointed attorneys, local criminal
defense lawyers' associations, or local bar associations.  
<P>
The United States Constitution guarantees legal representation
to every defendant in a felony criminal case.  Therefore, if a
defendant to a felony charge cannot afford a lawyer, the state
must provide him or her with one.
<P>
What are your constitutional rights?
<P>
1.   The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right against unreasonable
searches and seizures.  Usually a warrant is required.  The exclusionary
rule prevents the prosecution from placing into evidence any evidence
that was obtained unreasonably.  
<P>
2.   The Fifth Amendment guarantees the right against self-incrimination,
which is the well-known right to remain silent. 
<P>
3.   The Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a speedy trial.
 Every  defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right
to have the charges against him or her decided quickly so that
he or she can move on with his or her life.  The Sixth Amendment
also guarantees the right to a public trial and a jury trial.
 The right to confront witnesses, a compulsory process for obtaining
witnesses, and the right to assistance of counsel are also protected
by this amendment.
<P>
4.   The Eighth Amendment protects people from cruel and unusual
punishment.  In addition, it protects the right to treatment for
acute medical problems, including psychiatric problems.
<P>
Who decides to file charges?
<P>
The decision to file charges is often made by the police and the
prosecutor's office together.
<P>
What is jail diversion?
<P>
Jail diversion is a procedure in which a person with mental illness
who has been charged with a crime agrees to participate in voluntary
treatment.  This treatment is generally provided in the community.
 In exchange for participating in treatment, the charges are either
dropped or deferred, pending satisfactory compliance with treatment.
 Jail diversion must be distinguished from probation and a suspended
sentence (which are similar), which entail a conviction being
entered onto the defendant's criminal record, either by guilty
plea or by a verdict.
<P>
Can a person stand trial if he or she is viewed as incompetent?
<P>
No person can be tried or sentenced for a crime if--because of
a mental disease or defect--he or she cannot understand the nature
of the proceedings against him or her or assist his or her lawyer
in preparing his defense.  A criminal defendant found not competent
to stand trial is usually subject to civil commitment for an indefinite
period. 
<P>
If a person is found competent to stand trial, can he or she invoke
the insanity defense?
<P>
Yes, a determination of competency does not prevent a defendant
from raising the insanity defense.

<H2>Psychiatric Care In Jails</H2>
<H4>by Betsy Greer </H4>
<H4>Member, North Virginia AMI</H4>
<hr>




	What is the standard of medical care required of a physician for the treatment of incarcerated mentally ill individuals?  The National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI) says the standard "is the same as that of the average, competent physician in the community."
<P>
	NAMI and the Tennessee Alliance for the Mentally Ill asserted that in a successful appeal in a wrongful death suit against a Tennessee jailhouse psychiatrist.  June Husted of California is suing Dr. Everett Echols III for negligent care of her son Todd Husted which, she says, was the proximate cause of Todd's suicide at a Nashville jail.
<P>
	Todd Husted was jailed in Nashville in May 1988 for auto larceny and malicious mischief.  The suit centers on Echols' actions when, as a part-time psychiatrist for the Nashville jail, he examined Todd Husted and diagnosed him as suffering from "schizophrenia, undifferentiated type."  He prescribed medication and ordered two blood tests for the presence of drugs -- one test immediately and one seven days later as a way to ascertain the amount of antipsychotic medication in the blood.  June Husted mailed to the jail Todd's medical and psychiatric records that listed previous suicide attempts by her son.  She also talked to a psychologist at the jail who, in turn, told Echols of these previous suicide attempts.
<P>
	Two weeks after the initial examination, Echols renewed the same prescriptions without examining Todd Husted or his medical records.  Six days later, Husted committed suicide.  A test of his blood at that time showed no measurable content of lithium. 
<P>
	"Deceased committed suicide while in a psychotic state because of the lack of medication in his blood.  Defendant [Echols] had no idea of whether deceased was taking the prescribed medications because he never saw any blood test results," said the Tennessee Appeals Court, which overturned a directed verdict for Echols and the dismissal of Husted's wrongful death suit against him. It ordered a jury trial of the suit.
<P>
	NAMI/TAMI submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the appeal.  "The circumstances of this case raise serious questions about whether Dr. Echols' treatment of Todd Husted while in the metro jail complied with minimally acceptable professional standards."  They argued that Echols' failure to review materials sent by the prisoner's mother, "including the extensive records of past hospitalizations," and the "virtual lack of follow-up after the initial evaluation" were a breach of duty to provide minimal adequate care.
<P>
	"Amici assert that the failure of [Dr. Echols] to identify Todd Husted as suicidal was due to his lack of follow-up in this case, coupled with his failure to review the extensive past records provided and his failure to return the repeated calls placed to him by Plaintiff/Appellant June Husted," NAMI/TAMI said.  
<P>
	"The tragic death of Todd Husted, an individual suffering from schizophrenia, a severe brain disorder could have been prevented with appropriate psychiatric treatment during his incarceration in the Nashville Metro Jail."  The NAMI/TAMI brief cited case law and national standards to show that "The standard of care required of a physician who treats patients in correctional facilities is the same as that of the average, competent physician in the community."

<A NAME = "medic"><H2>MEDICAID LEXICON</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>

<P>

NOTE:  The following is a primer-like list of terms descriptive of the structure and operation of the Medicaid program.  It is not intended to be an exhaustive list, but simply to be helpful to NAMI members trying to understand changes that may be proposed for the Medicaid program in their states.

<P>

Medicaid - is the state-federal public program of medical insurance for certain low income persons.  It is embodied in Title XIX of the Social Security Act, also commonly called "medical assistance."  Medicaid is primarily a state program.

<P>

Eligibility - is the status of qualifying or not qualifying for a program.  Medicaid has its own set of rules that determine, state-by-state, whether an individual qualifies for enrollment and coverage.

<P>

Means Test - is the comparison of the program's maximum allowable financial thresholds for income and assets to the individual applicant's financial status.  Some public programs--like Medicare--do not require the application of a means test.

<P>

Recipient - is the term used to identify a person currently eligible to participate in Medicaid.  It is commonly used in social welfare programs that have a means test.

<P>

Beneficiary - is the term used to identify a person currently eligible to participate in the social insurance programs that do not use means tests (like Medicare, Part A and SSDI).

<P>

Categorical - is a term used to describe eligibility in the Medicaid context.  It refers to persons who are certified eligible by class, or "category," rather than individually.   It occurs when individually passing the entry requirements and being enrolled in one program automatically qualifies the recipient for another program. 

<P>

SSDI beneficiaries are categorically eligible for Medicare after 24 months; SSI recipients are categorically eligible for Medicaid in most states; Medicare beneficiaries with income below the poverty line and assets at twice the SSI threshold are categorically eligible for Medicaid.

<P>

Mandatory - is the term that applies to both populations and services that federal law says must be included in a state's Medicaid program as conditions of participation.  Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients have to be enrolled for Medicaid because they are categorically eligible.

<P>

Health Care Financing Administration - is a principal operating agency--like the Public Health Service, the Social Security Administration (until March 1995), the Administration on Aging, and the Administration for Children and Families--of the federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  HCFA has responsibility for Medicare and Medicaid.

<P>

Federal Financial Participation - is the payment the federal government will make to a state as its share of the cost--at least half--for services to recipients.  These payments are referred to as ffp.

<P>

Federal Medical Assistance Percentage - is the precise percentage of costs for services that the federal government will pay.  The fmap formula involves a ratio of per capita state income to national per capita income.  It is recalibrated annually using a rolling three-year average.  A few hundredths of an fmap percentage loss can mean tens of millions of dollars to large states.

<P>

State Matching Requirement - is the percentage of the cost of services that the state must pay. It is the inverse of the fmap.  If, for  example, the federal government, by current-year formula, is paying 58.18 percent of costs (Kansas, 1993) the state is obligated to pay 41.82%

<P>

State Plan - is the quasi-contractual document required for participation.  It is the basis of the agreement between the levels of government.  HCFA receives and reviews the state plan.

<P>

State Plan Amendment - is a modification to a state plan to add or delete provisions that are within the state's allowable flexibility.  The state plan may be amended annually.  "Optional services," for instance, can be added at a state's initiative, or "amount, duration, and scope" of mandatory services could be expanded or contracted--and HCFA must approve. 

<P>

Covered Services - are the medical and other services to beneficiaries for which Medicaid will pay.  These are classified as mandatory or optional.  In either class, each service must be named in law or regulation to qualify for ffp.  Mandatory services include broad, generic descriptors like "inpatient and outpatient hospital services, nursing facility services for adults, physicians' services, laboratory and X-ray services."  (See below for optional services.)

<P>

Optional Services - are those services named in federal law or regulation which a state may include in its Medicaid program and the federal government will share costs.  Optional services include "IMD's (fewer than 16 beds only), targeted case management, psychosocial rehabilitation, clinic services, prescription drugs."

<P>

Provider - means any person, organization, or institution that may render services and be reimbursed (or pre-paid) by Medicaid.  He, she, or it must be an allowable deliverer of services under state law and/or certification and licensing regulations.  Examples include hospitals, nursing facilities, HMOs, physicians, laboratories, nurse practitioners, and physicians assistants.

<P>

Institution for Mental Disease - is a facility with more than 16 beds in which the patient census reveals a primary diagnosis at admission of mental illness in more than 50 percent of the residents.  Abbreviated IMD, such facilities are precluded from Medicaid participation (the enforcement provision is the withholding of ffp), except for recipients over 65 years of age.

<P>

Drug Formulary - is a list of prescription medications for which a state Medicaid program agrees to reimburse.  Drugs not on the list are not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement.  Getting new drugs on a formulary may be difficult.

<P>

Waiver - is a provision in federal law that allows the responsible executive branch department of HHS or HCFA to permit--under safeguards around beneficiaries--a program design that does not comply with all normal requirements of federal law.   

<P>

Section 1115 Waiver - is a provision permitting operation outside of normal compliance that is named for the section of the law that authorizes demonstration exceptions.  Section 1115 has usually required rigorous research and evaluation designs, time limits, and no greater cost in ffp than otherwise would have been incurred.

<P>

Home & Community-based Waiver - is a provision [section 1915 (c)] permitting operation outside of normal compliance.  It was created as an alternative to institutional care.  Persons who would otherwise need institutional care may choose between that and community-based care. 

<P>

Certain non-medical services otherwise not eligible for Medicaid reimbursement are allowed under 1915 (c).  Th number of persons who may be served by such a waiver ("slots") for beneficiaries is limited by relationship to nursing facility beds that are or were really available as the alternative.

<P>

Freedom-of-choice Waiver - is an allowed departure [section 1915 (b)] from usual program operation that restricts choice of provider.  Normal operation allows recipients full choice of participating providers.  However, the stable funding requirement for a capitated system like an HMO precludes the option of choosing another system within the contract year.

<P>

Capitated Contract - is a legal arrangement whereby, instead of permitting fee-for-service arrangements, a state institutes the prepayment of a monthly fee to a provider network.  Such networks must include hospital, pharmacy, laboratory, and treatment professionals.  The network is then at risk for additional costs if necessary to deliver appropriate services to all enrollees.

<P>

Carve-out - is a program delivery and financing design wherein a state arranges services for a certain population (like persons with severe and persistent mental illness) through a distinct and separate component(s).  This is typically worked out through separate contracting (or subcontracting) for services to the special population.

<P>

Rodent pelts stored in museums since the late 1800s provide the first evidence that Lyme disease (borrelia burgdorferi) caused by tick bites has been around in the U.S. for at least 100 years.  This disease, which is rapidly increasing in certain areas, has been shown to have neuropsychiatric manifestations in a paper by Brain A. Fallon, M.D., et al, titled "The Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of Lyme Borreliosis."  The study can be obtained from Morris Area Lyme Support, P.O.Box 1483, Morristown, NJ 07960.  201/267-4251.

<H2>The Development of the Future: A Better Way</H2>

<H4>E Pluribus Unum</H4>

<I>by Clarence J. Sundram, chairman, New York State Commission on 
Quality of Care for the Mentally Disabled</I>
<HR>

	On May 1, we celebrate Law Day in this country.  This year, 
the American Bar Association selected as a theme for Law Day 
activities "E Pluribus Unum," the Latin phrase we see on our 
currency that means "Out of many, one."  As I reflected on this 
theme, it occurred to me that this motto has application as well to 
the field of mental health.
<P>
	For the past twenty years, I have been involved with mental 
health services as a counsel to the governor of New York, as the 
head of the oversight agency, as the administrator of the 
protection and advocacy system for New York, and as a court monitor 
and expert witness in class action lawsuits in several states.  For 
all of that time, the mental health community has been fragmented 
and as lacking in cohesion as the mental health system itself.  
Institutional providers disparage the work of community agencies 
that reject challenging clients; community agencies dismiss the 
role that institutions have played and continue to play; state 
agencies and local governments squabble over which of them is 
evading responsibility for the care of vulnerable citizens; private 
providers and governmental providers argue over the relative value 
of their services; families decry the unresponsiveness of service 
providers in an hour of need and urge easier access to services; 
primary consumers rail against the pervasive coercion of the mental 
health system and give compelling testimony of the harm they have 
suffered at its hands.  And so on.
<P>
	From my vantage point, there is a kernel of legitimacy to all 
of these claims, but the vehemence with which they are pressed 
emphasizes the disagreements and dissonance among the various 
constituency groups and gives scant voice to areas of agreement.  
Legislators and policy makers, who respond most effectively when 
they hear constituency groups speak with one voice, instead hear a 
Tower of Babel.
<P>
	This point came to me powerfully two weeks ago while attending 
a conference in New York City on "The Carey Years" that reviewed 
the governorship of Hugh L. Carey from 1975-1982.  A member of the 
audience at a panel discussion on human services noted that one of 
Governor Carey's most notable accomplishments was signing the 
Willowbrook Consent Decree, which ended litigation over the 
wretched conditions in an institution that once housed more than 
5,000 people with mental retardation.  In the ensuing years, the 
state transformed the service system for mental retardation, 
spending tens of millions of dollars to replace institutions with 
an array of community residences and day programs.  Why, he asked, 
had the Governor not done the same for the mentally ill?
<P>
	A panelist responded that early in his administration Governor 
Carey had appointed a widely representative 36-member task force to 
advise him on mental health issues.  But instead of speaking with a 
single voice, he said (with some exaggeration, I suspect) the task 
force came back with 36 opinions, ensuring that nothing would be 
done.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>(T)here is no dearth of profound challenges that could keep us all 
constructively occupied in improving a shameful history of 
treatment of persons with mental illness.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	If there is a single overarching challenge for the future of 
the American mental health care system, it is to learn to build 
consensus where there are broad areas of agreement about what needs 
to be done and to rid ourselves of the bad habit of focusing upon 
and magnifying the areas where there is disagreement.
<P>
	Despite the modest progress that has been made in recent 
years, there is much that is fundamentally wrong with mental health 
services in most parts of this country.  A few of the most glaring 
include:
<P>
		Thousands of citizens are locked away in psychiatric 
institutions long after there is any demonstrable 
clinical need for hospitalization, even in the opinion 
of the hospital staff.  They live in conditions of daily 
indignity that robs them of privacy and a sense of 
personal identity and segregates them from the rest of 
society, often with little constructive activity.  Many 
spend weeks and months with less access to the outdoors 
for fresh air and exercise than is afforded to convicted 
criminals in prisons.  Scientific advances in the 
treatment of persons with mental illness are painfully 
slow in trickling down to the institutions that confine 
them.
<P>
		Thousands more, who have been discharged from 
psychiatric institutions, live in conditions of 
unspeakable neglect in boarding homes, shelters, or in 
the streets of our communities.
<P>
		Despite the billions of dollars spent annually on mental 
health services, both consumers and families often find 
services unavailable in a time of need or unresponsive 
to their concerns.
<P>
		Patients with mental illness are unique among all 
patients in lacking the protection of informed consent 
to treatment, and they are the only group of citizens 
who can be volunteered by others for participation in 
experimental treatment that is of no direct benefit to 
them.
<P>
		While there is broad acceptance of the principle of 
patient participation in treatment planning and of the 
value of family involvement, practices are often widely 
at odds with this.
<P>
	My point is not that any or all of the proceeding problems are 
the ones around which all the mental health constituencies should 
galvanize their advocacy efforts (although that would not be a bad 
idea).  Rather, it is that there is no dearth of profound 
challenges that could keep us all constructively occupied in 
improving a shameful history of treatment of persons with mental 
illness.  The key to effective advocacy is for all of us to learn 
to speak in harmony rather than in dissonant voices.  This may 
require that we each truly listen to one another's points of view 
about potential solutions and be willing to forego the "solos" for 
a stronger chorus of effective advocacy.  When we have done so, we 
will be able to accomplish dramatic changes.  The recent passage in 
New York of a community reinvestment law that transfers a portion 
of the funds saved by closing institutions to localities for 
community services and that targets another portion for the care of 
the homeless mentally ill is an example of what cohesive advocacy 
efforts can achieve when the many voices speak as one.
<P>	E pluribus unum.

<A NAME = "bills"><H2>BILLS LIMITING SSI, SSDI NOW LAW</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
In the July/August issue of the NAMI ADVOCATE, we reported on two pieces of legislation being considered by Congress to limit SSI and SSDI benefits for certain categories of individuals ("Bills Limit SSI/SSDI Benefits"). Since then, both bills have been passed and signed into law.  This article provides further details about these two legislative initiatives.
<P>
Under existing law, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits are suspended for convicted felons confined in jails, prisons, or other penal institutions. Public Law 103-387, the Social Security Domestic Reform Act of 1994, includes provisions expanding suspension of SSDI benefits to three additional categories of people confined in institutions at public expense.
<P>
1. Individuals found guilty but mentally ill. (As a practical matter, benefits for individuals in this category were probably already suspended under the existing law.)  
<P>
2. Individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity.
<P>
3. Individuals determined as incompetent to stand trial under allegation of an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than one year.
<P>
The legislation is silent on whether Medicare benefits are affected. However, a staff member of the committee in the House of Representatives (which sponsored the bill) states that these benefits will not be affected.
<P>
The existing law contained an exception for people "actively and satisfactorily participating in a rehabilitation program" that is likely to lead to employment after release.  This exception was omitted from this year's amendments.  However, we have been informed that this omission was inadvertent and the exception will be added in the form of technical amendments when the new Congress re-convenes.  We will monitor this closely.
<P>
NAMI is exploring with other advocacy groups the possibility of a legal challenge to the amendments.  Lawsuits in the past that have challenged suspension of benefits for convicted felons have been unsuccessful.  However, it is NAMI's position that those cases don't apply because people found not guilty by reason of insanity or not competent to stand trial have never been convicted of crimes. 
<P>
People found not competent to stand trial have never even been tried on the charges against them.  Nevertheless, it may be difficult to mount a legal challenge, particularly because the current climate is so negative towards those who are perceived as having engaged in criminal activity.
<P>
Because we want to track the impact that this legislation will have, we encourage anyone directly affected (or their families) to send information to the NAMI Office of Legal Affairs. 
<P>
The second bill reported on in the July/August NAMI ADVOCATE concerned limitations on SSI and SSDI benefits for individuals whose alcoholism or drug abuse is a contributing factor to their disability.  The final version of this legislation clarified that these limitations would apply only to people whose eligibility for benefits were "based materially on alcoholism or drug addiction." 
<P>
According to the Social Security Administration (SSA), material in this context means that the person would not be found disabled without considering his/her drug addiction or alcoholism. 
<P>
Based on this description, an individual whose mental illness is sufficiently severe to qualify for these benefits will not be affected. However, individuals whose eligibility for benefits is based on both diagnoses (where the mental illness, in and of itself, would not necessarily establish eligibility) may be affected. 
<P>
The legislation specifies that affected individuals will be eligible to receive benefits for no more than 36 months.  However, any month where no appropriate treatment is available will not count against the 36-month limit. Individuals who do not comply with treatment requirements will be subject to suspension of their benefits for the period of time they do not comply.
<P>
Additionally, a series of "graduated sanctions" will be applied, whereby the first occurrence of treatment non-compliance will result in suspension of benefits for an additional two months, the second occurrence for an additional three months, and the third (and subsequent) occurrences for six additional months.  
<P>
Individuals whose benefits are suspended for twelve consecutive months will be terminated from the benefit roles.  The SSA is required to establish at least one referral and monitoring agency in each state to refer people for treatment and to monitor compliance. 
<P>
The legislation further specifies that payment of benefits to a representative payee will be required if eligibility is based materially on alcoholism or drug addiction.  Although professional organizational representative payees such as nonprofit social service agencies are preferred, the legislation states that "a family member or other entity may be selected if more appropriate."   Eligibility for Medicare and/or Medicaid will continue for so long as individuals remain disabled, even after termination of their SSI and SSDI benefits.

<P>
The following questions are a guide to evaluating important aspects of your community mental health and substance abuse care system.  
<P>
Does the public mental health service system have a set of articulated values, service principles, or a mission statement that guides the delivery of services?
<P>
Who governs the system policy?  A citizen board authorized by state law?  Are there consumer or family members on the board?  Who appoints citizens?
<P>
Is accountability easy to identify?
<P>
Does the system have a short- and long-term plan?
<P>
What portion of the local mental health and substance abuse budget comes from local taxes?  Is that similar to other communities in the state?  Do some communities contribute more than others?  Why?  Do rural areas fare poorly in local tax contributions?
<P>
Does the system have the following service components:  medication, emergency, inpatient, case management, day program, medical and dental, supported housing, work training and employment, recreational/social, and transportation? 
<P>
How does the public system coordinate with other local agencies such as jails, courts, police, social services, housing, and vocational rehabilitation?
<P>
Are services provided solely by local governments, or are some provided through contracts with local providers such as group homes?  How are contracts monitored?  Are competitive bids required?  How does the structure affect the quality of the service?
<P>
Because medication is so important to treating persons with mental illnesses, is there adequate access to medication?  Is medication given the priority it deserves within the system?  Are medication services integrated into other system components?
<P>
Are there waiting lists for services, and for which services?
<P>
Are priorities assigned to those being served; that is, are the more seriously ill given priority over the less ill?
<P>
Are services consumer-driven and client-centered (or are they fragmented)? 
<P>
Have consumer and family surveys been taken to rate services from the consumers' perspective?
<P>
Does the system involve consumers and families in treatment and rehabilitation programs and policy- and- program planning?
<P>
What services are available to children and adolescents, and are they coordinated?
<P>
If the local inpatient care is increasingly provided by the private sector, is there collaboration between the public systems and the inpatient facilities?  Are mental health center psychiatrists on call evenings and weekends for center clients in private hospitals?  Is the hospital staff burdened with on-call duties for center clients?  For non-center clients?
<P>
As state inpatient facilities are phased out, will the money allotted them follow patients into the community?  Will the state continue to be the primary source of funds for local care?  How illing is the community to accept responsibility for disabled citizens?  
<P>
Can incentives or disincentives for treatment in inpatient settings be identified in the local system?
<P>
Is discharge planning undertaken collaboratively by the system?  Are linkages between state and private hospitals and local mental health systems in place and functioning well?  Do they avoid homelessness?  (Many states require that local authorities may not relinquish their responsibilities to public clients in inpatient settings.)
<P>
Does the system have adequate data on service outcomes and unmet needs?  Does the system have information about how many need care but are unserved and about why they are unserved?  What happens to them?
<P>
Does the system take responsibility for all persons with serious mental illness and substance abuse, or just those who try to gain entry?
<P>
If the city or county has homeless people, has the service system accepted some responsibility for them, or has little progress been made to get those who are mentally ill into treatment and rehabilitation?
<P>
Is there enough local advocacy to ensure a quality community mental health and substance abuse service program?
<P>

<A NAME = "facts"><H2>FACTS ABOUT HIV AND AIDS</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
The following provides some answers to frequently asked questions about HIV and AIDS.  Dr. Cournos if from Columbia University. 
<P>
What is HIV?
<P>
HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus, the bloodborne virus that causes AIDS.  The virus makes people sick by attacking certain white blood cells that normally fight infection in healthy people.
<P>
What is AIDS?
<P>
AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.  AIDS is the most advanced form of HIV infection, a fatal illness that may develop months, or more commonly, years after HIV infection.  AIDS is a disease in which the body's immune system for fighting diseases is weakened and becomes less able to protect a person from infections and cancer.  At present, there is no cure for AIDS, and no vaccine to prevent it.
<P>
What are the symptoms of HIV infection and AIDS?
<P>
In the early stage of infection, a person may have no symptoms at all.  This stage may last for many years during which a person looks and feels healthy.  Eventually, however, the immune system deteriorates.  Usually this deterioration is measured by a decrease in the number of white blood cells known as CD-4 lymphocytes.  Medical problems begin to develop, becoming more severe as time goes on.  Swollen lymph glands, fatigue, and weight loss may occur.  Unusual rashes may appear on the skin or mucous membranes.
<P>
AIDS can affect most parts of the body, including the brain and nervous system, the kidneys, and the lungs.  The diagnosis of AIDS is based upon the presence of HIV infection and an AIDS-defining illness.  These illnesses include certain forms of cancer, such as Kaposi's sarcoma, certain types of infection such as pneumocystis carinii pneumonia or tuberculosis, an organic mental syndrome known as HIV encephalopathy (or AIDS dementia), or a severe reduction of CD-4 lymphocytes.
<P>
Why should people with mental illness be particularly concerned about HIV?
<P>
Evidence has been growing that HIV is spreading among people with serious mental illness.  In New York City, studies of HIV infection rates among psychiatric inpatients show rates between 4 percent and 23 percent.  Women are as likely to be infected as men.  In New York City, women admitted to psychiatric hospitals have many times the rate of HIV infection as the general population of women delivering babies or having abortions.
<P>
How does HIV infection occur?
<P>
HIV is only spread in very specific ways:
<P>
By having unprotected sexual intercourse--either anal or vaginal--with a partner who is HIV infected.  Oral intercourse can sometimes spread infection, too.
<P>
By sharing needles or syringes (such as during injection drug use) with someone who has HIV infection.
<P>
When an HIV-infected woman passes HIV on to her child during pregnancy, birth, or nursing.
<P>
What about blood transfusions?
<P>
HIV can be acquired by receiving blood, blood products, or an organ donation from an infected person.  But this type of spread is very unlikely in the United States because careful screening since 1985 has largely eliminated the use of HIV-infected human products.  You cannot get HIV from donating blood or body tissue.
<P>
Can HIV be spread by casual contact?
<P>
No.  HIV is not spread by hugging or dry kissing someone with HIV, by sharing food or utensils, or by being in the same room with an infected person.  HIV is not spread by mosquito bites or any other insect bites, or by toilet seats.
<P>
How do people with serious mental illness become infected with HIV?
<P>
HIV spreads among people with serious mental illness in the same way as it does in the general population, but there are some particular ways in which mental illness is associated with HIV-related risk behavior.
<P>
Studies show that people with serious mental illness have high rates of alcohol and substance use.  Use of substances increases risk for HIV in two ways--directly, when people share needles to inject drugs; and indirectly, because drug use is associated with unsafe sexual activity.
<P>
Sex with multiple partners, exposure to infected sexual and needle-sharing partners, exchanging sex for money or goods, and not using condoms during sex with either men or women increase the risk for HIV infection among people with serious mental illness.
<P>
How can people protect themselves from HIV infection?
<P>
You can avoid becoming infected with HIV, or infecting someone else, if you:
<P>
Recognize that you are at risk:  Anyone can get HIV infection.  Be honest with yourself.  If you engage in risky behavior, you could get infected.
<P>
Don't shoot drugs:  Get help if you have this problem.  If you can't stop yourself, avoid sharing needles or syringes--even with people you know well.  If you must use injection equipment after someone else has used it, clean it first.  Rinse all equipment twice with undiluted household bleach, and then rinse twice with water before each use.  Never shoot bleach.
<P>
Reduce your sexual risk:  Limit your number of sexual partners, and learn to ask them questions about their past behavior.  People who injected drugs at any time since 1978, those who have had unprotected sex with other people since that time, and those who received blood transfusions between 1978 and 1985 are among the people who may be infected with HIV.  Protect yourself by insisting on having safer sex--regardless of your partner's answers.  People are not always truthful about their past, so don't put yourself at risk based on what you're told.
<P>
Always use latex condoms ("rubbers") during oral, vaginal, and anal intercourse:  Although not 100 percent effective, if used properly condoms also help prevent the spread of other sexually transmitted diseases such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and herpes.  During vaginal and anal intercourse, use a spermicide that contains nonoxynol-9 with the condom (never alone) to further reduce the chance of getting HIV infection. 
<P>
Be sure the condoms you use are not damaged and are not too old.  You can check the package for the expiration date.  Do not use animal skin condoms, since they do not protect against HIV infection.  Do not use oil-based lubricants, such as vaseline, because they can damage condoms.
<P>
Learn how to talk to your partner about using condoms.  Be prepared to deal with negative attitudes such as "Condoms ruin the mood for sex," "People who use condoms don't trust each other," etc.  Learn to be assertive with sexual partners.  Postpone having sex if your partner refuses to use a condom.
<P>
If you are in a treatment program, talk to staff about how to obtain condoms.  You have the right to be able to protect yourself in any setting, including a long-term hospital or residential program.
<P>
Keep in mind that you can get sexual pleasure in ways that do not expose you to the risk of HIV infection.  These include dry kissing, touching, massage, and watching romantic or sexy movies.  Abstinence is also a legitimate choice of lifestyle.
<P>
Avoid the use of alcohol or illicit drugs during sex.  Being drunk or high can affect your judgment and interfere with acting safely.
<P>
How is HIV infection diagnosed?
<P>
The most common method of diagnosing HIV infection is a simple blood test that checks for the presence of antibodies to HIV.  The presence of antibodies means that the body has been exposed to HIV and the immune system is producing chemicals in an attempt to fight the infection.
<P>
There are two parts to the HIV blood test:  the EIA (Enzyme Immunoassay) and the Western Blot.  When both parts of the test are positive, it is pretty certain that HIV infection has occurred.
<P>
Who should take the HIV antibody test?
<P>
People who have engaged in HIV-related risk behavior should think seriously about being tested.  These include men who have had sex with other men; injection drug users; those who received of blood or blood products between 1978 and 1985; male and female sexual partners of any of these people; women who are considering pregnancy who have engaged in risk behavior or whose sexual partners are at-risk. 
<P>
Those being treated for STDs; those being evaluated for medical, psychiatric, or neurological illness that may be HIV-related; heterosexual men and women who have had multiple partners whose HIV status is unknown; previously tested HIV-negative individuals who continue to practice risk behavior; immigrants from countries where there is a high rate of HIV infection. 
<P>
Before taking the test, be sure to find out who will know your test results.  Many states have laws that protect the confidentiality of people who have the HIV antibody test.  Find out what the laws are in your state.  And be sure that you will receive pre- and post-test counseling.
<P>
What are the advantages of learning if you are HIV infected?
<P>
Everybody hopes their HIV antibody test will be negative.  For people with a positive antibody test, certain helpful steps can be taken, including:
<P>
You can seek good medical attention.
<P>
You can let your sexual or needle-sharing partners know of your infection and encourage them to get tested.
<P>
You can be extra careful about not passing the infection on to others.
<P>
You can improve your nutrition and take other steps to maintain your general health.
<P>
You can seek advice if you are considering having a baby, and, if you are pregnant, take medication that reduces the chance that your baby will be infected.
<P>
You may be eligible for special programs or benefits.
<P>
What are the disadvantages?
<P>
There are some problems that may result from learning that you are HIV positive:
<P>
You will probably suffer emotional distress if the result is positive.
<P>
You could experience discrimination if someone learns of your test result who is afraid of HIV or doesn't realize that people with HIV infection are protected by federal anti-discrimination laws.
<P>
What steps should you take if you are HIV positive?
<P>
Get advice from a counselor or a mental health professional whom you trust.  Infection with HIV is too complicated to manage by yourself.
<P>
Be optimistic.  Many people stay well for a long time, or have episodes of illness that respond well to treatment.  There are many helpful medications to slow the course of illness or prevent infections, such as AZT, DDI, and pentamidine, and researchers are constantly working on developing new treatments.
<P>
Locate a good doctor, or a hospital or clinic where staff are knowledgeable about HIV.  This will improve your chances of receiving careful monitoring and proper medical care.
<P>
Only inform people about your HIV status if they need to know--your sexual partner, for example.  Be careful about telling strangers, co-workers, landlords, or other people who could discriminate against you.  If you are discriminated against, learn the city, state, and federal agencies that you can appeal to.
<P>
Follow all the precautions suggested above to insure that you do not spread the infection to others.
<P>
Take good care of yourself, eat well, and exercise.

<P>
We have learned so much, we have come so far, and so much is at risk.  Our movement's parents and clients have become our leaders.  Our effective capability is leaping forward.  Community supports, PACT model outreach teams, employment, self-help, and low-side-effect medications show terrific outcomes for a new generation of positive engagement and personal success. 
<P>
As one state system, New Hampshire has neared the point at which we can say our adult services are of high quality, adequate supply, and strongly valued by clients and community.  Our children's services are still growing, and our elder supports have begun to show their potential.  While we have miles to go, this is a very positive place for all of our partners in the NH system.
<P>
We have shown we can work together--locally planning and providing; at state levels, advocating, leading, and supporting; and at national levels, working as never before in successful coalitions.  We have gained recognition of the necessity of mental health parity.  In NH our clients work.  Thirty percent of the citizens with severe mental illnesses are competitively employed.  In our most successful regions we are reaching sixty percent employed. 
<P>
Our clients are becoming drug- and alcohol-free.  For our clients who had been most severely ill and dully diagnosed, this has been an intensive four-year recovery process.  Personal and social gains of partners and friends, creative expression, and the experience of enjoying everyday life are within reach of all but a few clients.  (About 40 of our clients remain seriously ill and involuntarily committed.)  We have shown we can change the experience of being mentally ill from outcast to participant.
<P>
Still, intense poverty and stigma is ubiquitous.  Income-assistance rules are a major disincentive to working sufficient hours to escape very low income status.  Ignorance and fear of disabilities remains the basic cultural myth.  And our children remain at very high risk of extreme stress and misunderstanding when they experience their first episodes of significant emotional disturbance.
<P>
Too few magic bullets will appear in our next decade.  Advances in services research and in clinical care will continue, but in the face of increasing poverty, community disintegration, and toxic street drugs.  At a time when resources are becoming even more scarce, persons with mental illness are at extreme risk.  Just when we know so much more, it will become so much harder to actually make that support available.
<P>
A new deployment of our resources must respond to this changing reality.  Competitive employment, with needed supports, must become a foundation stone for therapeutic outcomes as well as for survival.  Living supports emphasizing dual diagnosis-oriented group and individual housing must be a stabilizing force.  Partial hospitalization should be scaled back in favor of recovery supports, such as client-run drop-in centers, self-help treatment centers, education and arts centers. 
<P>
Early, rapid stabilization of symptoms and outreach to uninvolved consumers must be the rule.  In the areas of our greatest social disintegration, an aggressive, shelter and transitional support with strong substance abuse orientation within the mental health system must be the front lines of our effort.
<P>
Today our country finds itself at a watershed in its philosophy of government.  The new national majority is redrawing the road map that for good and for bad was directing our movements in providing care.  In New Hampshire we have experienced a strong Republican majority for decades. 
<P>
Our experience has been that a commitment to persons with serious mental illness is not only politically possible, but it can be the basis for a progressive policy of independence, with support, and a strong accountability for assuring responsibility for those most in need.  Many paths can be taken to effective service-delivery systems.  We all must use this time as an opportunity to restate our vision of where we must go.  This must be our first agenda.
<P>
Certain formulas will prove true in meeting needs in this time of scarcity.  The coalition of strong families, clients, providers, advocates, and administrative leaders is the essential nucleus for the formation of our vision and our strategy.  Local political support--established through each local NAMI chapter, each mental health center, each drop-in center--is the foundation for all policy support for the public mental health system and the people it serves.  This local political organizing must be our second agenda.
<P>
To achieve this local organizing catalyst, we must actually design our service systems not only along efficiency lines such as managed care principles, but more importantly on the principles of community ownership of support and community integration.  We must be careful to not confuse our management tools such as efficient, "managed care" with our values and strategic vision.  Family and client organizing must be supported in local "caring and sharing" and also in informed political action.
<P>
We must respond to the strong consumer demand for self-help.  Consumer organizing and consumer ownership of service provision, especially including new "professional" roles, is vital.  Consumer governance of services such as "cooperative businesses" and board roles is essential.  We must work to be supportive of larger coalitions of such groups as anti-poverty advocates and community policing groups.
<P>
As we face this ongoing challenge of values and vision in a rapidly changing, increasingly shrill competition for resources, we must look to each other for a welcomed coalition of support and 
sustenance amidst this hostile and battering world.

<H2>National Depression Screening Day (NDSD):  October 10, 1996</H2>
<hr>


	National Depression Screening Day (NDSD)--October 10, 1996--has attracted more than 250,000 people over the last five years.  It is a national outreach program designed to educate people about the signs, symptoms, and treatments of depression and connect those in need with professionals who can help.  Part of the program's central message is that treatment is effective for this common medical disorder.  
<P>
	NAMI continues to cosponsor NDSD in 1996.  Local affiliates are working to ensure that screening sites will be available in every community and that the program is well publicized locally.  NAMI members interested in supporting NDSD should contact their local affiliate to learn about what activities are being organized in their communities.
<P>
	To locate the closest screening site, call the toll-free NDSD Site Locator Line at 1-888/805-1000 beginning September 9.  All screenings are free and anonymous.  According to a recent survey of NDSD participants, nearly 60 percent of those referred for treatment follow through and visit a clinician.

<A NAME = "wvcas"><H2>WV CASE NIXES DISCRIMINATION</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
A state court in West Virginia has determined that the West Virginia Public Employees Benefit Plan discriminates against people with mental illness by covering psychiatric treatment at levels lower than traditional medical treatment. 
<P>
The case was brought by the wife of a state employee after the plan refused to pay her bills for inpatient and outpatient psychiatric treatment.  When ordering the plan to reimburse her, the Court characterized as discriminatory a state law limiting coverage for psychiatric treatment. "This Court finds no rational basis and no compelling reason to make a distinction between services of a physician treating mental illness and services of a physician treating any physical illness." 
<P>
This decision adds to several cases around the country successfully challenging lower coverage in health insurance policies of neurobiological brain disorders (severe mental illnesses) than other medical disorders. However, this case is unique in that it is the first decision that characterizes lower coverage of these disorders as discriminatory. 
<P>
Previous successful challenges were limited to circumstances in which insurance policies failed to define specifically what was meant by "mental illness" or "psychiatric disorders."  For example, in Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield v. Doe, a father challenged limits placed on coverage of his daughter's bipolar disorder. Although the policy included benefits for "mental, psychiatric or nervous conditions," it failed to provide a specific definition of what these conditions were.
<P>
Citing scientific evidence of the biological basis of manic-depressive illness, the court characterized this illness as physical in origin rather than a "mental, psychiatric or nervous condition." It therefore ordered that the daughter's treatment for bipolar disorder must be covered at the same level as all other physical disorders. 
<P>
However, the impact of the Doe decision and several others like it was minimal because insurance companies could evade long-term compliance with these rulings simply by changing their policies to include a specific definition of "mental, psychiatric or nervous conditions."  This, in fact, is what happened after these decisions were handed down. 
<P>
The decision in the West Virginia case is potentially more significant because it characterizes lower coverage of severe mental illness as discrimination.  Therefore, the West Virginia Employees Benefits Plan cannot escape compliance simply by altering the language of its health insurance policy. 
<P>
In a letter to the judge who handed down the decision, Carolyn Nelson, executive director of the West Virginia AMI, characterized the decision as "an important milestone in the fight for justice and fairness to those...West Virginia families who will be touched by mental illness this year."  
<P>
The State of West Virginia is expected to appeal, seeking reversal of the circuit court's decision.

<A NAME = "forec"><H2>FORECAST FOR '95: MORE MANAGED CARE</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
At the NAMI convention last July, it was reported by the incoming president of the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors that 44 states were in some stage of modifying their Medicaid programs through use of managed care.  When the newly elected legislators and governors take office in all but two states in January 1995, they will return to this Medicaid agenda.
<P>
Managed care almost always means that an HMO-like provider assumes the financial risk for treatment of an enrolled population in exchange for a monthly fee per person enrolled, or capitation payments.  Capitation contrasts with fee-for-service reimbursement, in which the insurer--in this case Medicaid--is at risk.
<P>
This shift in who is at risk is the incentive for states to convert their Medicaid programs, in whole or in part, to capitated arrangements.  For families and consumers to interact effectively with the development and implementation of such systems, a whole new set of guidelines must be learned. 
<P>
NAMI families and consumers have mastered participation in the PL 99-660 planning councils and have effectively advocated for the amendment of their state Medicaid plans to include the optional services most helpful to persons with severe and persistent mental illness.  Becoming involved early and effectively in the conversion of fee-for-service Medicaid to capitated managed care models, however, requires significantly different knowledge.  
<P>
The basis of the agreement between state government and the healthcare provider organization bidding for the capitated business is a contract.  The individual states' requirements governing contracts with private-sector entities must be learned.  They almost certainly involve due posting of public notice in a state's official register and elsewhere. 
<P>
Identifying the contracting authority, obtaining the bid specifications, entering into dialogue with the Legislative Committees of jurisdiction, and establishing a relationship with the State Mental Health authority and the Medicaid authority are all preliminary data-gathering steps.  They are preparatory to making an evaluation and recommendations.
<P>
The following is a rudimentary checklist against which managed care proposals may be critiqued.  These suggestions are by no means exhaustive.  They are simply a means to further discussion.
<P>
1. Sufficient financing - All parties must be reminded that our people are already ill and disabled.  They are heavy users of services.  Taking over the care of such a population will clearly fail if the financing is insufficient.
<P>
2. Commitment to non-medical services that work - Managed care bidders who have dealt with primarily workforce-related populations may not understand--or be prepared to deliver--services like intensive case management and psychosocial rehabilitation necessary to our populations.
<P>
3. Selecting a managed care contractor - Family members and consumers must be integral participants in the development of selection criteria and in the actual selection of a managed care contractor.  Selection criteria should include:
<P>
Evaluation of professional staff involved in the decision-making for individual cases.  Decisions in cases involving severe mental illness should be made by psychiatrists and other mental illness professionals with specific training and experience working with these individuals.  
<P>
Evaluation of criteria for decision-making in individual cases. These criteria should reflect the contractor's concern with quality care and positive outcomes and should also incorporate planning for future care.  (For example, simple discharge is inadequate.  It must incorporate pro-active planning for the comprehensive needs of individuals in the community after discharge.) 
<P>
Mechanisms for consultation and for obtaining second opinions in appropriate cases, including those in which the consumer and/or his or her family request a second opinion.
<P>
Procedures for appeal and administrative review in accordance with existing professional standards, state and federal laws, and recognized best practices.  Administrative-review panels must be comprised of individuals not employed by the managed care provider and not involved in the treatment, which includes family members and consumers. 
<P>
An extensive program-evaluation component that provides longitudinal assessment of individual outcomes.  This evaluation should not be conducted by the program itself, but by outside evaluators such as academics, family members, and consumers. 
<P>
4.  Statewide advocacy ombudspersons must be established to represent the interests of consumers and family members who disagree with decisions made by managed care organizations (MCOs).  These individuals and the organizations they work for must be independent of all MCOs and state agencies with a direct interest in the outcomes of these disputes.  Yet they must also have stable and ongoing financing. 
<P>
5.  Required annual reviews.  SMHAs and state Medicaid agencies with responsibility for selecting MCOs should conduct annual reviews of the companies that are awarded contracts.  These reviews should include public hearings and other opportunities for interested parties to comment in writing or in person.  Advocacy ombudspersons and individuals or organizations responsible for program evaluation should be consulted as well.

<A NAME = "theim"><H2>THE IMPACT OF MANAGED CARE</H2></A><A HREF = "#top">[Return to Top]</A><br>
<P>
For most of the past decade, members of NAMI at state, local, and national levels have worked hard to improve services delivered through our public mental health system.  We recognized early that users of the mental health system--that is, consumers and their families--are in the real sense the only customers.  
<P>
Our long history of advocacy to improve services has created new attitudes and new respect in the public sector.  Bureaucrats have learned to listen to what families and consumers want and have moved to create policies and programs that respond to the full range of service needs. 
<P>
We've applauded the innovations that have come in many systems as a result of our advocacy, and we've looked to state legislatures to support our demands for priority resources for the most severely mental ill and disabled individuals. 
<P>
More recently we've pointed to the outcomes that can be achieved when comprehensive community support programs are in place.  More than 20 years of research on the PACT program in Madison, Wisconsin, has led to its enthusiastic introduction in a number of other states and communities.  
<P>
Now in the rapidly changing health care environment we meet a whole new set of players--especially with the apparent failure of federal healthcare reform.  A focus on the states is essential.  Indeed, in mental health care as in all major social change, the states are and have always been our true laboratories.  As we introduce ourselves to this new set of players coming largely from private sector experience, we need to determine the key messages with which to reach them.
<P>
First, we must recognize that managed care programs bring both opportunity and risk.  The opportunity includes the potential to use efficiencies learned in the private sector to control the escalating healthcare costs that are throwing many state's budgets into deficit. 
<P>
The opportunity to integrate public and private systems has long been a goal of our family movement.  Further, we hope to use the knowledge gained through research to achieve greater treatment efficacy.  Truly managing care, not just managing cost, must be our guiding principal.  
<P>
The real integration of the public and private sector includes an integration of providers, which may well bring a better trained set of professionals to meet the needs of our families.  Additionally, managed care integrated services delivered in a managed care setting that encompasses both public and private systems can markedly reduce stigma. 
<P>
Treatment outcomes should be improved, especially for those suffering from dual disorders of major mental illness and substance abuse.  We should expect to make our greatest impact on our most needy clients through a combination of resources managed efficiently.
<P>
Nonetheless, there are certainly grave risks.  Managed care companies with little or no experience dealing with serious mental illness have much to learn from the public sector.  Most important perhaps is the philosophy, the public health mission and mandate that underlies our state mental health authorities.  The mission is a lifetime commitment to accepting responsibility for the effective treatment and humane care for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness.  
<P>
Perhaps the most serious risks we face in this transition time are the continuing incentives to under-recognize, under-diagnose, and under-treat serious and persistent mental illness in systems that are still driven almost entirely by cost-containment. 
<P>
Further, the acute care model that has been the core of most managed care systems fails to recognize the comprehensive and long-term nature of services and treatments needed by persons with schizophrenia, manic depressive illness, and other severe mental disorders.  
<P>
Managed care companies tend to see themselves as having two essential customers: the patient and the payer.  Because they work on a contract basis and because the payer represents literally millions of dollars, these companies need to balance clinical measures of outcome with the ever-present desire for cost-containment. 
<P>
It is wise to remember that the key motivation for reform in all behavioral health care has been clear: a concern about controlling rapidly escalating costs and a need to exclude high-risk consumers.  Thus we face important challenges as we move to balance cost, quality, and access--the big three in any successful managed care system.  Quality and access are still controversial and difficult to measure, so cost remains the driving force.
<P>
As NAMI members become involved across the country in state-based reform, there are some key principals we must bring to the table.  First, we must insist that family members and consumers are directly involved in the design and development of new managed care systems.  We must be proactive, not reactive. 
<P>
We must be engaged from the very beginning with any successful contractor. We must insist that providers have experience working with seriously mentally ill individuals.  We must be sure that their key personnel understand the course and clinical management of persistent and episodic illnesses that may require both multimodule and long-term care from a multi-disciplinary treatment team.  
<P>
We must look for linkages between in-patient acute care, out-patient, and partial hospitalization programs as well as important bridges to housing, rehabilitation, and other vital community support services.  There must be clear mechanisms for clinical decision-making about treatment choices and rapid referral to specialty care.  And the retention of experienced psychiatrists is essential for our relatives.  
<P>
Published standards of care that involve consumers and families must be developed.  We must insist that individual treatment plans be written for each seriously mentally ill person, and those plans must be reviewed on a regular basis with the client and his or her family, as appropriate. 
<P>
Explicit criteria must be developed and applied in making individual case decisions, and regular assessment of the efficacy of both short- and long-term treatment interventions and services should be recorded.  The overall goal is to respect consumer choice, not just in words, but in the design and development of the program.  
<P>
All systems should devise a patient bill of rights and recognize that family members are not only valued partners in care, but often key members of the treatment team.  There must be clear mechanisms for achieving second opinions and encouragement of the use of expert consultation, especially in more complicated cases involving dual diagnosis of substance abuse and major mental illness. 
<P>
Care must be taken to note the presence of such problems as physical health disorders, a history of poor treatment adherence, or early signs of tardive dyskinesia.  Individuals with severe mental illness often complain that they are treated only from the neck up.  
<P>
The latest medications, including atypical antipsychotics such as Clozapine and Risperidone and the newer anti-depressants such as Prozac, Zoloft, and Effexor must be made available to all patients, to all consumers. 
<P>
These are the state of the art in psychiatric treatment, and if we are to achieve benefits from managed care that moves to merge public and private systems, we must insist that our family members get the best our science can bring us.  We also know that these medications generally have a relatively benign side-effect profile, which leads to better compliance and ultimately a greater ability to use and benefit from rehabilitation and social support services.
<P>
We need to insist that quality and outcomes be monitored and regularly reported as managed care systems move forward to replace our long-standing entitlement, but they must include the views of the families and consumers who are the primary customers.  Also, independent, announced, on-site visits and case reviews should be part of any true monitoring of standards and quality. 
<P>
There must be a published procedure for appeal of decisions and mechanisms for rapid administrative review in any disputes about treatment or services.  A strong internal program of evaluation of outcome measures must be matched by a commitment to longitudinal assessment as well as ongoing efforts to improve assess and strengthen outreach to underserved and difficult-to-engage populations.  
<P>
The state mental health authority and the Medicaid agency involved in the contracting should conduct an annual review of planned performance, goals, and objectives.  The reviews should include confidential interviews with a cross-sampling of providers, consumers, and their families regarding the appropriateness of and satisfaction with services and the outcomes in terms of treatment and life goals.  
<P>
Public hearings should be held regularly, and ample opportunity should be provided for public comment as the contractor for mental health services is regularly reviewed.  We must insist, too, that these new players in the mental health field recognize the value of a partnership with families and consumers.  Being two or three out of 25 or 30 members on advisory committees serving largely as window-dressing is not enough.  
<P>
We must remind those who will shape the next service system that there are no easy answers.  Our science is still evolving.  We are still learning to listen and truly respond to the many families and consumers who need help and support.  We must remind them that one size does not fit all in psychiatric services and that respect for individual choice must be the guiding principle in any system of care.  
<P>
Our newly merging managed care and mental health create different roles than those we have seen for state government.  Our systems are less government-controlled and more market-driven.  The state will no longer be a deliverer of care, but will become a quality monitor, procurement manager, and regulator.  This could mean the ultimate end will be a one-tiered, one-class system, and it may mean an increased advocacy force for the needs of persons with severe mental illness.  
<P>
Nonetheless, we must be sure that managed care providers are truly qualified.  There must be true measures of access and consumer satisfaction as well as real accountability for performance based upon published standards and protocol that go well beyond acute care.  There must be significant involvement at every stage of the process from families and consumers.  
<P>
It will be difficult in the next few years as we move to meet this challenging new role.  Issues of quality assurance are vital.  There are currently no agreed-on standards to measure quality of life, consumer satisfaction, and the outcomes that matter most to families.  The development of truly integrated services will be critical as we continue our advocacy to bring mental illness into the mainstream of our larger health system. 
<P>
Cost-shifting in today's two-tiered system allows symptoms to be ignored and ultimately encourages the dumping of the most severely ill and disabled into the often overburdened public system where we all know they often get ineffective and inadequate care.  
<P>
During the next year, we will see intense competition as state after state moves toward managing its Medicaid mental health system.  Without safeguards, standards, and outcome measures, our family members may be at risk.  It is essential that all of us get involved and bring our voice to this important decision-making. 
<P>
What's clear is that we will see an increased blurring of the lines between public and private systems as funding streams merge.  The existing system of payment is successful because of managed care's ability to fall back on public-sector funding when a patient's maximum number of covered days is reached.  But as health reform proceeds in state after state, the distinction between public and private funder and providers is becoming more difficult to determine. 
<P>
As this transition occurs, it will be our challenge.  Because outcomes will be the focus of decision-making as private managed care companies move into the public sector, we must focus our energies on accreditation issues.  There has until now been no substantive involvement by families and consumers in standard-setting and outcomes-monitoring.
<P>
We must demand that managed care contractors annually reveal the amount of profit they are making, the percentage of funds going to administrative costs, and the salaries of their top executives. 
<P>
We must guard against the practice that has been widespread in the private sector of squeezing money out through aggressive managed care that is not returned to improve the health care of the patient population.  In the impoverished system that we face in most states, we need more, not less, money directed to services and treatment.

<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><H2>Policy-makers:  Points of View</H2>
<H4>An interview with Steven E. Hyman, M.D.
</H4></font>
<hr>
<I>Note:  This interview with Steven E. Hyman, M.D., director of the 
National Institute of Mental Health, was conducted by Laura Lee 
Hall, Ph.D., NAMI deputy director of policy and research. 
</I><P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	Now that you have been the NIMH director for several months, 
what changes, if any, do you have in mind for NIMH in the near 
term and in the longer term?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font>	My near-term and long-term goals are similar:  ensuring that 
we fund the most promising science to advance our 
understanding of mental illness, improve treatment and service 
delivery, and ultimately lead to effective preventive 
strategies.  My priorities include an increasing focus on 
research in neuroscience, in genetics, and in the pathogenesis 
and treatment of serious mental disorders.  Within that broad 
plan, I already have set in motion several initiatives.  Let 
me illustrate with some specifics. 
<P>
	Many of our approaches to genetics were initiated when the 
complexity of the inherited vulnerability to mental disorders 
was not fully grasped.  Now that we recognize that 
"vulnerability" genes interact with environmental "second 
hits" to produce serious mental disorders, now that we 
understand that there may be more than one genetic pathway for 
vulnerability to mood disorders or schizophrenia, now that we 
understand that even in a single individual multiple genes may 
interact to produce vulnerability, it is evident that we need 
to update our strategies.  In particular, we need to take 
advantage of the rapid technological advances pioneered by the 
human genome project.  Accordingly, I have initiated a rapid 
and focused review of our investment in genetics so that we 
can better direct our resources toward finding genes that 
confer vulnerability to disorders such as schizophrenia, manic 
depressive illness, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive 
disorder, and autism.  
<P>
	Similarly, I have initiated a review of our investment in 
research on mood disorders.  I am concerned that we may not 
have enough of an investment in clinical trials while perhaps 
we still invest too much in human physiologic investigations 
using older approaches that are not informed by modern 
understandings of the brain.  This review should improve the 
quality of our portfolio in mood disorders and may identify 
new areas for research funding.  
<P>
	NIMH must adhere scrupulously to the principle that our 
research must be dictated by public health need and by a 
realistic opportunity for scientific progress.  Given our 
budgetary limits, we cannot continue to support research in 
areas that have outlived their usefulness.  Nor can we fail to 
invest in treatment and outcomes research because some of the 
research community finds these less "sexy" than, for example, 
neuroimaging studies.  The reviews I will be instituting are 
not geared toward producing glossy documents; rather, I want 
clear-eyed examinations of our investment with recommendations 
for implementation.  This is the type of mechanism that I will 
use--once we have gotten some experience with it--to update 
our successful long-term national plans in such important 
areas as schizophrenia research and childhood mental 
disorders.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	As you know, NAMI has become increasingly concerned that 
NIMH's research portfolio has become too expansive and has 
lost its focus on severe mental disorders.  What do you see as 
NIMH's primary mission in terms of the kinds of research it 
funds, and what criteria do you think should be in place for 
deciding the kinds of research that should be funded?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font>	If we look at the changes in the mission and research 
portfolio of the NIMH over the past two decades, the institute 
has in fact become progressively more focussed on severe 
mental disorders--in marked contrast to the institute of 
twenty years ago, which was involved in broad efforts in 
community mental health, in mental health promotion, or in the 
development of mental health service delivery.  This movement 
toward a focus on mental illness culminated in the return of 
NIMH to the National Institutes of Health, the world's 
premiere biomedical research organization.
<P>
	I plan to further strengthen this commitment to research on 
severe mental illnesses and to the basic sciences necessary 
for progress on these illnesses.  Particularly in the current 
budget climate, we need to be quite clear about our priorities 
and be guided by two primary considerations:  scientific 
opportunities and public health need.  Public health need 
dictates that our greatest commitment should be research 
focused on serious mental disorders.  We are fortunate that 
there are now unprecedented scientific tools that will hasten 
progress in these areas.  I am in the process of analyzing our 
entire research portfolio, not only to consider mission 
relevance, but also the quality of the science.  This effort 
has earned the explicit support of the Congress and a request 
that I brief Congress on our findings, which I find very 
encouraging.  
<P>
	NAMI has appropriately emphasized the need for research on 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, manic depressive 
illness, severe depression, and anxiety disorders.  We must 
not forget other severe and disabling mental disorders, 
however, including some disorders of childhood, severe eating 
disorders such as anorexia, severe personality disorders, 
post-traumatic stress disorder, and mental disorders of aging. 
 Congress has, in fact, encouraged research in many of these 
areas.  Similarly, we must remain committed to the support of 
basic science, which may not have obvious initial 
relationships to mental illness, because history has shown 
that we often cannot predict at the outset the ultimate 
implications or relevance of basic-science endeavors.  
Fortunately, all of my interactions with NAMI membership and 
staff have reassured me that there is no more sophisticated 
advocacy group when it comes to understanding the need for 
basic neuroscience research, and I believe that we will forge 
an even stronger alliance on behalf of both applied and basic 
research to benefit those with mental illness.  
<P>
	There is one other issue I would like to address.  NAMI has 
expressed concern about some of the basic behavioral research 
that we fund.  I believe that closer links between behavioral 
research and neuroscience are necessary.  And I intend to work 
to ensure that the behavioral research we support will have an 
immediate or longer-term impact on our understanding of these 
illnesses, on treatment, or on the delivery of services for 
mental illness.
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	NIMH funds research spanning from very basic science to 
clinical research and services research. You yourself have 
spoken about improving the translation of basic-research 
findings into clinical advances and actual treatment in the 
service system.  Can you describe your views concerning these 
three general areas of research, how they interact, and how we 
can foster scientific advances that will translate as rapidly 
as possible into better care for people with serious brain 
disorders?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font>	NIMH does indeed fund research that extends from molecules to 
services.  A general problem in science, not limited to 
research in mental illness, is found in the extremely 
specialized languages and research tools used by investigators 
in different areas of science.  These languages and research 
tools are required for rapid progress at any given level of 
analysis; however, that specialization creates a problem in 
the translation from one area to another.  The term 
translational research was initially coined in the realm of 
cancer research, but is quite relevant to our concerns as 
well.  We must encourage a subset of our scientists to focus 
on the boundaries between basic science and clinical research 
and, for that matter, between clinical research and services 
research.  We must hasten the movement of new discoveries into 
the clinic.  
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3">Q: </font>	You know that NAMI has been an ardent supporter of NIMH.  But 
beyond lobbying for more funding for the institute, NAMI 
desires a greater voice in administrative and policy decisions 
at NIMH.  What role do you believe that citizens--people with 
serious brain disorders and their families--should play at 
NIMH?  How will you go about involving citizens in your 
efforts?
<P>
<font color="#FF0000" size="3"><font color="#FF0000" size="3">A: </font> </font>	I am aware that the support for biomedical research in the 
United States stems from the needs of people suffering with 
illness and from their families and from the overall benefit 
to society of restoring those disabled by illness to 
productivity.  There is no place for arrogance among 
scientists.  We must have serious and open dialogues with all 
of our constituency groups.  NAMI plays a central role in 
advocacy for research on serious brain disorders; and I plan 
to involve NAMI, along with other constituencies, in our 
efforts in several ways.  First, I have encouraged all members 
of our National Advisory Mental Health Council--non-
scientists and scientists alike--to play a full and vital 
role in our policy decisions.  I was fortunate to have the 
opportunity to nominate Dale Johnson, former NAMI president 
and a very knowledgeable person, to our council.  I am also 
developing plans to convene our different constituency groups 
on a regular basis to discuss areas of mutual concern and 
interest.  
<P>
My near-term and long-term goals are similar:  ensuring that we 
fund the most promising science to advance our understanding of 
mental illness, improve treatment and service delivery, and 
ultimately lead to effective preventive strategies.
<P>
Particularly in the current budget climate, we need to be quite 
clear about our priorities and be guided by two primary 
considerations:  scientific opportunities and public health need.
<P>
Fortunately, all of my interactions with NAMI membership and staff 
have reassured me that there is no more sophisticated advocacy 
group when it comes to understanding the need for basic 
neuroscience research, and I believe that we will forge an even 
stronger alliance on behalf of both applied and basic research to 
benefit those with mental illness.
