<CENTER>Inclusive Placements on the Increase; <BR>
Most Students Are Served in the Regular Classroom</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
     States saw the largest increase in the number of students with disabilities they served under IDEA during the 1993-1994 school year, while reporting that there continued to be a great shortage of teachers and teacher aides.  A greater number of these students are being served in the regular classroom.<P>
     This and other data are reported in the recently published U.S. Department of Education's <I>17th Annual Report to Congress on the Implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</I>, which reflects the state of education for the 1993-94 school year.<BR>
     Selected highlights from this year's report include:<P>
<CENTER><B>Students Served, Placement and Exiting Patterns,<BR>
and Personnel Shortages</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
The number of individuals from birth through 21 receiving special education or early intervention services in the 1993-94 school year increased by 4.2% -- the largest yearly increase since the inception of IDEA in 1976.  The distribution of specific disabilities for children age 6-21 is:<P>
&iuml;     Specific learning disabilities -- 51.1%<BR>
&iuml;     Speech/language impairments -- 21.1%<BR>
&iuml;     Mental retardation -- 11.6%<BR>
&iuml;     Serious emotional disturbance -- 8.7%<BR>
<BR>
Although students with traumatic brain injuries (TBI), other health impairments, and autism still account for less than 3% of all students with disabilities, these are the most rapidly growing categories.  The size of the increase in the number of students with TBI and autism is probably related to the fact that these reporting categories were only recently established.  The increase in the number of students with other health impairments appears to be the result of growth in the service population.  Specifically, the number of students identified as having attention deficit disorders (ADD) appears to be increasing.<P>
     <B>Part H</B>.  The number of eligible infants and toddlers receiving early intervention services on December 1, 1993 rose to 154,065, or 1.3% of the entire birth through 2 population.  This is an increase of 7.4% over the previous year.  FY 1993 was the first year all States and jurisdictions were required to assure full implementation of the Part H program in order to receive funding.  The program was appropriated $213.2 million, up 23% from the previous year. Among all eligible infants and toddlers, the home remains the most frequent service site, followed by outpatient services and early intervention classroom settings.  The 1991-92 data shows that 1) family training, counseling, and home visits; 2) special instruction; and 3) speech and language pathology were the services most often provided.<P>
     <B>Section 619 Preschool Grants Program</B>.  In FY 1994, $339 million was appropriated for this program, 4% more than the previous year.  However, during the 1993-94 school year, almost 500,000 preschoolers with disabilities received services, 8.3% more than in 1992-93.<P>
<B>     Services Provided in Integrated Settings</B>.  During the last five years, regular classroom placements for students age 6 through 21 have increased by almost 10%.  The use of resource rooms 
has decreased, and all other placement settings have remained stable.  In part, these changes may be attributed to improved data collection and reported methods in several states.<P>
     In 1992-93, 95% of students with disabilities were served in regular school buildings.  Students age 6 through 11 are most likely to be served in regular classroom settings.  This continues the trend of placing more children in inclusive settings.<BR>
<B><BR>
     Graduation Data</B>.  The graduation rate for students with disabilities as a whole has been essentially unchanged over the past five years.  Rates for students with mental retardation are slightly higher than those for students with learning disabilities or serious emotional disturbance.<P>
     Thirty percent of students with disabilities who had been enrolled in 9th through 12th grades left school by dropping out.  An additional 8% left school before 9th grade.  <P>
     Almost all youth with disabilities had access to some form of vocational education in secondary school.  Data indicated that vocational training contributed significantly to the probability of competitive employment.<P>
     Freshmen with disabilities entering college made up a much larger portion of all freshmen with disabilities, tripling between 1978 and 1991 from 2.2% to 8.8%. <BR>
<B><BR>
     Demand for Special Educators</B>.  The number of teachers employed to serve children and youth with disabilities age 6 through 21 from 1991-92 and 1992-93 increased 0.7%.  The largest special education teacher category in school year 1992-93 was the specific learning disabilities category.<P>
     Teacher aides accounted for over half (55.7%) of all staff other than special education teachers employed to serve students with disabilities age 3 through 21.  However, states also reported that the area of greatest need was teacher aides, reporting a need of an additional 5,000 full-time equivalent teacher aides to fill vacancies and to replace personnel who were not fully certified or licensed.<BR>
<B><BR>
     Funding</B>.  During FY 1994, $2.149 billion was distributed to states for the provision of special education to children with disabilities through IDEA, Part B.  The average per-child allocation has remained relatively stable over the past three years, and was $413 in FY 1994 -- an increase of only $2 over the previous year.<BR>
<B><BR>
     Serving Students with Disabilities in Rural Areas</B>.  Rural districts serve a greater percentage of students with disabilities in regular classrooms than do non-rural districts.  In rural areas, only 14.6% of students with disabilities were in full-time special education programs, while in non-rural areas 25.3% were in these types of programs.  The data also indicates that both rural and non-rural districts serve 5.5% of students with disabilities outside of their home districts.<P>
     Rural districts serve a larger percentage of children living in poverty (22.9%) than non-rural populations (20.6%).The geographic isolation common to rural districts can impede every aspect of the special education process, including identification and assessment, service delivery, and availability of adequate personnel.<P>
     Recruiting and retaining staff qualified to serve students with disabilities is particularly difficult in rural areas.  Many professionals feel socially, culturally, and professionally isolated.  <P>

     impress lawmakers -- and thou shalt be prepared to outlast long delays.<P>

<CENTER><B>THE CEC CHILDREN AND YOUTH <BR>
ACTION NETWORK (CAN)</B><BR>
</CENTER><P>
<U>What is the Purpose of CAN?</U><P>
The purpose of the Network is: 1) to effect the necessary governmental changes at the local, state/province, and federal levels which will make possible the implementation of CEC policies related to the education of exceptional children; and 2) to further vitalize CEC units (federations, divisions, branches, and chapters) by providing meaningful vehicles for membership involvement and CEC public visibility.<P>
<U>What is the Structure of the Network?</U><P>
CAN is a communication network that is composed of a cadre of individuals capable and willing to effect necessary governmental change.  The Network is composed of political action network coordinators selected by their respective federations, branches, or divisions.  Each federation CAN coordinator is responsible for developing and maintaining a system of regional coordinators within his/her state.  Depending on the particular federation, regional coordinators may wish to develop a system of local coordinators.  Each division CAN coordinator is responsible for developing and maintaining a system of coordinators from each subdivision throughout the country.<P>
<U>What are Some of the Factors that Need to be Considered When Selecting a CAN Coordinator?</U><P>
1.     A commitment to the policies of CEC.<P>
2.     A willingness to devote the necessary time (approximately 10-15 hours per month) to carry<BR>
     out all responsibilities related to this position.<P>
3.     A freedom to speak for and represent CEC to policy makers and the public.<P>
4.     An access to telephone, FAX machine, mail, duplication, and other communication devices.<P>
5.     A willingness to serve a minimum of two years in this capacity.  <P>
<U>What are Some of the Responsibilities of CAN Coordinators?</U><P>
1.     Each CAN coordinator is responsible for developing a system of regional coordinators within<BR>
     his/her federation.  The number and location of these coordinators will be dependent upon the<BR>
     demographic, economic, and social factors of the state/province, as well as CEC<BR>
     organizational considerations.<P>
<BR>
--------------------------<BR>
*  While the purpose of the CEC CAN may be the same, the operation of the network in the U.S. and<BR>
   Canada differs.  This Fact Sheet is specific to U.S. federation and division CAN coordinators.<P>
<CENTER>(over)<BR>
</CENTER>2.     Develop and operate an effective children and youth action network in each state and whenever<BR>
     necessary trigger the network to achieve political action objectives at all levels of government.<P>
3.     Provide information to the CEC Department of Public Policy (DPP) on significant activities<BR>
     within a state/province that may require assistance from Headquarters, constitute significant<BR>
     policy advances or retreats, or be of interest to other federations or divisions.<P>
4.     Advise CEC DPP of any issue or crisis which may have national implications.<P>
5.     Provide CEC DPP with significant public statements and media articles.<P>
6.     Report to CEC DPP contacts with federal officials (e.g., members of the U.S. Congress and<BR>
     Executive Branch officials) on significant policy issues.<P>
7.     Inform CEC DPP of the federation's or division's public policy priorities.<P>
8.     Inform CEC DPP of invitations extended to members of the federal legislative or executive<BR>
     branches of government to participate in federation/division meetings or activities.<P>
<U>What are Some of the Responsibilities of CEC DPP?</U><P>
1.     Provide CAN with relevant information from federal and state/provincial levels of<BR>
     government.<P>
2.     Apprise CAN of all major relevant actions by the federal government.<P>
3.     Alert the Network or any segment of CAN to situations requiring political action.<P>
4.     Maintain regular communication to all coordinators.<P>
5.     Make training available to CAN coordinators.<P>
6.     Give priority to the Network in terms of problem-solving and assistance with Network<BR>
     activities.<P>
7.     Provide technical assistance at the request of a CAN coordinator.<P>
8.     Coordinate with CAN coordinators requests from other groups for CEC's participation in<BR>
     government-related activities in their state/province.<P>

<CENTER><B>BASIC WAYS TO COMMUNICATE WITH POLICY MAKERS </B> <BR>
</CENTER><BR>
There are a number of ways to communicate with policy makers--be they legislators who enact policy or agency staff who implement policy.  Regardless of the communication vehicle being used, following are some general principles for good communication to keep in mind.<P>
*     Keep jargon at a minimum.<BR>
*     Be concise and to the point.<BR>
*     Reinforce good decision making.<BR>
*     Communicate before decisions are made.<BR>
*     Continue communication to meet changing needs.<BR>
*     Be dependable and honest.<BR>
*     Use the talents of other good communicators.<BR>
*     Remember you represent others.<BR>
*     Remember what you communicate may be shared.<BR>
*     The message is more important than the medium.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Letter Writing<P>
</B>Officials and their staffs pay careful attention to their mail since it forms the major body of public and voter sentiment on pending legislative activity.  Many persons find it difficult to know how to communicate with their legislator.  Often, form letters with identical wording and petitions are used.  Most legislators, however, place little weight on such an approach.  The type of letter that is most appreciated and helpful is one that is carefully thought out and represents an individual's point of view concerning the bill or legislative matter that is being considered.  It should explain how the measure will benefit the writer or the community, or how the measure can be improved.  This is particularly important in letters from a constituent.  Since everyone does not have the same base of information or experience, letters should have clarity and simplicity, and at the same time reflect respect for the intelligence of the legislator and his staff.  A policy or bill should be specifically referred to by its title and number.<P>
<B>An outline to follow when writing a letter:</B><P>
1.      Introductory paragraph<BR>
         a.     The reason for your letter--including the policy or bill title and number.<BR>
         b.     Describe yourself.<BR>
         c.     What action you are seeking.<BR>
<BR>
2.         The body of the letter<BR>
         a.     Communicate the reason for the action being sought by using:<BR>
          -historical facts<BR>
          -data<BR>
          -credible opinion<BR>
          -impact data<BR>
          -viable alternatives<BR>
          <P>
          -personal experience<BR>
          -weaknesses of opposing points of view<BR>
          -logic     <BR>
     <BR>
          b.     Describe what impact the action will have on the community.<P>
3.          Letter closing<BR>
          a.     Restate action sought.<BR>
          b.     Express appreciation for consideration of views.<BR>
          c.     Indicate willingness to help.<BR>
          d.     State what response you are seeking.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Other points to keep in mind when writing letters:<BR>
</B><BR>
          *     Be careful of grammar, spelling, and punctuation.<BR>
          *     Don't threaten or question integrity.<BR>
          *     Be concise.<BR>
          *     Be legible.<BR>
          *     Avoid jargon.<BR>
          *     Check for clarity.<BR>
          *     A postcard saying, "I hope you will be able to support S.B. 405" is better than no correspondence at all.<BR>
          *     To avoid antagonizing, give reasons for disagreeing and refrain from outright or veiled hints that the position on legislation may cost a vote. <BR>
          *     Officials are accustomed to receiving letters criticizing them for action they take.  However, one of the greatest rewards legislators can receive -- and one that is perhaps most cherished -- is a simple letter thanking them for their performance.<BR>

</B>1.       Prepare in advance the major points you want to convey.<BR>
2.       Identify yourself, affiliation, and purpose of call.<BR>
3.       If the policy maker is not available, talk to staff responsible for education issues.<BR>
4.       If call is to be returned--give telephone number and when you will be available.<BR>
5.       Be courteous and succinct.<BR>
6.       Be prepared to answer questions or provide related information.<BR>
<BR>
<CENTER>--------------------------------<BR>
<B>Telephone Procedure</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
1.     Call (202) 224-3121 (Capitol switchboard) and ask for Senator's (NAME) office.<P>
2.     Tell whoever answers the telelphone your name and where you are from.  Ask to speak<BR>
     to the Senator about a matter concerning funding for education of individuals with<BR>
     disabilities.<P>
3.     If the Senator is not available, ask to speak to an aide who handles this matter for the<BR>
     Senator.  Be sure to keep the name of the aide for future calls.<P>
4.     Tell the Senator or aide that Senator (NAME), of (STATE), plans to offer an amendment<BR>
     in the (NAME OF COMMITTEE) (of which Senator (NAME) is a member) to<BR>
     (EXPLAIN WHAT THE AMENDMENT WILL DO).  You support the amendments for<BR>
     (CITE SOME REASONS).  (If you are speaking for others, or represent an organization,<BR>
     be sure to mention that at this point.)  Ask if the Senator will support the amendment.<BR>
     Yes, no, or undecided?  If yes, ask if the Senator will be there to vote?  If no, will he<BR>
     give his proxy to Senator (NAME OF PERSON OFFERING AMENDMENT)?  If the<BR>
     Senator is opposed to the amendment, ask why.  Give your arguments to the contrary,<BR>
     then get others to call.  If the answer is undecided, ask when a decision will be made. <BR>
     Let them know you will call back at that time.  In the meantime, get others to call.<P>
5.     Thank the person you spoke with.  Be courteous; you will probably need to talk to them<BR>
     again.<BR>
<B><BR>
Visiting</B><P>
A personal visit with a member of Congress is an effective way to emphasize your interest in an issue or bill.   A visit with your U.S. Congressman can occur either in Washington, D.C., or at his or her State offices. <P>
<B>Some tips for planning a meeting with an elected official:</B><P>
1.     Make an appointment.  Explain the reason for the meeting, the time needed (usually no<BR>
     more than 30 minutes), and identify any other individuals who will be in attendance.<P>
2.     If others are going, decide who will present the information and how it will be<BR>
     presented.  One possible format is to present the issue, the impact of the issue, and then<BR>
     possible solutions.<P>
3.     Prepare and/or collect any supporting materials to accompany your presentation.  (It is<BR>
     helpful to have materials that you can leave with the legislator.)<P>
4.     Learn the facts regarding your issue, both legislative and any others related to your position.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Practice your presentation.<BR>
<BR>
6.     Learn about the legislator.  Try to find out positions taken on similar issues.<BR>
<BR>
7.     Get to know the staff...they are key people to develop a rapport with.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Some tips for conducting a meeting with a policy maker:</B><P>
1.     Be on time.  Don't be disturbed if you have to wait since there may have been<BR>
     unavoidable delays or changes in the schedule.<P>
2.     When you arrive, introduce yourself to the secretary.  If you have a calling or business card, give one to the secretary.<BR>
<BR>
3.     When you meet the legislator (or staff person), introduce yourself and identify the group you are representing.  If you are a constituent, share that as well.<BR>
<BR>
4.     State the reason for your visit concisely and accurately.  Limit the number of issues you discuss and refer to bills by name and number.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Give the legislator essential information, review the critical points, describe the impact of the legislation and share your recommendation.<BR>
<BR>
6.     If your legislator has already publicly supported your position, express your thanks and tell him or her how much his or her efforts are appreciated.<BR>
<BR>
If your legislator has not yet committed to your position, clearly state reasons for<BR>
     supporting your position, and let him or her know you would appreciate his or her<BR>
     support.<P>
If your legislator is not supportive of your position, give him or her the information and politely ask him or her to reconsider the issue.<BR>
<BR>
7.     Be prepared to answer questions.<BR>
<BR>
8.     If possible, leave fact sheets or supporting materials with the legislator. (It may be helpful to include a contact name and number with the materials in case other questions arise.) <BR>
<BR>
9.     Have a picture taken with the official if possible.  Use the picture in local newspapers to<BR>
     provide publicity for the official and your organization.<P>
10.     Thank the legislator for his or her time and leave promptly.<P>
<B>Some suggestions for following up on a meeting with a policy maker:</B><P>
1.     Immediately after the meeting, record what occurred--who you met with, issues<BR>
     discussed, responses received, and any follow-up needed.<P>
2.     Write a thank-you letter to the official.  Summarize points made and include any follow-up information requested.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Wiring</B><P>
Western Union provides two special services for persons wishing to register their positions with elected representatives:<P>
1.<U>     Personal Opinion Telegram</U>--allows a person to send a message of 20 words to<BR>
     elected Representatives, Senators, or even the President, for $9.95 (just text).<P>
2.     <U>Mailgram Message</U>--for longer messages, up to 50 words (including sender's and<BR>
     receiver's name and address, salutation, and close) for $17.95.<P>
For more information on these and other services write to The Western Union Telegraph Company, 1 Lake Street, Upper Saddle River, NJ 07458, or call your local Western Union office.  Toll-free numbers are listed in local telephone directories.<BR>

<B>Testifying</B><P>
Legislative committees often hold hearings to gather information on a particular issue or piece of legislation.  Being selected to testify before a legislative committee provides you with a valuable opportunity for advocating for improved educational opportunities for individuals with disabilities or for individuals who are gifted.<P>
<B>Some suggestions to keep in mind if you are invited to testify:<BR>
</B><BR>
1.     Do your homework.  Gather as much information as possible about the issue.  Talk to<BR>
     key people in your organization and the field.<P>
2.     Learn what "the opposition" says and prepare responses to their concerns in case a committee member asks questions.<BR>
<BR>
3.     Determine the best person to serve as the witness who presents testimony.  The<BR>
     testimony should be delivered by a knowledgeable, articulate person who is familiar <BR>
     (or has been thoroughly briefed) on the issue(s).<P>
4.     Prepare a draft of the testimony and get feedback from several persons in the field and in the federation or division.<BR>
<BR>
5.     The beginning of the testimony should include: <BR>
       * the name and occupation of the witness.<BR>
       * the name of the group on whose behalf the testimony is being given.<BR>
       * a brief statement on why you support or oppose the bill.<P>
6.     Include in your testimony evidence to support your position, real-life examples of the impact of the legislation, and alternatives for those areas of the legislation that you oppose.  Remember that examples of your own personal or professional experience provide the best supporting evidence when intertwined with other factual information.<B><BR>
</B><BR>
<B>Related Activities for Building Rapport with Policy Makers</B><P>
In addition to the basic forms of communication previously presented, several activities also may be used to build a strong rapport with policy makers.<P>
<B>Some activities to consider:<P>
</B>1.     Invite the policy makers to learn more about the education of individuals with disabilities or those who are gifted.<BR>
<BR>
       *      Arrange for your official to visit special education classrooms or facilities in his or her district or state.
       *      Sponsor a special day to conduct a tour of several special education programs.<BR>
       *      Host a luncheon or dinner for the official to meet key special education leaders and/or professionals.     <BR>
<BR>
2.     Prepare an annual report to legislators explaining the status of services to children with exceptionalities in their districts.  Such reports should include statistics of the number of children served and not served, a description of programs offered, size of the community involved, and additional services needed.  Legislators are always interested in receiving such reports and will often publish them in the records of the legislature.<BR>
<BR>
3.     Invite the legislator to speak or attend an organizational meeting or banquet.<BR>
<BR>
4.     Recognize legislators who have acted in the best interests of children with exceptionalities by presenting legislative statesmanship awards to them or by dedicating educational facilities in their names.<BR>
<BR>
<B>When attempting to involve a policy maker in local activities, consider the following:</B><P>
1.     A legislator's time is at a premium.  Make arrangements through his or her local business office well in advance.  Follow through on a regular basis to confirm attendance.  Leave the schedule flexible enough to accommodate minor changes.<BR>
<BR>
2.     Government officials greatly depend on publicity.  The best payment is to provide<BR>
     extensive press coverage.  Assistance is usually available from their offices.<P>
3.     Cooperate with legislators' staffs well enough in advance so they are prepared for<BR>
     their audience.<P>
4.     Be sure that any information presented to the legislator is accurate.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Legislators will be more interested in participating in local improvement of services to children with exceptionalities if they can identify community interest.  Therefore, involve as many community groups as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Determining the Proper Timing and Amount of Energy to Expend on Communication<P>
</B>For effective political action, it is essential for you to know when to use the techniques of communication, who the appropriate targets of communication are, and how much communication to direct at selected targets to accomplish an objective, yet not exhaust future resources.  <BR>

<B>Keep in mind the following tips:</B><P>
1.     Many bills arouse very little public comment.  Eight to ten letters to a legislator from scattered parts of the state are ordinarily something the legislator will notice.<BR>
<BR>
2.     Usually only a small amount of effort is needed to attract legislators' attention.  But where there is opposition, a stronger effort is needed.  All-out support is essential at critical points on major issues.<BR>
<BR>
3.     Determine which level of effort is needed on an issue:  (1) some response may require a few letters or telegrams to be sent; (2) a strong response may require at least one letter or telegram to be sent from each local chapter; and (3) an all-out effort may require numerous responses to be sent from each local chapter.<BR>
<BR>
4.     Assuming that most members of your network will help sometimes, but very few can always be relied upon, fit the amount of effort to the target.  The more important the target, the greater the effort should be.<BR>
<BR>
5.     Some effort, or even a strong effort, needs to be made from time to time to check the responsiveness of the communication network and to be sure members understand their role.<BR>
<BR>
6.     Chart the progress of bills and be ready to act quickly.<BR>
<BR>
7.     Ask someone in the legislator's office to notify you about times and places for hearings early enough to allow you time to communicate with legislators.<BR>
<BR>
8.     Evaluate your efforts in terms of progress made over a period of time.  Remember that some legislators' proposals are reintroduced and lost repeatedly until enough policy makers are convinced of their constructive value.

<CENTER>Rules For Effective Advocacy</B><BR>
</CENTER><BR>
     Most of what a good advocate does is intuitive and grows out of a few basic principles.  Following is the core set of principles on which most advocates agree.  Try to remember these principles when you become discouraged, entangled in detail, or simply confused.  They may help clear your head, renew, and redirect your energies.<BR>
     <B>1.)  Ask for what you want.</B><BR>
     <B>2.)  Be specific in your request.</B><BR>
     <B>3.)  Be ready to work hard.</B><BR>
     <B>4.)  Find a legislative champion.</B>     <B><BR>
     5.)  Organize, coordinate, orchestrate.</B><BR>
     <B>6.)  Touch all the bases.</B><BR>
     <B>7.)  Stay flexible, be opportunistic.</B><BR>
<B>     8.)  Keep it simple.</B><BR>
     <B>9.)  Assume the perspective of others.</B><BR>
<B>     10.)  Build and preserve your credibility.</B><BR>
     <B>11.)  Anticipate and deal with your opposition.</B><BR>
     <B>12.)  Be prepared to compromise.</B><BR>
     <B>13.)  Never burn your bridges.</B><BR>
     <B>14.)  Target your efforts.</B><BR>
     <B>15.)  Honor the staff.</B><BR>
     <B>16.)  Track your progress.</B><BR>
     <B>17.)  Be persistent.</B><BR>
     <B>18.)  Follow up.</B><BR>
<CENTER><B>What's CEC Newsworthy?<BR>
</CENTER></B><BR>
     The <I>CEC Special Education Advocacy Handbook</I> provides general tips on how to access and use the media to your best advantage.  But how do you know what issues the press will really respond to and want to give coverage to?  And what should your main goals be in your interactions with the media?  Here are some guidelines:<BR>
<CENTER><B>Your Four CEC PR Goals</B><BR>
</CENTER><li>To serve the goal of improving educational outcomes for students with exceptionalities.<BR>
<li>To heighten the visibility, understanding, and appreciation of special educators.<BR>
<li>To increase CEC membership.<BR>
<li>To increase the recruitment of persons into the special education profession.<BR>
<CENTER><B><BR>
Is it News?</B><BR>
</CENTER>One of these three elements can be found in stories that get press coverage:<BR>
<li><B>     Increasing public awareness</B> -- By increasing public awareness of the truth, you provide a balanced view of the issues at stake.  Stories can expose the peril of the alternatives or provide solutions.<BR>
<li><B>     Solutions to a problem</B> -- When your product or service (e.g., membership/conference) provides a solution to a problem or meets the needs of an audience, publicity can be generated.<BR>
<li><B>     Responding as an expert</B> -- Press will seek you out when you are perceived as being a credible expert in a field.<BR>
<BR>
Your story ideas can relate to the following as well: current events, recognized achievement, area of influence, large interest base, human interest, milestones, controversy, personal significance, or neighborhood factors.<P>

<BR> 
<p>
I.  How a Bill Becomes Law:  Steps in the U.S. Federal Legislative Process<BR> 
</B><P> 
1.     Most bills can be introduced in either house.  The procedure by which a bill becomes a law is much the 
same regardless of where the bill originates.  In this example, the bill is first introduced in the Senate, given a 
number, and referred to the proper committee.  If a bill overlaps the jurisdictions of two or more committees, it 
may be referred simultaneously or sequentially to them so that each may deal with the sections of the bill 
appropriate to its jurisdiction, or it may be referred to one committee for purposes of legislative strategy.<BR> 
<BR> 
2.     The Senate committee refers the bill to an appropriate subcommittee where the members will explore 
various sides of a subject through oral and written testimony given during public hearings on the bill.  Since the 
entire legislative body does not attend, all legislators who eventually vote on the bill lean heavily on the written, 
publicly available proceedings and the recommendations of the committee or subcommittee.  Congressional 
committees are increasingly exerting "legislative oversight" to monitor the implementation and evaluate the 
effectiveness of enactments through the use of hearings and written testimony.<BR> 
<BR> 
3.     The full committee meets in executive session (i.e., only members attend), sometimes closed, to consider 
the facts.  It may "kill" the bill, approve it with or without amendments, or draft a new bill.  Such sessions are 
known as "executive markups."<BR> 
<BR> 
4.     If the committee recommends the bill for passage, it is then listed on the calendar (i.e., an agenda or list of 
pending business).  When the committee recommends placing a bill on the calendar, it is said that "the 
committee has reported favorably."<BR> 
<BR> 
5.     The committee prepares a report which includes the purposes and scope of the bill, an explanation of 
committee amendments, proposed changes in existing law (along with existing law as is), a section-by-section 
analysis of the bill expressing views of department and agency heads whose views are solicited, minority views, 
and long range cost estimates.<BR> 
<BR> 
6.     The bill comes up for debate (in the Senate).  Depending on the degree of controversy, debate may last 
from a few hours to several weeks.  Amendments may be added.  The bill is then voted on.<BR> 
<BR> 
7.     If the bill passes, it goes to the other body, in this case the House of Representatives, and is referred to the 
proper committee.  However, similar bills on the same subject may move through both house chambers 
concurrently.<BR> 
<BR> 
8.     Hearings may be held by the committee(s) to which the bill was referred.<BR> 
<BR> 
9.     The committee may reject the bill, prepare a new one, or accept the bill with or without amendments.<BR> 
<BR> 
10.     If the committee recommends the bill for passage, it is listed on the calendar and is sent on to the Rules 
Committee.  (Note:  Only the House of Representatives has a Rules Committee.)<BR> 
<BR> 
11.     The Rules Committee is one of the most powerful committees in the House of Representatives.  After a 
bill has been recommended for passage by the committee to which it was referred, the Rules Committee can 
block it or clear it for debate before the entire House.  (If a bill is blocked, a discharge petition, signed by 218 
members of the House, can clear the bill for House consideration.  The procedure of obtaining a discharge 
petition seldom succeeds.)<BR> 
<BR> 
12.     The bill goes before the entire body, is debated, and is voted on.<BR> 
<BR> 
13.     If the bill is passed by the second body but contains major differences from the first body's version, either 
house may request a conference committee.  Representing both parties, the conferees meet and try to reconcile 
the differences between the two bills.<BR> 
<BR> 
14.     Generally, they reach an agreement and report back to their respective houses where the agreement is 
either accepted or rejected.  The compromise version is generally referred to in common parlance as the 
"conference report."<BR> 
<BR> 
15.     If the report is accepted by both houses, the bill is signed by the Speaker of the House and the President of 
the Senate and is sent to the President of the United States.<BR> 
<BR> 
16.     The President may sign or veto the bill within 10 days.  If he does not sign within 10 days and Congress is 
still in session, the bill automatically becomes law.  If Congress has adjourned before the 10 days have elapsed 
and the President has not signed the bill, it does not become law.  This is known as a "pocket veto."  If the 
President returns the bill with a veto message, it may still become law if passed by a two-thirds majority in each 
house.  This is called an "override."  Failure to override is referred to as "sustaining a Presidential veto."  If one 
house sustains, the other house need not vote at all.<BR> 
<BR> 
Note:     Any bill that is not acted upon before a Congressional session terminates must be reintroduced in one of 
the houses when the new session begins.<BR> 
<BR> 
<B>II.  Authorizing Legislation and Appropriating Funds<P> 
</B>In the Congress of the United States, it is most important to be aware of two quite distinct legislative 
processes, <B>appropriations</B> and <B>authorizations</B>.  These processes involve separate committees 
as well as separate legislative bills.  Authorizing committees create programs, set general directions, and alter 
existing federal programs.  In fact, they do everything but actually provide the dollars.  There are numerous 
authorizing committees in both houses of the Congress.  The primary one in the Senate that is concerned with 
programs for children with exceptionalities is the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  The primary one in 
the House that is concerned with programs for children with exceptionalities is the Education and Labor 
Committee.<P> 
It is the function of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to determine how many dollars shall be 
allocated.  There is only one Appropriations Committee in each of the houses.  All appropriations bills must 
initiate in the House.<P> 
Budget Committees exist in both houses with a charge to set overall budget priorities for each fiscal year, which 
begins on October 1.<P> 
It is vital that the dual system of the U.S. Congress be kept in mind.  A battle may be won with the authorizing 
committees by creating or changing a program, but if that program is to have meaningful financial support, 
energies must be shifted to the appropriations committees.  When a fiscal year begins and Congress has not yet 
enacted all the regular appropriations bills for that year, Congress passes a joint resolution, "continuing 
appropriations" for government agencies at rates generally based on their previous year's appropriations.

<H3><b><I><CENTER>Exceptional Child Education Resources (ECER)
Database </CENTER></b></I></h3>

<B><I>What is ECER?</B></I><BR>
Exceptional Child Education Resources (ECER) is the world's most comprehensive
database of resources in special education and gifted education.  ECER contains more
than 80,000 citations and abstracts of print and nonprint materials dealing with the
education and development of people of all ages with exceptionalities--those who have
disabilities and those who are gifted.  Resources in all areas of special education and
related services (including services provided by audiologists, speech therapists,
occupational therapists, physical therapists, and educational psychologists) are covered
in ECER. <P>

ECER covers all types of exceptionalities, including giftedness; talent (artistic
giftedness); creativity; physical disabilities; hearing and visual impairments; mental
retardation/developmental disabilities; learning disabilities; behavior disorders/emotional
disturbances; mental disorders; autism; speech and communication disorders; chronic
illnesses (medically fragile); special health problems (e.g., eating disorders, cancer,
AIDS); child abuse and neglect; and children "at risk" due to disabilities, physical or
psychological problems, minority/ethnic status, or family or environmental factors. 
ECER dates from 1966 to present, and is updated monthly. <P>

<B><I>Is the ECER Database Like the ERIC Database?</B></I><BR>
The ECER database is compatible with the ERIC database.  ECER and ERIC use the
same cataloging, indexing, and abstracting rules and authorities. And ECER descriptors
are taken from the <i>Thesaurus of ERIC Descriptors</I>, which allows similar
strategies in searching the two databases. <P>

Some overlap exists between the ECER and ERIC databases.  Approximately half of
the database records that go into ECER also appear in ERIC.  This overlap applies
primarily to unpublished documents (curriculum and teaching guides, reports, etc.) and
articles in core special educational journals.   <P>

<B><I>What Are the Differences Between ECER and ERIC?</B></I><BR>
The ECER records that do not appear in ERIC include published books, additional
journal articles, and nonprint materials.  References retrieved in the ERIC database can
be excluded from ECER searches to avoid duplication.<P>

<B><I> How Can I Access the ECER Database?</B></I><BR>
By subscription.  With one economical annual subscription, you can receive ECER on
CD-ROM through SilverPlatter Information, Inc.

On the Internet.  ECER is also available online<br>

<b> Reading: The First Chapter In Education </b><P>

No other skill taught in school and learned by school children is more
important than reading. It is the gateway to all other knowledge. If
children do not learn to read efficiently, the path is blocked to
every subject they encounter in their school years.<P>

The past five years have brought major breakthroughs in our knowledge
of how children learn to read and why so many fail. These new insights
have been translated into techniques for teaching reading to beginning
readers, including the many students who would otherwise encounter
difficulties in mastering this fundamental skill. Researchers have
come to appreciate that early identification and treatment of such
students can make all the difference. Researchers have also documented
the problems -personal, social, and educational  - that too often
result when early attention and intervention do not occur.<P>


<B>Reading to Learn </B><P>

Students who do not "learn to read" during the first three years of
school experience enormous difficulty when they are subsequently asked
to "read to learn." Teaching students to read by the end of third
grade is the single most important task assigned to elementary
schools. During the first three years of schooling, students "learn to
read." That is, they develop the capacity to interpret the written
symbols for the oral language that they have been hearing since birth.
Starting in fourth grade, schooling takes on a very different purpose,
one that in many ways is more complex and demanding of higher-order
thinking skills. If efficient reading skills are not developed by this
time, the English language, history, mathematics, current events, and
the rich tapestries of literature and science become inaccessible.<P>

In addition, a strong body of evidence shows that most students who
fall behind in reading skills never catch up with their peers become
fluent readers. They fall further and further behind in school, become
frustrated, and drop out at much higher rates than their classmates.
They find it difficult to obtain rewarding employment and are
effectively prevented from drawing on the power of education to
improve and enrich their lives. Researchers speak of this syndrome as
the "Matthew Effect" - the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. <P>

Most Americans know how central reading is to education. According to
a 1994 poll conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates for the
American Federation of Teachers and the Chrysler Corporation, nearly
70 percent of teachers believe that reading is the "most important"
skill for children to learn. Two years earlier, the same polling firm
reported that 62 percent of parents believed that reading was one of
the most important skills for their children to master. Both teachers
and parents ranked reading as more critical than mathematics and
computer skills. In other words, there is general agreement among
researchers and the public that all children must learn to read early
in their academic careers.<P>


<B>The Challenges of Illiteracy</B><P>

More students fail to learn to read by the end of the third grade than
many people imagine. Indeed, it is no exaggeration to say that all
schools encounter students who fall into this category and that all
schools should have plans for addressing the special needs of these
students. <P>

In its 1994 Reading Assessment, the National Assessment of Education
Progress (NAEP), a federally supported program that tracks the
performance of American students in core academic subjects, reported
that more than four out of 10 fourth-graders (42 percent) in American
schools were reading at a "below basic" level. This means that they
could not understand "uncomplicated narratives and high-interest
informative texts." NAEP also reported that such illiteracy persists
in the higher grades. The report found that nearly one-third (31
percent) of eighth-graders and nearly one-third (30 percent) of
twelfth-graders are also reading at a "below basic" level. The latter
figures probably understate the problem, because many poor readers
drop out of school before twelfth grade. <P>

Other researchers have come to similar conclusions regarding how
widespread students' reading problems really are.  National
longitudinal studies have measured the ability of children to
recognize individual words in text. Their data suggest that more than
one child in six (17.5 percent) will encounter a problem in learning
to read during the crucial first three years of school. Further
evidence comes from the sharp rise in the number of students who are
diagnosed as learning disabled or are referred to special education
because they cannot read at the proper grade level.<P>

In contrast to popular belief, reading failure is not concentrated
among particular types of schools or among specific groups of
students. To the contrary, students who have difficulty reading
represent a virtual cross-section of  American children. They include
rich and poor, male and female, rural and urban, and public and
private school children in all sections of the country. According to
the NAEP assessment, for example, nearly one-third (32 percent) of
fourth graders whose parents graduated from college are reading at the
"below basic" level. <P>

In short, the failure of a substantial number of students to learn to
read during the critical first three years of school is a national
problem - one that confronts every community and every school in the
country. <P>


<B>A Common Stumbling Block: Phonemic Awareness</B><P>

Whatever the reason children fail to read by the end of the third
grade, most non-readers share a common problem. They have not
developed the capacity to recognize what reading experts call
phonemes. Phonemes are the smallest units of speech  -  the basic
building blocks of speaking and writing. The word "cat," for example,
contains three phonemes - the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds. Phonemes are
often identical to individual letters, but not always. The word "ox,"
for example, has two letters but three phonemes  -  the /o/, /k/, and
/s/ sounds. <P>

Researchers have demonstrated that accomplished readers are adept at
recognizing phonemes and putting them together to construct words and
phrases. They do this quickly, accurately, and automatically. The
absence of this critical linguistic skill makes it difficult for
children to decode and read single words, much less sentences,
paragraphs, and whole stories. Teaching phonemic awareness and
discrimination among phonemes is imperative for all students.<P>

<B>Solutions in the Classroom</B><P>

Teaching beginners to read must be highly purposeful and strategic.
Effective techniques have been developed for helping students,
including those with learning disabilities, to develop phonological
awareness, word recognition, and other advanced skills required for
reading.<P>

Phonological awareness activities build on and enhance children's
experiences with written (e.g., print awareness) and spoken language
(e.g., playing with words).  A beginning reader with successful
phonological awareness and knowledge of letters ostensibly learns how
words are represented in print.<P>

Intervention for learners who have difficulty with phonological
awareness must be early, strategic, systematic, and carefully
designed. It must be based on a curriculum that recognizes and
balances the importance of both phonics instruction and the
appreciation of meaning. <P>

For children who have difficulty reading, effective reading
instruction strategies should be used to build phonological awareness
and alphabetic understanding.  These strategies should be explicit,
making phonemes prominent in children's attention and perception.  For
example, teachers can model specific sounds and in turn ask the
children to produce the sounds.  In addition, opportunities to engage
in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful, frequent,
and fun.<P>

Instructional strategies should consider the characteristics that make
a word easier or more difficult to read. These include: the number of
phonemes in the word; phoneme position in words (initial sounds are
easier); phonological properties of words (e.g., continuants, such as
/m/, are easier than stop sounds, such as /t/); and phonological
awareness dimensions, including blending sounds, segmenting words, and
rhyming.<P>

Many early readers will require greater teacher assistance and
support. Using a research-based strategy known as scaffolding,
teachers should provide students with lots of instructional support in
the beginning stages of reading instruction, and gradually reduce the
support as students learn more about reading skills.  The ultimate
goal is for students to read on their own without the help of a
teacher.<P>


<B>A Balanced Approach</B><P>

Unfortunately, it is not always easy for teachers to recognize
students with reading difficulties. When they do, teachers sometimes
find themselves caught between conflicting schools of thought about
how to treat reading disabilities. One school of thought gives
considerable attention to the teaching of phonics in the early stages
of reading. Another school of thought emphasizes the whole language
approach. Should teachers rely on phonics instruction, whole language
instruction, or a combination of the two? <P>

The U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) have supported the review of
hundreds of studies done in recent years on reading instruction and
disabilities. This body of research suggests that the relatively
recent swing away from phonics instruction to a singular whole
language approach is making it more difficult to lift children with
learning disabilities out of the downward learning spiral and, in
fact, may impede the progress of many students in learning to read
with ease.<P>

Few dispute the value of giving children opportunities to write,
surrounding children with good literature, and generally creating a
rich literate environment for students. But for many children this is
not enough. Such children will have continued difficulty with reading
unless they master the decoding skills associated with phonics
instruction.  <P>

Research makes clear that children do not learn to read the way they
learn to talk. Speech is a natural human capacity, and learning to
talk requires little more than exposure and opportunity.  In contrast,
written language is an artifact, a human invention, and reading is not
a skill that can be acquired through immersion alone.  Beginning
readers benefit from instruction that helps them understand that the
words they speak and hear can be represented by written symbols - and
that letters and the sounds associated with them, when combined and
recombined, form words - just as they benefit from experiences that
make reading fun.<P>

California's experience with a chosen reading approach is instructive.
A decade ago, the state became a leader in the movement to embrace
whole language instruction. However, as a result of low reading
scores, a task force was formed and has recently adopted a more
balanced reading approach that includes building phonological
awareness along with the reading of meaningful and engaging texts. <P>

Research indicates that reading can be taught effectively with a
balanced approach that uses the best of both teaching approaches.
Such an approach incorporates phonics instruction with the rich
literacy environments advocated by whole language instruction.<P>

<B>The Learning to Read/Reading to Learn Initiative</B><P>

Throughout the Learning to Read/Reading to Learn: Helping Children
with Learning Disabilities to Succeed initative, three leading
researchers in the field of reading instruction, Marilyn Jager Adams,
author of Beginning to Read: Thinking and Learning about Print, a book
supported by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement
(OERI); Ed Kameenui of the University of Oregon, a researcher
supported by the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP); and Reid
Lyon of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development
(NICHD) have identified what they believe are the most important
strategies for improving early reading instruction.  These strategies
are effective for virtually every child but are absolutely critical
for children with learning disabilities. By evaluating the ways in
which students learn to read, researchers have identified nine skills
essential to the learning process. Identification of these skills will
alert teachers and parents to ways in which they can help children
learn to read more efficiently.<P>


<B>Reading: The Key to Success</B><P>

As already discussed, reading is the gateway to learning. Facility to
understand and use written language has always been a prerequisite to
the efficient acquisition of knowledge, and it is becoming
increasingly important in today's information society. In the past, it
may have been possible for persons who were illiterate to obtain a
good job, support a family, and live a comfortable life, but those
days are gone. Children who do not learn to read today can expect to
live on the margins of society in every way. Universal literacy is the
ultimate "access" issue in American education. <P>

American schools thus face a new and monumental challenge.  For the
first time, educators are being asked to bring all students to a level
of performance that was demanded of only a relatively few students in
the past. Educational and political leaders understand this challenge,
and a major effort is underway to raise the standard of teaching and
learning in American schools. Improved reading instruction is crucial
to this process. Attainment of the National Education Goals by the
year 2000 will require enhanced reading skills in American students.
Developments such as  national standards in core subjects, new forms
of accountability, or decentralization of school management will have
few positive effects in the absence of  well-conceived reading
instruction. <P>

Attaining such goals also means that ways must be found to address the
learning needs of those students who, for whatever reasons, face
difficulties in learning to read. Doing so is not only a matter of
equity; it is also a practical necessity if the overall objectives of
improving American education as a whole are to be met. <P>

Not only are American schools facing new demands, they also are being
asked to deliver more education without the addition of substantial
new resources. Thus they must become more efficient. Incorporating the
new knowledge we now possess about reading and how to teach it is
imperative if schools are to use their resources effectively and
efficiently.  All students must start reading as soon as they are
developmentally ready to do so, and they must build on basic reading
skills as they move into higher grades. In the absence of such orderly
progression, schools are put in a position of having too many children
in remedial or special education programs.<P>


<B>Toward a Nation of Readers </B><P>

We are living at a pivotal time in the history of American education.
More than ever before, schools are being asked to deliver a higher
level of education and to do so for all students. Meeting this
challenge requires that the process of "learning to read" be securely
underway for virtually all students by the end of the third grade.<P>

No American school would knowingly withhold a vaccine from students
that would prevent a childhood disease like measles. Yet this is, in
effect, what is happening when it comes to the teaching of reading.
Recent gains in our knowledge of the reading process have given us the
tools to help the majority of students, including those with learning
disabilities, to learn to read at the level required to function as
effective individuals, workers, parents, and citizens in today's
world. The challenge is to put this new knowledge in the hands of
teachers, parents, and school administrators so that millions of
American students who otherwise would fail to learn to read will gain
access to this important skill.<P>

<b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word </b><P>

Long before children are able to engage in reading themselves, they
must feel that reading is something they would like to do. They must
develop an appreciation of the pleasures of written language and of
the many ways language is useful. <P>


<b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language </b><P>

Children need to develop a basic sense of what print looks like and
how it works. They must learn how to handle a book, which way to turn
the pages, and that the printed words - not the pictures - tells the
story when you read. Children should be taught that words are all
around them - in newspapers, mail, billboards, signs, and labels - 
and have many different and valuable purposes.<P>


<b>Learn the Alphabet </b><P>

Comfortable and early familiarity with letters is critical for
learning to read. Children should learn the names of letters and to
recognize and form their corresponding shapes. <P>


<b>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words </b><P>

Children need to learn that printed words are made up of ordered
strings of letters, read left to right. They should be helped to
understand that when the combination or order of letters is changed,
the word that is spelled also changes.<P>


<b>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and Phonemes </b><P>

The ability to think about words as a sequence of phonemes is
essential to learning how to read an alphabetic language. Children
should become aware of the building blocks of spoken language. They
need to understand that sentences are made up of strings of separate
words. They should become comfortable in hearing and creating rhymes.
They should be led to play with the sounds of language until they can
pull words apart into syllables, and pull syllables into individual
phonemes.* <P>

<font size=2><I>*A phoneme is the smallest functional unit of speech.  The word "cat"
contains three phonemes: the /k/, /a/, and /t/ sounds.  Letters often represent more than
one phoneme - the <b>a</b> in "cat" is a different sound thant the <b>a</b> in "cake" -
and sometimes a single letter will contain more than one phoneme.  For example, the
word "ox" has two letters but three phonemes: /o/, /k/, and /s/.  Fluent readers learn to
recognize these discrete sounds of spoken words quickly, accurately, and
automatically.  Phonemic awareness is the foundation on which all other reading skills
are built.</I></font><p>

<b>Learn Letter Sounds </b><P>

Given a comfortable familiarity with letters and an awareness of the
sounds of phonemes, children are ready to learn about letter-sound
correspondence. The most important goal at this first stage is to
help children understand that the logic of the alphabetic writing
system is built on these correspondences. <P>


<b>Sound Out New Words </b><P>

As children learn specific letter-sound correspondences, they should
be challenged to use this knowledge to sound out new words in reading
and writing. Making a habit of sounding out unfamiliar words
contributes strongly to reading growth, not just for beginners, but
for all readers. Children need to understand that sounding out new
words can actually be a strategy for helping them unlock
pronunciations of words they have never seen before, and can make
what they are reading understandable.<P>


<b>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily </b><P>

The ability to read with fluency and comprehension depends on
recognizing most words almost instantly and effortlessly. Once the
framework for a new word or spelling has been laid, through sounding
and blending, the key to recognizing it quickly and easily is
practice. The most useful practice is reading and rereading of
meaningful text made up of words the child has been taught to sound
out. For beginners, such reading helps most if it is relatively easy.
As a rule of thumb, no more than one in 20 words should cause
trouble.<P>


<b>Know Spelling Patterns </b><P>

As children become reasonably capable of sounding out words in
reading and spelling, it is important that they notice the
similarities in their spellings. Awareness of spelling patterns that
recur across words hastens progress in reading and writing, and weak
knowledge of spelling is an impediment to mature readers. <P>


<b>Learn to Read Reflectively </b><P>

Although the ability to sound out words is essential for learning to
read, it is not enough. Written language is not just speech written
down. Instead, text brings new vocabulary, new language patterns, new
thoughts, and new modes of thinking. To enjoy and profit from
reading, children must also learn to take the time to reflect on
these aspects of text.<P>

Reading is the single most important educational skill your students
will learn.  Understanding the organization and meaning of text and
instruction in both phonics and literature is essential to helping
young children read. By understanding the prerequisite skills for
reading, teachers can build a solid foundation for their students to
learn and succeed in school.<P>

<b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</b><P>

<ul><li>Share stories with children and invite them to explore a story's
magic.<P>

<li>Share informational texts and invite children to wonder about the new
ideas presented.<P>

<li>Take every opportunity to point out the ways in which reading is
essential to the communications of everyday life (e.g., on labels,                               
instructions, and signs).</ul><P>

<b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language and the Writing System</b><P>

<ul><li>Make sure students know how books are organized. They should be
taught the basics about books--that they are read from left to right
and  top to bottom, that print may be accompanied by pictures or
graphics,  that the pages are numbered, and that the purpose of
reading is to gain meaning from the text and understand ideas that
words convey.<P>

<li>Read to children from books with easy-to-read large print. Use
stories that have predictable words in the text.<P>
<li>Use "big books" to help children notice and learn to recognize words
that occur frequently, such as a, the, is, was, and you.<P>
<li>Label objects in your classroom.</ul><P>

<b>Teach the Alphabet</b><P>

<ul><li>A strong predictor of the ease with which a child learns to read is
his or her familiarity with letters of the alphabet. This familiarity
is a critical building block for learning to read.<P>

<li>It is important to go beyond knowing the names of letters. Students
must also develop a sense of the purpose of letters.<P>

<li>Help them notice the letters in the print that surrounds them and that
you share with them every day.<P>

<li>Engage the students in activities that will help them learn to
recognize letters visually. <P>

<li>Help students learn to form the letters and encourage them to
embellish their  work with their names and with other first attempts
at writing.</ul><P>


<b>Develop the Students' Phonological Awareness</b><P>

<ul><li>In listening and speaking, we pay attention to the meaning of
language rather than to its sound. To learn to read, however,
students must be taught to attend to the sounds, or phonology, of
language. This is necessary for them  to understand how speech is
represented by print. Children with learning disabilities need
special help in learning to develop such phonological awareness.  <P>

<li>Model and demonstrate how to break short sentences into individual
words. For example, use the sentence "Frogs eat bugs," and
demonstrate with chips, cards, or other manipulatives how the
sentence is made up of three words and how the order of the words
matters. Using manipulatives to make sentences, play with each word
and put it in order.  <P>

<li>Develop students' awareness of the sounds of individual words by
asking them  to clap out syllables and to listen for and generate
rhymes.  <P>

<li>Once children are comfortable in playing games with words, syllables,
and rhymes, move onto phonemic awareness.</ul><P>

<b>Develop Phonemic Awareness </b><P>

<ul><li>Phonemic awareness refers to an understanding that words and
syllables are comprised of a sequence of elementary speech sounds.
This understanding  is essential to learning to read an alphabetic
language. The majority of children with reading disabilities fail to
grasp this idea.  <P>
 
<li>In teaching phonemic awareness, the focus of all activities should be
on the sounds  of words, not on letters or spellings. <P> 

<li>Use strategies that make phonemes prominent in children's attention
and perception. For example, model specific sounds, such as /s/ in
the word sat, and ask children to produce each sound in isolation and
in many different words until they are comfortable with the sound and
understand its nature.<P>

<li>Begin with simple words and simple challenges, e.g., listen for
initial /s/ in sat, sit, sip, and sad . . . or for long /e/ in me,
see, bee . . . .<P>

<li>Teach students to blend phonemes into words.  Begin by identifying
just one    phoneme, e.g., /m/-ilk, /s/-at, working gradually toward
blending all the phonemes in words, e.g., /s/-/a/-/t/.<P>

<li>Teach students to identify the separate phonemes within words, e.g.,
what is the first sound of soup?  What is the last sound of kiss?
Beginning phonemes are easier to identify than final phonemes. <P> 

<li>Once students are comfortable listening for individual phonemes,
teach them to break up words, into component sounds, e.g., 
/m/-/oo/-/s/= "moose".<P>

<li>Create a sequence of segmenting and blending activities to help
students develop an understanding of the relationship between sounds
in words.<P>

<li>Provide children with more support when first teaching a task.  For
example, model a sound or strategy for making the sound, and have the
children use the strategy to produce the sound. Model and practice
several examples.  Prompt the children to use the strategy during
guided practice, and gradually add more examples. As the students
master these skills, provide less teacher-directed instruction and
more practice and challenge. <P>

<li>Make teaching phonological awareness a top priority.  Opportunities
to engage in phonological awareness activities should be plentiful,
frequent, brief, and fun.<P>

<li>Phonemic awareness is essential for learning to read, but it is not
enough by itself.  It must be coupled with instruction and practice
in learning the relationship between letters and sounds.</ul> <P>

<b>Teach the Relation of Sounds and Letters </b><P>

<ul><li>Students should learn the letters of the alphabet and discriminate
each letter from the other, because each stands for one or more of
the sounds that occur in spoken words. <P>
<li>When presenting each letter, model its corresponding sound and have
children produce the sound themselves.  For children with learning
disabilities, the teaching  activities must be explicit and
unambiguous. <P>

<li>At first, teach and work with only a few letter-sound correspondences
that have high utility in many words (e.g., /m/ in man, mad, him, and
ham).  Postpone teaching less frequently occurring letters until
students have a firm understanding of how left-to-right spellings
represent first-to-last sounds (alphabetic understanding). </ul><P>


<b>Teach Children How to Sound Out Words</b><P>

<ul><li>After students have mastered a few letter-sound correspondences,
teach them to decode words or sound them out.  Begin with small,
familiar words. Teach the children to sound out the letters, left to
right, and blend them together, searching for the word in memory.  <P>
<li>Model sounding out the word, blending the sounds together and saying
the word.  The ability to sound out new words allows children to
identify and learn new words on their own. <P>

<li>Give children stories containing words that reflect the letter-sound
patterns that have been taught, and encourage them to sound out words
whenever they are uncertain.  <P>

<li>Help children learn spelling conventions, such as the use of final
/e/'s to mark long vowels, by comparing and contrasting lots of
examples. </ul><P>


<b>Teach Children to Spell Words</b><P>

<ul><li>Teach children to spell words by sounding their letters one by one.
Model the sounding and spelling process for children as they spell.<P>

<li>Begin with short words children can sound out, because these words
follow regular spelling  conventions, e.g., cap, bat, and sit instead
of cape, bait or sight.<P>

<li>Begin with simple words that do not contain consonant blends, e.g.,
ham and pan instead of slam and plan.  <P>

<li>Encourage students to use spelling knowledge and strategies regularly
in their own writing. <P>

<li>Introduce spelling conventions systematically.  Begin with words that
exemplify the most frequent and basic conventions, and provide
support and practice to  help students generalize from these words to
others. The goal is to help them see the spelling conventions in the
words.  <P>

<li>Use words in which letter-sound correspondences represent their most
common sounds (e.g., get instead of gem). <P>

<li>Develop a sequence and schedule of opportunities that allow children
to apply and develop facility with sounds and words at their own
pace.  Specify what skills to assess and when to assess them so that
you will know when to move on.  Take into account each student's
background knowledge and pace in moving from sounding out to blending
words to reading connected text. </ul><P>


<b>Help Children Develop Fluent, Reflective Reading</b><p>

<ul><li>Help children learn to read fluently by requiring them to read new
stories and reread old stories every day.  <P>
<li>Help children extend their experience with the words, language, and
ideas in books by interactively reading harder texts with them and to
them every day.<P>

<li>Relate information in books to other events of interest to children,
such as holidays, pets, siblings, and games. Engage children in
discussion of the topics.<P>
<li>In both stories and informational texts, encourage wondering.  For
example, "I wonder what Pooh will do now?" "How do you think the
father feels ?" or "I wonder what frogs do in the winter?  Do you
think that's a problem?  Why?" <P>
<li>Model comprehension strategies and provide students with guided
assistance.<P>

<li>Point out how titles and headings tell what a book is about.  <P>
Help students identify the main ideas presented in the text, as well
as the supporting detail. Graphics help to reveal main ideas, and the
relationship between text and graphics helps students understand what
they are reading.<P>

<li>Point out unfamiliar words and explore their meaning.  Revisit these
words frequently and encourage students to use them in their own
conversations.<P>

<li>Show children how to analyze contextual clues to figure out the
meaning of an unfamiliar word. Research shows that most vocabulary
growth comes from learning new words in reading.</ul><P>

Parents can have a strong positive influence on their child's
reading. Research has shown that enjoying books with a child for even
a few minutes a day can make a measurable difference in the
acquisition of basic reading skills, and that everyday activities - 
such as a trip to the grocery store - can be turned into enjoyable
learning experiences. <P>

Following is a list of ways in which parents can encourage the
development of the  skills needed by children in order for them to
become good readers.  <P>

<b>Create Appreciation of the Written Word</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Find time to read aloud with your child every day. Typically,
parents play an important role in developing this skill by reading to
children and showing how important reading is to their daily life.
Lap time with picture books and stories can strongly motivate your
child to enjoy reading. Try to make these books available for your
children to explore and enjoy on their own as well.</ul><P>


<b>Develop Awareness of Printed Language </b><P>

<ul> <li> Teach about books. When reading aloud to your child, let your child
open the book and turn the pages. Point to the words as you read.
Draw attention to repeated phrases, inviting your child to join in
each time they occur. <P>
  
<li> Point out letters and words that you run across in daily life. Make
an obvious effort to read aloud traffic signs, billboards, notices,
labels on packages, maps, and phone numbers. Make outings a way to
encourage reading by showing your child how printed words relate to
daily living.</ul><P>


<b>Learn the Alphabet </b><P>

<ul> <li> Play alphabet games. Sing the alphabet song to help your child learn
letters as you play with alphabet books, blocks, and magnetic
letters. Recite letters as you go up and down stairs or give pushes
on a swing. A-B-C, dot-to-dot and letter-play workbooks, games, and
puzzles are available at most toy stores. Many engaging computer
games are designed for teaching children letters. Make sure these
toys are available even when you are unable to play along.<P>
 
<li> Watch "Sesame Street" with your child. Show the child how to sing
along, answer the riddles, and engage actively in its fun.<P>

<li> Make writing materials available to your child and encourage their
use. Help your child learn to write his/her name and other important
words or phrases. Gradually, help the child learn to write more and
more letters. At first, most children find it easier to write
uppercase letters.</ul> <P>

 
<b>Understand the Relation of Letters and Words</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Teach your child to spell a few special words, such as his/her name,
"stop," or "exit." Challenge the child to read these words every
place they are seen. Draw attention to these and other frequently
occurring words as you read books with your child. Challenge the
child to read these words as they arise or to search them out on a
page. Play word-building games with letter tiles or magnetic letters.
Have the child build strings of letters for you to read.</ul><P>


<b>Understand That Language is Made of Words, Syllables, and Phonemes</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Sing songs and read rhyming books. Sing the alphabet with your
child, and teach your child songs that emphasize rhyme and
alliteration, such as "Willaby Wallaby Woo" and "Down By the Sea."
Emphasize the sounds as you sing. Play rhyming games and clap out
names. Jumble the wording or word order of familiar poems and
challenge your child to detect the error. Talk like a robot, syllable
by syllable.<P>
 
<li> Play word games. Challenge your child to play with words. For
example, ask your child to  think of words that rhyme with "bat" or
begin with /m/. What would be left if you took the /k/ sound out of
"cat"? What would you have if you put these sounds together: /p/ and
ickle; /m/ and ilk; and /s/, /a/, and /t/. Which of these words
starts with a different sound -- "bag", "candy", "bike"? Do "boat"
and "baby" start with the same sound?</ul><P>


<b>Learn Letter Sounds</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Sound out letters. Point out other words that begin with the same
letter as your child's name, drawing attention to the similarities of
the begining sound. Use alphabet books, computer games, or car games
such as, "I'm thinking of something that starts with /b/" to engage
the child in alliterative and letter-sound play. If you have a book
that lends itself to alliteration and rhyme, such as a Dr. Seuss
book, sound out rhyming words as you read or challenge the child to
do so for you. Play word games that connect sounds with syllables and
words. For example: If this spells "cat," how do you spell "hat"?</ul><P>


<b>Sound Out New Words </b><P>

<ul> <li> Point out new words.  As you encounter them, say the sound while
touching each letter in a new word. For example, say "s-u-n" and then
blend sounds to create the word. In practicing new words, use
predictable words with common sounds and spellings, like "fun" or
"sat" instead of "night" or "saw." <P>
 
<li> If you encounter words with unknown meanings or with complex
spellings, encourage your child to try to sound out the words.
However, if too many words require this kind of attention and effort,
it is best to find an easier book.<P>
 
<li> Play spelling games with your child. After your child begins
pronouncing words, encourage spelling by saying each sound in the
words and then writing the letter that goes with the sound.<P>
 
<li> Encourage your child to spell. After your child has learned to
pronounce words, have the child say each sound.<P>
 
<li> Independent writing. Encourage your child to use inventive or
independent spelling. At this stage, the child will tend to omit
letters and confuse letter names with letter sounds, producing such
spellings as LFNT for elephant, BN for bean, and FARE for fairy. Use
correction wisely. You should be most concerned about is the child's
sensitivity to the sounds that need to be represented.</ul><P>
 

<b>Identify Words in Print Accurately and Easily</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Help your children to read easy, enjoyable stories as often as
possible.  It is likely that your child will enjoy reading more and
learn more from reading if you sit together, taking turns reading and
encouraging discussion. In the beginning, invite the child to read
well-chosen words. Gradually, as the child becomes able, take turns
with sentences, speakers, paragraphs, and pages. At the end of each
section or story, revisit those words that caused trouble. Rereading
the entire story over several days, and again weeks later, is a
powerful way to reinforce this learning. </ul><P>
 

<b>Know Spelling Patterns</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Now it becomes useful to point out the similarities between words
such as will, fill, and hill or light, night, and sight. This is also
the time to help your child learn the correct spelling of the words
he/she writes.</ul><P>
 

<b>Learn to Read Reflectively</b> <P>

<ul> <li> Pause for discussions as you read. As you read stories to and with
your child, stop frequently to discuss their language, content, and
relevance to real life and other knowledge. Pause to explore the
meanings of new words, using them in other sentences and contrasting
what they mean with words that have similar meanings. Make an effort
to revisit new words and concepts later, when the book has been put
aside. When reading stories, pause to discuss the various characters,
problems, events in the story, and invite your child to think about
how the problems might be solved or to wonder about what might happen
next. When resuming a story, ask your child to review what has
happened so far, drawing attention to looming mysteries and
unresolved conflicts. In reading expository text, invite the child to
marvel at the creatures or events described and to wonder about
details or connections not mentioned by the text. </ul><P>

<b>Above all: Read, read, and re-read </b><P>

<b><i>What is the Researchers as Resources on Reading Network?</b></i><p>
The researchers who have agreed to serve as resources are listed in
the attached directory called Researchers as Resources on Reading
Network. These researchers are experts on the research-based
principals of reading instruction and include some of the premier
scholars in reading and learning disabilities. All of the researchers
have extensive experience working with parents, teachers, and schools
to improve reading programs for students with learning disabilities.<P>

<b><I>What can I expect the researchers to do?</b></i><P>
Researchers affiliated with the network anticipate phone calls and
other forms of communication from parents and school district
personnel who wish to tap the expertise of the network. Limited
advice, assistance, and consultation will be provided voluntarily,
with more complicated arrangements such as on-site technical
assistance to be made solely at the discretion of the researchers and
the school. Arrangements for any consultation or technical assistance
involving payment are to be negotiated between the researcher and the
schools or school districts and will not involve the network. It is
important to seek a careful match between your needs and the
researcher's expertise and interests. In addition to general
expertise in reading instruction, a researcher may have specialized
knowledge that can be applied to your specific situation or problems.
While specialized knowledge is important, the researcher network does
not identify this particular expertise.<P>

<B><I>How can I work with the researchers?</B></I><P>
When you contact a researcher, it is important that you have clearly
identified the areas in which you want technical assistance. If you
need help in defining your questions, tell the researcher. He or she
may be able to assist you in clarifying problem areas that need to be
addressed. As you work with the researcher, it is important to
continue to identify the important areas to be addressed. <P>

To get the best answers to your reading questions 
remember to:<BR>
 
<ul><LI>Clearly identify what you want from the researcher, even if it is
help in defining your questions; <BR>

<li>Continually check to be sure you are receiving the help you want;
and <br>

<li>Provide the researcher with clear information about the context in
which your students will learn to read. </ul><p>

<B><I>How do I contact members of the network?</B></I><p>
You should contact members of the network directly. An office
telephone number (O) and a fax number (FX) are listed for each
researcher.<P>

<B><I>How long will the network be in existence?</B></I><P>
The network will exist from July 10, 1996 to July 10, 1997.<P>

<B><I>Who should I contact for more information about the network?</B></I><P>
To obtain more information about the network, contact Jane Burnette at the ERIC/OSEP Special Project, ERIC Clearinghouse on
Disabilities and Gifted Education, The Council for Exceptional
Children, 703-264-9419. This clearinghouse will maintain the Researchers as
Resources on Reading Network. However, members' arrangements with
schools or districts are at their own discretion and will not involve
the network management. <P>

<b><i>READINGS AND RESOURCES ABOUT READING INSTRUCTION FOR
YOUNG CHILDREN WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES (E540bib)</b></i><P>

July 1996<p>   

<b><i>Adams, M. J. (1990). Beginning to read: Thinking and learning about print. The 
MIT Press, 55 Hayward St., Cambridge, MA 02142.  494pp.</b></i><br>
    Drawing on an array of research on the nature and development of reading 
proficiency, this book argues that educators need not remain trapped in the 
phonics versus teaching-for-meaning dilemma and offers instructional 
alternatives.  The book proposes that phonics can work together with the 
whole-language approach to reading and provides an integrated treatment of the 
knowledge and processes involved in skillful reading, the issues surrounding 
their acquisition, and the implications for reading instruction.  The book 
stresses the importance of preschool language and literacy experiences and 
includes descriptions of those that will best prepare children for reading 
instruction. <P>

<b><i>Blachman, B. A. (1991).  Early intervention for children's reading problems: 
Clinical applications of the research in phonological awareness.  Topics in 
Language Disorders, 12(1), 51-65.  UMI*</b></i><br>
    This article reviews research on training phonological awareness in 
kindergarten and first-grade children and describes research-based intervention 
and assessment activities applicable to classroom and clinical settings.  
Intervention applications include categorization activities, phoneme 
segmentation, and metalinguistic games. <p>

<b><i>Brady, S. et al. (1994). Training phonological awareness: A study with 
inner-city kindergarten children. Annals of Dyslexia, 44, 26-59. UMI*</b></i><br>
   Inner-city kindergarten children (n=24) were given an 18-week phonological 
awareness training program, that incorporated auditory and articulatory 
techniques for fostering metaphonological development.  Compared to controls, 
subjects had greater gains in phonological awareness at the end of kindergarten 
and had a trend toward better reading skills in first grade.<P>

<b><i>Cunningham, P. M., & Allington, R. L. (1991).  Words, letters, sounds, and big 
books: A beary good approach.  Learning, 20(2), 91-92, 94-95. UMI*</b></i><br>
   Describes how primary teachers can use decoding strategies within a 
literature-based, whole-language setting.  A three-stage approach involves the 
book stage (real reading), the word stage (learning words), and the letter-sound
stage (learning sounds).  The article provides sample activities. <P>

<b><i>Curtin, J. (1993).  The effectiveness of the reading recovery program on reading
achievement.  (ED363863) 12p. ERIC Document Reproduction Service
(EDRS)**</b></i><br>
   A study examined the effect of the Reading Recovery program on the reading 
achievement of first-grade students.  Subjects, 60 third-grade students in a 
Chicago public school with 97% Hispanic and 3% White student population, 
completed the Iowa Tests of Basic Skills.  Test scores for the 30 students who 
were tutored using Reading Recovery lessons in first grade were compared to the 
scores of the 30 students who were not tutored.  Results indicated that the 
students tutored in Reading Recovery did not obtain significantly different 
reading achievement gains compared to those students who received only classroom
instruction.  Findings affirm the goals of the Reading Recovery program, which 
are to assist the lowest reading achievers in first grade to reach the median of
their class and to maintain the rate of gain.<P>

   This paper discusses several strategies for promoting literacy, which 
teachers can share with parents of exceptional children who are having 
difficulty learning to read and write.  Strategies include: reading aloud to 
children, modeling reading behavior, writing to and with children, and 
responding to children's reading and writing. <P>

   First-grade and second-grade teachers (N=275) were surveyed concerning their

Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association (Chicago, IL,

(EDRS)**</b></i><br>
    The process of teaching reading to 12 second- and third-grade 
learning-disabled children was investigated in mainstream classrooms and 
resource rooms.  The study focused on how the process of achieving 
intersubjectivity in a routine task like reading takes place and how the 
construction of intersubjectivity (referred to as scaffolding) can vary as a 
result of the teacher norms being brought to the task.  Transcripts of 
teacher-child interaction were coded according to Vygotskian principles.  
Resource teachers were found to apply these principles more consistently than 
mainstream teachers.  As a result, resource teachers had longer interactions 
with children in which they made more adjustments that catered to a reader's 
zone of proximal development.  Students in resource rooms were also more likely 
to have successful reading episodes and were more likely to initiate interaction.  It is
concluded that resource room teacher-child interactions were longer because
mainstream teachers persisted in the use of the recitation model  of teaching to a
greater extent than did resource teachers, and because mainstream classroom settings
used a more hierarchical physical arrangement of space and the teacher's position.

   A longitudinal study examined the contributions of early language ability, 
home characteristics, and merging knowledge about literacy to children's later 
decoding and comprehension ability.  The study followed 127 children from the 
beginning of kindergarten to the end of grade 3 (when 83 were left).  Subjects 
attended schools in a small, rural, midwestern town or a low-income area of a 
small midwestern city.  Results indicated that: (1) individual differences in 
decoding ability have little effect on children's reading comprehension, and 
vice versa; (2) early language understanding predicts reading comprehension; (3)
emerging knowledge about reading predicts subsequent decoding ability; (4) 
children's early interest in and involvement in literacy predicts gains in 
reading and (5) home problems had a negative prediction on reading.  Findings 
suggest support for integrating cognitive processing models, developmental 
models, and social constructivist models. <P>

   The Success for All (SFA) program was designed as a K-3 preventive and 
intensive intervention for students at risk of failing to learn to read for the 
purpose of bringing every student to grade level in reading by third grade.  Key
program elements include individualized tutoring, regrouping across grades into 
homogeneous reading classes, smaller reading classes, family support, and a 
comprehensive reading program.  This paper presents findings of a study that 
examined the effects of the SFA program on student reading achievement in four 
cities. Specifically, the study sought to assess student achievement when the 
SFA program is introduced in settings geographically removed from program 
developers.  A comparison of individual reading test results with those of 
matched control groups indicated advantages at three of the sites, with 
particular advantages for the lowest-achieving 25 percent of students relative 
to their control counterparts at all four sites.  Results also indicate that the
SFA program can be replicated at distant locations with limited monitoring by 
program developers.   <P>

     A 3-year research project, employing qualitative inquiry in
a pair of preschool and primary grade classrooms (one self-contained and one
integrated at each level), was undertaken to
examine the literacy learning difficulties of school-aged
children with developmental disabilities.  The multi-site case
studies of the first phase of the project used the constant
comparative method of data collection and analysis.  Analysis of
the first year of the project reveals two primary themes:
technology and inclusion.  Technology facilitated literacy
learning opportunities when: it was available; teachers were
competent users and programmers of the devices; and teachers had
ample time to adapt materials.  Inclusion facilitated learning
when: peers had a clear understanding of and experiences with
their roles; and the individual needs of all students were
considered. <P>

READINGS</b></i><P>

October 1991<p>   

Sandra L. Berger<P>

<b><i>Angevine, C.  (1989).  Give the learning disabled child the gift of 
time-academic learning time.  Academic Therapy, 24(5), 607-610.  </b></i><br>
Provides a list of five specific strategies to promote high academic learning and student 
success.<P>

<b><i>Armstrong, T.  (1987).  In their own way:  Discovering and encouraging your 
child's personal learning style.   Los Angeles CA:  St. Martin's Press. </b></i><br> A 
former teacher and learning disabilities specialist describes learning 
differences and provides suggestions.    <P>

<b><i>Barton, J., & Starnes, W. (1989).  Identifying distinguishing characteristics of
gifted and talented/learning disabled students.  Roeper Review, 12(1), 23-29. 
</b></i><br>
Discusses the use of the WISC-R subtest scores as a means of identifying gifted 
children with learning disabilities.  The extent and nature of differences among
subgroups on the WISC-R can reflect the kind and severity of learning 
disability.<P>

<b><i>Baum, S. (1984).  Recognizing special talents in learning disabled students. 
Teaching Exceptional Children, 16(2), 92-98. </b></i><br> Discusses approaches to
working 
with learning disabled students who are also gifted, talented, or creative.  An 
example of a secondary student with special abilities in photography is used.<P>

<b><i>Baum, S. (1984).  Meeting the needs of learning disabled gifted students.  
Roeper Review, 7(1), 16-19.  </b></i><br> Provides general information on G/LD
children and discusses a rationale for providing enrichment activities within the
framework of the gifted program.  Program ideas using Renzulli's Enrichment Triad
Model are suggested as well as identification strategies.<P>

evaluation results.<P>

<b><i>Baum, S. & Owen, S.  (1988).  High ability/learning disabled students:  How are 
they different?  Gifted Child Quarterly, 32(3), 321-325.  </b></i><br> Reports 
characteristics that distinguish high ability/LD students from LD students with 
average cognitive abilities.   Conclusions indicate that high ability/LD 
students were more creative than average LD students, but cause the most 
classroom disturbances and perceive themselves as less efficacious in academic 
tasks.<P>

<b><i>Boodoo, G. (1989).  A survey of procedures used for identifying gifted learning 
disabled children.  Gifted Child Quarterly, 33(3), 110-114.  </b></i><br> The results of
this study indicate that not many gifted learning disabled children are identified or
served in the educational setting.  A strategy is suggested for identifying G/LD
children in which the classroom teacher plays a major role.<P>

<b><i>Bos, C.  (1983).  Comprehensive monitoring.  The Pointer, 27(2).  </b></i><br>
Presents strategies to improve reading comprehension by teaching LD students to
search actively for information and concepts.<P>

To shed light on appropriate grouping practices for early adolescents, this article
presents current data on using between-class grouping and regrouping in American
schools serving this population, based on the 1988 Johns Hopkins University middle
school survey. Findings show that learning opportunities in the middle grades remain
highly stratified. <P>

Analysis of essays comparing experiences in gifted and regular classes written by sixth
grade gifted students found that many students felt teachers and peers outside the
gifted class had unfair expectations of them. Other topics addressed by students
included grading, group work, lack of acknowledgement for effort, treatment by peers,
and teacher expectations. <P>

Program.</b></i><br>
This study investigated attitudes of educators from both the middle school movement
and gifted education, by means of a survey of 400 members of relevant professional
organizations. The survey focused on six interest clusters: (1) grouping strategies, (2)
identification issues, (3) curriculum modifications, (4) teacher preparation, (5) program
evaluation, and (6) the emotional/social needs of gifted students. Opposing attitudes
were found for two clusters: first, grouping practices (with educators of the gifted
favoring ability grouping and middle school educators opposing such grouping) and
second, social development (with only middle school educators seeing the "gifted" label
as creating social adjustment problems). On the remaining clusters the groups had the
same opinions but differed in how strongly they felt. Educators of gifted students felt
more strongly that the regular curriculum was not challenging enough for gifted
students, that the programs for gifted students should address the emotional needs of
the students, and that middle school teachers need more staff development in the
characteristics and needs of gifted students. Educators of the gifted ranked their top
three priorities as curriculum, teacher preparation, and appropriate identification while
middle school educators selected curriculum, grouping practices, and teacher
preparation as most important. The survey form and 24 references are attached.<P>

Thirty sixth graders in accelerated mathematics classes were taught in cooperative
learning teams for 12 weeks.  Students appeared to benefit academically, personally,
and socially from the cooperative learning strategies used to teach mathematics,
cooperative learning skills, effective communications, internal locus of control, and
personal responsibility in decision-making.<P>

A 1988 Johns Hopkins University survey gathered data on organizational variations

In spring 1988, the Johns Hopkins Center for Research on Elementary and Middle
Schools (CREMS) conducted a national survey of principals in 2,400 public middle
grade schools that include grade 7. Using the 1988 survey date, this document
presents an overview of educational approaches and practices in schools that serve
early adolescents. Topics examined include: (1) grade span; (2) size; (3) grouping; (4)
number of teachers per students; (5) changing classmates; (6) homeroom and advisory
periods; (7) guidance counselors; (8) teams of teachers; (9) curriculum; (10) instruction;
(11) goals for students; (12) transitions and articulation practices; (13) remediation; (14)
report card entries; (15) teacher certification; and (16) teacher talents. This
document also summarizes principals' reports of their overall evaluation of present
practices and presents four conclusions regarding middle grades reform based on
survey data. The survey is appended. <P>

This paper examines gifted education in the context of current educational reform
efforts. It offers a rationale for the differentiated education of gifted students based on
American values and equitable allocation of educational resources. Examples are
offered of curriculum content modification for math, science, language arts, and social
studies which utilize four approaches: (1) acceleration, (2) enrichment, (3)
sophistication, and (4) novelty. The relationship of gifted education to the America 2000
program and to the six national education goals is noted. The paper then reviews major
reform efforts in the areas of accountability, the middle school concept, and cooperative
learning. Issues remaining to be solved are also identified and include personnel
preparation, unidentified students (e.g., the culturally different), curricular options,
strategies and metathinking, and the value of the term, "gifted," itself. <P>

for Education Statistics (ED).</b></i><br>
The National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88), a longitudinal study
sponsored by the National Center for Education Statistics, provides trend data about
transitions experienced as young people develop, attend school, and embark on
careers. The study began with a national sample of about 26,000 eighth graders in
1988
and follows these students at 2-year intervals through high school and further. Findings
of the base year are summarized, drawn from the descriptive summary "A Profile of the
American Eighth Grader" by A. Hafner and others (1990). Characteristics of sample
members, in-school and out-of-school experiences, and aspirations and choice
behaviors are described. The paper is divided into three sections: (1) background on
the
study; (2) cross-sectional findings from the NELS:88 base year, with 24 tables and 16
graphs; and (3) issues for the next wave of data. Appendix 1 describes generating the
sample; Appendix 2 gives a chart of key questionnaire items. <P>

Staffing patterns can significantly affect educators' efforts to provide high-quality
instruction and create positive teacher/student relations in the middle grades. State
data and Johns Hopkins University survey results are used to show how staffing
patterns serving one goal may interfere with accomplishing another goal. Corrective
staffing measures are suggested. <P>

adolescents' developmental needs embody the best features of effective gifted
programs.<P>

Schatz, E. (Feb 1990).  Ability Grouping for Gifted Learners as It Relates to School
Reform and Restructuring.  Madison:  Wisconsin State Dept. of Education.</b></i><br>
This monograph uses a question-answer format to address issues concerned with
meeting the needs of gifted students as Wisconsin schools restructure and change
grouping practices as part of raising standards of learning for all students. Among 12
questions considered are the following: (1) Aren't some of the principles of middle level
education, cooperative learning and whole class instruction in reading harmful from the
standpoint of providing appropriate programs to gifted students? (2) Isn't acceleration a
necessary component of gifted education but contradictory to the middle level
philosophy? (3) If one views middle level education as anti-tracking and anti-ability
grouping, then how is grouping at the middle of the pyramid ever acceptable? (4)
"Doesn't participation in Midwest Talent Search promote labeling and an "earlier
is better" approach to gifted education? (5) Don't research reports and declining test
scores clearly support as little ability grouping as possible at all levels of education? (6)
Won't cooperative learning increase boredom in gifted students and hold them back?
(7) How can young gifted readers be challenged by whole class instruction in reading?
and (8) How can we be sure school districts are asking the right questions about gifted
education as these strategies are implemented? <P>

The emphasis of middle school philosophy on heterogeneous grouping is examined in
relationship to the needs of gifted learners. Arguments supporting such grouping based
on developmental needs of young adolescents, social discrimination, and the need for
positive role models are considered. Cooperative learning is seen to be an unproven
instructional method with this population.<P>

</b></i><br>
This chapter reviews recent trends toward increasing emphasis on excellence in
American business and applies these trends to school reform and restructuring in the
context of gifted education. First, it notes the main ideas of recent business and
education excellence studies which call for radical changes in the American education
system. Examined is the dilemma of balancing the educational demands of equity and
excellence especially in an age of major demographic shifts. A quality-oriented
paradigm is proposed which merges equity and excellence and focuses on the
individual thus replacing the industrial model paradigm which focused on the "system".
The issue of ability grouping is considered and research supporting within class
grouping is cited. Concepts underlying the middle school approach are noted as
another example where the equity/excellence dilemma and grouping concerns emerge.
"Equifinality" is offered as a concept which suggests many potential ways to reach
resolution especially when the focus is always on the individual gifted learner and the
teacher/facilitator. <P>

Comparison of the fields of gifted education and middle school education indicates
some major differences in such areas as organizing for instruction, how students learn,
mainstreaming, delivery of instruction, affective needs, and the concept of giftedness.

A variety of beliefs and practices central to middle schools may cause special difficulties
for gifted learners.  Such practices often focus on potentially competing goals of student
competencies versus student excellence and include such practices as heterogeneous
grouping, cooperative learning, and an absence of clearly defined middle school
curricula.<P>

This study investigated differences among intellectually gifted students of junior high
age participating in full time intensive programs for the gifted.  Findings indicated some
differences based on ethnicity and gender, but most differences were observed
between lower and higher socioeconomic groups, particularly for social support and
social and behavioral self concept.<P>

<b><i>READINGS AND RESOURCES ON AUTISM</b></i><P>

July 1995 <p>

<b><i>Aarons, M., & Gittens, T. (1992).  The handbook of autism: A guide for
parents and professionals.  Routledge, 29 W. 35th St., New York, NY 
10001-2291.  28pp. </b></i><BR>
     This book attempts to dispel common myths associated with 
autism while providing practical, up-to-date suggestions and 
information for parents and practitioners working with autistic 
students.  The history and etiology of autism are explored, and 
problems of diagnosis are outlined. Considerations for teaching, 
management, and counseling of autistic students are included, and 
possible alternate treatments and cures for autism are described.<P>

<b><i>Amenta, C. A. III. (1992). Russell is extra special:  A book about 
autism for children. Brunner-Mazel Publishers, 19 Union Square, New 
York, NY 10003.  32pp. </b></i><BR>
     This portrayal of an autistic boy and his family is designed 
to help children (ages 4-8) and their parents understand this serious 
developmental disorder.  This book uses photographs to illustrate the 
boy's family life and daily activities.  Russell's mood swings, 
problems with learning, communication, behavior, sleeping, and social 
skills are detailed. <p>

<b><i>Berkell, Dianne E. (Ed.) (1992).  Autism: Identification, education, 
and treatment.  Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., 365 Broadway, 
Hillsdale, NJ 07642.  319pp. </b></i><BR>
     This collection of 12 papers is intended to provide an 
understanding of the autistic syndrome and information regarding 
effective diagnostic and treatment approaches.  Part I introduces the 
reader to autism by providing an overview of past and current 
philosophies and practices in the field.  Part II deals with 
intervention practices and strategies including approaches to 
assessment and instruction.  Part III addresses emerging trends in 
autism such as family involvement and services, early intervention, 
community integration, and supported employment.<p>

<b><i>Biklen, D. (1993). Communication unbound:  How facilitated 
communication is challenging traditional views of autism and 
ability/disability.  Teachers College Press, Columbia University, 1234
Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10027.  221pp.</b></i><BR>
     This book introduces "facilitated communication," a method of 
assisting people with autism to communicate by means of physical 
assistance in typewriting.  The book is organized around the author's 
own experience using the facilitated communication method, with 
examples of fieldwork using qualitative research to illustrate 
particular points and principals.  Experiences of care givers and 
parents are described, as they confront the controversies surrounding 
the use of facilitated communication and witness its successes and 
failures.<p>

<b><i>Davis, K. (1990).  Adapted physical education for students with 
autism. Charles C. Thomas, 2600 S. 1st St., Springfield, IL 
62794-9265.  126pp. </b></i><BR>
     This book is written for teachers of physical education, and 
adapted physical education working with students with autism.  
Included are the Institute for the Study of Developmental Disabilities
Gross Motor Checklist, assessments and reports, a behavior plan, 
sports skills check lists, adapted sports rules, teaching hints, 
suggestions for gymnasium activity areas, lists of resources and 
materials on autism and on gross motor aspects of autism.<p>

<b><i>Frith, U. (1989). Autism:  Explaining the enigma.  Basil Blackwell, 
238 Main St., Suite 501, Cambridge, MA  02142.  208pp.</b></i><BR>
     The theory of autism presented in this book sees the key 
problem as an inability to integrate pieces of information into 
coherent wholes, and in so doing make sense of the mind's own 
activities, thoughts, beliefs, and feelings.  The history of autism 
research is reviewed and key phenomena illustrated through case 
studies.<p>

<b><i>Groden, G., & Baron, G. M. (Eds.) (1991).  Autism:  Strategies for 
change.  A comprehensive approach to the education and treatment of 
children with autism and related disorders. Gardner Press, Inc., 19 
Union Square West, New York, NY 10003.  244pp.</b></i><BR>
     This book offers a blueprint on how to bring about change in 
program planning and management as well as in clinical and educational
practice for individuals with autism.  The model that is presented 
emphasizes the importance of children and young adults learning 
procedures to manage their own behaviors instead of being externally 
controlled.  The model also emphasizes working intensively with 
families to enhance children's home behaviors and functioning.<p>

or less impaired peers, and each includes parent training.  Each 
program emphasizes the importance of making appropriate plans for the 
child's movement to a different educational setting beyond the 
preschool years.<p>

delayed onset autism.  The family's efforts to cope with the diagnosis
of the child's condition are described, as is the family's determined 
9-year search through a wide variety of treatments and educational

theoretical framework.  University Press of America, 4720 Boston Way, 
Lanham, MD 20706.  75pp.</b></i><BR>
     The book presents a holistic approach to autism based on the 
premise that etiology comprises biological (genetic variation) and 
environmental (stress) factors.  The first chapter briefly considers 
etiology, behavior (biosocial, affective, cognitive, and 
affective-cognitive), and treatment.  The second chapter examines the 
psychodiagnostic use of human-figure drawing.  The third chapter 
presents a biosocial approach to personality assessment.  <p>

reaching the autistic child.  Woodbine House, 6510 Bells Mill Rd., 
Bethesda, MD 20817.  255pp.</b></i><BR>
     The book describes the treatment approach used with autistic 
children at the Linwood Children's Center in Ellicott City, Maryland. 
Basic to the Linwood method are four tenets:  (1) the child is 
accepted in his totality; (2) the focus of treatment is on the health 
of the child; (3) all education is therapy, all therapy is education; 
(4) therapy is flexible.  The three treatment elements are 
observations, establishing relationships, and changing behaviors.  
Chapter topics include shaping behavior, limit setting, compulsions, 
language and thought processes, and social and emotional development. <p>

State Associations for the gifted traditionally are advocacy organizations for gifted
students.  Membership in these organizations includes parents, teachers,
administrators, and researchers concerned with the education of gifted students.  State
associations lobby for legislation, provide information, sponsor annual conventions,
organize workshops, and offer support to parents and teachers attempting to meet the
needs of gifted children.  Listed below are the contact addresses of those state
associations for which ERIC EC has current information.  We appreciate the assistance
of the Duke University Talent Identification program in compiling this list.<P>

  This paper analyzes and synthesizes information on assessment of attention deficit
disorder (ADD), to provide guidance to states as they formulate  policies and practices.
The paper presents an overview of ADD from an  educational perspective, focusing on
student characteristics, developmental  patterns, and coexisting disorders.  Schoolwide
assessment of all students is  recommended, to screen for problems and to monitor
individual social and  academic progress.  This schoolwide assessment would be
followed by  modification of learning environments, and subsequent individual
evaluation of  only those students in need of additional assistance.  The paper identifies
the  best composition for a multidisciplinary assessment team, describes phases in  the
assessment process, and describes various strategies appropriate for  individual
student assessments in school settings.  Instruments used in the  assessment process
are provided, including the Conflict Behavior Questionnaire,  Skamp Rating Scale,
Home Situations Questionnaire-Revised, School Situations  Questionnaire-Revised,
and Academic Performance Rating Scale.  A brief paper by  Jeanne M. Kincaid titled
"Legal Considerations Pertaining to the Evaluation of  ADD/ADHD" and a paper by
Perry A. Zirkel titled "A Checklist for Determining  Legal Eligibility of ADD/ADHD
Students" are appended.  A list of parent support  groups and information centers
concludes the paper.  (Contains 26 references.)  (JDD)<br>   Descriptors: *Attention

  This report presents school-based interventions that teachers can employ in  regular
classrooms to educate students with attention deficit disorders (ADD).   The report
attempts to compensate for the limitations in the ADD research  literature by
extrapolating from research on other difficult-to-teach students  to identify and describe
academic and social skills interventions that are  likely to be effective in regular
classrooms with students who have ADD.  The  first chapter provides an overview of
the interventions and explains procedures  followed in selecting the interventions.  Each
of the remaining eight chapters  focuses on a single intervention program.  These
include: (1) classwide peer  tutoring, (2) early literacy program, (3) "Tribes," (4)
self-regulated strategy  development in writing, (5) earth science videodisc program, (6)
skills for  school success, (7) aggression replacement training, and (8) life-centered
career education.  Each of the eight chapters provides a description of the
intervention's purpose, its content and activities, implementation  requirements, impact
on teachers, significant costs, testimonials of  effectiveness, limitations, research
support, contact point for more  information, and a list of references.  To a large extent,
the program  developers, as well as the teachers and administrators who are using the
programs successfully, describe the interventions in their own words.  (JDD) <br>

  This paper provides guidelines on how to identify and work with students with
attention deficit disorder (ADD).  It begins by outlining common symptoms of  ADD in
the classroom and general principles for the incorporation of medication  into school life.
The paper presents features of schools successful in dealing  with ADD.  School-wide
suggestions emphasize individualizing classroom and  lesson planning, using
cooperative learning, pairing ADD students with non-ADD  peers, and using checklists
to formalize communication between the school and  the home.  Further suggestions
provide for serving the student with ADD within  the classroom context and as an
individual learner.  Principles of behavior  management effective in working with
students with ADD are also presented.  (PB)<br>

  This briefing paper is intended to improve understanding of attention/deficit
hyperactivity disorder (Ad/HD)--what it is, what to look for, and what to do.  Three
subtypes are identified: (1) the predominantly combined type; (2) the  predominantly
inattentive type; and (3) the predominantly hyperactive/impulsive  type.  Causes and
incidence of ADHD are briefly addressed.  Signs of ADHD are  discussed, including
inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.  Essential  diagnostic features of the
syndrome based on the Diagnostic and Statistical  Manual of Mental Disorders (4th
edition) are listed, and components and sources  of a professional diagnostic evaluation
for ADHD are explained.  The discussion  of ADHD treatment addresses: effects of
improved understanding of ADHD,  behavior management, medication, and educational
intervention.  Provision of  special educational services is also considered and basic
guidelines for  educational intervention are listed.  Parents are given suggestions on
what to  do if their child is found ineligible for services, how to help their child  improve
his/her self-esteem, and how to find parent support groups.  (Contains  7 references, a
listing of 21 readings and resources, a listing of 2 policy  clarifications of the Department
of Education on ADHD, and a list of 6  organizations.) (DB)<br>   Descriptors: *Attention

  Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are provided 
for under three federal statutes: the Individuals with Disabilities Education 
Act (IDEA), Part B; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.  State education agencies have 
ultimate responsibility for providing a free appropriate education for students 
with this disability by providing services directly, by contracting for 
services, or by delegating responsibility to local education agencies.  To meet 
legal requirements, schools must identify and provide services for eligible 
children, educate children with ADHD along with nondisabled children to the 
extent possible, eliminate practices and policies that allow disabled children 
to be suspended or expelled for more than 10 days for behavior associated with 
their disability, and follow procedural safeguards outlined in IDEA.  Because 
state education agencies are responsible for school oversight, a state's 
education policymakers have a clear mandate to formulate policy and develop a 
state plan for educating disabled students.  To prevent school failure for 
children with ADHD and unnecessary lawsuits, they must be sure the policy and 
plan are known and implemented in the state's schools.  Questions that 
policymakers need to ask about providing services to students with ADHD are 
listed.  Efforts in Kentucky, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia to train 
regular education teachers to educate children with ADHD are described.

  This guide provides a survey of those laws that directly affect the child 
with attention deficit disorder (ADD), with or without hyperactivity.  The 
guide addresses three general classes of rights: (1) civil rights (for example, 
the right to equal treatment and opportunity under the law); (2) the right to 
society's support in educational services and disability payments; and (3) the 
right to exemption from military service.  The guide is divided into 14 parts, 
of which the first 3 are an introduction, an outline of the judicial system, 
and an explanation of equal protection and due process guaranteed by the U.S.  
Constitution.  Subsequent parts address the major federal laws which define the 
rights of individuals with ADD, including: the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act; the Americans with Disabilities 
Act; the Social Security Act; and the Selective Service Act.  Other sections 
deal with individualized inquiry, state law remedies, court litigation, and 
parent advocacy.  A final section on resources lists approximately 20 
textbooks, policy documents, and organizations.  (JDD)<BR>

  Responds to previous article (Hakola, this issue) on legal rights of students 
with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD).  Discusses resistance on part of special 
and regular educators to comply with law, calling resistance understandable and 
perhaps warranted when it stems from philosophical orientation, diagnostic and 
classification issues, and monetary concerns.  (NB)<BR>

  This manual, developed in Montana, is intended to assist schools in complying 
with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which requires the provision 
of services to people with disabilities in a nondiscriminatory manner.  The 
first section provides an introduction to Section 504, noting that some 
students not covered by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) 
may be covered under Section 504.  The second section examines school district 
responsibilities under the law, including written assurance of 
nondiscrimination, designation of a compliance coordinator, grievance 
procedures, and procedural safeguards.  Eligibility procedures under Section 
504 for receiving a free appropriate public education are considered next, 
including referral, Section 504 student determination, evaluation procedures, 
the individualized program, placement, reevaluation, and procedural safeguards. 
A Section 504 policy/procedures checklist is attached.  The fourth section 
looks at special issues including transportation, residential placement, 
nonacademic services, program accessibility, students with special health care 
needs, students with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and funding.  
Definitions of key terms in the law and a variety of sample forms to be used by 
schools are also provided.  Appendices contain: (1) the text of Section 504 as 
amended in 1990; (2) memoranda from the Office of Civil Rights regarding 
substance abuse, distinctions between Section 504 and IDEA, and attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder; (3) a systematic comparison of IDEA, Section 
504, and the Americans with Disabilities Act; and (4) additional resources.

  Special Education for Children with Attention Deficit Disorder: Current

  Target Audience: Policymakers<BR>
  This paper examines issues concerning the eligibility of children with 
attention deficit disorder (ADD) for special education and related services 
under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  A policy 
memorandum was issued by the Department of Education in September 1991, 
identifying those circumstances under which such children are eligible for 
special services.  Such children are seen to qualify under IDEA's "other health 
impairments" category if ADD is a chronic or acute health problem that limits 
alertness, adversely affects educational performance, and requires special 
education.  They may also qualify under other IDEA disability categories or 
under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The policy interpretation 
memorandum was issued after reviewing public comments required under the 
Education of the Handicapped Act Amendments (1990) and is intended to clarify 
for states and local school districts their responsibilities under federal law 
toward children with ADD.  Currently at issue is implementation of the 
Department's ADD policy and further consideration by Congress of eligibility of 
children with ADD under IDEA.  An appendix summarizes the history, causes, 
prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and educational implications of ADD.

  Teachers play an important role in monitoring the effects of stimulant 
medication used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  Any 
negative attitudes they hold toward ADHD students or the students' parents, 
doctors, or medication, can compromise treatment efficacy.  To assess teachers' 
perceptions of ADHD concerning social variables, drug therapy, causal factors, 
parental support, teacher training, involvement, and experience with ADHD 
students, 206 teachers, drawn from 11 elementary, middle, and high schools, 
were administered a 44-item survey.  Comparative analysis revealed no 
significant relationship between teachers' stimulant attitudes and causal 
beliefs and their amount of experience with ADHD students.  Teachers who 
advocated the use of ritalin were more likely to believe in genetic causal 
factors, and seemed more sensitive and aware of the social, academic, and 
medical problems associated with these disorders.  Neither age nor experience 
appeared to mediate teachers' attitudes toward ADHD causes or treatment.  Most 
teachers desired a high responsibility role in helping students with ADHD.  
Older and more experienced teachers expressed dissatisfaction both with their 
college training and in-service training on stimulant medication.  Future 
studies may concentrate on the adequacy of teacher training on stimulant 
medication, both on the college level and through in-service training.  Contains six references.  (RJM)<BR>

  Target Audience: Parents<BR>
  This guide provides information to help parents decide whether their child 
with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should take 
methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin).  Information is provided in a question-
and-answer format on various concerns, including: the meaning of ADHD, whether 
Ritalin is overprescribed, when this medication is appropriate and who can 
prescribe and monitor it, what research indicates about the effects of Ritalin, 
how to know if the medication is working, the effects of medication on family 
functioning, different forms and dosages of Ritalin, the effects of Ritalin on 
attention span and impulse control, effects of medication on social behavior 
and academic performance, age at which the medication can be started and 
whether it helps adults with hyperactive behavior, documented side effects of 
Ritalin, and unusual negative results that have been reported about Ritalin use.
Points for the parents to consider are summarized: the effects of Ritalin can 
be linked to the adequacy of dosage and regularity of intake; symptoms return 
once the medication wears off; along with the medication, behavior management 
and parent education or counseling are important; the medication may facilitate
the application of behavior management to improve control over ADHD symptoms; 
and at some point medication will be stopped.  (Contains 31 references.) (SW)<BR>

  This paper reviews literature on the adult outcomes for children diagnosed  with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).  It critiques  methodological issues, including diagnostic definitions, research designs,  sample characteristics, and assessment instruments.  It examines the  relationship of AD/HD to a variety of adult disorders and pathology, including:  (1) impaired lifestyle functioning (continuance of AD/HD symptomology and  educational or occupational problems); (2) substance abuse (alcohol and drugs);  (3) social pathology (antisocial behavior, criminality, and pathological  gambling); and (4) psychiatric symptoms (mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and  antisocial personality disorder).  The paper concludes that some individuals  diagnosed with AD/HD in childhood continue to experience the full or partial  syndrome in adulthood, tend to have lower educational and occupational status,  have an increased risk for alcohol and substance abuse, and appear to be at  greater risk for psychopathology.  In particular, there seems to be a link  between AD/HD in childhood and antisocial personality disorder in adulthood.   (Contains 49 references.)<BR>

  This paper reviews the assessment and diagnosis of attention  deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adults.  To provide baseline  information, consideration is given to outcome studies for adults who were  first diagnosed with ADHD as children.  Studies of clinical assessment methods  are addressed, and previous diagnostic criteria are compared to current  criteria.  Also considered is the area of retrospective childhood diagnosis.   The retrospective approach of reviewing childhood symptoms was found to provide  moderate agreement between parental and subject recollections of childhood  behavior; however, there may be a tendency for subjects to under-report their  symptoms compared to parents.  Presence of co-morbid disorders such as learning  disabilities has confounded much of the clinical assessment of symptomotology.   Tests which have been used to differentiate children with ADHD and those with  learning disabilities are examined, as are the use of neuropsychological tests  in adults.  It is concluded that the lack of consensus in the existing  literature suggests that a multimodal method of assessment appears necessary at  this time.  (Contains 39 references.) (SW)<BR>

  Clinical research has established a connection between childhood trauma and 
the development of dissociative disorders in adults.  Pathological dissociation 
produces a range of symptoms and behaviors such as amnesias, rapid shifts in 
mood and behavior, and auditory and visual hallucinations.  Many of these 
symptoms are misdiagnosed as attention, learning, or conduct problems, or even 
psychoses.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This pamphlet explains briefly what is known about attention deficit 
disorders (ADD), to help parents and educators have a more positive influence 
on the ADD child's life.  It begins with definitions of terminology; 
characteristics of preschool, school-age, and adult individuals with ADD; and 
causes of ADD.  It discusses special problems associated with ADD, including 
academic problems, behavior difficulties, interpersonal difficulties, and self-esteem difficulties.  Strategies effective in managing ADD are outlined, 
including medical management, behavioral strategies, cognitive-behavioral 
therapy, modifications in assignments and tests, and instruction in learning 
strategies.  The pamphlet concludes that with appropriate management and 
treatment during the formative years, the individual with ADD can live a normal 
and productive life, and that it behooves educators to realize the important 
facilitative roles they serve in the overall treatment plan of children and 
adolescents with ADD.  The pamphlet concludes with a list of 14 resources for 
educators, 8 resources for students, 9 resources for parents, and 8 parent 
support groups and organizations.  (Contains 23 references.) (JDD)<BR>

<B><I> Do you have any information on attention deficit disorder and children who are gifted</b></i>?

</B></I><P>Recently, an increasing number of gifted children have been identified or diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder, with or without hyperactivity.  This dramatic increase is somewhat disturbing, and has been explained in many different ways including greater awareness on the part of educational professionals and improved diagnostic techniques.  However, ADD in gifted students is difficult to assess because so many of the behavioral characteristics are similar to those associated with giftedness or creativity.  A child who is gifted may have ADD.  Without a thorough professional evaluation, including a physical examination by a physician, it is hard to tell.<P>

This file includes information about gifted students and ADD.  At the end of this file are links to Internet resources and Internet listservs (discussion groups) where you can obtain more specific information on this topic.  There may be an ERIC digest that provides further information on this topic.  You can read the full text of ERIC EC digests under our listing at

developmental lags, and focuses on the child's weaknesses.  A call is made for
seeking a full understanding of contextual, curricular, and environmental
factors outside the child before labeling students.  (PB)<BR>

This fact sheet summarizes information on children who have an attention
deficit disorder with hyperactivity (ADHD), are gifted, or are both ADHD and
gifted.  Fourteen diagnostic criteria for ADHD from the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III are listed.  A comparison of
behaviors associated with ADHD and with giftedness is offered, noting the many
similarities.  Parents and teachers are urged to consider the situation and
setting of problematic behaviors, noting that children with ADHD typically
exhibit problem behaviors in all settings (both at home and at school) whereas
gifted children are most likely to exhibit such behaviors in situations where
they are bored or waiting for other students.  Other differences noted include
a long attention span (when interested) by gifted students and a greater
variability in task performance by children with ADHD.  Careful evaluation is
urged for students who may be both gifted/talented and ADHD.  (DB)<BR>

This paper examines characteristics of a typical 6-year-old and
characteristics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), including
distractibility, impulsiveness, inattention, and hyperactivity.  The occurrence
of ADHD in gifted students is discussed.  Possible causes of ADHD are noted.
The 5 "M" program of treatment is presented, which involves: (1) medication
with stimulants to help the student pay attention; (2) management using
behavior modification techniques, which included acknowledging adherence to
classroom rules, teaching self-monitoring of behavior, allowing children to
help design classroom rules, and using rewards and punishments to reinforce
rules; (3) modification of the classroom environment to meet student needs; (4)
modeling appropriate behavior; and (5) mothering (and fathering, too ), which
calls for unconditional love and acceptance of the child, as ADHD children must
perceive that they are loved if they are to accept themselves.  The paper
concludes that through steady support and management, the gifted ADHD child is
not only teachable, but can provide a great deal of positive stimulation to the
classroom environment.  (JDD)<BR>

<B><I>How can gifted students be identified?

</B></I><P> School districts throughout the U.S. use a variety of instruments and procedures
to identify gifted students.  When looking for instruments or procedures, it is important to keep in mind that
identification should be linked to curriculum.  If an instrument is used to identify talent,
then school districts should be prepared to adapt curriculum to nurture and foster those
 identified talent areas.<P>

The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Virginia
has a database of empirically sound identification instruments that can be used with a variety of populations.  When contacting NRC/GT at UVA for information about identification instruments, it is suggested that you provide specific information about your  school district and the populations you wish to assess.<P>

This review of research and literature examines issues related to the
identification of potentially gifted students from groups most likely to be
underrepresented in gifted education programs, including racial and ethnic
minority groups, economically disadvantaged students, and those with limited
English proficiency.  Three major reasons for underrepresentation are
identified and discussed: (1) test bias (the most frequent attribution for
underrepresentation in programs); (2) selective referrals (usually because of
teacher attitudes and knowledge about minority students and the type of school
students are likely to attend); and (3) reliance on deficit-based paradigms
(making recognition of the strengths of minority children less likely). 
Recommendations for modifying traditional assessment procedures include the use
of multiple criteria and nontraditional measures and procedures and
modification of selection criteria.  Four aspects of assessment are discussed:
the construct of giftedness, the referral process, the identification process,
and the process by which decisions are made using assessment information for
curriculum and instructional planning.  (Contains approximately 140
references.) (DB)<BR>

The efficacy of use of the Raven Progressive Matrices Test (RPM) in the
selection of gifted children from traditionally underrepresented groups was
investigated in a large-scale study with a diverse population.  A total of
16,985 subjects were given the Raven Progressive Matrices Test.  These included
22.7 percent Latinos, 37 percent Whites, 14 percent African-Americans, 2.8
percent Asians, 8.4 percent Filipinos, and 5.6 percent Indochinese, each of
whom had been identified as potentially gifted on the basis of a case study
analysis by a school psychologist.  The sample of children certified as gifted
based on Raven performance was compared to a group certified as gifted based on
individual administrations of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children -
Revised (WISC-R), and to actual enrollment ratios of cultural subgroups for the
school district.  Findings support the position that the RPM is a more
equitable test than the WISC-R for evaluating students from ethnically diverse
populations, as well as for ensuring greater gender equity.  (PB)<BR>

The primary purpose of this study was to determine if a model for identifying
gifted and talented students could be developed which would provide equal
access to gifted programs for children of all ethnic and economic backgrounds. 
The culturally and ethnically diverse San Diego City School District provided a
pool of over 35,000 children referred for giftedness whose records were coded
and analyzed through this research.  Based on these findings, a model designed
to increase the proportion of ethnically and economically diverse students
referred for assessment and identified as gifted was implemented and evaluated,
with the Raven Progressive Matrices used as the criterion measure of
intellectual ability.  Component research papers by Dennis P. Saccuzzo, Nancy
E. Johnson and Tracey L. Guertin cover the following topics: the use of the
Raven Matrices in an ethnically diverse gifted population; use of the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children - Revised (WISC-R) with disadvantaged gifted
children; evaluation of risk factors in selecting children for gifted programs;
information processing in gifted versus nongifted African-American, Latino,
Filipino, and White children; ethnic and gender differences in locus of control
in at risk gifted and nongifted children; and understanding gifted
underachievers in an ethnically diverse population.  Appendices include a
teacher nomination form, a student/parent information form, and an independent
evaluation review, in which author Margie Kitano finds the new model to have
significantly impacted school system practice and increased the number and
proportion of underrepresented students referred and identified although
failing to fully meet the initial criterion for equal access.  (Contains 222

This report reviews and synthesizes the most promising practices used to
identify exceptionally talented students from the Native American population. 
Preliminary information includes an Indian Student Bill of Rights, discussion
of the problem of talent identification, and discussion of special issues
including diversity within the Native American population and cultural
assimilation versus accommodation.  Eight principles of identification are then
presented.  These include, among others, using assessments that go beyond a
narrow conception of talent; using appropriate instruments with underserved
populations; and using a multiple-measure/multiple-criteria approach to
identification.  Specific practices are then considered, which address:
balancing the ideal and the practical; deciding on a concept of talent;
recognizing the issues of a particular school; identifying traits that may
influence manifestations of talent; recognizing behaviors that distinguish some
Native American students from the general population; looking for
manifestations of talent potential, alternative behaviors, situations, and
interpretations; selecting and constructing appropriate assessment tools; and
using the collected student data to make decisions.  Recommendations address
technical assistance, professional development, assessment portfolios,
experimental programs, and program funding.  Five appendices include technical
information concerning evaluation measures, two sample case studies, and a list
of assessment instruments.  (Contains 77 references.) (DB)<BR>

<B><I> My child has just been identified as "gifted and talented." How do we decide 
whether to enroll her in the gifted program?  How do we decide about 
acceleration?  I am concerned that my child will be separated from friends and
classmates and may be teased by other children. I am also concerned that my child 
will feel pressured by the work, to a point that she dislikes school. Also my 
child does not want to leave her current school, and does not want to be 
classified any differently than her friends.

Please help me with the pros and cons of these issues, and any other guidance you
can offer.

<HR> <P>

The decision to enroll a child in a gifted program is not irreversible. If the placement
doesn't work out, the child can always go back to the regular education classroom. The
reverse is rarely true. If you opt to keep your child in the regular education classroom,
and your child quickly becomes bored, transferring to the gifted classroom during the
same school year may not be possible. <P>
Research indicates the following:<P>

Gifted students benefit from learning together and should be placed with 
similar students in their areas of strength.<P>

It has been extremely difficult for regular education teachers to differentiate curriculum
to meet the needs of gifted students in mixed ability classrooms.<P>

Many gifted students think and learn differently from their chronological age mates who
are not gifted. They tend to better understand, accept, and use their learning
differences as assets when they are grouped together. When they are provided with
consistent appropriate academic challenge, they tend to be more comfortable with
themselves (and others).<P>

When cooperative learning has been used in the regular education classroom, gifted
students often become tutors and learn less academic content. The other students may
depend on them to do most of the work, or do the work that is difficult, and therefore the
regular education students also learn less academic content.<P>

Gifted students frequently know many of the concepts introduced in the regular 
education class and waste a lot of time. They often develop bad habits, such as 
constant daydreaming.<P>

Gifted students are more likely to socialize "normally" when they are with 
students who share their interests and learning style. This is most likely to occur with 
intellectual age mates, regardless of chronological age.<P>

  This review of the literature focuses on research findings concerning the 
long-term academic, social, and emotional effects of acceleration, as well as 
the results of non-acceleration, on gifted children.  Access to accelerated 
programs in Canada and the United States was also investigated.  The review led 
to the following conclusions: (1) academic outcomes of acceleration are 
positive; (2) no carefully executed research has been conducted that has found 
negative social and/or emotional outcomes of acceleration of gifted children; 
(3) gifted children who are not intellectually stimulated and challenged may 
become underachievers and not fulfill their potential; and (4) acceleration is 
not widely used in Canada or the United States.  Especially noted is the 
widespread opposition to acceleration by educators despite research which 
clearly finds that their concerns are unfounded.  (Contains 30 references.)

  This report describes an extension of the Learning Outcomes Study (a 
nationwide longitudinal investigation of 1,010 students just entering programs 
for gifted learners in grades 2 and 3) to investigate excellence within each of 
the four program types considered: within-class programs, pull-out programs, 
separate classes, and special schools.  The qualitative extension focused on an 
"exemplary" model from each of the program types.  Two program evaluation 
tools, the Program Profile Form and Program Satisfaction Survey (with versions 
for students, parents, teachers, and administrators), were created to document 
key program components.  Program profiles included a description of each 
program's setting and general procedures (identification process, curricular 
options, staff selection, school demographics) and five criteria: leadership, 
atmosphere and environment, communication, curriculum and instruction, and 
attention to student needs.  In addition, ways that all selected programs 
addressed the needs of diverse populations of students were addressed.  
Appendices provide additional information on program demographic information, 
program profiles, the interview questions used, the program satisfaction 
surveys, and other research aspects of the study.  Executive Summary is also 
published separately.  (Contains approximately 95 references.) (DB)<BR>

  This book looks at gifted and talented students from a "national resource" 
point of view.  The first chapter establishes the basic premise that gifted and 
talented children represent a significant resource to any nation and that it is 
profitable to the nation to invest in their development and education.  
Subsequent chapters describe types of giftedness, characteristics of gifted 
youth, underidentified gifted populations (and techniques for identifying 
them), and the role of adults in fostering giftedness and providing needed 
opportunities.  One chapter is devoted to the special case of gifted females.  
One chapter addresses nine categories of options available for enhancing the 
educational experiences of gifted students and explains how these options can 
be modified and combined to meet the needs of a specific school district and 
its gifted students.  A chapter on "follow-up" studies of gifted and talented 
students suggests certain commonalities in personal qualities among the 
"successful" gifted and talented as well as the kinds of activities that appear 
to promote achievement and maintain a positive self-concept.  (Contains

  It is argued that lack of sustained academic effort, not student grouping, is 
the major reason for differences in student performance.  Ability grouping is 
seen as a useful tool, especially in accelerated programs for bright children, 
that should not be rejected in favor of approaches that ignore individual 
differences.  (MSE)<BR>

  This research examines how a developmentally appropriate educational program 
in the early years can affect the development of gifted children.  The 
qualitative research specifically focused on a multi-age, multi-ability setting 
with partial implementation of a whole language program, a systematic writing 
process and with some flexibility in grouping of students.  Eleven teachers and 
approximately 260 students in an ungraded primary school were involved, with 3 
first year and 30 second year students identified as gifted.  The study found 
that gifted children followed a somewhat accelerated curriculum.  Teachers felt 
that there were definite social benefits to integrating the gifted and 
nongifted students.  The multi-age, multi-ability setting seemed to allow young 
students not identified as gifted to progress more rapidly than they might have 
in a traditional graded classroom, as they were exposed to higher level 
instruction.  There was little evidence of the development of creative 
productivity or multiple intelligences other than linguistic and logical-
mathematical.  Interviews with teachers indicated their willingness to allow 
students to do above-grade level work and to use higher level materials with 
some children.  Interview questions are provided in an appendix.  (Contains 12

  The long-term effects of various accelerative options were evaluated using a 
group of 510 students identified as highly gifted in junior high.  Their 
academic achievements, extracurricular activities, goals and aspirations, and 
social and emotional adjustment were assessed after completing high school.  No 
discernible negative effects of accelerative strategies were found.

  A study gathered quantitative and qualitative data on the cognitive and 
affective outcomes for gifted students (grades 3-6) in full- and part-time 
programs from three classrooms in each of two neighboring school districts, one 
urban and one rural.  Results suggested that outcomes are affected by the goal 
structures of classrooms and that the instructional environment of a gifted 
classroom may be a more important variable than the amount of time students 
spend in a program.  Differences in the full- and part-time classrooms 
operating in the two districts and their effects were examined.  Qualitative 
analysis led to the proposition that cooperatively structured classrooms were 
more successful learning environments than competitive ones.  Numerous examples 
and quotes drawn from the researcher's classroom observations are given.  I
llustrations provide floor plans, daily routines, and schedules of classroom 
activities for both the self-contained and pull-out classrooms in the two 
districts.  (VW)<BR>

  This monograph presents four chapters on cultural and linguistic diversity in 
special education from the perspectives of three ethnic groups--African 
Americans, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and Mexican Americans, respectively.  The 
first chapter is titled "Education Reform and Service Delivery to African-
American Students," by Festus E. Obiakor and others.  This chapter focuses on 
issues related to education reform as embodied in the General Education 
Initiative and service delivery to African-American students with disabilities. 
The second chapter is "Ecobehavioral Assessment: A New Methodology for 
Evaluating Instruction for Exceptional Culturally and Linguistically Diverse 
Students" (Carmen Arreaga-Mayer and others).  This chapter reviews the current 
bilingual special education efficacy literature, offers a prototype 
ecobehavioral approach, and reports on a pilot study with 36 elementary 
students (in 26 classrooms) utilizing this approach.  The third chapter is 
"Assessment of Asian and Pacific Islander Students for Gifted Programs" (Li-
Rong Lilly Cheng and others).  This chapter briefly describes the relevant 
cultural and ethnic groups, examines academic performance of Asian and Pacific 
Islanders in San Diego (California) as it relates to referral of this 
population to gifted programs, and draws implications for practitioners in the 
form of recommended multidisciplinary practices.  The fourth chapter, 
"Nonstandardized Instruments for the Assessment of Mexican-American Children 
for Gifted/Talented Programs" (Jaime H. Garcia), discusses assessment 
strategies that provide qualitative data for the identification of gifted 
Mexican-American students.  These strategies are grouped into four categories: 
student production, informant data, language and cognitive style data, and data 
organization systems.  (Each chapter contains extensive references.) (DB)<BR>

This digest is adapted from Linda Cohen's publication, "Meeting the Needs of
Gifted and Talented Minority Language Students." It explores the controversy
surrounding the underrepresentation of minority language students in gifted and
talented programs and makes recommendations for more suitable assessment
techniques and program models.  Addressed are the following questions: (1) Why
are minority language students underrepresented in programs for gifted and
talented students? (2) What are some commonly used techniques for the
identification of gifted and talented minority language students? and (3) What
types of programs are available for gifted and talented students, and are they
suitable for minority language students who are selected to participate?
Specifically described are enrichment programs, parent involvement programs,
acceleration or honors programs, and mentor programs.  The following
recommendations are made: broaden the concept of giftedness; expand research on
giftedness and minority language students; employ more well-rounded assessment
techniques; increase staff awareness of their potential for developing a gifted
and talented program; explore various program models; and increase awareness of
different ways giftedness may be manifested in different populations.  Includes
17 references.  (DB)<BR>

This document is a "theme" issue of a quarterly serial publication.  It
focuses on identifying and serving gifted children from diverse populations. 
The first article, "Eliminating Four Barriers to the Identification of Gifted
Minority Students" by Mary Frasier, notes that: (1) not every impoverished home
is illiterate; (2) limited opportunities for learning should not be assumed to
restrict the child's achievement; (3) there are common mental traits of
giftedness regardless of the child's background; and (4) giftedness may
manifest itself differently in different children.  The second article, "Gifted
Learning Disabled Students: Questions and Answers," by Anne J. Udall, answers
questions concerning the characteristics of such students, their prevalence,
and the best ways to meet their curriculum needs.  Next, Mary T. Kolesinski in
"The Bilingual Gifted: Viable Strategies for Effective Programming" proposes
strategies for improving the identification process and teaching strategies to
address the special needs of these students.  In the fourth paper, "An Update
on the Javits Project: Identifying and Serving Disadvantaged Gifted Youth,"
Evelyn L. Hiatt presents preliminary information on the Texas Student Portfolio
(TSP), a measure designed to provide unbiased assessment of characteristics
associated with gifted students, especially as they pertain to critical and
creative thinking.  (The TSP is part of a 3-year project undertaken by the
Texas Education Agency with funding from the Jacob K. Javits Gifted Students
Education Act of 1988.  The project's purpose is to fulfill the grant's
objective to investigate nontraditional approaches to identifying and serving
underrepresented populations in programs for the gifted.) Finally, Evelyn Hiatt
and Jeanette Covington respond to common questions on identifying and serving
diverse populations.  (DB)<BR>

<B><I>How can the talents of young gifted children be assessed and nurtured? </B></I><P>   A variety of instruments and procedures are used to identify gifted students.  The recognition and nurturing of giftedness in young children (K-3) is particularly challenging because school systems generally prefer to avoid labeling the children.  Informal or formal identification may involve procedures such as teacher assessment of a child's problem solving ability, parental assessment of a child's abilities and interests, or the assessment of student products (portfolio assessment). <P>

When looking for instruments or procedures, it is important to keep in mind that
identification should be linked to curriculum.  If an instrument is used to identify talent,
then school districts should be prepared to adapt curriculum to nurture and foster those
 identified talent areas.<P>

The National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented at the University of Virginia 
has a database of empirically sound identification instruments that can be used with a variety of populations.  When contacting NRC/GT at UVA for information about identification instruments, it is suggested that you provide specific information about your  school district and the populations you wish to assess.<P>

This analysis of underserved gifted preschool and primary children explores
the identification of gifted children from the current perspective, examines
the impact of current identification practices on underserved populations,
outlines some promising practices for assessment, and summarizes implications
for educational development when serving underrepresented populations.  It is
concluded that educators are now paying more attention to the needs of
underserved populations with systematic research into issues of assessment,
programmatic alternatives, curriculum integration, and evaluation.  Stressed is
the need to apply research findings to modify practice at the local, regional,
and state levels and to develop assessment approaches which examine both
performance and potential.  Portfolio assessment is seen as one alternative
strategy for identification of gifted children in underserved groups.  A
continuum of programmatic options is recommended based on identified student
strengths.  Changes in state and local funding procedures are suggested which
would support a broad range of opportunities and services.  (16 references)

This research examines how a developmentally appropriate educational program  in
the early years can affect the development of gifted children.  The  qualitative research
specifically focused on a multi-age, multi-ability setting  with partial implementation of a
whole language program, a systematic writing  process and with some flexibility in
grouping of students.  Eleven teachers and  approximately 260 students in an ungraded
primary school were involved, with 3  first year and 30 second year students identified
as gifted.  The study found  that gifted children followed a somewhat accelerated
curriculum.  Teachers felt  that there were definite social benefits to integrating the
gifted and  nongifted students.  The multi-age, multi-ability setting seemed to allow
young  students not identified as gifted to progress more rapidly than they might have
in a traditional graded classroom, as they were exposed to higher level  instruction.
There was little evidence of the development of creative  productivity or multiple
intelligences other than linguistic and logical- mathematical.  Interviews with teachers
indicated their willingness to allow  students to do above-grade level work and to use
higher level materials with  some children.  Interview questions are provided in an
appendix.  (Contains 12  references.) (JDD)<BR>

This descriptive study looked at the provision of differentiated language  arts
instruction for gifted students by means of whole language instruction  approaches in
regular classes.  Two classrooms in each of two elementary  schools were identified as
exemplary whole language classrooms and each  contained several students identified
for school gifted programs.  One  classroom in each of grades 1, 2, 4, and 5 was
represented.  Participant  observation was conducted at least once per week for
approximately a semester.   Additionally, interviews with the classroom teachers, the
principals, the  reading/language arts coordinators, the teachers of the gifted, and the
targeted students were conducted.  The benefits of the whole language approach  for
these students were analyzed in terms of: student choice of reading  materials,
responses to reading, and writing projects; use of time; social  interaction; and
appropriate teaching.  Analysis indicated: all teachers and  classrooms provided
examples of some exemplary practices but none provided all  those components
advocated by either whole language experts or educators of the  gifted; the classroom
that provided the most exemplary whole language practices  also provided the most
differentiation of learning experiences for gifted  students; and both students and
teachers had difficulty articulating what  appropriate challenges and differentiated
language experience meant to them.  It is concluded that, although whole language
instruction is a positive  approach, it does not preclude the need for differentiated gifted
programming.   (Contains 28 references.) (DB)<BR>

The digest addresses ways that parents and educators can nurture giftedness
in young children.  Problems in appropriate school placement for young gifted
children with uneven development are discussed and illustrated with examples. 
In selecting a program, parents need to look for a highly individualized program
in which children are encouraged to progress at their own learning rate, with
planned opportunities for development of social, physical, and cognitive skills
in an informal classroom atmosphere.  Parents also need to support the child's
need for friendship with intellectually equal children.  Includes six references.  (DB)<BR>

This brief information sheet summarizes the types of social-emotional 
problems common among gifted children and suggests preventive actions schools 
can take.  A table lists problems associated with characteristic strengths of 
gifted children.  Specific problems briefly addressed include: uneven 
development, peer relations, excessive self-criticism, perfectionism, avoidance 
of risk-taking, multipotentiality, the presence of disabilities, difficulties 
adjusting to the school culture and norms, relating to expectations of others, 
depression, and problems in peer and family relations.  Educators are urged to: 
(1) reach out to parents, (2) focus on parents of young children, (3) educate 
and involve health care and other professionals, use educational flexibility, 
and establish parent discussion groups.  (Contains 13 references.) (DB)<BR>

The field of gifted education has been, for many years, a laboratory for the development of creative educational enrichment activities.  Critical thinking, problem-finding, and problem-solving activites, for example, were originated by professionals working in gifted education.  Recently these creative activities have been used successfully in heterogeneous classrooms, and teachers have found that the activities are highly stimulating for general education populations.  The abstracts included here are typical examples of activities that were designed for gifted students, and may also be useful for general education populations.  In addition, the AskERIC Virtual Library provides a <a href=gopher://ericir.syr.edu/11/Lesson>searchable database</a> of lesson plans that were designed for gifted students and may also be appropriate for all students.<P>

  A differentiated curriculum can provide the basis for discovering, serving, 
and nurturing academic talent across California's diverse student population.  
Differentiation provides tools to vary the curriculum or instruction so that 
students who have already mastered given material continue to progress and 
students who have a particular interest in an area can pursue it in greater 
depth or in a personalized way.  Although aimed at gifted and talented 
youngsters, four principles of differentiation can be used to meet the needs of 
all students.  These include acceleration, complexity, depth, and novelty.  The 
responsibility for differentiation is one which all educators must share, at 
the classroom level and the school level.  Educators must develop a new vision 
of excellence that depends on a fresh understanding of how the core curriculum 
can be differentiated to provide advanced learning opportunities.  The 
education of the most able students, as with all students, is best developed in 
challenging contexts which shift the emphasis from the structure of the program 
to the quality of the curriculum.  The core curriculum currently embodied in 
California's curriculum frameworks is often described as a "thinking 
curriculum" because it tries to engage students at all times in the search for 
meaning.  In addition to differentiation at the classroom level, successful 
differentiation at the school level involves new service models, new roles for 
educators, shared resources, improved assessment practices, and ongoing staff 
development.  (JDD)<BR>

  An enrichment program developed for sixth-grade gifted students combined 
creative problem solving with future studies in a way that would simulate real 
life crisis problem solving.  The program involved forecasting problems of the 
future requiring evacuation of Earth, assuming roles on a spaceship, and 
simulating crises as the spaceship traveled to Titan.  (JDD)<BR>

  This presentation summarizes effective strategies and programs for nurturing 
students who are gifted in science.  A smorgasbord of educationally 
accelerative opportunities is recommended, to enhance students' potential for 
future development in science.  These opportunities may include field trips, 
advanced placement courses, and science summer camps.  Experiences that promote 
science achievement are described, such as simultaneous teaching of separate 
science subjects.  Models for encouraging scientific development, such as early 
entrance to college and contests/competitions, are cited.  Recommendations are 
offered for nurturing talent in science and technology.  Recommendations relate 
to the topics of identification, science curriculum, and teachers/mentors.

  This updated 1987 article argues that teaching of thinking skills, common in 
gifted education, has wider value in regular school instructional programs.  It 
describes programs which have implemented Talents Unlimited, a classroom-level, 
research-based model for teaching creative- and critical-thinking skills which 
encompasses productive thinking, decision making, planning, forecasting, and 
communication.  (VW)<BR>

  The paper describes a curriculum model developed for gifted and talented 
students in an integrated middle school program, as a cooperative effort 
between the College of Education at the University of Houston and a Houston 
middle school.  The program includes identification procedures, curriculum 
practices, and evaluation techniques.  The curriculum is intended to be both 
differentiated and interdisciplinary.  The curriculum consists of subject 
matter in eight areas: math, science, social studies, language arts, music, 
art, computer technology, and Spanish.  Teachers become teachers/advisors in 
the program and assist students in individual and group activities according to 
student interest and subject area proficiency.  Results of the initial 5-year 
pilot phase and a refined pilot phase indicated that students developed 
independent study skills and decision-making strategies.  Teaching teams 
developed 3-week study guides for each subject area and for interdisciplinary 
areas.  These brief guides identify topics, subtopics, essential curriculum 
elements, a selection of activities, an evaluation process, and suggested 
references.  Seven study guides are attached.  (DB)<BR>

Currently, the only federal funding earmarked for gifted education is available through application to the Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Education Act of 1992.  The Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program is designed to build nationwide capability in gifted and talented education and encourage rich and challenging curricula for all children.  Funding that is not earmarked for gifted education may be used to benefit gifted students.  Examples include Goals 2000 and some technology funds such as Challenge grants.  <P>

This fact sheet summarizes issues involved in the reauthorization of the 
Jacob K. Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Act of 1988, Title IV-B, 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  This Act provides grants for research 
and demonstration projects and training activities to meet the needs of gifted 
and talented students.  The Javits program has served over 2 million gifted and 
talented students through 75 discretionary projects and also funds the National 
Center for Research and Development in the Education of Gifted and Talented 
Children and Youth.  A Federal government report is cited indicating that only 
two cents of every $100 spent on K-12 education in 1990 supported special 
opportunities for gifted students, and recommending that the definition of 
"gifted" be broadened and that effective programs be expanded into regular 
school programs.  Specific reauthorization issues addressed include: whether to 
focus on equal education or on excellence for the few; reauthorization of the 
National Center for Gifted Research; and continuation of discretionary grants 
for model projects serving only gifted and talented students.  Specific 
appropriation figures for fiscal years 1989 through 1995 (proposed) are listed.

participant observation, interviews, and document analysis revealed that: (1) 
gifted students who have cerebral palsy and do not speak exhibit indicators of 
cognitive ability that are similar to those exhibited by nondisabled gifted 
students, though the expression and recognition of these indicators are 
inhibited by communication barriers; (2) classroom atmosphere, structures, and 
instructional activities differentially impact the intellectual development of 
gifted students with physical disabilities; (3) gifted students with physical 
disabilities are able, with some modifications, to integrate and succeed 
academically and socially in regular classrooms; and (4) many barriers must be 
overcome by gifted students with physical disabilities in order to reach their 
goals.  The study demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the obvious 
external manifestations of intellectual talent and illustrates some unique 
behaviors that may appear given appropriate circumstances.  (Contains 22

<B><I> My child has been very content in a gifted program for several years.  This year he appears to be struggling, and his grades have fallen.  It was suggested that he might have a learning disability that hasn't been a problem until this year.  Is this possible, and how can I get more information? 

</B></I><P>According to a 1992 Dept. of Education Office for Civil Rights survey,
there are 24,241 people in the United States who are identified as being
both learning disabled and gifted.<P>

Child Services for LD children are covered under PL94-142 and IDEA.  However,
those documents do not address giftedness, and there is no federal legislation
that addresses the rights and responsibilities of children who are both gifted
and disabled.  Some states do not "double label" twice exceptional children
(gifted children with disabilities) and do not provide services under both
codes. <P>

Services provided to GT children vary from state to state, and often vary among
school districts within a state.  To inquire about policies and regulations in your state, please contact your state Department of Education in your state's capitol.<P>


This file includes information about gifted students with learning disabilities.  At the end of this file are links to Internet resources and Internet listservs (discussion groups) where you can obtain more specific information on this topic. Information about gifted children with disabilities other than learning disabilities is available in other FAQs.  There is an ERIC digest that provides further information on this topic.

Extensive interviews were conducted with 12 young adults with learning disabilities who were successful at the college level, as well as with their parents, along with a thorough review of available school records, in order to examine how well high-ability students with learning disabilities succeed in academic environments.  Most of the participants had been identified as having a learning disability late in their academic careers, suggesting their high ability may have masked some manifestations of learning disability.  Students' mixed academic achievements often hindered their inclusion in gifted education programs.  Reports of positive school experiences primarily centered around individual teacher support.  Students reported many negative school experiences such as social problems, difficulty with teachers, and frustration with certain academic areas.  Parents often reported that school systems "did not know what to do" with their children.  However, students recalled very positive out-of- school experiences which enabled them to survive and constructively adapt their negative school experiences, resulting in positive personal attitudes.  Positive personal characteristics in this group included high motivation, a high level of "task commitment," perseverance, and endurance.  A major finding was the positive impact of the services provided by the University of Connecticut Program for Students with Learning Disabilities.  The important influence of a learning specialist at the college level emerged as a critical factor in the academic success of the students participating in the study.  Executive Summary is also published separately.  (Contains approximately 150 references.)

This digest is derived from Susan Baum's "Being Gifted and Learning Disabled...From Definition to Practical Intervention." The learning disabled gifted are grouped into three categories: identified gifted students who have subtle learning disabilities, unidentified students whose gifts and disabilities may be masked by average achievement, and identified learning disabled students who are also gifted.  Four general guidelines are offered to professionals in developing appropriate educational programs.  They are: (1) focus attention on the development of the gift; (2) provide a nurturing environment that values individual differences; (3) encourage compensation strategies (five compensation strategies are suggested); and (4) encourage awareness of individual strengths and weaknesses.  Stressed is the importance of such students learning to be their own advocates.  Includes nine references, nine resources, and 14 suggestions for additional reading.  (DB)<BR>

<B><I> What does the research say about including gifted students in the regular education classroom?  Specifically, are those elementary school  programs that rely
heavily on a pull-out vs. an inclusion-type program  (homogeneous vs. heterogeneous
grouping) proving to be more or less successful?

</B></I><P>When attempts are made to evaluate the effect of a particular school environment, such as the resource room, or ability grouping, or a particular instructional method such as creative problem solving, the range and diversity of results is impressive.  It is clear that
resource rooms work well sometimes, and not at all well at others.  The
enrichment triad is a great success in some places and a disappointment in
others.  Merely placing youngsters in a particular setting, or providing them
with a particular set of activities, does not necessarily lead to success. It
would appear that merely grouping gifted students together without, at the same
time, changing the content and the instructional strategies, will not yield much
in the way of benefits.  On the other hand, a well-constructed program that
brings gifted students together and provides them with an intellectually
stimulating and important set of ideas, together with giving them practice to
use their own ability to problem-find and problem-solve, seems to yield very
tangible results (Gallagher, 1993).<P>
Changing the learning environment without changing the content of lessons seems
nonproductive and leads many gifted students to say that "school is boring."
Further, much of the curriculum that is designed with gifted students in mind is
designed on an "ad hoc" basis, without benefit of scope and sequence, and with
little apparent justification.  Regarding curriculum issues, please see
VanTassel-Baska, J. (1992)  "Planning Effective Curriculum for Gifted Learners."

It is argued that lack of sustained academic effort, not student grouping, is
the major reason for differences in student performance.  Ability grouping is
seen as a useful tool, especially in accelerated programs for bright children,
that should not be rejected in favor of approaches that ignore individual
differences.  (MSE) <BR>

This research review summarizes two major sets of meta-analyses on five kinds
of ability grouping programs: (1) XYZ classes (high, middle, and low classes);
(2) cross-grade grouping; (3) within-class grouping; (4) accelerated classes;
and (5) enriched classes.  One group of meta analyses concluded that the
strongest benefits from grouping were found in programs in which there was a
great deal of adjustment of curriculum for highly talented learners.  The other
meta-analysis did not find any strong positive benefits of grouping, but did
not examine grouping programs designed for highly talented students.  Re-
analysis of all studies included in both sets of meta-analyses confirmed that
higher aptitude students usually benefit academically from ability grouping.
Benefits are in proportion to the amount of curriculum adjustment, with programs
entailing acceleration of instruction resulting in the most gain on
standardized tests.  Grouping was found to have less influence on the academic
achievement of middle and lower aptitude students.  Analysis of noncognitive
outcomes suggests that the effects of grouping on self-esteem measures
for all ability groups are small and may even be rather positive.  Results are
contrasted with the conclusions of J. Oakes ("Keeping Track: How Schools
Structure Inequality" (1985).  The review concludes that American education
would be harmed by the wholesale elimination of programs that group learners
for instruction by ability.  (DB) <BR>

Document Type:  REVIEW LITERATURE (070) <BR>
Journal Announcement:  RIEOCT92 <BR>
This review of the literature summarizes findings on instructional grouping
issues and academic achievement of gifted elementary students. The review
addresses problems of using standardized tests to evaluate instructional
effectiveness of grouping arrangements, distinctions between providing the
same curriculum and a differentiated curriculum to gifted groups, and grouping
within the heterogeneous class or in self-contained classes. It is concluded
that research evidence strongly supports grouping of students by ability for at
least the curriculum areas of reading and mathematics. In addition, there is
also evidence that once students are grouped by ability, the level of
instruction and pace of learning must be adapted in order to gain the maximum
benefit for the student. (20 references) (DB) <BR>

Agrees with Susan Allan's article in the same "Educational Leadership" issue
that ability grouping research is often misinterpreted--to the disservice of
students.  Reviewers should distinguish among three types of programs that
differ according to curricular adjustment and acceleration effects.  Blanket
condemnation of all three types is unwarranted.  Includes three references.

Thirteen research syntheses were analyzed to determine the academic, social, and
psychological effects upon learners who are gifted and talented of three
grouping practices: (1) ability grouping for enrichment; (2) mixed ability
cooperative grouping for regular instruction; and (3) grouping for
acceleration. It was concluded that the research showed strong, consistent
support for the academic effects of most forms of ability grouping for
enrichment and acceleration, but that the research is scant and weak concerning
the socialization and psychological adjustment effects of these practices.
Claims for the academic superiority of mixed ability grouping or for whole
group instructional practices were not substantiated for gifted and talented
learners. Other conclusions indicated that: academic outcomes of ability
grouping vary substantially from effects reported for average and low ability
learners; full time, pullout, and within-class grouping can all produce
substantial academic gains; and there is little impact on self-esteem and a
moderate gain in attitude toward subject in full time ability grouping. A
series of guidelines for practices is included. Appendices chart the
meta-evaluation of the research syntheses and the research-supported
conclusions concerning grouping issues. (45 references) (DB) <BR>

This monograph uses a question-answer format to address issues concerned with
meeting the needs of gifted students as Wisconsin schools restructure and change
grouping practices as part of raising standards of learning for all students.
Among 12 questions considered are the following: (1) Aren't some of the
principles of middle level education, cooperative learning and whole class
instruction in reading harmful from the standpoint of providing appropriate
programs to gifted students? (2) Isn't acceleration a necessary component of
gifted education but contradictory to the middle level philosophy? (3) If one
views middle level education as anti-tracking and anti-ability grouping, then
how is grouping at the middle of the pyramid ever acceptable? (4) "Doesn't
participation in Midwest Talent Search promote labeling and an "earlier is
better" approach to gifted education? (5) Don't research reports and declining
test scores clearly support as little ability grouping as possible at all levels
of education? (6) Won't cooperative learning increase boredom in gifted students
and hold them back? (7) How can young gifted readers be challenged by whole
class instruction in reading? and (8) How can we be sure school districts are
asking the right questions about gifted education as these strategies are
implemented? Includes 24 references.  (DB) <BR>

</B></I><P>A list of best practices does not exist at this time.  When attempts are

room (Vaughn, Feldhusen, & Asher, 1991), or ability grouping, or a particular
instructional method such as creative problem solving, the range and diversity of results
is impressive. It is clear that resource rooms work well sometimes, and not at all well at

This book provides a comprehensive review of teaching-learning models used in
the development and implementation of a curriculum for gifted students.  The
models described were selected for their demonstrated or potential success with
gifted children and their widespread use.  For each model, the following types
of information are provided: assumptions underlying the model, elements of the
model, modification of the basic curriculum, modifying the approach, model
development, research on effectiveness, advantages and disadvantages, and
references.  Following an introductory chapter, nine chapters cover the
following models: (1) George Betts--the autonomous learner model; (2) Benjamin
Bloom and David Krathwohl--the cognitive and affective taxonomies; (3) Jerome
Bruner--the basic structure of a discipline; (4) Sidney Parnes--creative
problem solving; (5) Joseph S. Renzulli--the enrichment triad; (6) Shlomo and
Yael Sharan--group investigations; (7) Hilda Taba--teaching strategies program;
(8) Calvin Taylor--multiple talent approach; and (9) Donald J. Treffinger--self-
directed learning.  In addition, five other approaches are briefly described:
J. P. Guilford--the structure of intellect; Lawrence Kohlberg--discussions of
moral dilemmas; Frank E. Williams--teaching strategies for thinking and
feeling; problem-based learning; and thinking actively in a social context.  The
final chapter offers guidelines for developing a comprehensive approach to
gifted education curricula.  (Individual chapters contain references.) (DB)<BR>

This paper introduces the Learning Outcomes Study at the University of
Virginia, an ongoing 2-year investigation of over 1,000 elementary school
children who entered one of 16 different gifted programs (or no program) in the
fall of 1990.  The study will compare effects of four examples each of four
types of program delivery arrangements: (1) within-classroom (or mainstream
type); (2) pull-out programs; (3) separate classes or ability tracking; (4) and
special schools.  Special comparisons will be made of program effects on
minority and disadvantaged students.  Information will also be collected on
each program's curriculum, teaching methods and goals, as well as the
background and training of program teachers, and student identification
criteria.  Students will be assessed four times: at the time of entry into a
formal gifted program, at the end of their first year in the program, and at
the beginning and end of their second year.  Multiple outcome measures will
assess student achievement, attitudes, and adjustment.  Additional questions
possibly examined include the relationship between self-concept and intrinsic
motivation; whether these two concepts have a differential impact on
achievement; and the behavioral adjustment of high achieving students.  (18

This book on effective curriculum for gifted students begins with an
introduction that discusses gifted education's use of the special education
model and implications of current educational reform.  Part 1, "General Issues
in the Design and Development of Appropriate Curricula for the Gifted," then
explores scope and sequence in curricula for the gifted, correspondence between
gifted learner characteristics and curricula, philosophy and goals for a gifted
program, gifted learner outcomes, teaching-learning activities and resources,
instructional strategies and management techniques, assessing and evaluating
curricula, and implementing a curriculum for gifted learners.  Part 2,
"Specific Considerations in Planning Curricula for Special Populations of
Gifted Learners," notes such special populations as disadvantaged gifted,
underachievers, gifted girls, and gifted students with disabilities.  This part
then examines methods of identifying and nurturing disadvantaged gifted
students and learning-disabled gifted students, and offers an individualized
plan for a learning-disabled gifted female.  Part 2 also contains four chapters
written by other authors: "A Perspective on Curriculum Development for Gifted
Learners" (Gail McEachron-Hirsch); "Curricula for Exceptional Children: A
Special Education Perspective" (Virginia Laycock); "Gifted Children with
Specific Learning Disabilities" (Lori Korinek); and "Bridging Family and
School: A School Psychologist Perspective" (Agnes Donovan).  The appendix
contains sample curriculum units, as follows: tessellations unit (fifth grade),
marvelous machines (fifth grade), the unexpected (eighth grade), exponential
and logarithmic functions (high school), a scientist's history of the world
(fourth to sixth grades), and investigating weather folklore (fourth grade).  (JDD)<BR>

This monograph describes the development of a scope and sequence model for
science education specifically intended for use with gifted students in grades
K-8.  Introductory material notes the rationale and purpose of the model as
well as its functions such as providing a scaffolding linking educational
concepts with the technology of school curriculum.  The three stages of the 21-
month project are outlined.  Instructional emphases of the curriculum are: (1)
scientific habits of mind; (2) critical/productive thinking skills; and (3)
metacognitive skills.  Ways to further differentiate the curriculum are
suggested, such as varying the level of the outcome and varying the
sophistication of the content.  Desired outcomes are grouped into generic
concept outcomes and scientific process outcomes with associated assessment
indicators.  Specific outcomes are listed by approximate grade level for
concepts; content applications (in biology, earth science, physical science);
interdisciplinary applications (social systems, number systems, cities as
systems, language, political systems, economic systems); the scientific
process; problem-based learning; technology (computer, camera, and calculator
skills); scientific habits of mind (stressing curiosity, creativity,
objectivity, openness to new ideas, and skepticism); critical/productive
thinking skills; and metacognitive strategies (planning, monitoring, assessing).
Guidelines for using the model for unit development are also offered.  (DB)<BR>

This paper highlights three models for implementing local restructuring of
schools: James Comer's School Development Program; Robert Slavin's Success for
All; and Henry Levin's Accelerated Schools.  These have been among the more
popular models for restructuring schools in poor, predominantly minority
neighborhoods with traditionally low-achieving students.  Separate sections
describe and analyze each of these programs individually.  Further sections
address important issues and themes common to all the programs.  One of these
sections discusses evaluation and assessment issues of both programs and
students.  A further section looks at the three models from the viewpoint of
traditional assessments.  A discussion of what causes improvements in learning
notes that: Comer's model is based on healing conflicts and creating an ethos
that fosters identification and bonding and a community of trust; Slavin's model
is more heavily cognitive; and Levin's format calls for active, intelligent
participation of all members.  Final sections review resources and costs for the
various programs, and efforts at replication.  An author bibliography is
included.<BR>

The Accelerated School Program is designed to improve the education of
disadvantaged students by using "acceleration" techniques used with gifted and
talented students.  The goal is to speed up the learning of at-risk students so
they will be able to perform at grade level by the end of elementary school. 
Central to the strategy is the placement of curriculum and instructional
decisions in the hands of the instructional staff, requiring a complete
restructuring of the traditional school organization.  The emphasis on local
responsibility for educational outcomes requires an appropriate decision-
structure built around the school's unity of purpose.  The school must also
develop the capacity to identify challenges, to understand these challenges,
and to implement and evaluate solutions.  Fifty schools nationwide have begun
the six-year process needed to implement the accelerated school program.  Cost
estimates average about $1,000 per pupil per year.  Although many issues
regarding curriculum development, changing staff roles, and developing parent
participation will require further exploration, the Accelerated Schools Model
offers hope for closing the educational gap between America and other
countries, and between the disadvantaged and the advantaged.  Comments by T. P.
Fitzgerald, Frances Kemmerer, and Steven D. Gold and a response by the
presenter are included.  (FMW)<BR>

Examining the question, "Why are children not mastering what they ought to be
learning in school?," this book merges cognitive science with educational
agenda to show how incompatible children's minds and natural patterns of
learning are to current educational materials, practices, and institutions,
making a case for restructuring the schools.  The chapters in the book are
divided into three parts.  The first part examines the characteristics of the
"natural" learner.  The second part explores the characteristics of educational
institutions, and the third part presents a reconceptualization of education
for the purpose of understanding.  The chapters are: (1) "Conceptualizing the
Development of the Mind"; (2) "Initial Learnings: Constraints and
Possibilities"; (3) "Knowing the World through Symbols"; (4) "The Worlds of the
Preschooler: The Emergence of Intuitive Understandings"; (5) "The Values and
Traditions of Education"; (6) "The Institution Called School"; (7) The

The article discusses the use of the Structure of Intellect (SOI) model as a
basis for developing thinking abilities in a variety of curriculum areas: (1)
the integration of subject matter areas and SOI operations; (2) thematic
lessons that sequence specific cells of the SOI model; (3) directed teaching
lessons to develop student awareness of their own thinking processes; (4)
strategies that foster student attitudes conducive to the use of divergent
thinking; and (5) application of SOI-based thinking abilities to problem
solving.  Sample curriculum activities are included as illustrations.  (Author/JW)<BR>

This updated 1987 article argues that teaching of thinking skills, common in
gifted education, has wider value in regular school instructional programs.  It
describes programs which have implemented Talents Unlimited, a classroom-level,
research-based model for teaching creative- and critical-thinking skills which
encompasses productive thinking, decision making, planning, forecasting, and
communication.  (VW)<BR>

<B><I> My school system is planning to develop a gifted program.  What resources
are available?

</B></I><P>The first step in planning a program for gifted students is to
contact your State Department of Education and
speak with the person responsible for gifted education.  Find out if your
state has written material on state policies or regulations that affect
education for students who are gifted.<P>

In program planning, there are many issues to be considered.  One primary 
issue is curriculum--deciding what students should know, matched with the 
characteristics and ability of the students.  Most instructional models are insufficient to 
address this issue because they must be massaged into lock-step time 
constraints. Therefore, many schools use a combination of models that provide 
structure, and then look closely at their own  curriculum.  Selected curriculum resources
are enclosed in this document.<P>

  This curriculum framework provides a model for developing appropriate and 
meaningful language arts curricula for high ability learners in kindergarten 
through grade 8. It is intended as a guide to making decisions about 
traditional curricular emphases within the language arts areas of reading, 
writing, speaking, and listening, as well as nontraditional areas like 
thinking, multiculturalism, and technology.  The curriculum development guide 
discusses: issues in developing learner outcomes; current language arts 
learning objectives specified by state guides; learner outcomes in the concept, 
content, and process dimensions; and interdisciplinary applications through 
project work.  Four goals are presented, each accompanied by learner outcomes 
and archetypal activities for high ability students in language arts.  The 
goals include: to develop analytical and interpretative skills in literature, 
to develop persuasive writing skills, to develop linguistic competency, and to 
develop listening/oral communication skills.  Several performance assessment 
protocols for language arts are provided.  An annotated list of 37 exemplary 
resources for teaching language arts to high ability learners concludes the 
guide.  (JDD)<BR>

  This concept paper outlines the rationale for a project on the development of 
science curriculum for K-8 high ability learners.  The rationale was developed 
through a synthesis of major recommendations from national science reform 
reports and from a review of the literature on effective science curriculum for 
high ability learners.  The paper begins with a summary of the background 
research, with emphasis on six key curriculum components: (1) developing an 
understanding of scientific concepts; (2) developing scientific inquiry skills; 
(3) developing a knowledge base in science areas; (4) developing 
interdisciplinary connections; (5) developing problem-based learning 
approaches; and (6) developing scientific habits of mind.  Then major project 
objectives are outlined.  These include: review of promising science curriculum 
materials for high ability learners; development of papers on key science 
concepts; development of a curriculum scope and sequence model; conducting a 
summer institute on teaching science to gifted learners; development of a set 
of exemplary science curriculum units; field testing of newly developed 
curriculum; and generation of scholarly publications.  A glossary defines key 
terms and an appendix provides a synthesis of science report recommendations.

  This paper contains findings of a study that investigated the extent to which 
three schools nationally recognized for their change efforts could provide 
evidence of systemic change.  The conceptual framework was developed from the 
following sources: (1) the effective-schools movement; (2) structural reform; 
(3) the middle-school movement; (4) curriculum, instruction, and assessment 
reform efforts; and (5) the literature on special-needs populations.  Data were 
obtained from interviews with the principals, school district personnel, 
teachers, students, and parents; classroom observation; and document analysis.  
Findings indicate that structural change efforts received the most focus in the 
three schools.  Despite engagement with the authentic-assessment movement, 
there was little change in curriculum and assessment practices.  Finally, the 
schools clearly communicated their visions.  A conclusion is that changing a 
school's philosophy and/or mission is only one step toward systemic change.  
Until change moves from the school-level structural arena to the classroom-level 
arena of curriculum and instruction, reform will continue to be piecemeal 
rather than systemic.  One figure and a copy of the interview protocol are 
included.  (LMI)<BR>

  This paper looks at broad trends in education of the gifted and identifies 
elements that states should review and reconsider in terms of the current 
climate for educational reform.  The 1972 Marland report is contrasted with the 
1993 report of the U.S.  Department of Education titled "National Excellence: A 
Case for Developing America's Talent;" Marland's exclusive focus on the 
education of the gifted and talented versus the later report's emphasis on 
excellence for all students is noted.  This paper then identifies the following 
specific areas for state policy review, based on a review of documents from 49 
states: (1) philosophy and rationale; (2) mandated services; (3) definitions of 
the gifted; (4) identification procedures; (5) programs for the gifted; and (6) 
differentiated curriculum and instruction.  States are urged to accept the 
challenge offered by the "National Excellence" Report, reevaluate their 
policies, and consider changes recommended in this paper.  (DB)<BR>

  This paper introduces the Learning Outcomes Study at the University of 
Virginia, an ongoing 2-year investigation of over 1,000 elementary school 
children who entered one of 16 different gifted programs (or no program) in the 
fall of 1990.  The study will compare effects of four examples each of four 
types of program delivery arrangements: (1) within-classroom (or mainstream 
type); (2) pull-out programs; (3) separate classes or ability tracking; (4) and 
special schools.  Special comparisons will be made of program effects on 
minority and disadvantaged students.  Information will also be collected on 
each program's curriculum, teaching methods and goals, as well as the 
background and training of program teachers, and student identification 
criteria.  Students will be assessed four times: at the time of entry into a 
formal gifted program, at the end of their first year in the program, and at 
the beginning and end of their second year.  Multiple outcome measures will 
assess student achievement, attitudes, and adjustment.  Additional questions 
possibly examined include the relationship between self-concept and intrinsic 
motivation; whether these two concepts have a differential impact on 
achievement; and the behavioral adjustment of high achieving students.  (18

  This textbook focuses on the development and education of talented children 
and adults.  Part 1 considers who the gifted and talented are, in terms of 
personality aspects, intellectual competence, and specific talent in a domain.  
It presents a pyramidal framework of talent based on looking at adult talent 
and its precursors in childhood behavior.  Chapters in Part 1 are: "Who Are the 
Talented? Giftedness, Talent, Genius, and Intelligence"; "Getting Started: 
Developing a Program for Talented Youth"; "Identifying the Academically 
Talented: Superior Cognitive Talent and Specific Academic Talent"; "Creativity 
and Talent"; and "Identifying Creativity and Talent Behaviors." Part 2 
considers the paths of talent development, from birth to adult in three 
chapters.  Part 3 considers what one does with talented children, in curriculum 
and counseling.  Part 3 chapters are: "Precepts for Curriculum for the 
Academically Talented," "Curriculum Practices: In and Out of the Classroom," 
"Guidance and Counseling Needs of the Talented," and "At-Risk Talented 
Children." The text emphasizes guidance aspects of dealing with talented 
children more than therapeutic approaches.  Each chapter begins with focusing 
questions.  Several case examples are offered of talented individuals, programs 
serving the gifted, and techniques for teaching gifted and talented individuals.
Appendices contain a gifted/talented data gathering questionnaire and the text 
of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  (Contains approximately 850 
references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This digest, in question and answer format, summarizes what is known about 
effective ways to provide fully educational services for gifted students in the 
regular classroom.  The following questions are addressed: What are the steps 
to full service? (educators need to plan environments in which all students can 
fully develop their abilities and interests); What are the characteristics of 
students who are gifted and talented? (such students differ in the pace of 
learning, depth of understanding, and interests); What is the role of the 
regular classroom teacher? (teachers should be facilitators with skills in both 
subject areas and learning management); What program options are needed to meet 
the needs of these students? (a multiple programming approach is needed); What 
instructional provisions must be made? (student characteristics should guide 
development of instructional accommodations).  A 14-item list of references and 
suggestions for further reading are included.  (DB)<BR>

  This paper proposes a five-step model intended to meet the needs of gifted 
students in the context of the mixed ability reality that most teachers in 
regular classrooms encounter.  The model consists of five steps each of which 
has several components.  The steps and components are: (1) acceptance 
(initiatives must start out small and sound to be successful, must focus on 
"cans" rather than "can'ts", and must recognize various learning patterns, 
styles, and rates); (2) classroom climate (should be child centered, active, 
open and respectful); (3) knowledge of content objectives (including the course 
of study, the role of textbooks, and a wide variety of resources and 
materials); (4) learning activities (characterized by flexible pacing, both 
acceleration and enrichment options, and use of interdisciplinary theme units); 
and (5) evaluation (use of alternative methods by a variety of individuals to 
evaluate both observable and nonobservable domains).  (DB)<BR>

  Gifted education depends on two linkages in its program development efforts: 
the special education linkage and the general education linkage.  A closer 
working relationship with general education is recommended, along with careful 
consideration of the curriculum reform movement, basic research on teaching and 
learning, and effective schools research.  (Author/JDD)<BR>

  This handbook is intended to aid in development of educational programs for 
gifted students in New Hampshire.  The handbook is divided into seven sections. 
Section I, provides material regarding the specific policies that authorize and 
pertain to gifted education in New Hampshire and offers resources to assist 
educators in describing the present status of gifted education in their area.  
Section II includes an overview of the nature and goals of gifted education, the 
rationale for gifted education, and the fundamental beliefs upon which the 
handbook's guidelines were established.  Section III examines preparation 
considerations to establish a sound foundation for planning efforts, such as 
setting priorities and gathering and analyzing data.  Section IV examines the 
nature and purposes of the planning process.  It outlines who should be 
involved in planning, reviews planning tasks, and provides a checklist to 
monitor planning progress.  Section V discusses major responsibilities and 
tasks at the district level such as promoting shared decision making and 
creating a master plan.  Section VI addresses the extension of district-level 
criteria to the local school or building level and proposes seven indicators of 
excellence in programming.  Section VII, discusses plan implementation and 
management, evaluation and long-range planning, and communication and school-
community relations.  Appendices include: "Summary of Planning Tasks," 
"References" (over 70); "Parent Handout on Contemporary Programming," 
"Assessing the Nurturing Students' Interests" (Talent Checklists), "Guidelines 
for Cooperative Agenda Meetings," and "Sample Forms and Resources from Selected 
Programming Models." (JDD)<BR>

<B><I> Help!  I need research to support the value of appropriate programs for gifted and talented students.  There is opposition to the idea and we are conducting a campaign to show support for the program.

</B></I><P>The first step in planning responsible advocacy for gifted students is to 
contact your state Department of Education in your state's capitol and speak with the person responsible for gifted education.  Find out if your state has written material on state policies or regulations that affect education for students who are gifted.<P>  

Responsible advocacy also includes an active lobbying effort for a rigorous 
regular education curriculum.  There are several reasons to do so.  First, a 
gifted education curriculum is based on the regular education curriculum.  And 
every child is entitled to an appropriate education, including continuous 
learning experiences.  Second, if the gifted program is perceived as the only 
"good" education, then all parents are justified in wanting this for their 
child. When measuring the rigor of the gifted education curriculum, let two 
questions guide your actions:  (1) Can every child do this? (2) Should every 
child do this?  If the answer to either question is "yes," then the 
curriculum would be difficult to justify as appropriate solely for gifted 
students. <P>

Other documents that are useful for advocacy include the following:<BR>

This report on the educational needs of American gifted and talented students 
identifies indicators of an educational crisis, describes the current status of 
education for these students, and presents recommendations to meet the 
educational needs of these students.  Indicators demonstrating the need for 
change include the relatively poor performance by American students on 
international tests and the small number of students performing at the highest 
levels on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests.  Recent studies 
have shown that gifted and talented elementary school students have mastered 35-
40% of the curriculum in five basic subjects before they begin the school year; 
most regular classroom teachers make few, if any, provisions for talented 
students; highest achieving students study less than an hour a day; and only 2 
cents out of every $100 spent on K-12 education supports special opportunities 
for talented students.  A review describes how gifted and talented students are 
currently identified, the number of students served, the kind of support 
available, the kind of education most gifted and talented students receive, and 
characteristics of effective programs for these students.  Seven 
recommendations are offered: (1) set challenging curricular standards; (2) 
establish high-level learning opportunities; (3) ensure access to early 
childhood education; (4) increase learning opportunities for disadvantaged and 
minority children with outstanding talents; (5) broaden the definition of 
gifted (a broadened definition based on the federal Javits Gifted and Talented 
Education Act is offered); (6) encourage appropriate teacher training and 
technical assistance; and (7) match world performance.  (Contains 43 
references.) (DB)<Br>

The Program Status Research Study examined the status of local programs for 
students with high abilities and reasons given by key personnel for program 
status.  A mail survey to 2,900 local personnel in 19 states (divided into four 
groups according to economic health and the existence or non-existence of a 
state mandate to provide services) yielded a response rate of 54 percent.  
Analysis indicated that programs in states with mandates and in good economic 
health are "intact" and "expanded," while programs in all other groups are 
being "threatened," "reduced," and "eliminated" in high numbers.  Respondents 
attributed intact programs to the existence of a state mandate and advocacy 
efforts and threatened programs to a decline in state and local funds.  
Respondents indicated that 75 percent of high ability students in grades 3-8 
receive program services, 50 percent in grades 1-2 and 9-12, receive similar 
services, but program services for students at the Pre-K to K level were almost 
nonexistent.  Interviews with four key personnel from each state confirmed the 
main reasons given by survey respondents for variations in program status.  Six 
guidelines with accompanying research support are offered, including, among 
others: (1) maintenance of advocacy efforts in states with good economic health 
and mandates; (2) increase of advocacy efforts in states with poor economic 
health and/or where mandates do not exist; and (3) focus of advocacy efforts on 
policy makers at the state government level.  Appendices include the survey and 
exemplary policy statements of school boards.  (Contains 60 references.) (DB)<Br>

This digest offers guidelines for group advocacy efforts on behalf of gifted 
education.  Four potential pitfalls are identified: using an adversarial rather 
than a persuasive approach; assuming that people in administrative and 
political positions are not too bright or not very knowledgeable--or both; 
being impatient; and ineffectively coping with intragroup tensions.  In 
contrast, effective advocacy involves four basic phases: needs assessment; 
planning; contact; and follow up and evaluation.  Eleven guidelines for 
establishing and maintaining a successful parent advocacy group are suggested 
and include: focus on a mission and a sense of purpose; include not only 
parents but also business leaders and school professionals; contact the state 
advocacy group; adopt a constitution that spells out the organization's goals; 
identify and respect the group that holds the power; allow professionals to 
develop the program; conduct short- and long-term evaluation of the advocacy 
process; and be an informed advocate.  (DB)<Br>

first examines the doctrine of progress, suggesting that important educational 
change is glacial and much of what purports to be educational change is 
ephemeral.  It claims that the present prime directive of our educational 
system is to socialize job holders.  Such reform movements as "authentic 
assessment" are seen to be more efforts to hold schools accountable to 
government than true examples of educational change.  An alternative view is 
offered, which states that: (1) progress along the path of improvement is 
uncertain; (2) schooling tries to make people useful, but ends by dumbing them 
down; (3) good schooling entails enlightenment; and (4) education is a process 
of liberation that does not require schooling.  It is concluded that teachers 
of gifted students need to see their prime mission as care of students' 
intellect, rather than development of their hypothetical usefulness.  The 
existing "one best system" for all students is seen as in decline and suffering 
from an epidemic of "thoughtlessness" which can only be countered by an 
emphasis on thoughtfulness in the education of the gifted.  (Contains seven

This speech by an educator and parent of gifted children addresses the 
problem of appropriate educational services for gifted children, concluding 
that advocacy for these children entails pushing for acceleration, an often 
neglected but effective option.  The paper begins with anecdotes which 
illustrate the unmet needs of gifted children and which identify recent trends 
questioning the economic utility of higher education.  The paper suggests that 
gifted children often learn laziness in school and that the goal for such 
children should not be "normalization" as it is for exceptional children with 
handicaps but, rather, maximization of the child's potential.  The presentation 
claims that rapid progress is needed to stimulate gifted children to stay 
gifted, and therefore acceleration should always be considered when developing 
Individualized Education Programs for gifted students.  A framework for rapid 
progress is offered, listing service and placement options ranging from regular 
age-grade placement to an advanced program in a special school.  (DB)<Br>

New York State does not have a mandate requiring differential instruction for 
gifted students but has increased services.  Factors promoting program 
development have included financial incentives, mandatory screening, 
educational reform, and vigorous advocacy.  Negative factors associated with 
lack of a mandate have been inequities in program access, program quality 
control, and limited teacher preparation programs.  (DB)<Br>

<B><I> Have there been any longitudinal studies on gifted students and the effect of 
special services such as gifted programs?

</B></I><P> There are very few longitudinal studies, but some effects can be gleaned from them.  Differentiated curriculum does have a positive effect on achievement outcomes, but other factors, such as individual persistence and sense of mission, are very important.  Programs that are entirely within a heterogeneous class are less likely to result in increased learning than other program types, perhaps because it is harder to offer the necessary consistent challenge.  Well thought out programs allowing grade or subject acceleration produce positive learning effects and do not appear to hamper social or emotional development.<P>

This report describes an extension of the Learning Outcomes Study (a 
nationwide longitudinal investigation of 1,010 students just entering programs 
for gifted learners in grades 2 and 3) to investigate excellence within each of 
the four program types considered: within-class programs, pull-out programs, 
separate classes, and special schools.  The qualitative extension focused on an 
"exemplary" model from each of the program types.  Two program evaluation 
tools, the Program Profile Form and Program Satisfaction Survey (with versions 
for students, parents, teachers, and administrators), were created to document 
key program components.  Program profiles included a description of each 
program's setting and general procedures (identification process, curricular 
options, staff selection, school demographics) and five criteria: leadership, 
atmosphere and environment, communication, curriculum and instruction, and 
attention to student needs.  In addition, ways that all selected programs 
addressed the needs of diverse populations of students were addressed.  
Appendices provide additional information on program demographic information, 
program profiles, the interview questions used, the program satisfaction 
surveys, and other research aspects of the study.  Executive Summary is also 
published separately.  (Contains approximately 95 references.) (DB)<BR>

The summary report describes a 5-year longitudinal study in Calgary (Alberta, 
Canada) of gifted and talented students from grade 9 through the post-high 
school year.  Students had previously attended either a special school setting 
or were integrated with regular students in their home schools.  The study 
examined: students' achievement; their progress and well-being in academic, 
social, and personal domains; course work; transition from junior high to 
senior high school; high school graduation; and preparedness for post-high 
school life.  Subjective data obtained included the views of students, parents, 
and teachers over the 5 years.  Objective data included student scores on tests 
and academic grades.  Additional data included students' areas of strengths and 
weaknesses, choices made by students, activities engaged in, and recognitions 
they received.  General findings included: students on the whole were 
successful, well-adjusted individuals; special school and mainstreamed students 
were comparable with respect to skills, abilities, and progress in academic, 
personal, and social domains; achievement of the two groups of students was 
generally comparable; students who had attended the special school were more 
likely to report satisfaction than mainstreamed students; and fewer special 
school than mainstreamed students reported social adjustment problems at the 
postsecondary level.  (DB)<BR>

The purpose was to investigate the long-term impact of the California State 
University (Sacramento) Academic Talent Search Summer School (ATSSS) by means 
of a longitudinal follow-up of students at an interval of 4 years.  A group of 
100 academically talented middle school students (grades 7 through 9) were 
selected from the 350 participants in the ATSSS at California State University 
in 1984.  Qualifications for the program were based on scores on the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test or equivalent test scores.  During the summer, students studied 
fast-paced mathematics, writing, and/or Latin.  Four years later, in 1988, a 
questionnaire was mailed to the selected students to determine their high 
school experiences.  A response rate of 80% of the 100 locatable students gave 
a sample that compared favorably with the 1984 summer school group.  Responses 
were analyzed descriptively using frequency distribution and cross-tabulation 
tables.  Results indicate that: (1) program participants viewed the experience 
as highly positive; (2) academic acceleration through the program was 
associated with positive changes in school grades as indicated by grade point 
averages, interest in school and learning, and in students' abilities to get 
along with intellectual peers, age peers, and adults; (3) the program 
contributed to self-esteem and feelings of self-control; and (4) participants 
performed well in sports as well as academics.  No pattern of social 
maladjustments or harmful results from the acceleration was found.  (TJH)<BR>

The intellectual and social abilities of young precocious children and the 
effects of educational interventions on these children are examined in this 
third year report of a longitudinal study of the developmental patterns of 
unusually precocious children.  The report focuses on several studies conducted 
with preschool and elementary school age children during the 1977-78 granting 
year.  Included are a brief overview of the project structure; test performance 
results for the 1977-78 year, (including cognitive, social, and personality 
factor data); descriptions of 3 educational intervention programs studied, and 
a report on the current status of the longitudinal study's focal group of 
"extraordinarily precocious" children.  The appendices which comprise 
approximately half the documents contain program information and related 
letters and brochures as well as 3 papers describing the identification of 
intellectual precocity in young children, social development in intellectually 
advanced children, and the tenets of the Early Entrance/Optimal Match Program.

There are many students with high native abilities that remain underdeveloped because of inadequate opportunity, practice, and motivation. Although genetics significantly affects development of various intelligences, environment (including cultural values) and sequential experiences help crystallize native abilities. Schools must organize and institutionalize equal opportunities and experiences for talented students, regardless of race, gender, or ethnic origin.(12 references) (MLH)<BR>

This report on gifted education is based on surveys returned by central education agencies in 49 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The first section contains informational charts which provide a broad overview of state level services for gifted students. Included are data on the level of personnel support for the program, whether or not the state has a mandate and what the mandate requires, the number of students served by the program, and the level of financial support for these services. The second part of the report contains narrative information from state and trust territories on topics related to school reform. This section shows the impact that issues such as middle grade reform, site-based decisionmaking, and state education agency reorganization have had and are having on services to gifted students. Finally, the third section contains the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of contact persons at state education agencies and state associations. (DB)<BR>

This report presents a model state legislative bill to provide for the special needs of gifted and talented students. The model bill utilizes a "best practices" framework and attempts to be fiscally responsible and provide maximum flexibility while meeting the needs of gifted and talented students.  The model legislation itself begins with a statement of purpose followed by a section defining the population of gifted and talented students and stating a policy of nondiscrimination. A section on supervision of gifted and talented programs covers the Office of State Coordinator, the duties of the Office of State Coordinator, and collaboration with the State Advisory Board. The section on the State Advisory Board for Gifted and Talented Education includes guidelines for Board establishment, Board membership, and Board duties.  Specific program responsibilities and criteria are presented in the section on gifted and talented programs. In addition, a definition and nondiscrimination policy statement are offered on the issue of traditionally underserved populations. The final section makes appropriation recommendations. Following the model legislation, analysis is provided for each of the Bill's sections.  (DB)<BR>

This paper, commissioned for the development of the national report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing America's Talent," examines current state policies, regulations, and legislation concerning education programs for gifted and talented students. The paper also looks at other state policies which have a direct influence on the nature and scope of local programs for gifted and talented students. Recent policies to restructure education are considered in the context of their effects on programs for gifted and talented students. Specific principles are recommended for shaping the reform agenda in the areas of curriculum and instruction, accountability, and governance. For each principle, examples of actions and potential impact on gifted and talented students are discussed. In addition, approaches taken by states to the following traditional issues are considered: (1) whether gifted and talented education policies should be linked with special education policies; (2) how the state should define and demarcate the gifted and talented population; (3) whether the state should mandate services for gifted and talented students; and (4) how the state can provide fiscal incentives to districts for gifted and talented education programs. The paper concludes with a checklist for states in policy development and recommendations for federal leadership. (DB)<BR>

This study analyzed state policies on the identification and education of gifted students as reflected in legislation, regulations, rules, recommendations, and guidelines provided by 49 states. The elements examined include: (1) state mandated services, (2) district plans for the gifted, (3) gifted education as part of special education, (4) philosophy or rationale, (5) definitions of gifted and talented, (6) identification procedures, (7) programs for the gifted, (8) differentiated curriculum and instruction, (9) counseling and other support services, (10) parent involvement, (11) program evaluation, (12) teacher education and certification, and (13) state funding for the gifted. The analysis indicated that all states have formulated policies that support education of the gifted and talented but that considerable variability among states exists with respect to specific components. Major recommendations are made in the following areas: establishing challenging curriculum standards; providing high-level learning opportunities; ensuring access to early childhood education; offering extended opportunities for economically disadvantaged and minority children; providing teacher training and technical assistance; and matching the high performance of similar students throughout the world.

This monograph presents a paradigm for identifying giftedness among all 
groups of young people.  Section 1 presents a review and critique of 
traditional identification approaches and highlights the limitations that tests 
may have for identifying talent potential among groups currently 
underrepresented in gifted programs.  Section 2 examines the values and 
environmental influences of several cultures, to identify the additional 
challenges faced by high achieving, ethnically diverse students.  Within-group 
cultural differences are also considered.  The third section reports the 
results of an exploratory study which examined the characteristics of 
economically disadvantaged and limited English proficient gifted students.  
Section 4 looks at behaviors that characterize gifted performance, noting 
research results which suggest that there may be well-known "absolute" 
behaviors which characterize high performance cross-culturally, as well as 
specific behaviors which manifest themselves in particular cultural contexts.  Emerging insights from the Javits Gifted and Talented Students' Education Act 
are addressed in the fifth section.  The final section provides a synthesis of 
the previously presented ideas and proposes a five-element paradigm of 
giftedness, including: (1) new constructs of giftedness; (2) absolute and 
specific behaviors; (3) cultural and contextual variables; (4) authentic 
assessment; and (5) identification through learning opportunities.  Executive 
Summary is also published separately.  (Contains approximately 125 references.)

The Gifted Education Policy Studies Program was designed to address two
issues: the status of state and local policies on the identification of gifted
students from special populations (culturally diverse, children with
disabilities, and economically disadvantaged); and the impact of educational
reform movements (cooperative learning and middle schools) on services for
gifted students.  Content analysis of documents collected from each state
concerning identification of gifted students revealed that inclusive policies
were present, but the record for actual inclusion of special populations was
poor.  Site visits to three states (Arkansas, Ohio, Texas) with inclusive
practices revealed that local leaders were able to take state help in the form
of demonstration projects and seed money to create broader identification
procedures.  Barriers to more effective policies were identified, and model
legislation was developed.  Concerning the impact of middle schools on gifted
education, a survey of 400 teachers revealed that gifted education specialists
embraced ability grouping and rejected the position that being identified as
gifted created social difficulties for students, while middle schools personnel
felt the opposite.  A survey of educators of gifted students and educators
using cooperative learning revealed differences on almost every dimension
concerning the value of cooperative learning.  Case studies identified features
of middle schools with strong programs for gifted students and features of
programs that blend cooperative learning and gifted education.  (Contains 42

This report on the educational needs of American gifted and talented students
identifies indicators of an educational crisis, describes the current status of
education for these students, and presents recommendations to meet the
educational needs of these students.  Indicators demonstrating the need for
change include the relatively poor performance by American students on
international tests and the small number of students performing at the highest
levels on National Assessment of Educational Progress tests.  Recent studies
have shown that gifted and talented elementary school students have mastered 35-
40% of the curriculum in five basic subjects before they begin the school year;
most regular classroom teachers make few, if any, provisions for talented
students; highest achieving students study less than an hour a day; and only 2
cents out of every $100 spent on K-12 education supports special opportunities
for talented students.  A review describes how gifted and talented students are
currently identified, the number of students served, the kind of support
available, the kind of education most gifted and talented students receive, and
characteristics of effective programs for these students.  Seven
recommendations are offered: (1) set challenging curricular standards; (2)
establish high-level learning opportunities; (3) ensure access to early
childhood education; (4) increase learning opportunities for disadvantaged and
minority children with outstanding talents; (5) broaden the definition of
gifted (a broadened definition based on the federal Javits Gifted and Talented
Education Act is offered); (6) encourage appropriate teacher training and
technical assistance; and (7) match world performance.  (Contains 43

This collection of 41 articles examines critical issues in the provision of  special services for gifted Asian American, American Indian, Black, and  Hispanic American students.  The following key issues are addressed for each  group: (1) the identification of the gifted in that population; (2) the purpose  of the special program for that population; (3) the need to differentiate the  special program from that provided for majority culture students; (4) the  nature of program modifications; and (5) any special considerations and  administrative implications.  The following findings are discussed: (1)  definitions of giftedness must be appropriate to the student being served; (2)  internal program articulation must address student strengths and weaknesses,  and prevent interruptions in service by stabilizing placement criteria; (3)  definitions, program purpose, and identification procedures must be clear; (4)  all aspects of the program must be consistent with each other; (5) definitions  and program purposes must be comprehensive; (6) teachers must respond to the  differing values, concerns, and behavioral manifestations of giftedness; (7)  gifted students must be viewed as having unique needs that are different from  their peers'; and (8) instruments and procedures used in assessment must be  valid.  A 32-item list of materials and resources for developing a curriculum  for Hispanic American students and 32 charts and illustrations are included.   Statistical data are presented in three tables and one graph.  A 495-item  bibliography and brief biographies of the editors and contributors are appended.   (FMW)<BR>

  This book contains 450 strategies for starting or improving programs for 
including students with disabilities in regular classrooms.  Consideration is 
first given to developing a plan for inclusion, grouping students, using 
assistants for the student groups, scheduling, presenting the inclusion plan, 
training staff, setting up an inclusion classroom, and working as a team.  
Specific classroom and curriculum modifications are then discussed, including 
modifications to textbooks and novels, daily assignments, spelling and written 
language, mathematics strategies, oral and written directions, oral 
presentations, note-taking, and grading.  Suggestions are offered for creating 
audiocassettes, providing additional support for students with hearing and 
vision impairments, modifying the environment for students with attention 
deficit disorder, and dealing with behavior and attention difficulties as well 
as impulsivity and distractibility.  Appended are 21 worksheets and 
reproducible forms to survey teachers, parents, and students; gather student 
data; develop a schedule; develop curriculum modifications; and carry out other 
administrative activities.  (SW)<BR>

  This textbook emphasizes practical guidelines and approaches that work with 
special students mainstreamed into regular classrooms.  The background of the 
mainstream and inclusion movements and labeling practices is considered, along 
with specific exceptionalities and methods effective in teaching children who 
have learning disabilities, mental handicaps, behavior problems, physical 
impairments, visual impairments, and hearing impairments.  The book then covers 
the concept, practice, and components of the Individualized Education Plan, 
including teamwork in planning and implementation.  Classroom organization and 
management techniques are addressed, including behavior management and the 
affective components of learning, attitudes, and how to communicate teacher 
expectations.  The final chapters address basic skill areas, including: 
identification of reading difficulties, reading strategies, oral and written 
language, spelling, handwriting, mathematics assessment tools, mathematics 
instructional content, and techniques for helping children with special 
learning needs in math.  The potential of technology to meet the increasing 
diversity in the general education setting is also addressed.  Step-by-step 
suggestions and classroom vignettes are included, along with a glossary.  (Each 
chapter contains references.) (SW)<BR>

  This study evaluated the short-term and long-term effects of three variants
of a case-by-case process for readying students with learning disabilities to
move successfully from resource rooms to regular classrooms for math
instruction.  Twenty-seven special educators from 21 elementary and middle
schools and their 47 students with learning disabilities were assigned randomly
to one of three experimental conditions or a control group.  In the
experimental conditions, students were prepared for the transition by use of
curriculum-based measurement and transenvironmental programming, each alone and
in combination.  Educational placement, math achievement, and student attitudes
about reintegration were assessed in special and regular education settings.
Teachers using the more complex and labor-intensive variants of the case-by-
case process were more successful at moving students across settings and
fostering greater math achievement and positive attitude change, especially
while the students were still in special education.  Nevertheless, at 1-year
follow-up, about half of the 47 students had never been integrated or were
moved to the mainstream temporarily, only to be returned to special education.
One reason for the relatively high return rate may have been that reintegrated
students' math achievement slowed considerably in the mainstream.  Implications
are discussed.  Study data are presented in nine tables and one figure.

  This bulletin summarizes research on the benefits of inclusive education
programs; provides data on the current status of special education; and
considers studies of individual inclusion programs, state and district studies,
and the effects of inclusion on students without disabilities.  The research
and evaluation data on inclusion indicate a strong trend toward improved
student outcomes (academic, behavior, and social) for both special education
and general education students.  It is suggested that the drive for upgrading
standards and the inclusion of all students in these reforms has created
tension for educators.  A point of congruence between the school effectiveness
efforts and those promoting inclusion is that a new approach must become part
of a restructured educational system.  Districts conducting successful
restructuring programs that include all students have identified the following
key factors: visionary leadership; collaboration; refocused use of assessment;
supports for staff and students; funding that is sufficient and "follows the
student," and effective parent and family involvement.  (Contains 57

  This article presents strategies for early intervention in integrated
settings for children with disabilities.  The strategies attempt to follow
principles of both developmentally appropriate practice and effective special
education.  Strategies are grouped into four categories: (1) attention and
responsiveness to the child; (2) environmental structuring, (3) adult
mediation, and (4) peer mediation.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Progress in implementing the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act 
(IDEA) and recommendations to further promote its implementation via the 1995 
legislative reauthorization process are examined.  The purpose of the 
legislation and major court findings regarding its interpretation are discussed.  
Ten hearings conducted by the National Council on Disabilities, to elicit views 
of parents and students on the law's effectiveness and to gather 
recommendations for better implementation, are summarized, with testimony from 
witnesses in the following 10 theme areas: the "zero reject" provision of the 
law, assessment for eligibility and nondiscriminatory evaluation of students, 
providing for appropriate education, providing the least restrictive 
environment, parent participation in decision-making, procedural due process 
for students, services to transition students from school to activities after 
school, discretionary programs to help implement the law, provisions that 
determine the federal share of costs and how federal funds are allocated, and 
the 1994 federal educational reform law entitled the Educate America Act.  
Appendices include hearing dates, locations, participants and witnesses, and a 
synthesis regarding IDEA implementation based on 27 research papers.  (SW)<BR>

  Full inclusion is a confusing topic.  Many people misunderstand the "least 
restrictive environment" provision of the federal Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act.  Districts need not educate every disabled child in a regular 
classroom for the entire day, but have numerous options, so long as each child 
is carefully evaluated.  Recent lawsuits brought by parents of mentally 
retarded children support mainstreaming practices.  (MLH)<BR>

  During the early years of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act

Recent cases may signal that the courts may be growing impatient with school

  This theme issue provides guidance on school district compliance with the 
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) in the inclusion of students 
with disabilities.  It provides a summary and analysis of four recent decisions 
in federal appellate courts, which all affirmed the right of students with 
significant disabilities to attend regular education classes full time when the 
educational benefits for the individual student warrant such a placement.  The 
cases are: "Daniel R.R. v. State Board of Education," "Greer v. Rome City 
School District," "Oberti v. Board of Education of the Borough of Clementon 
School District," and "Sacramento City Unified School District v. Rachel 
Holland," and were decided upon by the Fifth, Eleventh, Third, and Ninth 
Circuit Courts, respectively.  Consistent across all the decisions is the 
holding that, before denying a student the opportunity to be in an inclusive 
setting, school districts must demonstrate that placement in the regular class 
with appropriate support services and supplementary aids will not provide 
benefit for the student.  It is also noted that the U.S.  Supreme Court has 
denied review of the Holland decision, suggesting that these appellate court 
decisions will be the standard for some time to come.  (DB)<BR>

  Whether inclusion will produce resource economies for school districts is
difficult to determine.  Districts that have developed inclusive models have
reported mixed results.  There appear to be no savings in personnel costs,
although some overall reduction in transportation expenditure has occurred.  Inclusion
demands a more fluid approach to resource allocation.  (18 references)

  Describes mainstreaming at the Dowling Urban Environment Learning Center in
Minneapolis, Minnesota--a fully inclusive, racially mixed, K-6 magnet school
that is expensive but well worth the cost.  This school has a clear purpose,
few signs of emotional exhaustion among staff, and little depersonalization.  Dowling's
ambience is in marked contrast to an ineffectively managed middle
school described in the September 1994 "Kappan." (MLH) <BR>

  Mara Sapon-Shevin and Jim Kauffman debate the potential and pitfalls of the
inclusion movement.  Sapon-Shevin enumerates the benefits of inclusion
accompanied by adequate resources, support and commitment, teacher preparation
time, restructuring, and staff development.  Kauffman insists that alternative
settings are necessary for some students and deplores "dumping" kids,
regardless of need, into regular classrooms to save money.  (MLH)<BR>

  This investigation examined longitudinal cost data of one school district's
movement toward more inclusive practices.  Findings included district costs
were significantly less than comparable costs for out-of-district services;
numbers of students with severe disabilities significantly increased over a
five-year period; and contractual (related services) costs doubled over the
period.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Profiles teachers' everyday experiences at a southeastern Texas middle school
that mainstreams most of its special needs students.  Classroom observations,
accompanied by teacher and student survey data, showed that mainstreaming had
deleterious effects.  Since teachers spent a disproportionate amount of time
serving special education students, regular students received less individual
assistance, parent-teacher contacts, and lesson preparation time.  (MLH)<BR>

  Target Audience: Practitioners<BR>
  The position paper of the Grand Island, Nebraska, schools supports the 
assumption that when a pupil's handicap affects his ability to learn and 
perform, appropriate special education should include guidelines for special 
grading.  The paper identifies grading obstacles such as differing perceptions 
of various participants in the grading process.  Three grading philosophies 
(criterion-referenced, self-referenced, and norm-referenced) are explained.  
General grading practices (e.g., use of a multiple grading system to serve 
diverse functions) are recommended.  Also noted are grading practices for 
handicapped and remedial students grouped into categories based on standards, 
grading vehicles, or logistics.  Elements of the grading process supported by 
this paper include performance criteria, the grading decision, and reporting 
systems.  Physical, cognitive, emotional, and sensory handicapping factors are 
described as they relate to grading practices.  Problems that regular educators 
have with adjusting grading practices for handicapped pupils are noted.  Ten 
grading policy recommendations include grading by the subject teacher, 
designation of "alternative assignment" when adaptive grading is applied, 
reporting to parents in the form of a written progress report as well as a 
standard grade, and failure only in extreme and well-documented cases.  
Questions to help a teacher determine whether alternative grading is necessary 
for a mainstreamed student are offered.  A sample matrix of grading messages 
and receivers, a grading contract, a multicategory system of grading 
mainstreamed handicapped students, and a three-page reference list conclude the 
document.  (DB)<BR>

  Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
  The paper examines several basic grading procedures, noting the advantages 
and disadvantages of each procedure for handicapped students.  Eight 
alternatives to grading are mentioned; of these, four are considered: (1) 
contract grading, (2) pass-fail grading, (3) the mastery learning approach, and 
(4) written evaluations (including checklists).  It is suggested that a more 
appropriate approach than any of these commonly found practices must be worked 
out on a building level.  Samples of grading proposals are provided which may 
be useful to vocational teachers, including a pass-fail system based on 
competency achievement for a post-secondary program with suggested time 
parameters of 6, 9, and 12 months; a proposal combining grading with a 
weighting system; and a framework consisting of a set of assumptions and a 
single learner progress chart.  (CL)<BR>

Many school districts are still wrestling with the issue of how best to design  and implement inclusive programs.  The National Longitudinal Study, as cited by  the U.S. Department of Education (1994) indicates that the success of students  with disabilities in regular education classes is related to the supports and  services they receive. <P>

Studies have indicated that when general education classes are modified to  accommodate the needs of students with disabilities, these students have  improved educational outcomes.  For students with severe disabilities, these  outcomes include better social development, more social interactions, enhanced  skill acquisition and generalization, better health, more independence, greater  success in meeting the objectives of individualized educational plans (IEPs),  more positive attitudes on the part of nondisabled peers and others in the  community, and more normalized adult functioning.  For students with mild  disabilities, studies found that integrated placements resulted in higher  academic achievement and greater socioemotional growth.  Recent research  suggests that the more students with disabilities are included in general  education classrooms and other age-appropriate environments, the more likely  they are to have positive outcomes (Hunt, Farron-Davis, Staub, Beckstead,  Curtis, Karasoff, & Sailor, 1992).<P>

This report documents what has been learned through the National Longitudinal  Transition Study (NLTS) of Special Education Students about regular education  and secondary students with disabilities.  Findings are based on data from more  than 8,000 youth in secondary special education, ages 13 to 21, in 1985-86.   Focus of the report is on how much time students spent in regular education and  the effects of regular education on outcomes independent of student and other  characteristics.  After an introductory chapter, chapter 2 presents a general  description of the methodology of the NLTS and a discussion of analytic  considerations unique to this report.  Chapter 3 looks at characteristics of  students with disabilities in regular education.  Chapter 4 describes academic  and social outcomes during high school associated with time in regular  education.  Outcomes for young adults in the areas of postsecondary education,  employment, independent living, and community participation are presented in  chapter 5. Chapter 6 synthesizes findings from the NLTS about regular education  and secondary school students with disabilities.  (Contains 41 references.) (DB)<BR>

This paper presents findings of a 6-year study exploring factors contributing  to postsecondary school attendance or nonattendance by youth with disabilities  based on data from the National Longitudinal Transition Study of Special  Education Students (NLTS) for 8,000 students, ages 13 through 21, with  disabilities.  Factors found to be related to enrollment in postsecondary  institutions included student ability/achievement, parental education,  family/school urbanicity, parent expectations, enrollment in academic classes,  and involvement in high school group activities.  Students who were  mainstreamed in high school academic classes were found to be more likely to go  on to postsecondary education, and students who displayed antisocial or  behavioral problems were found to be less likely to enroll in postsecondary  education.  Findings for postsecondary academic programs were similar to those  for vocational programs.  Appendices provide background information on the NLTS  sample and a list of 19 reports and papers based on the NLTS.  (Contains 45  references.) (PB)<BR>

This paper focuses on the secondary school experiences of Hispanic students  with disabilities, presenting findings from the National Longitudinal  Transition Study (NLTS) of Special Education Students.  The 5-year NLTS study  included data on more than 8,000 students (of whom 733 were Hispanic) enrolled  in special education in the 1985-86 school year.  The data provided in this  report were collected in 1987 from telephone interviews with parents of the  NLTS Hispanic youth.  The paper begins with a description of individual and  family background factors, such as disability category, functional skills,  youth demographics and household characteristics.  It continues with a  description of students' secondary school experiences including school  characteristics (such as size and urbanicity) and school policies and practices  regarding instructional placement and vocational education services and  programs.  The paper then focuses on aspects of student school performance and  activities related to vocational and instructional placement experiences  including absenteeism, school completion, employment during secondary school,  and participation in extracurricular activities.  Findings indicated that  Hispanic students with disabilities were unlikely to be in racially integrated  or mainstream settings, had fewer vocational training opportunities than other  special education students, and were unlikely to participate in extracurricular  group activities.  An appendix presents background information on the NLTS.   (35 references) (DB)<BR>

This report presents findings of a 5-year study on the transition of youth  with disabilities from secondary school to early adulthood.  The study included  more than 8,000 youth with disabilities who were aged 13 to 21 and receiving  special education in 1985-86.  It examined experiences of the students in  education, employment, and personal independence.  Data included interviews  with students' parents in 1987, analysis of school records, and a survey of  educators, followed up by 1989 interviews with a subsample of 800 parents  and/or youth.  An executive summary reports major findings addressing:  characteristics of youth with disabilities, secondary school programs of  students in regular schools, secondary school programs of students in special  schools, secondary school performance, secondary school completion, social  integration, personal and residential independence, employment, enrollment in  postsecondary schools, engagement in productive activities outside the home,  youth with emotional disturbances, youth with visual impairments, severely  impaired youth, young women with disabilities, the economically disadvantaged,  the link between secondary school and postschool outcomes, occupationally  oriented vocational training, regular education placements, work experience  during high school, and social activities.  The report provides narrative  analysis and many tables detailing findings in 11 chapters: "Introduction"  (Mary Wagner); "More Than a Label: Characteristics of Youth with Disabilities"  (Camille Marder and Robert Cox); "Secondary School Programs" (Mary Wagner);  "Secondary School Performance" (Mary Wagner); "Sticking It Out: Secondary  School Completion" (Mary Wagner); "Social Activities" (Lynn Newman); "Growing  Up, Moving On: Aspects of Personal and Residential Independence" (Lynn Newman);  "The Working World Awaits: Employment Experiences during and Shortly after  Secondary School" (Ronald D'Amico); "Enrollment in Postsecondary Schools" (Paul  Butler-Nalin and Mary Wagner); "A Broader Look at Outcomes: Engagement in  Productive Activities after Secondary School" (E.

This study examined the management, operation, and effectiveness of special  education programs in 33 urban school districts from 1984-85 through 1986-87.   Data were collected on special education students, facilities, budgets, pre- referral, referral, placement, exit from special education programs, program  evaluation, vocational education, related services, special education  complaints and hearings, mainstreaming, and student progress evaluation  criteria.  Findings are organized around six underlying themes: the stability  of school district enrollments and funding for special education programs; the  referral and subsequent placement of students in special education programs;  the incidence of complaints and hearings; the impact of federal and state  regulations on program evaluation; the integration of special and regular  education programs; and policy and program recommendations.  No major  increasing trends were found in enrollment or expenditures over the years  studied.  Numbers of inappropriate referrals were reduced.  Complaints and  hearings were not a major problem in most areas, and most special education  students were enrolled in buildings that also held regular education classes.   Recommendations based on these and other findings are offered.  Eleven  appendices describe the study's methodology and present raw data.  (PB)<BR>

The concerns of Kansas educators about the implementation of the Education  for All Handicapped Children Act (P.L.  94-142) mandate are examined in this  research report.  Five different samples of public school educators, totaling  7,000 persons, were randomly selected and stratified according to district size. Each sample was sent either the Stages of Concerns Questionnaire (SoCQ) or the  General Concerns Inventory (GCI).  Returns were obtained from between 32 and 39  percent of the different samples.  The hypothesis central to the study was that  the developmental sequence of concerns is predictable and can be observed and  measured.  The longitudinal design provided a basis for (1) an annual  examination of educators' concerns regarding P.L.  94-142, (2) assessment of  the change in stages of concern over time, (3) a test of the developmental  change theory, and (4) the design and development of a new instrument, the  General Concerns Inventory.  The results from 3 years of study (1978-80)  indicated that Kansas educators are still at an early stage of adoption of the  mandated policy and only modest developmental change has occurred in the  interval, though that change is in the hypothesized direction.  The  developmental theory received continued support.  (Author/MLF)<BR>

  This paper presents a summary of the current status of efforts to include
students with mental retardation in mainstream educational programs.  It begins
with a summary of a New Jersey federal court's ruling requiring more inclusive
education and a discussion of the commitment of the Arc (formerly The
Association for Retarded Citizens of the United States) to greater inclusion.
The benefits of inclusive education for students with and without disabilities
are briefly reviewed.  Summary data (for 1989-90) are then given on placements
nationally in eight different instructional arrangements.  The next sections
provide national and individual state data on the extent to which children with
mental retardation are being educated in the following instructional settings:
regular classes, resource rooms, separate classrooms, and separate schools.  A
summary points out that only 6.7 percent of children with mental retardation
are being educated in regular classrooms and that children with mental
retardation are much more likely than children with other disabilities to be in
segregated settings.  Ranking of states by a weighted formula finds most states
place fewer than 10 percent of children with mental retardation in regular
classes.  The paper ends with a call to action for policymakers and
administrators in the federal, state, and local governments as well as Arc
chapter members.  An appendix provides a table of state data.  (DB)

  The paper examines critical issues involved in the debate over the Regular
Education Initiative (REI) to merge special and regular education, with
emphasis on implications for school psychologists.  The arguments of proponents
and opponents of the REI are summarized and the lack of involvement by school
psychologists is noted.  The REI is seen to effect school psychologists by a
possibly drastic reduction in the demand for professional psychological
services in the schools, and by the denial of valuable and necessary
psychological services to many special needs students.  Specific issues that
psychologists need to address are: (1) pupil identification and classification;
(2) pupil placement; and (3) changing roles and responsibilities.  School
psychologists are urged to become more involved in the debate because their
expertise is needed, because they have a professional responsibility to
contribute, and because REI could have a direct impact on their future
employment possibilities.  They are urged to become involved at the
professional/organizational level and at the local school level.  Includes 33

  This critical discussion of current trends in special education examines the
current inclusive schools movement and compares it to the regular education
initiative (REI).  After contrasting the two movements' respective advocates,
goals, tactics, and understanding of and links to general education, the paper
argues that the field's rhetoric has become increasingly strident and its
perspective has become increasingly insular and disassociated from general
education's concerns.  Especially noted is the disproportional influence in the
inclusive schools movement of those concerned with individuals with severe
intellectual disabilities (especially The Association for the Severely
Handicapped) and their rejection of the concept of a continuum of placement
options.  Goals of the inclusionists are seen as focusing on abolishing special
education and promoting social competence (in contrast to REI's emphasis on
preventing academic failure and emphasizing academic standards and
accountability).  Special education is blamed by many in the inclusive schools
movement as being responsible for general education's failure to accommodate
diverse student needs.  Believers in full inclusion are urged to put the
specific needs of individual children first and to compromise with general
education.  However, a pessimistic prediction is proffered concerning the
current movement's ability to forge a productive alliance with general
education.  (Contains 120 references.) (Author/DB)<br>

  This review of the literature and analysis looks at the concept of full
inclusion of students with disabilities in the context of the regular education
initiative (REI).  The concept of full inclusion is explained as the use of new
methods, techniques, and strategies to teach students with and without
disabilities in the same classroom.  Identification of assumptions underlying
the issue precede specific arguments both for and against full inclusion.  An
analysis of the validity of both sets of arguments considers attitudes of
educators, parents, and students.  Next, the paper looks at values emphasized
and compromised by the full inclusion model such as increased emphasis on
cooperative learning and social development and possible compromises in the
values of educational excellence and efficiency.  The paper concludes that full
inclusion is the preferred condition but should not be the only possibility.
Also stressed is the importance of specialists, classroom teachers, parents,
and students all participating in student program development and decision
making.  (Contains 212 references.) (DB)<br>

  Written from the perspective of a state director of special education, the
paper identifies and discusses accomplishments in special education during the
10 years since the Education for All Handicapped Children Act (P.L.  94-142)
was enacted, current problems and issues, and future challenges within the
following key areas of change: (1) access to education for all handicapped
children; (2) continuum of services from birth to adulthood--early childhood
intervention; (3) continuum of services from birth to adulthood--transition
programs for older students with handicaps; (4) least restrictive environment;
(5) special education manpower; (6) monitoring of special education
programs/related services; and (7) programs for gifted students.  Despite the
increasing financial challenges facing special education the future is likely
to bring solidified regular and special education partnerships, programming for
unserved and underserved groups of handicapped students, improved
implementation of the continuum of services delivery approach, increased
effective integration of severely handicapped into the public schools,
maintenance of procedural safeguards along with efforts to reduce the
legalistic burdens on special education, increased emphasis on technical
assistance in state monitoring of special education programs, and continuation
and enhancement of gifted programming.  (DB)<br>

  This paper argues that the philosophic assumptions underlying full inclusion
efforts for students with severe disabilities and other restructuring movements
are actually barriers to "best practice" implementation, and an alternative
perspective based on social relations is offered.  First two different
perspectives on disability, the "different person" perspective (which sees
differences as inherent and immutable) and the rights perspective (which views
all individuals as entitled to the same rights, services, and outcomes) are
compared.  Both perspectives are seen to result in a dilemma and be
inappropriate to guide current restructuring.  In contrast, the social
relations perspective views differences in the context of relationships which
are expected to change with time or as the comparison basis changes.  This
perspective is applied to a case in which an emphasis on gender differences in
provision of maternity leave is replaced with relation-based provision of
parental or family leave.  Other examples apply the social relations
perspective to inclusion of students with severe disabilities and the provision
of bilingual/bicultural education to all students and not just to the Spanish-
speaking minority.  (Contains 15 references.) (DB)<br>

  This descriptive study formulates a comprehensive picture of the structure,
educational practices, and associated positive student outcomes of integrated
programs for students with severe disabilities across a variety of California
communities.  Three of the seven participating programs represented the full
inclusion model of integration implemented at the elementary level.  Four of
the programs represented special class models of integration; two were located
at elementary schools and two at high schools.  The study presents descriptive
information on each of the models of integration, with quantitative measures of
positive student outcomes.  Outcome measures in this preliminary study were
restricted to the quality of the students' individualized education programs
(IEP), the extent of integrated activities for each child across the school
day, and the extent and type of interactions occurring between the students
with disabilities and their nondisabled schoolmates.  Findings included the
following: (1) the high school special class model received the highest rating
for quality of IEPs; (2) students in the full inclusion programs spent an
average of 94 percent of school hours in integrated settings; and (3) the
amount of reciprocal interaction was almost identical across the three models.

  This fact sheet provides a definition of learning disability (LD) in adults; 
a list of common elements found in many useful LD definitions; and a list of 
areas in which LD may affect life situations of adults.  The background of the 
concept of "learning disability" is briefly reviewed, followed by the 
definition of the Interagency Committee on Learning Disabilities, which was 
selected for use by the National Adult Literacy and Learning Disabilities 
Center because it reflects current information and issues associated with LD, 
allows for the presence of learning disabilities at any age, and has wide 
acceptance in the LD community.  Highlights of the definition are pointed out, 
as are common elements in a variety of LD definitions.  Definitions adopted by 
the U.S.  Office of Education in 1977, the Learning Disabilities Association of 
America, the National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities, and the 
Rehabilitation Services Administration are also provided.  Finally, a brief 
discussion identifies areas in which LD impacts adults, including self esteem, 
education, vocation, social interactions, and independent living.  (DB)<BR>

  This guide is intended to help the literacy practitioner in the 
identification of adults with learning disabilities.  These adults have worked 
diligently for a year or more to improve comprehension skills, writing and 
spelling, or work skills, yet, have made little progress.  The role of 
screening as only the first step in a process involving a formal assessment by 
a qualified professional, is stressed.  First, a set of questions to be 
answered by the literacy practitioner as he/she observes the individual is 
provided.  Next are lists of typical characteristics of individuals with 
vision/hearing and/or auditory/visual processing problems.  Following this is a 
list of typical problems in three areas of academic performance: reading, 
expressive language, and mathematics.  A list of behavior patterns and 
psychological manifestations indicating the possibility of a learning 
disability is also provided.  Finally, other means of information gathering 
such as reviews of records, a screening interview, a screening questionnaire, 
and a screening tool are suggested.  (DB)<BR>

diverse challenges faced by students with disabling conditions.  Twenty-three 
case studies describe actual scenarios experienced in the school district of 
Palm Beach County, Florida.  For each case study, a situation is described, a 
challenge is identified, solutions are considered, an assessment is made to 
select the most appropriate system, and expenditures for the selected system 
are determined.  The case studies deal with students with the following 
disabilities: arthrogryposis, cancer, cerebral palsy, educable mentally 
handicapped, emotionally disabled, gifted learning disabled, hearing impaired, 
muscular dystrophy, near drowning, post encephalitic generalized dystonia, 
stroke, traumatic brain injury, traumatic spinal cord injury, and visually 
impaired.  Twelve vignettes are then presented, describing school situations 
that involve the use of assistive technology and challenging the reader to 
develop strategies to solve the problems described.  A list of vendors is 
supplied, and school district procedures for placement of adaptive/assistive 
equipment for students with disabilities are included.  (JDD)<BR>

This paper describes programs and resources that focus on access of 
postsecondary students with disabilities to computers and other forms of 
technology.  Increased access to technological devices and services is provided 
to students with disabilities under the Technology-Related Assistance for 
Individuals with Disabilities Act (Tech Act).  Section 508 of the 
Rehabilitation Act as amended by P.L.  99-506, may also have an impact as it 
requires that electronic office equipment used by the federal government be 
usable by persons with disabilities and may increase accessibility in other 
markets as well.  Special programs have been developed at several colleges and 
universities to provide computer access for individuals with disabilities.  
These programs train students in use of large print terminals, adaptive 
keyboards, computerized braillers, talking computers, and other aids to 
independence.  Seven publications that discuss financial support for purchasing 
adaptive technology are described, along with two organizations offering 
financial support.  Several resources that assist with accessing computer 
technology are also described, such as the inLarge screen enlarging program, 
the SpeechViewer II software and accessories package, the IBM PC User Group, 
the Unicorn Smart Keyboard, and a journal titled "Technology and Disability."

Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990, Section 504 
of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Americans with Disabilities Act, and the 
regulations implementing these statutes.  The paper defines "assistive 
technology device" and "assistive technology service," outlines 
responsibilities of states receiving IDEA funds to provide such devices and 
services, notes eligibility requirements, examines requirements for vocational 
education programs, considers the use of assistive technology devices and 
services to enable placement in regular education settings, discusses the 
provision of auxiliary aids to students in postsecondary education programs, 
reviews the scope of the term "auxiliary aids and services," and points out 
that individuals with disabilities in public and private schools must be 
afforded an opportunity to participate in or benefit from an aid or service 
equal to that afforded others.  References to the United States Code, the Code 
of Federal Regulations, and court cases are provided to support the paper's 
views.  (JDD)<BR>

Through technology, students with disabilities are identifying new options 
for participation, exerting more control, making more choices, and interacting 
more effectively.  Inclusion, as a policy and as a practice, is reducing the 
physical and social isolation encountered by individuals and families, 
broadening expectations, reducing limits, and expanding choices.  Technology 
and inclusion go hand in hand.  Without technology supports and accommodations, 
many students cannot take full advantage of education.  Without the 
opportunities for interaction found in inclusive settings, students cannot 
truly demonstrate their abilities.  The following areas should be analyzed to 
determine whether technology support has the potential to facilitate the 
child's participation: (1) transportation to and from school and related 
events; (2) physical access; (3) classroom/library equipment and modifications; 
(4) shop/vocational education; (5) lunchroom; (6) playground/gym; (7) 
evaluation/assessment; (8) curriculum; (9) Individualized Education Program or 
Individualized Family Service Plan; (10) training; and (11) planning and policy.
Several questions to consider in analyzing each area are listed.  (JDD)<BR>

  This study, involving 4 children (ages 6 and 11) with autism, demonstrated 
that a self-management technique was effective in improving responsiveness to 
verbal initiations from others and in extending responsiveness to settings 
(community, home, and school) without the presence of a treatment provider.  
Concomitant reductions in disruptive behavior were also observed.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  Four district brochures presenting guidelines on services for children and 
adults with autism have been combined to form this document.  "General 
Guidelines for Education and Treatment of Individuals with Autism" addresses 
aspects of education and treatment, listing important questions about such 
topics as ancillary services, indivdualization, home programming, and 
accreditation.  "Guidelines Pertaining to Adult Day Training/Workshops" 
examines adult day training/workshops, and touches upon such issues as the need 
for distinct services, individualized planning, and the philosophy of training 
and programming.  "Guidelines Pertaining to Group Homes for Children and 
Adults" covers issues of community resources, individualization, staff 
training, and the role of the parents.  In the fourth brochure, guidelines are 
offered for the selection of an appropriate educational placement for students 
with autism.  Areas addressed are classroom environment and structure, 
student/staff ratio, teaching methods, progress evaluation, accountability, 
related services, and personal reactions.  (CL)<BR>

  The booklet provides background information on the diagnosis and 
characteristics of autism.  A chart portrays the signs and symptoms, followed 
by the definition of the syndrome by the National Society For Children and 
Adults with Autism.  Associated features are noted along with information on 
age of onset, etiology, incidence and sex ratio, complications, and 
differential diagnosis.  The diagnostic criteria put forth by the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Third Edition) DSM-III are also 
presented in terms of associated features, age at onset, course, impairment, 
complications, prevalence, sex ratio, predisposing factors, familial pattern, 
and differential diagnosis.  Typical behaviors, such as unusual response to 
sound and unusual speech patterns, are listed.  Programmatic requirements, 
including early diagnosis and appropriate intervention, highly structured 
programs, and comprehensive home programming/parent training, are summarized.  
A brochure entitled "Questions and Answers," which presents practical questions 
and answers on autism is attached.  (CL)<BR>

  This monograph describes the program of the Language and Cognitive 
Development Center (Massachusetts), which serves toddlers and school-aged 
children with autism or other pervasive developmental disorders (PDD).  An 
introduction presents incidence figures, the program's philosophy, the 
program's approach to assessment, intervention with children having limited 
reality systems, approaches to generalization of training, dealing with 
behavior problems, and the program's unique approach to teaching language.  
Next, a discussion of cognitive-developmental systems theory examines child 
development in terms of the sign stage of development (0-18 months), formation 
and dynamics of reality systems during the sign stage, and the development of 
intention during the sign stage.  Intervention is then considered, including 
the program's "Umwelt" approach to the evaluation of reality systems, 
correcting developmental dysfunctions, developing body schema, coping with 
surroundings, developing social contact, and developing communication and 
representation skills.  The integration of skills learned in the Center into 
the home environment is then explained.  A final discussion answers questions 
concerning the curriculum for school-age nonverbal or limited verbal PDD 
children, examines determinants of child success, and offers evidence of the 
program's success (48 percent of Center children have returned to the public 
school mainstream for all or part of their classes).  (Contains 53 references.)

  A case study of a 3-year-old autistic child and her family is presented, 
following the child through a 3-year intensive intervention program with a 
multidisciplinary team in a day treatment program.  The day treatment program 
plan included academic goals, language goals, parental goals, and home training 
goals.  A major component of the program was the family's participation in a 
behavior-based developmental model training course.  The document presents the 
child's developmental history, school history, and early intervention 
strategies.  A follow-up study 5 years after leaving the day treatment program 
found that the child had made apparent cognitive and behavioral improvements.  
Her language skills remained weak and her eye contact limited, and she 
exhibited little spontaneity.  Her parents retained and used the skills learned 
from their earlier participation in the parent training course.  Family 
counseling was recommended to aid in meeting the challenge of parenting an 
adolescent and to establish long-term educational and vocational goals.  Seven

  This investigation compared self-talk use in five preschool autistic children 
(ages 57 to 86 months) and in matched chronological age and mental age peer 
groups.  Videotape recordings of the children during free play with and without 
an adult were coded for the following self-talk categories: (1) private, 
mastery speech; (2) stereotypic repetitions; (3) word play; (4) self-regulative 
speech; (5) utterances; and (6) mouthing of words.  All three groups exhibited 
fewer instances of self-talk in the presence of adults than without an adult.  
The autistic children demonstrated a similar pattern of self-talk with adults 
as did their control peers.  Autistic children showed less consistency in 
behaviors between the adult present and adult absent situation than did 
controls; this was not felt to reflect their lack of response to adults in 
their environment, but rather to the high production of utterances and private 
mastery talk when they were not with an adult.  (Contains six figures/tables.)

  Preschool children with autism (n=9) and their normally developing peers 
(n=9) were compared before and after one school year.  The autistic children 
had narrowed the gap after treatment--making a nearly 19-point increase in 
intelligence quotient and an 8-point gain in language quotient.  Results 
support the value of a language enriched early intervention program.  (DB)<BR>

  This study investigated the communicative behavior of five high-level and 
five low-level autistic children (ages 3-5 years).  Differential responses of 
parents and a clinician to the children's protesting, responses, and 
initiations were assessed.  Findings indicate differential interaction behavior 
and behavior problems of autistic children with their parents and a clinician.  
Both groups of autistic children reacted quite sensitively to different 
interaction partners and their communicative feedback.  Low-level autistic 
children mainly used nonverbal protests when interacting with their parents.  
Parents tended to respond to appropriate communicative acts with new demands, 
while the clinician acknowledged the communication.  Reassessment of the low-
level group after 20 months of daily therapy showed a significant reduction of 
protests and noncompliance and an increase in parents' positive feedback.

The following definition is from <i>The Encyclopedia of Mental and Physical Handicaps</I>, Tver and Tver (1991):<P>

The term aphasic is applied to a person who has had a total loss or lack of language function.  Aphasia is only occasionally found in children; but when it is, its subjects are assigned to one of two major categories:  either as expressive (motor) aphasic; or receptive (sensory) aphasic.  The expressive aphasic: (1) understands but cannot express; (2) knows words but cannot negotiate them; (3) communicates by pulling, pointing, and gesturing; (4) repeats one or two known syllables; (5) evidences no muscular paralysis; (6) possesses adequate intelligence for speech implementation.  The receptive aphasic: (1) lacks understanding of speech and ignores sounds; (2) hears at one moment, but not at the next; (3) may be confused with one who is deaf (the child exhibits the same characteristics); (4) has moderate loss of hearing and may tilt head toward the speaker; (5) displays a discrepancy between intelligence and ability to communicate.  <P>

  A patient with chronic agrammatic Broca's aphasia exhibited deep dyslexia and 
was treated with functional reorganization of the phonetic route of reading, 
with the patient learning consciously to control formerly automatic behaviors.  
The patient's responses indicated that the phonetic route encompasses at least 
two dissociable functions: grapheme-phoneme conversion and sequential analysis.

Apraxia (dyspraxia) refers to a disorder of the nervous system, characterized by an 
inability to carry out purposeful movements, but not accompanied by a loss of 
sensory function or paralysis.  An individual may have severe difficulty in performing drawing, writing, buttoning, and other tasks requiring fine motor skill, or in sequencing the necessary movements.<P>

  Five children, aged 7-10 years, exhibiting Developmental Verbal Apraxia (DVA) 
were evaluated to determine the presence of word-retrieval problems.  DVA is a 
symptom cluster including at least some of 21 potential symptoms, such as 
delayed speech development and severe articulation disorder.  The Boston Naming 
Test (a picture confrontation naming task) and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary 
Test-Revised, Form L, were administered to all subjects.  Evidence of word-
finding problems was based on the number of correct responses, the speed with 
which responses were given, and other word-finding behaviors.  Results 
indicated that the DVA children had more restricted receptive vocabularies, 
expressively identified fewer pictures correctly upon confrontation,  identified 
the pictures more slowly than did normal children of the same age, and 
exhibited more behaviors often associated with word-finding problems (such as 
fidgeting and hitting their heads).  A year later, two of the DVA children were 
administered the new German's Test of Word Finding, which confirmed the 
continuing presence of word-finding problems.  It was concluded that children 
exhibiting DVA are thus at high risk to exhibit significant word-retrieval 
problems, and remedial objectives addressing these problems should be included 
in treatment programs of DVA clients so identified.  Appended are tables 
detailing the research results.  (JDD)<BR>

The <i> Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-4)</i> offers five subcategories of Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD). They are:<BR>
 <ul>Autistic Disorder<BR>
 Rett's Disorder<BR>
 Childhood Disintegrative Disorder<BR>
 Asperger's Disorder<BR>
 Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified <BR>
  (Including Atypical Autism)</ul><P>

<B>DSM-IV 299.80 - ASPERGER'S DISORDER</B><br>
Diagnostic Features<P>
 
The essential features of Asperger's Disorder are severe and
sustained impairment in social interaction and the development of
restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and
activities. The disturbance must cause clinically significant
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of
functioning. In contrast to Autistic Disorder, there are no
clinically significant delays in language. In addition, there are no
clinically significant delays in cognitive development or in the
development of age-appropriate self-help skills, adaptive behavior,
and curiosity about the environment in childhood. The diagnosis is
not given if the criteria are met for any other specific Pervasive
Developmental Disorder or for Schizophrenia.<P>
 
Prevalence<P>
 
  Information on the prevalence of Asperger's Disorder is limited,
but it appears to be more common in males.<P>
 
Course<P>
 
  Asperger's Disorder appears to have a somewhat later onset than
Autistic Disorder, or at least to be recognized later. Motor delays
or motor clumsiness may be noted in the preschool period.
Difficulties in social interaction may become more apparent in the
school context. It is during this time that particular idiosyncratic
or circumscribed interests (such as a fascination with train
schedules) may appear to be recognized as such. As adults,
individuals with the condition may have problems with empathy and
modulation of social interaction. This disorder apparently follows a
continuous course and, in the vast majority of cases, the duration is
lifelong.<P>
 
Familial Pattern<P>
 
  Although the available data are limited, there appears to be an
increased frequency of Asperger's Disorder among family members of
individuals who have the disorder.<P>
 
Differential Diagnosis<P>
 
  Asperger's Disorder is not diagnosed if criteria are met for
another PERVASIVE DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDER or for SCHIZOPHRENIA.
Asperger's Disorder must also be distinguished from
OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER and SCHIZOID PERSONALITY DISORDER.
Asperger's Disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder share repetitive
and stereotyped patterns of behavior. In contrast to OCD, Asperger's
is characterized by a qualitative impairment in social interaction and
a more restricted pattern of interests and activities. In contrast to
Schizoid Personality Disorder, Asperger's is characterized by
stereotyped behaviors and interests and by more severely impaired
social interaction.<P>
 
Diagnostic Criteria<P>
 
A. Qualitative impairment in social interaction as manifested by at
 least two of the following:<BR>
 
 <ol><li>marked impairment in the use of multiple nonverbal behaviors
  such as eye-to-eye gaze, facial expression, body postures, and
  gestures to regulate social interaction.<BR>
 
 <li>failure to develop peer relationships appropriate to
  developmental level.<BR>
 
 <li>a lack of spontaneous seeking to share enjoyment, interests, or
  achievements with other people (for example, by a lack of
  showing, bringing, or pointing out objects of interest to other
  people).<BR>
 
 <li>lack of social or emotional reciprocity.<P></ol>
 
B. Restricted repetitive and stereotyped patterns of behavior,
 interests, and activities as manifested by at least one of the
 following:<BR>
 
 <ol><li>encompassing preoccupation with one or more stereotyped and
  restricted patterns of interest that is abnormal either in
  intensity or focus.<BR>
 
 <li>apparently inflexible adherence to specific, nonfunctional
  routines or rituals.
 
 <li>stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms (hand or finger
  flapping or twisting, or complex whole-body movements).
 
 <li>persistent preoccupation with parts of objects.<P></ol>
 
C. The disturbance causes clinically significant impairment in
 social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.<P>
 
D. There is no clinically significant general delay in language
 (single words used by age 2 years, communicative phrases used by
 age 3 years).<P>
 
E. There is no clinically significant delay in cognitive development
 or in the development of age-appropriate self-help skills,
 adaptive behavior (other than in social interaction), and
 curiosity about the environment in childhood.<P>
 
F. Criteria are not met for another specific Pervasive Developmental
 Disorder or Schizophrenia.<P>

  This study compared Rorschach test performance of 12 subjects with Asperger 
syndrome (AS) and 12 subjects with high-functioning autism (HFA, mean age 12 
years).  AS subjects demonstrated a trend toward greater levels of disorganized 
thinking than the HFA group and were more likely to be classified as 
"introversive." The test did not differentiate the two groups on most variables.

referred less to a previous stretch of the conversation and more to an aspect 
of the physical environment. The Asperger group was very similar to the 
controls. (Author/JDD)<BR>

 Two experiments evaluated the social interactions of 15 Asperger-type 
autistic subjects with either normal or schizoid control subjects. Asperger 
subjects tended to avoid gazing at the interviewer when the interviewer was 
talking. Results suggest that a lifelong absence of gaze response to social 
clues including speech may explain some features of autism. (Author/DB)<BR>

 Consideration of underlying neurological and psychological deficits suggests 
that the autistic syndrome results from the coexistence of at least two 
distinct constellations of functional impairments: deficits in mechanical 
language skills, as in the developmental dysphasias; and deficits in social 
relatedness, play, and nonverbal communication, as in Asperger's syndrome.

 Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
 This book addresses the educational needs of children who are pervasively 
developmentally delayed (PDD), especially those exposed to drugs prenatally and 
those with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, autism, hyperactivity, Asperger Syndrome, 
other heath impairments, attention deficit disorder, and childhood aphasia. 
The first chapter recommends the use of the PDD Characteristics Checklist, the 
Communication/Behavior Prompts Form, and the Developmental Ages Checklist to 
identify specific target skills and behaviors. The second chapter offers 
guidance on organizing the classroom including the "quiet chair;" classroom 
arrangement; instructional materials; use of learning centers; and suggested 
books, screening instruments, and augmentative communication systems. 
Classroom management techniques are discussed in the third chapter and include 
getting control; getting the child to sit down, stay down, and develop on-task 
behavior; remediating visual/tactile and auditory ultrasensitivity; dealing 
with aggression; intervening with self-stimulating behaviors; and managing 
inappropriate behaviors. The fourth chapter considers basics of language 
acquisition, alternative forms of communication, and the importance of 
communication skills to socialization. Some useful examples of sign language 
are illustrated. Sensory development activities are suggested in the fifth 
chapter. Chapter 6 offers suggestions for working with parents and chapter 7 
offers some specific successful techniques in changing behaviors. Sample forms 
are attached. (40 references) (DB)<BR>

  This book presents training activities for special education or regular 
teachers to use with children having auditory processing disorders.  Each 
chapter begins with a discussion of theory and general intervention guidelines 
and then presents remedial activities.  The first chapter looks at auditory 
processes overall, lists the normal sequence of auditory skill development, and 
offers suggestions for helping students with auditory processing problems in 
the regular classroom.  The second chapter considers auditory discrimination 
and provides a list of appropriate tests and 85 remedial exercises.  Next, a 
list of tests and 71 remedial exercises are provided for improving auditory 
memory.  The fourth chapter considers auditory perception, identifying tests 
and giving 64 exercises.  Remaining chapters provide discussion, suggested 
tests, and remedial exercises for: auditory-vocal association (60 exercises); 
auditory synthesis (34 exercises); auditory-vocal automaticity (32 exercises); 
auditory figure-ground (12 exercises); and reading skills (24 exercises).  The 
last chapter lists commercial materials including books, filmstrips and 
accompanying records, games, instructional aids, instructional kits, programs,

  This book was written to help teachers gain a better understanding of 
children who are failing in school and to provide a systematic process of 
attacking their learning problems.  The text presents workable principles for 
determining probable causes of learning problems and for selecting suitable, 
effective remedial activities.  Learning problems dealt with include: visual 
processing problems (sequencing, memory, abstraction, and discrimination); 
auditory processing (sequencing, memory, abstraction, and discrimination); 
verbal processing (production and response); kinesthetic processing 
(perception, coordination, learning, and memory); and abstract processing 
(integration, nonverbal concepts, and concentration).  For each problem area, 
the book includes symptoms, instructions for personal observation, tests 
commonly used to verify and substantiate a specific diagnosis, and suggestions 
for general classroom assistance and individual remediation.  (Contains 
approximately 80 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  A 90-minute inservice workshop to facilitate early identification of children 
"at risk" for auditory processing problems was presented to 44 preschool 
teachers.  Results indicated that, with a relatively brief training experience, 
preschool teachers can be taught to identify and refer such children.

  Journal Announcement: CIJDEC87<BR>
  A technique for evaluating children's auditory-language processing abilities 
was developed.  Teachers were trained in inservice workshops to identify 
auditory-language processing problems, using the Observational Profile of 
Classroom Communication.  They subsequently referred 46 nonhandicapped first-, 
second-, and third-graders for evaluation, which indicated that 87% had 
problems.  The technique was considered effective.  (KM)<BR>

	The study investigated and recorded changes in selected psychomotor skills 
of an 11-year old gifted male with severe motoric problems identified as 
dysgraphia.  A pre-post test design using videotape evaluation recordings was 
employed to determine changes in psychomotor performance, and a rating scale was 
designed to establish baseline and determine performance changes after 
administration of a sensory motor intervention approach.  The approach featured 
stimulation of vestibular, kinesthetic, tactile, and visual sensory modalities.  
Correlated tests were applied to factor grouped data as measured by a panel of 
six raters, indicating that the S improved significantly in body awareness and 
visual-motor control.  The practical value of single-subject designs is 
emphasized.  (Author/CL)  <BR>

The following material was excerpted from the 
<a href=http://pie.org/TM/E22035T3635> Orton Dyslexia Society [PIE Online] World
Wide Web Server</a><P>

The Orton Dyslexia Society has two working definitions of dyslexia:<br>
"Dyslexia is a neurologically-based, often familial, disorder which interferes with the
acquisition and processing of language.  Varying in degrees of severity, it is manifested
by difficulties in receptive and expressive language, including phonological processing
in reading, writing, spelling, handwriting, and sometimes in arithmetic.  Dyslexia is not a
result of lack of motivation, sensory impairment, inadequate instructional or
environmental opportunities, or other limiting conditions, but may occur together with
these conditions.  Although dyslexia is life-long, individuals with dyslexia frequently
respond successfully to timely and appropriate intervention."<P>

"Dyslexia is one of several distinct learning disabilities.  It is a specific language-based
disorder of constitutional origin characterized by difficulties in single word decoding,
usually reflecting insufficient phonological processing abilities.  These difficulties in
single word decoding are often unexpected in relation to age and other cognitive and
academic abilities; they are not the result of generalized developmental disability or
sensory impairment.
Dyslexia is manifested by variable difficulty with different forms of language, often
including, in addition to problems in reading, a conspicuous problem with acquiring
proficiency in writing and spelling."<P>

  This digest presents basic information for those providing educational 
services to children with dyslexia who have phonological core deficits.  First 
it provides a brief overview, noting the incidence of dyslexia and the large 
number of these children with phonological deficits which result in far less 
academic progress than experienced by other children with learning disabilities.
A definition of phonological core deficits notes the major components of 
phonemic awareness, sound-symbol relations, and storage and retrieval of 
phonological information in memory.  Several criteria for classification and 
identification of dyslexia and learning disability are summarized and popular 
assessment measures are listed.  Ten suggested interventions are noted, such as 
teaching metacognitive strategies, providing direct instruction in language 
analysis and the alphabetic code, and using techniques that make phonemes more 
concrete.  Also listed are some print resources for teachers, relevant 
associations, and electronic resources.  (DB)<BR>

  Pointing out that the label of dyslexia carries an acute stigma of mental 
incompetence (and the researcher/author is herself dyslexic), this booklet 
intends to provide educators and parents with a frame of reference regarding 
the topic of dyslexia.  Defining dyslexia broadly as "characterized by a 
consistent difficulty with processing phonological information," the book first 
discusses some of the ways in which dyslexia operates, how a diagnosis can be 
made in the classroom, causes of dyslexia, and the necessity of referring the 
child for testing with a reading specialist if consistent dyslexic reading 
patterns are noted.  Chapter 2 presents a history of dyslexia and proposes a 
working definition of the term followed by chapters 3 and 4 directed to the 
parents of the dyslexic child and to the teacher of the dyslexic child.  Next 
chapters 5-8 discuss fundamental reading skills, classroom methods for teaching 
language arts, classroom methods for teaching content areas, and methods for 
handling group work.  The book concludes with a methodology of assessing the 
performance and progression of dyslexic students.  References and a list of 
professional organizations which specialize in understanding dyslexia are 
attached.  (NKA)<BR>

  A descriptive study examined how school districts in Texas identify students 
for dyslexia programs.  Of the 300 districts surveyed, one-third responded with 
a long list of assessment instruments with no clear focus towards a definition 
of dyslexia, nor were notations cited accounting for discrepancies within 
learning achievement and other demonstrations of thinking.  Districts generally 
said they followed the guidelines of the Texas Education Agency and used a 
variety of intelligence tests and achievement tests.  The districts did list a 
number of tests to assess phonological information processed by the individual, 
but none were of recent publication date.  In addition, visual/auditory 
perception, visual motor integration and listening comprehension were all 
important areas of assessment linked to success in language development and 
reading, writing, and spelling.  Perhaps what is important in the end is the 
sense that the learner, not the label, is important.  (Contains 16 references.)

Target Audience: Practitioners <BR>
 This practicum focused on the use of repeated taped reading instruction with 
modeling to improve fluency, comprehension, and automatic word recognition in 
five students (ages 11-13 years) with learning disabilities for a period of 10 
weeks.  The instruction also involved the teacher giving corrective feedback and 
having the students answer story map questions both orally and in written form.  
Students' pre-intervention and post-intervention performance was compared in 
oral reading, comprehension, word recognition, and attitude toward reading.  
Results indicated that students improved in comprehension, fluency, and word 
recognition.  The practicum results supported the need to develop a reading 
program that is frustration-proof and failure-proof for use with the 
learning-disabled child.  Appendices include the Heatington Attitude Scale, 
sample story map questions, and samples of students' work.  (Includes 14 
references.) (JDD)  <BR>

are examined: sensory processing (assessment of tactile, proprioceptive, 
vestibular, auditory and visual functions) and praxis (ideation, motor planning 
and execution).  Procedures include standardized test items, parent interviews, 
and behavior observation.  (Author/KM)<BR>

  A group of 182 children (ages four through nine) with known or suspected 
sensory integrative dysfunction were assessed using tests and clinical 
observations to examine developmental dyspraxia.  The study did not justify the 
existence of either a unitary function or different types of developmental

  The Adapted Cuing Technique (ACT) was created to accompany oral stimulus 
presentation in treatment of dyspraxia.  ACT is consistent with current 
treatment theory, emphasizing patterns of articulatory movement, manner of 
production, and multimodality facilitation.  A case study describes the use of 
ACT in the treatment of a five-year-old child.  (Author/CL)<BR>

  This pamphlet presents an overview of speech and language disorders including 
a description of symptoms, possible causes, identification, intervention, and 
current research.  Description of the disorders includes examples of symptoms; 
the four components and the physical tools of speech; and the role of the 
brain, including its hemispheres, problems during maturation, and its language 
centers.  Examples are given of speech disorders (phonological impairment, 
verbal dyspraxia, and dysarthria); language disorders (form errors, content 
errors, and use errors) and expressive and receptive language disorders.  The 
concept of delay versus disorder is discussed.  The process of handicap 
identification is described, noting conditions which must be ruled out and 
stressing the importance of early identification and intervention.  Current 
methods of therapy are described, and research is cited indicating that speech 
disorders may be outgrown by adolescence but that difficulties involving 
language use may persist into adulthood.  Ongoing research involves 
investigation of differences in brain organization, investigation of the 
genetic connection, and the use of computers to train children with language 
impairments to process speech and language more rapidly.  Seven organizations 
are listed to write or call for additional information.  A chart of language 
milestones for ages one through six is also provided.  (BRM)<BR>

  Of particular concern to educational psychologists when assessing hearing-
impaired children is the identification of learning difficulties in addition to 
deafness which might hinder progress with language development.  This study 
sought to replicate research which showed that some deaf children who have 
difficulty with fine motor movements and body image also have difficulty with 
speech musculature and thus with language learning by purely oral methods, and 
research which showed that relatively large percentages of deaf children 
exhibit dyspraxic features.  A battery of diagnostic tests was administered to 
106 British school-aged hearing-impaired children to detect dyspraxia.  Only a 
small number of children were identified, and the main profiles emerging on 12 
dyspraxia subtests differed from the profiles of former research subjects.  The 
link between fine motor, speech, and certain memory tests was not replicated.  
The eupraxic/dyspraxic profile did not emerge for the subjects.  (Author/JDD)

  This report documents the fifth year of follow-up of mentally retarded school 
completers in the Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania) area, begun with parents/ guardians 
of students who completed their special education programs in 1985-86 (N=73) 
and in 1986-87 (N=60), 1990 (N=102), and in 1991 continued with completers 
(N=95), when a preliminary follow-up study was done.  Findings for the first 
two groups are reported in terms of living arrangements, work situations, 
competitive employment, physical and emotional disabilities, expectations and 
outcomes (a retrospective), and the hard core idle.  The 1990 cohort is 
discussed in terms of living arrangements, work situations, competitive 
employment, training and placement, transition planning and outcomes, and 
comparison of work and living arrangements of three cohorts 1 year after 
completion.  Initial follow-up data for the 1991 school completers are 
presented for living arrangements, work situations, job placements, post-school 
training placements, transition planning, and comparison with the 1990 cohort.  
Conclusions on the oldest group include more movement into a variety of 
competitive and sheltered work situations, entrenched patterns of idleness by 
14 percent of the group, and no progress for those with multiple disabilities.  
Conclusions for the 1990 cohort include substantial similarities with 
experiences of the older group at the same stage.  Findings for the 1991 cohort 
included a higher proportion with no work placement.  (DB)<BR>

  The education of students with severe to profound mental handicaps (SPH) or 
multiple disabilities may be greatly limited in rural settings.  A survey 
investigating this issue in a southwestern state was completed by 136 of 346 
directors of special education, 67 of whom worked in rural special education 
cooperatives.  These cooperatives served 393 preschool, 851 elementary, and 828 
secondary students with SPH or multiple disabilities.  However, only 4 percent 
of teachers of these students possessed SPH certification, and only 26 percent 
possessed certification in mental retardation (MR).  Figures were similar for 
individual rural districts and urban areas.  The most common service delivery 
systems used by rural cooperatives were self-contained classrooms: (1) 32.5% of 
cooperatives for SPH elementary students; (2) 31% for MR elementary students; 
(3) 20% for SPH secondary students; and (4) 26% for MR secondary students.  
Developmentally-based program models were reported by 86 percent of rural 
cooperatives and ecologically-based programs by 29 percent.  The fact that few 
districts used transdisciplinary teaming may indicate a lack of understanding 
of this model rather than a conscious decision to use other models.  Survey 
results suggest that the quality of services available for SPH and multiply 
disabled students is limited by lack of qualified teachers, little use of 
ecological procedures, and a tendency to ignore functional and near-future 
needs.  (SV)<BR>

highlight key features of the Education for All Handicapped Children Act 
(Public Law 94-142, reauthorized in 1990 as the Individuals with Disabilities 
Education Act); Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; Public Law 99-
457; and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Then individual sections provide 
information on vision impairments, hearing impairments, speech impairments, 
physical disabilities, mental retardation, learning disabilities, multiple 
disabilities, emotional disorders, autism, and other health impairments.  
Information provided typically includes the nature of the impairment, severity 
factors, associated problems, aids and appliances, therapeutic or remediation 
approaches, simulation activities, and resources (books for both children and 
adults as well as organizations).  Specifically discussed under physical 
disabilities and other health impairments are the following conditions: 
cerebral palsy, spina bifida, spinal cord injury, muscular dystrophy (Duchene 
type), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, brittle bone disease, 
and amputation.  The guide also presents lists of general print and 
organizational resources, guidelines for use of less stigmatizing terminology, 
and suggestions for interacting with individuals with disabilities.  (DB)<BR>

  This handbook for parents is part of a packet intended to aid educators, 
families, and adult service providers to facilitate the transition from school 
to adult life in the community for students with both cognitive disabilities 
and visual or dual sensory impairments.  Emphasis is on preparation of students 
for adult lifestyles through transition planning and community based 
instruction, including vocational experiences.  Introductory sections describe 
the handbook and identify goals.  The first major section examines the parent's 
role as children approach adulthood and covers sharing information and 
participating in goal selection, selection of learning experiences and skills 
to be developed, exploration of post-school options, and development of more 
appropriate options.  The transition process is explained next, which includes 
the transition planning team, Individualized Education Programs and Transition 
Plans, the transition planning meeting, areas for transition planning, and a 
transition planning form.  The last section identifies issues in planning for 
adulthood including: working with state agencies; vocational options; living 
arrangements; financial planning; travel; recreation and leisure; family 
support; legal services; and advocacy.  Appendices include three references and 
lists of locations of parent resource centers, state rehabilitation agencies 
and resource centers, and state protection and advocacy agencies.  Additional 
appendices list specific agencies in New York State.  (DB)<BR>

  This digest discusses the dilemma surrounding foreign language requirements 
at colleges and universities and students with learning disabilities.  Many 
students and professionals question the reasonableness of foreign language 
requirements for students with learning disabilities, but, according to Section 
504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, colleges and universities are not 
required to waive such requirements.  The digest focuses specifically on the 
following: waivers and course substitutions, alternatives to waivers and course 
substitutions, considerations involved in teaching foreign languages to 
students with learning disabilities, and the Orton-Gillingham Technique.  A 
program designed for teaching Latin to learning disabled students is described, 
and information on a conference that focuses specifically on foreign language 
learning and learning disabilities is provided.  (VWL)<BR>

    The paper summarizes four presentations made by members of the Pennsylvania 
State University Program for Learning Disabled (LD) students.  An initial 
section considers the definition of LD and reviews a study on diagnosing LD in 
12 undergraduates.  The existence of a foreign language disability in students 
with good attitudes toward learning a foreign language, but who have repeatedly 
failed foreign language courses, is discussed, and analysis of scores on the 
Modern Language Aptitude Test are analyzed.  A study to develop norms for 
evaluating written expression is  described.  Intervention programing is said to 
include procedures based on behavioral theories as well as availability of 
special equipment on a long term basis.  Intervention is programed according to 
the amount of structure needed by the student.  (CL)<BR>

  This paper examines issues related to the provision of special education 
services by public schools to students in private, parochial, or home school 
settings and offers guidelines for local education agencies.  First, the paper 
reviews federal statutory and regulatory obligations, particularly those under 
the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), the Education 
Department General Administrative Regulations (EDGAR), and advisory rulings of 
the Office of Special Education Programs and the Office for Civil Rights.  It 
also reviews case law, including Zobrest versus Catalina Foothills School 
District (decided by the U.S.  Supreme Court), Goodall versus Stafford County 
School Board (decided by the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals), Florence County 
District Four versus Carter (U.S.  Supreme Court), Work versus McKenzie 
(District Court in the District of Columbia), McNair versus Cardimone (Sixth 
Circuit Court of Appeals), Wright versus Saco School Department (decided by the 
Maine Supreme Court), Tribble versus Montgomery County Board of Education (U.S. 
District Court, Alabama), and Felter versus Cape Girardeau School District (U.S.
District Court, Missouri).  Noted is the ambiguity of advice from the 
Department of Education and the tendencies of the court system to rely upon the 
plain language of the law.  The paper concludes with an outline of a public 
school's obligations for private school children, options for a public school, 
and parental rights and options.  (DB)<BR>

  This book is a guide to providing library resources and services that support 
homeschooling.  The first section contains an overview of the homeschooling 
movement, statistics that show a nationwide trend toward this form of 
education, and an examination of the motivations, philosophies and educational 
styles of homeschoolers.  The second section discusses how to determine the 
needs of homeschoolers and how to establish policies and programs that reflect 
those needs.  Sample programs and services are presented in the words of 
librarians who have worked with homeschoolers.  There is a list of the ten most 
requested topics for books and materials, lists of what homeschoolers liked the 
most and the least about their libraries, and suggestions from homeschoolers on 
how to provide better service.  In the third section, critical issues in 
planning services are described: materials selection, intellectual freedom, 
balanced collections, and censorship.  The fourth section looks at the future 
role of libraries in terms of the library as a "homeschool laboratory," 
cooperation between libraries, homeschoolers and school districts, and the 
onset of online home education.  Appendices provide various sources for 
information on homeschooling including: homeschooling organizations; 
periodicals, newspapers, newsletters; correspondence schools and instructional 
service providers; homeschool curriculum and resource suppliers and publishers; 
suppliers of home education video and audiotapes; educational and/or 
homeschooling software suppliers; online home education connections; and a 
bibliography, as well as a homeschooling survey for librarians.  (AEF)<BR>

  The District of Columbia Board of Education recognizes home schooling as an 
option for parents.  This option allows a parent or guardian to provide 
instruction to his or her own children, but not for an instructor to teach non-
related children in a home setting.  This document, compiled by the District of 
Columbia Public Schools, provides guidelines for parents to conduct a home 
instructional program.  The guidelines include a copy of the "Notice of Intent 
to Provide Home Instruction Form," along with guidelines for submission.  The 
implications of providing false or misleading information in the process are 
also addressed, as are procedures for terminating home instruction.  
Documentation accompanying the guidelines includes the following: (1) "D.C.  
Law 8-247"; (2) "Final Rulemaking" document; (3) a 1995-96 District of Columbia 
Public Schools calendar; and (4) "Homeschool Resources," which includes lists 
of periodicals, organizations, books, and publishers.  (BGC)<BR>

  A small but increasing number of school-aged children are engaging in home 
schooling--pursuing learning at home or elsewhere in the community.  This 
digest summarizes research findings on and issues around home schooling.  It 
describes the historical roots of home schooling, the estimated number of 
participants, the constitutionality and legal issues surrounding it, and the 
resources available to home schoolers.  The effect of home schooling on 
children's social development is also examined.  Disagreement exists about 
which is more beneficial to children--spending more time with mixed-age groups 
or with their peers.  Public opinion is divided about home schooling.  It is 
primarily opposed by professional educators' unions and associations; however, 
the parents' right to homeschool their children is generally upheld by the 
American Civil Liberties Union, most state legislatures, and the majority of 
respondents to a Gallup poll.  (LMI)<BR>

  Noting that most home-schooling materials adhere to conventional schooling at 
the cost of creativity, this handbook provides guidelines for building a 
successful home school curriculum, one that avoids student resentment and 
parent burnout, targets children's interest and motivation, and understands how 
a child's developmental stages contribute to learning.  The guide is based on 
the Moore Formula for home schooling, which emphasizes a creative curriculum, 
skill-building work, and community or family service, and which results in low 
stress, low cost, and high achievement and sociability.  The chapters in the 
book are divided into the following five parts: (1) "Can Homeschooling Be Both 
Successful and Stress-Free?"; (2) "Homeschooling Stress: Prevention and 
Remedy"; (3) "Making Homeschooling Successful"; (4) "Effective Homeschoolers 
Share Their Wisdom"; and (5) "Some Encouraging Information for Parents and 
Educators." A concise description of the Moore Formula for home schooling is 
presented in an epilogue.  (SW)<BR>

  This theme issue focuses on techniques for effectively parenting gifted 
students.  In "Parenting the Middle School Gifted Child," Sharon Freitas 
provides suggestions for communicating with adolescents and understanding their 
needs as they strive for increasing independence.  "In Search of the Owner's 
Manual" (Terrie Gray) documents the search for a child-rearing formula.  "An 
Adolescent Already  Understanding and Meeting the Needs of Your Developing 
Gifted Child" (Richard Swart) reviews the development of gifted children and 
describes how these developmental differences often account for school 
problems, difficulties in family relationships, and emotional problems.  
"Gifted Kids Don't Come with a Set of Instructions" (Fran Westbrook) discusses 
the gifted label, the need for permission to fail, the need for a stimulating 
home environment, teaching responsibility, underachievement, and advocacy.  
"Self-Concept and the Gifted Child: Executive Summary" (Robert D. Hoge and 
Joseph S. Renzulli) addresses differences between gifted and average children 
in their self-concepts, effects on self-concept of labeling a child, and impact 
on self-concept of placing the child in a separate enriched or accelerated 
classroom.  Other articles include: "How To Build Achievers" (Laura Hathaway); 
"A Mother's Joy, A Teacher's Reward" (Margaret Gosfield); "Musing on Parental 
Modeling" (Martha Flournoy); "Advocacy Notes" (Martha Flournoy); "Homeschool: 
Where Present and Future Meet" (Isabelle Nidever); "Resources for Parents: A

  This book advances a philosophy of education and a vision of elementary 
schools as institutions that offer a solution that responds to the changing 
needs of today's families where schools become "schoolhomes" in which learning 
is animated by an ethic of social awareness.  Following an introduction that 
sketches the sweeping social changes since the 19th Century, chapter 1, "School 
and Home", describes the ideas of John Dewey and Maria Montessori and argues 
for an educational approach that brings the domestic and the educational 
together.  Chapter 2, "Culture and Curriculum," describes the challenge to the 
"homeschool" idea in a diverse and pluralistic society where no common culture 
binds students together.  Chapter 3, "Learning To Live," considers the 
different educational needs of boys and girls.  Chapter 4, "Domesticity 
Repressed," looks at the general rejection of home and domesticity in current 
cultures and argues that domesticity and concepts of family and home cannot be 
separated from educational institutions.  Chapter 5, "Home and World," argues 
for the role of education in changing the world rather then preparing students 
for the "real world." An epilogue, "The Here and Now," describes the 
accomplishments of actual schools and individuals implementing programs with 
"homeschool" approaches.  Included is a 146-item bibliography.  (JB)<BR>

  This booklet uses hypothetical case examples to illustrate the definition,
causal theories, and specific types of learning disabilities (LD).  The
cognitive and language performance of students with LD is compared to standard
developmental milestones, and common approaches to the identification and
education of children with LD are outlined.  Research supporting or refuting
the effectiveness of various medications and diets is summarized and general
suggestions are provided for families attempting to cope with the stress of
raising a child with LD.  The outlook for the future is explored in a
discussion considering whether learning disabilities can be outgrown or cured,
a description of services available to adults with LD, and a summary of
research being sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health.  The
pamphlet concludes with a list of print resources and support groups relating
to LD.  (PB)<BR>

  The paper presents a discussion of human mental processes as they relate to
learning disabilities.  Pathognomonic symptoms associated with disturbances to
brain areas or functional systems are discussed, as well as treatment
procedures.  This brain behavior relationship is offered as a basis for a
classification system that is seen to more clearly define attention and
learning disabilities and to afford more precise and reliable strategies for
diagnosis and treatment.  Ninety-two symptoms are grouped in a screening
checklist format for the areas of attention, perception, mood, memory, and
movement.  A multidisciplinary treatment approach involving medicine,
neuropsychology, and education is recommended.  (Author/DB)<BR>

  The Mentor Supported School Success Program was developed by the rural school 
district of Dorchester County, Maryland, as an effort to include students 
displaying troubling behaviors in regular classroom settings.  The program 
offers supplementary support to current school programming through the use of 
mentors.  In the first year of the program, members of the school-based 
multidisciplinary team identified students exhibiting troublesome behaviors, 
with priority given to elementary-aged students previously recommended for 
expulsion.  All students are eligible for participation.  Paraprofessionals and 
substitute teachers who had demonstrated both empathy for students and 
consistent effective behavioral management strategies were selected as mentors. 
Mentors assist with individual behavioral management plans, support classroom 
activities, provide additional monitoring of non-academic activities, and help 
teach the social skills training program.  Program components include 
integrated behavior management plans for each student; daily orientation and 
wrap-up; carefully designed mentor schedules; academic assistance; monitoring 
of medications; crisis intervention; social skills training; and evaluation of 
changes in students' behavior, attendance, and academic achievement.  A mid-year informal review suggests positive results in all four pilot elementary 
schools.  (JAT)<BR>

views of externalizing behavior problems.  Findings suggest that professionals 
need to target peer-identified behavioral and social skill goals and develop 
programming aimed at normalization to improve acceptance in integrated settings.

Definition<P>

Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder-NOS (not otherwise
specified) are developmental disabilities that share many of the
same characteristics. Usually evident by age three, autism and
PDD-NOS are neurological disorders that affect a child's ability
to communicate, understand language, play, and relate to others.<P>

In the diagnostic manual used to classify disabilities, the
DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), "autistic
disorder" is listed as a category under the heading of "Pervasive
Developmental Disorders." A diagnosis of autistic disorder is
made when an individual displays 6 or more of 12 symptoms listed
across three major areas: social interaction, communication, and
behavior. When children display similar behaviors but do not meet
the criteria for autistic disorder, they may receive a diagnosis
of Pervasive Developmental Disorder-NOS (PDD not otherwise
specified). <P>

secondary to sensory and motor processing deficits.  These difficulties are 
conceptualized as Multisystem Developmental Disorder (MSDD), and case vignettes 
illustrate typical patterns of MSDD and intervention options.  (Author/SW)<BR>

  Diagnosis of pervasive developmental disorders relies on the detection of 
deficits in social, play, and communication skills relative to the child's 
mental age.  A case example illustrates the multidisciplinary process of making 
the diagnosis in very young children.  Psychiatric evaluation criteria are 
examined, and a developmental framework for differential diagnosis is presented.

      Discipline polices for students with disabilities have
      become a major area of debate among policymakers, advocates,
      and educators, as efforts to remove "bad kids" from schools
      are seemingly thwarted by federal legislation requiring
      districts to provide educational services to students.  This
      policy analysis outlines expulsion and suspension procedures
      required by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
      as interpreted by court litigation.  It then discusses
      several issues to consider, including: (1) the extent of
      violence in schools and who is responsible for the acts of
      violence need clarification; (2) children should not be
      discriminated against based on their special education
      label; (3) policies addressing student evaluation for
      special education services should highlight the need to
      accurately describe students' behavior as well as their
      academic achievement; (4) students with disabilities are
       more likely to be the victims of violence than perpetrators;
      and (5) no research exists showing that "zero-tolerance"
      policies improve school order and safety.  (JDD)<BR>

  This document, presented in question and answer format, provides guidance
about legal requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act
(IDEA) concerning the misconduct of students with disabilities and corrects the
misunderstanding that students with disabilities are exempt from discipline
under current law.  It discusses recent amendments made to IDEA by the
Improving America's Schools Act and the Gun-Free Schools Act as they apply to
students with disabilities who bring guns to school.  The 16 questions and
answers address the following topics: appropriate steps when misconduct first
appears; additional measures allowed; short-term suspensions; obtaining a court
order for school expulsion or change of placement; group determination of the
misconduct's basis; continuing obligations of the school district to the
suspended or expelled student; options when the misconduct is a manifestation
of the disability; special provisions concerning firearms; placement in an
interim alternative setting; application of the Gun-Free Schools Act; authority
of the school district's chief administering officer; and immediate steps to
take when a student with a disability brings a firearm to school.  Two
flowcharts illustrate the appropriate process in the cases of a student with
disabilities who engaged in behavior subject to discipline but does not bring a
firearm to school and of a student with disabilities who brings a firearm to
school.  (DB)<BR>

appropriate implementation of individualized educational programs (IEPs) with
violent students with disabilities.  Specifically it addresses: (1) the legal
background of special education under the Individuals with Disabilities
Education Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (2) required
procedures and issues related to discipline, including procedural safeguards,
due process, notice, evaluation, IEP development, placement, placement changes,
the stay-put provision, the Jeffords amendment, and preliminary injunction; and
(3) discipline and proper IEP implementation including long-term suspension and
expulsion, required procedures for the discipline of students, determination of
the relationship between misconduct and disability, short-term suspension, case
laws regarding discipline and IEP implementation, and discipline and IEP
components.  Flow charts illustrate appropriate discipline procedures in
different situations.  (Contains 28 references.) (DB)<BR>

  Practical guidelines are presented for implementing a discipline policy at
the local level for students with disabilities, with suggestions for
distinguishing policies affecting students in general and students with
disabilities.  Emphasis is placed on emerging issues and practical consequences.
Relevant federal and state court decisions are cited, including the U.S.
Supreme Court's decision in Honig versus Doe.  Issues of concern include: due
process protection for students classified as disabled before expulsion or long-
term suspension of more than 10 days; the legal basis stipulating that students
with disabilities can be treated in the same manner as students without
disabilities for short-term suspension and other typical disciplinary measures;
petitioning for a court order temporarily changing the student's placement when
the individual presents a continuing threat of disruption; relationship of the
student's misbehavior to the disability; continuation of educational services
following expulsion or long-term suspension; other situations such as
successive short-term suspensions; use of drugs or alcohol or carrying a weapon
by a student classified as disabled and applicable disciplinary procedures.

  This report presents the outcomes of a policy forum convened to address
issues of disciplining students with disabilities.  Summaries of panel
presentations are provided, focusing on legal and policy issues,
school/interagency solutions/good practices, and family and community issues.
Observations and recommendation of forum workgroups are also summarized, in the
areas of: definition/scope of discipline, interagency/community/family issues,
systemic reform practices, array of services and intervention strategies, and
training and empowerment.  Forum participants recommended that a range of
discipline options be available, and the focus should be on early intervention.
The school curriculum should include the development of prosocial behaviors,
problem solving, mediation, negotiation, and other skills that lead to positive
student behaviors.  In general, forum participants favored an emphasis on
dissemination of information about effective practices and support for systemic
capacity building, rather than the development of additional federal and state
law and regulation changes.  Appendixes provide a participant list and forum
agenda.  (JDD)<BR>

  This paper presents the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA),
Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) as statutory frameworks for providing educational
services for students with disabilities.  The paper then addresses the issue of
disciplinary exclusion as provided for in each of the three laws.  IDEA creates
an entitlement to a free appropriate public education in the least restrictive
environment (LRE) without exception, and so precludes a district from expelling
any student with disabilities for alleged misconduct.  A school district may
change a student's educational placement to another providing a free
appropriate public education meeting statutory requirements in the LRE.  Any
exclusion from school of more than 10 days constitutes a change of placement
and may be accomplished only through the change of placement procedures set
forth in IDEA and its implementing regulations.  Based on Section 504, an
evaluation conducted before attempting to exclude a student for more than 10
days or expel must include a determination of whether there is a connection
between the behavior and the student's disability.  Some students may lose some
of these protections if they are using illegal drugs or abusing alcohol.
References to the United States Code, the Code of Federal Regulations, and
court cases are provided to support the paper's views.  (JDD)<BR>

  Disciplinary Sanctions for Students with Special Needs.<BR>

  One of the more controversial issues that has come before the courts since
the implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA) concerns the
imposition of disciplinary sanctions on students with disabilities.  Because
this issue is not directly addressed by the act, school administrators must
turn to case law for guidance.  This paper reviews court litigation and IDEA
provisions to develop guidelines for administrators in this situation.
Although IDEA does not directly refer to discipline, its provisions have
implications for the application of disciplinary sanctions on special education
students.  The case law of the last 2 decades clearly strikes a balance between
students' rights and school administration authority.  School officials may
impose disciplinary sanctions as long as they follow procedures that will not
deprive special-education students of their rights.  Restrictions are placed on
school authorities, however, when they wish to expel the student or change the
student's placement for disciplinary reasons.  In these situations, the due-
process procedures outlined in IDEA usually replace the normal due-process
protections.  In conclusion, it is better to anticipate a problem and prevent
one from escalating.  An appropriate individual education program (IEP) should
be developed that contains goals, objectives, and methods for behavior
modification.  Contains 49 end notes.  (LMI)<BR>

programs before identifying goals; (5) failing to consider future community 
realities; (6) being unaware of the process elements of strategic planning; and 
(7) assuming all planning approaches are the same.  (DB)<BR>

  The Multi-District Outreach Projects for Services for Youths with 
Disabilities include 14 federally funded projects that assist in the adoption of 
proven models, components of models, or other exemplary practices.  The 
projects are designed to improve secondary education and transition services in 
areas such as continuing education, self-determination, vocational education 
and training, supported or competitive employment, leisure and recreation, or 
other aspects of independent living.  The projects are felt to serve a need for 
dissemination and replication of exemplary practices, as state and local 
education agencies work to implement federal transition services requirements 
and school-to-work opportunity requirements.  The 14 funded projects are 
described.  Outreach projects newly funded in 1994 focus on a self-
determination transition curriculum, transition planning for adolescents with 
serious emotional disturbance, employability assessment, natural supports in 
employment, collaboration transition teams, and a collaboration and networking 
project.  Expiring outreach projects addressed statewide transition inservice, 
a workshop series assisting families to prepare for the transition from school 
to adult life, various transition programs, and job training and work 
experience programs.  (Contains 13 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  Two problems confront the school-to-work (STW) transition initiative: the 
quality of STW transitions and the equity with which those experiences are 
distributed among different student groups, including those with disabilities.  
In the past, the goals of equity and quality seemed to conflict.  Many persons 
advocating increases in quality appeared to be unconcerned with equity and vice 
versa.  The following criteria for developing STW transitions in which equity 
and excellence coexist have been identified: (1) access to all; (2) 
individualization; (3) generic problem-solving; (4) community settings; and (5) 
guaranteed benefits (recognized and accepted credentials authorizing entry into 
career opportunities or postsecondary educatcation programs; placement or 
acceptance in postsecondary vocational and educational programs; placement in 
competitive or supported employment; and participation in continuing and adult 
education, adult servic and independent living in community settings).  
Studies have confirmed the positive effects that participation in vocational 
education and work experience programs have on the employment outcomes of 
secondary school students in special education.  The identified criteria for 
developing/evaluating STW programs for students with disabilities can be used 
to design equitable STW programs emphasizing community-based training and 
experience.  (Contains 15 references.) (MN)<BR>

  Four articles comprise this monograph on interventions which lead to 
employment of youths with disabilities.  Articles are based on investigations 
and demonstrations sponsored by the Office of Special Education and 
Rehabilitative Services (OSERS).  In "Promoting Employment for Youths in 
Transition: Outcomes, Activities, and Indicators," Paula D. Kohler and Frank R. 
Rusch present a model for systems change based on outcomes, activities, and 
indicators for promoting employment in this population.  The article presents 
an overview of the OSERS investigations leading to the model's development.  
The second article, "An Analysis of OSERS'-Sponsored Secondary Special Education 
and Transitional Services Research" (Frank Rusch et al.), contains the findings 
from an analysis of five federal funding competitions focusing on transition to 
work or postsecondary education, in an effort to identify quality indicators 
and outcomes.  In a further extension of this line of research, Frank Rusch et 
al. in "Employment Outcomes and Activities for Youths in Transition," 
identified 22 outcomes and 65 related activities associated with employment.  
Of these, OSERS project directors ranked the following as the most important 
outcomes: utilizing individualized education plans, educating students 
alongside their nondisabled peers, and documenting progress in employment-
related skill areas.  Finally, in "School-to-Work Transition: Identification of 
Employment Related Outcome and Activity Indicators," Paula Kohler and Rank 
Rusch identify measures to serve as indicators for each outcome and activity 
identified earlier by project directors.  The listing of outcome and activity 
indicators is appended.  Individual papers contain references.  (DB)<BR>

The process of organizing, interpreting and utilizing sensory
information from our touch, movements, sight, sound and other systems,
and from body awareness and the pull of gravity is called sensory
integration. This concept was developed and refined by the research of
the late A. Jean Ayres, PhD, OTR. Sensory integration helps us move
through space (walking, running), react to danger (recoil from a sharp
object or extreme heat), and coordinate the movements of our head,
eyes and hands (lifting our head to read from a black board and then
writing on paper on a desktop.)<P>

  Target Audience: Teachers; Practitioners<BR>
  This paper offers teachers basic information about sensory integration and 
suggests strategies for managing classrooms which include children with sensory 
integrative dysfunction.  The first section looks at what sensory integration 
is, noting especially the roles of the three "near senses": the vestibular 
system, the proprioceptive system, and the tactile system.  Next, sensory 
integrative dysfunction in children is considered, including the hyporesponsive 
child and the hyperresponsive child.  Specific ways that sensory integration 
dysfunction can become a problem in the classroom are considered, including 
problems with peers, with controlling aggression, with motor planning, and with 
maintaining alertness.  Suggestions for classroom management while managing a 
child with sensory integrative dysfunction are offered, including suggestions 
for setting up the classroom, managing instructional time, and being flexible 
in teaching styles.  Teachers are urged to seek the support of colleagues, 
administrators, parents, and providers of support services.  (Contains 21 
references.) (DB)<BR>

  This review of nonstandard treatments as they relate to individuals with 
mental retardation reveals attempts to increase intelligence and make 
individuals "normal." Covering the early 1930s through the present, the review 
addresses: cell therapy, electric shock, behavior modification, vitamin B-6 
therapy, Doman-Delacato treatment, auditory training, sensory integration, the 
Feingold diet, Candida Albicans yeasts, facial screening, Dolphin therapy, 
facilitative communication, and water-misting.  The treatments are grouped 
according to their decade of initial presentation, with major developments 
briefly highlighted to illustrate their significance in special education.  
Issues underlying the arguments of advocates and opponents of the treatments 
are discussed.  The role of studies pertaining to each issue is analyzed, and 
in some cases, the involvement of the U.S. mass media, legislature, and 
judicial system is mentioned.  The following therapies that are professionally 
accepted and promoted by the education system are also briefly reviewed: art, 
music, and dance therapy; equine and pet therapy; recreation and play therapy; 
and physical and occupational therapy.  Appendices include a diagnostic 
checklist for children with behavior disturbances and information on dosages 
and outcomes of studies of high-dose vitamin B6 and magnesium for individuals 
with autism.  (Contains 151 references.) (SW)<BR>

  Social skills development of preschool children with visual impairments is
discussed.  A review of the literature considers the field of child development
and social cognition, the effect of blindness on child development, and the
effects of blindness on social cognition.  Three areas concerning the
development of social skills for children with visual impairments are
addressed: social interactions and development within the home; social skills
in the preschool, with particular emphasis on play research; and early social
skills intervention programs.  It is concluded that children with visual
impairments develop differently than children without visual impairments.  Their
passage through the various stages of development is usually delayed.  The
development of socialization skills may also be delayed if the early
experiences of the child are not enhanced or mediated through the environment.
It is important to teach parents how to interact with their child, identify
their needs, and encourage interaction with siblings.  Encouraging appropriate
play skills is also important to the early acquisition of social skills.  The
child who is visually impaired must develop play skills in order to maintain
interactions with peers.  The direction for future research in preschool social
skills development is briefly considered.  (Contains 54 references).  (SW)<BR>

  This report discusses the community-based resources that may be available to
regular and special education teachers serving visually impaired students in
rural areas.  It notes the national shortage of teachers qualified to teach
children with visual impairments and suggests that rural teachers will have to
devote some effort to seeking out appropriate educational resources.
Communicating with the community can uncover resources useful in transitional
training that involves daily living skills, job training, or job placement.
Procedures for the productive use of volunteers and volunteer organizations are
considered, and local cooperatives are recommended as potential sources for
employment experience.  The report concludes that ready-made resources for
visually impaired students are unlikely to exist in rural areas and that
regular and special education teachers will need to create them.  A table
identifies local/community and regional/county organizations and personnel that
currently exist in some settings or that might be created to provide services
in the areas of employment, family support and advocacy, recreation, social and
interpersonal development, and medical or financial needs.  A second table
lists addresses and phone numbers for national organizations that focus on the
education of visually impaired and blind students.  (RAH)<BR>

  The National Library Service for the Blind and Physically Handicapped (NLS),
an arm of the Library of Congress, leads a highly successful national program
to produce and distribute books and magazines for blind, visually impaired, and
physically handicapped individuals.  A fostering relationship exists between
NLS and a network of 143 regional and local libraries that serve blind and
handicapped readers directly.  By developing and disseminating centralized
policies and procedures at the national level, NLS is able to sustain a uniform
quality of service throughout the library system.  Each year NLS receives
permission to reproduce, with no royalties charged, more than 2,000 book titles
for loan.  In addition, NLS has systematically developed a collection that
provides access to some 220,000 recorded and embossed titles in 16 million
copies for a variety of blind and handicapped users.  Copyright clearance,
which is vital for a program that reproduces so many titles, and cataloging are
important features of the NLS approach: both cassette and flexible disc
recordings can be used only with special playback equipment.  NLS also has a
role in the narrative reproduction or braille embossing of materials and the
distribution of discs, cassettes, and playback equipment.  The NLS serves as a
resource for a clientele of extremely varied tastes and needs.  (SLD)<BR>

  This book, by an author with a visual impairment, is written for people with
a visual disability who wish to learn about alternate ways of processing
information, including reading, writing, organizing notes, and doing everyday
tasks.  The first chapter describes ways of adjusting to the loss of sight and
managing everyday living skills.  The second chapter deals with the use of
computers by people with visual impairments and covers the basics of computer
operations, adaptive computer input and output devices, and commonly used
application programs.  Chapter 3 discusses personal information management
systems.  Chapter 4 lists types of jobs held by people with visual disabilities
and reviews steps needed to enter or re-enter the job market.  Leisure
activities are discussed in the fifth chapter.  These activities are grouped
into three categories: those requiring physical effort, those that emphasize
mental effort, and volunteer activities.  The last chapter is on the blindness
system--organizations of and for people with visual impairments.  Benefits
provided by these and other organizations are discussed.  The text of each
chapter is followed by a list of references and resources, including books,
magazine articles, and recorded books.  Also listed are some government and
private organizations that provide services to people with visual impairments.

  Target Audience: Parents<BR>
  Intended for parents of infants and preschoolers with visual impairments,
this booklet encourages parent involvement in all aspects of educational
programming for their children and provides guidelines for selection of a
suitable program.  The first section examines the stresses involved during
transitions from one program to another.  Parents are urged to be active
members of the child's educational team by making observations, creating a
"snapshot" of the child for the team, identifying what the family thinks is
important, keeping records, planning for meetings, and dealing effectively with
professionals.  The relationship of program choice to the overall family
situation is noted.  General and specific guidelines in selecting a program are
addressed, including general atmosphere; social environment; physical
environment; learning environment; and specific features of infant programs,
preschool programs, and kindergarten programs.  Specific guidelines are also
offered to help evaluate a program from the child's point of view.  These
include looking at the learning environment, teacher competency, and transition
issues.  Also included are some suggestions for helping the child during the
first few weeks of a new program.  (DB)<BR>

DEFINITION OF CEREBRAL PALSY<P>

     Cerebral palsy is a condition caused by damage to the brain,
usually occurring before,during or shortly following birth.
"Cerebral" refers to the brain and "palsy" to a disorder of
movement or posture.  It is neither progressive nor communicable.
It is also not "curable" in the accepted sense, although
education, therapy and applied technology can help persons with
cerebral palsy lead productive lives.  It is not a disease and
should never be  referred to as such.  It can range from mild to
severe.<P>

     The causes of cerebral palsy include illness during
pregnancy, premature delivery, or lack of oxygen supply to the
baby; or it may occur early in life as a result of an accident,
lead poisoning, viral infection, child abuse, or other factors.
Chief among the causes is an insufficient amount of oxygen or
poor flow of blood reaching the fetal or newborn brain.  This can
be caused by premature separation of the placenta, an awkward
birth position, labor that goes on too long or is too abrupt, or
interference with the umbilical cord.  Other causes may be
associated with premature birth, RH or A-B-O blood type
incompatibility between parents, infection of the mother with
German measles or other viral diseases in early pregnancy, and
microorganisms that attack the newborn's central nervous system.
Lack of good prenatal care may also be a factor. A less common
type is acquired cerebral palsy: head injury is the most frequent
cause, usually the result of motor vehicle accidents, falls, or
child abuse.<P>

  This paper presents a study of two intellectually gifted students (ages 6 and 
14) who have cerebral palsy and are unable to communicate orally.  Results of 
participant observation, interviews, and document analysis revealed that: (1) 
gifted students who have cerebral palsy and do not speak exhibit indicators of 
cognitive ability that are similar to those exhibited by nondisabled gifted 
students, though the expression and recognition of these indicators are 
inhibited by communication barriers; (2) classroom atmosphere, structures, and 
instructional activities differentially impact the intellectual development of 
gifted students with physical disabilities; (3) gifted students with physical 
disabilities are able, with some modifications, to integrate and succeed 
academically and socially in regular classrooms; and (4) many barriers must be 
overcome by gifted students with physical disabilities in order to reach their 
goals.  The study demonstrates the importance of looking beyond the obvious 
external manifestations of intellectual talent and illustrates some unique 
behaviors that may appear given appropriate circumstances.  (Contains 22 
references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This fact sheet on cerebral palsy is offered in both English and Spanish.  
First, it provides a definition and considers various causes (e.g., an 
insufficient amount of oxygen reaching the fetal or newborn brain).  The fact 
sheet then offers incidence figures and explains characteristics of the three 
main types of cerebral palsy: spastic, athetoid, and ataxic.  It briefly 
discusses developmental, educational, and employment implications.  These 
include the value of early identification and intervention.  (DB)<BR>

  One of a series of children's books written from the point of view of an 
elementary grade child with a disability or other problem, the stories 
emphasize similarities in childhood experience while providing information 
specific to the disability.  In this book, Mark, a fifth grader with cerebral 
palsy, has been reluctantly doing research on sewing machines for a school 
report.  He discovers that the money for his team's baseball jerseys that he 
has been responsible for is missing, and he finds himself feeling more friendly 
toward sewing machines.  After the story, a question and answer section 
provides answers (by Mark) of typical questions children often have about 
cerebral palsy.  These include: "Why are you in a wheelchair?" "What is 
cerebral palsy?" "What is it like to have CP?" "Does having CP mean that you're 
crippled or handicapped? Does it matter what people call you?" "But how can you 
play baseball in a wheelchair?" "Can you play other sports?" "Isn't it hard to 
get around in a wheelchair?" "Can you go real fast in your wheelchair?" "Why do 
you talk funny?" "Why do you wear a helmet?" "Will you get better?" "Are you 
sad that you have CP?" (DB)<BR>

Fragile X Syndrome, a common inherited disorder involving a fragile site on
the x-chromosome, results in significant speech and language problems and
diminished cognitive/intellectual functioning.  Improved accuracy of diagnosis
and the strong heritability component means that schools increasingly will be
faced with the issues involved in educating students who have the syndrome.  (

The cytogenetic survey of 67 individuals previously identified as having
mental retardation and autistic behaviors revealed only 1.5 percent with the
fragile X chromosome.  The finding suggests that most persons with fragile X
syndrome do not have autistic behaviors severe enough to be identified as a
secondary psychiatric diagnosis.  (Author/DB)<BR>

Fragile X syndrome is the most common cause of mental retardation next to
Down syndrome.  The syndrome is more prevalent in males because they only have
one X chromosome, where the gene for fragile X is carried, while women have two
X chromosomes and the normal gene can compensate for the affected chromosome.
Certain physical features are associated with the syndrome, such as elongated
faces and hyperextensible finger joints.  Children with fragile X have IQs that
decline as they become adults.  Language problems affect all males with fragile
X, even those that have a normal IQ.  Many prepubertal males may have
borderline IQs, learning disabilities, attention deficits, and hyperactivity.
Primary weaknesses include arithmetic, short-term memory, and signs of autistic
behavior that lasts into adulthood.  Women with fragile X show milder symptoms
than men, both in physical and cognitive problems.  One of the main treatments
for fragile X is folic acid, along with special education, language therapy,
occupational therapy, and psychotherapy.  Genetic counseling is very important
for anyone who is aware of having or being a carrier of the fragile X syndrome.

<B>KABUKI MAKE-UP SYNDROME</B><P>

The name describes the prominent facial characteristics of children with this
disorder. The following are excerpts from the info in the NORD database
regarding Kabuki Make-up Syndrome.<P>

Symptoms<BR>
One of the most distinguishing features of Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome is the
unusual facial features.  The opening between the upper and lower eyelids is
abnormally long and one third of the lower eyelid is turned outward.   The tip
of the nose may be broad and depressed and the ears may be large and malformed.
The eyebrows of patients with Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome may be high and arched.
The palate of the mouth may be cleft or have a  high arch, and the upper and
lower teeth may not meet properly (malocclusion).<P>

These unusual facial features resemble the make-up of actors in a Japanese
traditional play called "Kabuki". Many patients with Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome
have a sideways curvature of the spine, a short fifth finger that curves inward,
and abnormalities of the vertebrae, hands and hip joint. All patients with
Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome have mental retardation ranging from mild to severe.
Short stature and abnormal skin ridge  patterns on the fingers, toes, palms of
the hands and soles of the feet are common. Early development of breasts in
females and heart defects have been found in a few patients with Kabuki Make-Up
Syndrome.<P>

Causes<BR>
The majority of cases of Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome are thought to occur for no
apparent reason (sporadic).  Three patients recorded in the medical literature
had abnormalities on the Y chromosome leading researchers to believe it may be
inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.<P>

Affected Populations<BR>
Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome is a very rare disorder that affects males and females
in equal numbers.  There have been 70 cases reported in the medical literature.
The majority of cases have occurred in people of Japanese ancestry. Cases of
Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome have also been reported in Canada, Italy, Latin America,
Germany, Libya, and the United States.<P>

Therapies:   Standard<BR>
Patients with Kabuki Make-Up Syndrome may benefit from orthopedic care for
prevention of scoliosis.  Physical therapy and cosmetic surgery may also be
helpful. Physical therapy may benefit in the prevention of scoliosis. Genetic
counseling may be of benefit for patients and their families.<P>

This special edition explores the serious genetic disorder, Lesch-Nyhan
Disease (LND), which is characterized by severe dystonia, spasticity, speech
impairment, renal disease, varying degrees of cognitive deficit, and,
especially, compulsive self-injury.  The information provided is based on
experience at the Matheny School and Hospital (New Jersey) and reflects that
institution's philosophy of individualized treatment and development of skills
necessary to self-direct one's life, regardless of the degree of disability.  In
the first section, an overview of LND is provided in tandem with a column of
observations and comments by staff at the school about a specific case.  Later
sections focus on self-injurious behavior, health care, adapted equipment,
speech/communication/feeding, education, and leisure/recreation.  (Contains 11

with Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, typically characterized by apasticity, mental
retardation, and violent biting of the lips and fingers.  Utilizing an
electromyographic (EMG) monitor and a custom-designed relay connected to either
a computer game or a tape player, a 15-year-old male learned to control sudden
high levels of arousal-related muscular tension which were the antecedents of
self-abuse.  A subsequent study of the experimental treatment protocol (rather
than the viability of the instrumentation) is proposed.  (Author/JW)<BR>

A case study focuses on the characteristics and physical management of a 15-
year-old with Prader-Willi Syndrome, a birth defect associated with hypotonia,
insatiable appetite, hypogonadism, central nervous system dysfunction, and
abnormal growth and development .  A literature review addresses studies
dealing with behavior modification of obesity and continuous eating, nutrition
counseling, and physical activity intervention.  Interventions in the case
study included those programmed by trained personnel in the following service
areas: adapted physical education, behavior modification, nutrition, nursing,
dormitory living, social work, education, and speech and language.  Data are
reported for behavior, weight, and adjustment to physical activity.  Analysis
of data from the S's developmental and medical histories, continuous
evaluations, previous staffing summaries, motor proficiency tests, exercise
metabolism tests, progress reports and staff and parent survey forms revealed
that the S made considerable progress in reaching her program goals.  She was
found to demonstrate most of the characteristics classic to the Prader-Willi
population.  Recommendations were made for programming.  (CL)<BR>

<B>WILLIAMS SYNDROME</B><P>

 Williams Syndrome is a very rare condition which statistics state
 affect approximately 1 in 20, 000 babies. It is an inborn error of
 metabolism cause as yet unknown, which can leave a degree of brain,
 heart and kidney damage, ranging from mild to severe.
 The symptoms, characteristics and behaviors of Williams Syndrome are
 as follows:<BR>
 <UL><li>Elfin/Pixie Facial Features : a broad forehead, upturned nose,
 wide mouth, full lips, widely spaced teeth, small chin, puffiness
 around the eyes, small head, depressed nasal bridge.<BR>
 <li>Stellate Eye Pattern: blue and green-eyed children may have a
 star-like pattern in the iris. Brown-eyed children don't usually
 display this pattern.<BR>
 <li>Low Birth Weight: many of these children are labeled failure to
 thrive but do show a slow but steady growth and weight gains. Vomiting,
 gagging, diarrhea or constipation are common in infancy.<BR>
 <li>Heart Disorders: can range from non-existent, to slow murmurs, to
 aorticor pulmonary stenoses (narrowing).<BR>
 <li>Elevated Serum Calcium Level: this sometimes occurs in the first
 two years of infancy.<BR>
 <li>Hernias: umbilical, inguinal<BR>
 <li>Apparent Sensitive Hearing: can overreact to volume or type of
 noise (high-pitched motors, machines).<BR>
 <li>Development Delays: sitting, walking, language, gross and fine
 motor skills.<BR>
 <li>Friendly/Talkative Personality: unafraid of strangers, have
 some attention problems, sometimes described as impulsive.<BR>
 <li>Possible mild mental retardation: attention deficit-type behaviors,
 good long-term memory.<BR>
 <li>Premature puberty</ul><P>

Williams Syndrome is a genetic disorder first described by Dr. J.C.P. Williams
of New Zealand.  Ws is considered rare and is thought to occur in about 1:20,000
births.  Research has indicated that individuals with Williams Syndrome are
missing an elastin gene on chromosome #7.  This deletion could account for many
of the features of Williams Syndrome, although there may be other genetic
material missing from the same region.  The extent of additional deletions may
vary and be responsible for some of the medical and developmental difficulties
experienced by the affected individual.<P>

  The perspectives of seven hearing parents on their use of sign communication  
with their deaf children were evaluated.  All parents had chosen Signed English 
rather than American Sign Language (ASL).  Parents' understanding of ASL varied 
greatly; they reported difficulty in developing personal and family fluency in  
Signed English; and they identified specific support needs.  (DB)<BR>

  Project CHIME (Children with Hearing Impairments in Mainstreamed  
Environments) develops and implements strategies that promote effective  
preschool mainstreaming of selected hearing-impaired children, ages 2-5 in  
Nassau County, New York.  Written for parents of preschool children with  
hearing impairments, this handbook contains background information on  
mainstreaming, hearing loss, and the Project CHIME program.  Project CHIME  
emphasizes an auditory/oral approach to teaching communication, and encourages  
children to use residual hearing, hearing aids, and auditory trainers to  
develop their hearing and oral speech.  Project CHIME also emphasizes the  
importance of mainstreaming in the preschool environment to allow children with 
hearing loss to develop relationships with their hearing peers.  The handbook  
covers such topics as parent involvement and training, role of CHIME staff,  
types of hearing loss, and use of hearing aids and auditory trainers.  (JDD)<BR>

  This book's aim is to define and clarify the issues involved in the education 
of deaf and hard of hearing children in local public schools, to bring to light 
the accumulating research in this area, and to recommend actions for organizing 
effective educational programs.  The book offers a perspective on the current 
confusion in the field of deaf education, examines how different deaf 
constituencies have unique needs, describes how the family contributes to and 
makes demands on the school system, and discusses how deaf children are 
succeeding and losing out.  Part I, called "The Context of the Educational 
Program," contains the following papers: "An Historical Perspective on School 
Placement" (Donald F. Moores); "What Does 'Local Public School' Program Mean?" 
(Thomas N. Kluwin); "Ethnic and Cultural Considerations" (Valerie J. Janesick 
and Donald F. Moores); "How Family Factors Influence School Achievement" 
(Thomas N. Kluwin and Martha Gonter Gaustad); "Issues of Educational 
Interpreting" (Joe D. Stedt) and "Understanding the Context of Local Public 
Education" (Martha Gonter Gaustad).  Part II, "The Process and Outcomes of 
Schooling," presents "Patterns of Communication among Deaf and Hearing 
Adolescents" (Martha Gonter Gaustad and Thomas N. Kluwin); "The Role of Sport 
and Extracurricular Activities in Shaping Socialization Patterns" (David A.

  This paper examines the evolution of sign language's role in education, 
beginning with the debate over sign language versus oral communication, 
followed by the debate over American Sign Language (ASL) versus other sign 
systems.  The paper points out that this debate process is hindering the 
educational experience for thousands of deaf children and further widening the 
gap between the "hearing world" and the "deaf world" as hearing people try to 
impose their opinions on those who are deaf.  Research is cited showing that 
deaf children with deaf parents, who used sign language to communicate, scored 
better in overall educational achievement and social adjustment than deaf 
children of hearing parents.  American Sign Language is not recommended for use 
with young deaf children, because the native language of most parents of deaf 
children is English, the majority of teachers are hearing, and ASL is a spatial 
language with no written format.  The system of Signed English is recommended 
in its place.  Newer, more complex sign systems are not recommended because 
they have become so complex that they hinder rather than assist the learning 
process.  (Includes nine annotated references) (JDD)<BR>

  The purpose of this study was to describe the personal and professional 
changes that occurred when three young children with Down Syndrome were 
mainstreamed into "regular" kindergarten classes in Northeast Tennessee.  
During the 1989-1990 school year, data were collected using participant 
observation and in-depth interviews with parents, teachers, and principals in 
three schools.  Data were collapsed into four general categories of results, 
focusing on changes in personal and professional confidence, changes in 
teaching approaches and strategies, changes in perspectives on integration, and 
changes in personal beliefs and attitudes.  Results indicated that all adults 
 involved in the mainstreaming process viewed the experience positively.  All 
parties gained a great deal of confidence both in themselves and in each other. 
All those concerned developed a respect for the potential that children with 
Down Syndrome bring to the regular classroom.  (20 references) (JDD)<BR>

  The study compared the adjustment to regular classes (in New Zealand) of 
eight 6- and 7-year-old children with Down Syndrome (DS) with that of 24 
children rated by their eight teachers as being the "three least competent 
children in the class." The study evaluated teacher attitudes, social 
participation on the playground, and developmental progress.  The study found 
teachers still uncertain about the value of integrating such children into 
regular classes after 1 year though their beliefs were not always supported by 
the data comparing the DS children with the contrast children in the areas of 
time on-task/disruptions, interactions with the teacher, compliance, social 
interaction, and affectionate behavior and mimicry.  There was no support for 
the commonly held belief that DS children are socially isolated during 
unstructured time with some DS children showing a greater range of abilities 
when interacting with peers in unstructured situations than in the classroom.  
All of the DS children maintained or surpassed their previous rate of progress 
after 1 year although teachers gave them much more attention than contrast 
children.  Results suggested that integration of these children can be 
effective but that the services of an itinerant teacher are valuable and the 
use of novelty encourages more peer interaction in all children.  (DB)<BR>

  What is epilepsy?<BR>
 Epilepsy is a neurological condition that from time to time produces brief disturbances in the normal electrical function of the brain. Normal brain function is made possible by millions of tiny electrical charges passing between nerve cells in the brain and to all parts of the body. When someone has epilepsy, this normal pattern may be interrupted by intermittent bursts of electrical energy that are much more intense than usual. They may affect a person's consciousness, bodily movements or sensations for a short time. These physical changes are called epileptic seizures. That is why epilepsy is sometimes called a seizure disorder. The unusual bursts of energy may occur in just one area of the brain (partial seizures) , or may affect nerve cells throughout the brain (generalized seizures). Normal brain function cannot return until the electrical bursts subside. Conditions in the brain that produce these episodes may have been present since birth, or they may develop later in life due to injury, infections, structural abnormalities in the brain, exposure to toxic agents, or for reasons that are still not well understood. Many illnesses or severe injuries can affect the brain enough to produce a single seizure. When seizures continue to occur for unknown reasons or because of an underlying problem that cannot be corrected, the condition is known as epilepsy. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, all nations, and all races. Epilepsy can also occur in animals, including dogs, cats, rabbits, and mice.<P>

  Epilepsy affects approximately one percent of the population, with most cases 
having onset during childhood.  School personnel can best incorporate the child 
with epilepsy into the classroom and provide support for families by becoming 
familiar with the types of seizure disorders, the issues that epilepsy presents 
for children and families, and the supports that children and families need.  
This paper provides information on: (1) seizure types, what they look like, 
first aid, and what not to do; (2) common misconceptions and negative attitudes 
regarding epilepsy that can compromise a child's ability to participate 
actively in social and school activities; (3) difficulties in diagnosis and 
medication and resulting family stress; (4) possible scholastic difficulties; 
and (5) the benefits and drawbacks of rural living and rural schools for 
children with epilepsy and their families.  Two brief case studies illustrate 
the social, emotional, and academic effects that epilepsy can have on children. 
Ways in which the school can alleviate some of the problems of students with 
epilepsy and their families are suggested, including an information seminar for 
the entire school about epilepsy and associated problems, designating one staff 
member to be a support person for the student, and maintaining frequent family 
contacts.  Information sources on epilepsy for teachers and family are noted.

  The brief guide offers information on epilepsy to teachers and other school 
personnel.  Types of seizures are defined (e.g., simple and complex partial 
seizures, generalized tonic clonic seizures), and management practices in the 
classroom setting for each type of seizure are described.  Signs indicating 
that a seizure requires immediate medical attention are listed.  Specific 
suggestions for helping other children in the class understand what seizures 
are and deal with the experience of witnessing a seizure are offered.  Other 
topics addressed in the pamphlet include medication for seizure prevention and 
the school's involvement in this responsibility, symptoms a teacher might note 
in a child as yet undiagnosed with epilepsy, academic and behavioral 
expectations for the epileptic child, avoiding overprotection, and 
communicating with parents.  A list of suggested readings is included.  (JW)<BR>

<li>Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is an organic brain disorder caused by prenatal
   alcohol exposure. The affected person may have:<BR>
<li>height, weight, and growth deficiencies.<BR>
<li>a specific pattern of facial features.<BR>

EDUCATING CHILDREN WITH FETAL ALCOHOL SYNDROME (FAS) and FETAL ALCOHOL EFFECTS (FAE)<P>

   One of the most debilitating characteristics of FAS and FAE is the
   poor ability to adapt to demands of surroundings. Educational
   experiences should make students as independent as possible, both now
   and in the future, with the outcome being adults functioning as fully
   as they are able. For some children, "functional" may mean following
   traditional academic curricula. Many students are fairly accomplished
   in academic subjects. To be independent, they also may need to learn
   to ride buses, prepare meals, use money appropriately, and not only
   perform a job, but use the social skills necessary to keep it.
   Educational goals and objectives should go beyond classroom boundaries
   and target skills to be used not only at school, but in homes and
   communities as successful, productive citizens.<P>
   
   Equally important is instruction of communication skills. Programs
   must depart from traditional models of "speech therapy" or "language
   instruction" and view communication as all the verbal, written,
   gestural, and behavioral skills that allow an individual to
   participate in a social environment. Students with FAS/FAE must be
   taught appropriate ways to relate needs to others, whether verbally or
   through other communication systems. Communication skills should be
   developed in the context of social skills instruction. Because the two
   are inseparable and essential sets of skills to live and work in the
   community, they should be major components of the educational process
   from preschool through to high school. Small children can learn to
   communicate their needs, interact with peers, and respond to others
   appropriately. By high school, students should be teaming more complex
   communication and social skills, such as how to interact with
   employers and coworkers, make and maintain friendships, and behave
   with friends of the opposite sex.<P>

  The information needs of regular elementary teachers concerning the special 
needs of students who have Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) and Fetal Alcohol 
Effects (FAE) were assessed.  A literature review covers means of 
identification of these disorders, intervention, effective instructional 
strategies, and issues involved with FAS and FAE.  Observations were undertaken 
with a first grade teacher and a child who is alcohol-affected but not yet 
identified as having FAS/FAE.  An informal interview was also conducted with a 
special education teacher who was helping the first grade teacher in having the 
child tested to receive special services.  Additionally, a questionnaire was 
completed by nine teachers in the same elementary school regarding the extent 
of teacher knowledge concerning FAS/FAE as well as information needs.  It was 
concluded that alcohol-affected children have learning disabilities, poor 
social skills, and disruptive behavior.  Forty-four percent of the teachers had 
a student suspected of having either FAS or FAE, and 11 percent had a student 
who had been identified.  Appendices include an observation form, a 
questionnaire, interview questions, and a handout for educators on FAS and FAE.

  This publication's instructional strategies were collected over a three-year 
period from participants in a series of workshops which dealt with fetal 
alcohol and other drug-affected children in the educational setting.  These 
strategies are not intended to be all inclusive; rather, they are intended to 
celebrate the "wisdom of practice." The approaches listed here have not been 
evaluated as to their effectiveness, but are based on sound guidelines for 
working with children who may have been prenatally exposed to alcohol or others 
drugs.  The strategies should provide the educator with a springboard for his 
or her own creativity and expertise.  Each strategy is organized into sections 
by grade level: Preschool; Kindergarten through 6th Grade; Junior High/Middle 
School; and High School.  Each grade level is then divided into three sections, 
with each section featuring sub-categories: (1) Room Environment (Quiet Zones, 
Classroom Seating, Limit Distractions, Organized Materials, Clear Rules for 
Classroom and Learning Centers); (2) Active Learning (Use Multiple Modalities, 
Multi-sensory, Manipulatives; Keep Steps Simple; Provide Opportunities for 
Decision Making and Problem Solving; Model and Demonstrate Behaviors; Provide 
Structure); and (3) Routine (Daily Schedule, Consistent Schedule, Plan for 
Change, Build in Transitions, Use Visual, Auditory, and Sensory Cues).  (RJM)<BR>

  This digest briefly summarizes available information on the educational needs 
of prenatally substance exposed infants and children.  Estimated incidence 
figures are given for the numbers of children exposed in utero to illicit drugs 
and alcohol.  The importance of parent/caregiver education in specific 
techniques to increase infant alertness and interactions is stressed.  Sixteen 
recommended classroom strategies are grouped into protective factors (e.g., 
developmentally appropriate curricula) and facilitative processes (e.g., 
encouraging child attachment to an adult and allowing child decision making).  
Transdisciplinary/transagency approaches to program development are encouraged.  
Also listed are five references and six resources, including hotlines and 
organizations.  (DB)<BR>

  This publication's instructional strategies were collected over a three-year 
period from participants in a series of workshops which dealt with fetal 
alcohol and other drug-affected children in the educational setting.  These 
strategies are not intended to be all inclusive; rather, they are intended to 
celebrate the "wisdom of practice." The approaches listed here have not been 
evaluated as to their effectiveness, but are based on sound guidelines for 
working with children who may have been prenatally exposed to alcohol or others 
drugs.  The strategies should provide the educator with a springboard for his 
or her own creativity and expertise.  Each strategy is organized into sections 
by grade level: Preschool; Kindergarten through 6th Grade; Junior High/Middle 
School; and High School.  Each grade level is then divided into three sections, 
with each section featuring sub-categories: (1) Room Environment (Quiet Zones, 
Classroom Seating, Limit Distractions, Organized Materials, Clear Rules for 
Classroom and Learning Centers); (2) Active Learning (Use Multiple Modalities, 
Multi-sensory, Manipulatives; Keep Steps Simple; Provide Opportunities for 
Decision Making and Problem Solving; Model and Demonstrate Behaviors; Provide 
Structure); and (3) Routine (Daily Schedule, Consistent Schedule, Plan for 
Change, Build in Transitions, Use Visual, Auditory, and Sensory Cues).  (RJM)<BR>

  This guide was developed to provide effective and practical strategies to 
meet the needs of prenatally substance-exposed children in preschool or day 
care settings.  Techniques are based on good child development practices and 
are equally effective for both teachers and parents.  The first chapter 
outlines information about prenatal substance exposure, such as the effects of 
different drugs on the fetus and the resulting behaviors and learning 
characteristics.  The second chapter presents teaching strategies, including 
protective factors involving daily routines, transitions, and rules; 
facilitative factors such as relationships, peer sensitivity, and decision 
making; and strategies for play, communication development, motor development, 
social/emotional development, and home-school partnerships.  Characteristics of 
an exemplary child development program are then described in chapter 3. 
Practical guidelines are offered for dealing with parents with chemical 
dependency in chapter 4. The final chapter focuses on assessment and offers a 
preschool assessment protocol consisting of a parent interview and 
developmental history, administration of developmental screening tests and 
instruments, play observation, and behavioral observations.  An appendix lists 
organizational resources, training resources, written resources, videotapes, 
audiotapes, free reference materials, newsletters, and other resources; another 
appendix defines terms.  (Each chapter contains references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This book illustrates techniques that families have found effective in coping 
with a family member who has mental retardation.  It provides quotations and 
comments from a number of parents as well as anecdotal accounts and 
photographs, grouped into four sections.  The first section is on the 
recognition process and recounts how parents have coped with the emotional 
trauma and imbalance as their feelings change from joy to sorrow and 
uncertainty when finding out and acknowledging that their child has mental 
retardation.  The second section is on the dynamic process of dealing with 
fears, fantasies, and facts associated with the effects of the disability on 
the family dynamics.  The third section stresses the working process which is 
using existing support systems and the exercising of rights when dealing with 
schools, programs, and placement decisions.  The final section is on the future 
process--ways to prepare and position the family member with mental retardation 
for a lifetime.  (DB)<BR>

  Inclusion of students with disabilities, especially those with mental 
retardation, has come to mean the placement of all students in general 
education classrooms, sometimes with limited planning for the individual needs 
of each student.  Several court cases, laws, and movements have brought about 
the level of inclusion that exists today.  However, schools are now evolving 
from inclusion to integration, which involves the planned placement of students 
in a setting.  Two circuit court cases with implications for integration 
include Holland versus the Board of Sacramento City Unified School District, in 
which four components were outlined for determining the removal of a student 
from general education and the Oberti case, which stated that students with 
disabilities should be placed in general education classes with appropriate 
support.  The four components of the Holland case provide a framework for 
examining what is effective in integrating students; components include 
educational benefits, non-academic benefits, effect on teacher and children in the
regular classroom, and cost.  A case-by-case approach to integrating students into
general education is needed.  The established best practices of the field of mental
retardation should follow students no matter where they are placed, and ongoing
monitoring of student progress should occur.  (Contains 45 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This revised digest presents basic information on mental retardation for 
educators and others.  First, definitions from the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and the American Association on Mental 
Retardation (AAMR) are presented.  The fact sheet then analyzes how the new 
AAMR definition differs from earlier ones noting the new definition's emphasis 
on a pattern of limitations and on a multidimensional approach to assessment.  The
AAMR use of the term "supports," is also explained noting the eight types of 
function that support can serve and four levels of support intensity.  Also 
cited are figures showing the number of children, aged 6-21, who were 
classified as having mental retardation and received services under IDEA.  Additional
paragraphs list typical characteristics of children with mental 
retardation and consider educational implications (such as use of more hands-on 
instructional materials with these children and short but frequent learning 
sessions).  The fact sheet also lists 10 suggested additional readings, 9 
organizational resources, and 3 periodicals.  (DB)<BR>

evaluated, in case studies of three families, what it means to have a child 
with a disability.  The research developed out of practice in early 
intervention and work focusing on optimal developmental environments for 
persons with disabilities.  Background information on each of the families is 
provided, including data on the children's disabilities, which included mental 
retardation in each case.  Five principal areas which emerged from interview 
data are identified: the children, parental stress/anxiety, services, personal 
comments, and survival strategies.  Data acquired from questionnaires completed 
by the parents and from the MAPS (McGill Action Planning System) planning 
process are also presented.  Recommendations are provided in three areas: 
attitude changes, policy changes, and service provision.  (Contains 14

  This paper examines issues concerning self determination for people with 
mental retardation and other disabilities, within the context of the Life 
Centered Career Education (LCCE) curriculum.  It looks at various views of self-
determination; offers a definition; and relates self-determination to autonomy, 
self-actualization, and self-regulation.  Aspects of the Individuals with 
Disabilities Education Act dealing with self-determination and transition are 
considered, as are best practices in promoting self-determination and the 
educator's role in this process.  The paper then addresses the curricular 
components of self-determination, describing the development of one 
organization's (The Arc) model of self-determination and a project which

  This monograph addresses the issue of full inclusion of children and youth 
with severe intellectual disabilities and whether this form of social and 
academic integration is consistent with the direction of present school reform 
policies.  The first section examines the implications of current efforts in 
educational reform.  A case study illustrates differences between integration 
and inclusion.  Key elements of full inclusion are identified: (1) full general 
education class membership; (2) full perception of "ownership" by the general 
education program (including special education); (3) individual outcomes-based 
decision making; (4) student-based services with team curriculum design; and 
(5) site team coordination of services and educational support.  Next, issues 
in education policy are discussed such as recent trends in general education 
policy and reform.  The following critical variables in school restructuring 
are identified: curriculum revision, performance-based assessment, 
decentralized instruction, school autonomy, site-based management and 
budgeting, shared decision making, infusion and coordination of educational 
resources, and community involvement.  Finally, the comprehensive local school 
is described as a framework for inclusion through delivery of a variety of 
special education services and through systematic team design of the 
individual's curriculum within the general curriculum.  (Contains 87

  This paper describes a language-based, problem-solving socialization and sex 
education curriculum designed for individuals with developmental delays.  The 
curriculum aims to increase the students' understanding of themselves socially, 
psychologically, and physically enabled to function more effectively in a 
mainstream society that is ever changing.  The program has a strong theoretical 
and applied research base in the areas of language development and thought, 
sociolinguistics, and cognitive behavior modification.  It uses a process-
oriented approach involving group interaction and natural context.  This paper 
describes the program's philosophy, parental permission needed, student 
attitudes, and use of team teaching.  Activities include vocabulary 
development; use of pictures, slides, and videotapes; semantic mapping; role 
play; problem solving; group work; and follow-up activities.  The curriculum's 
31 lessons cover such topics as hygiene, human reproduction, relationships, 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and sexual abuse.  A sample lesson plan is 
presented, on the topic of parts of the body.  (Contains 32 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  This monograph presents a rationale for proactive social skills training for 
persons with mental retardation as well as over 100 examples of such 
instruction across the K-12 continuum.  Chapter 1 provides a conceptual 
framework of social competence with principles of what, when, and how to teach 
social skills.  Chapter 2 discusses the direct instruction of social skills 
including use of simulation and specific instructional procedures and processes.
The bulk of the book consists of specific lesson plans organized by level 
(primary, intermediate, middle school/junior high, and senior high) and skill 
areas (classroom related skills, school building related skills, personal 
skills, interaction initiative skills, interaction response skills, community 
related skills, and work related skills).  Each lesson plan includes the 
objective, performance criteria, materials needed, and procedures (often 
outlined in detail).  A checklist for rating school and community social skills

What is Muscular Dystrophy ?<BR>
   The terms covers over 40 separate Neuromuscular disorders which
   have in common the progressive and irreversible wasting of muscle
   tissue. Some of these diseases are known as dystrophies, the wasting
   of the muscles from within themselves. Others are atrophies, wasting
   arising from a disorder originating in the nerve system which causes
   loss of the ability to use muscles. Various Myopathies, Peripheral
   Nerve and Metabolic Disorders also fall into the realm of disorders
   covered by the MDA's program. These Neuromuscular disorders (NMD's)
   are generally, incorrectly, termed "muscular dystrophy".<P>

What is Tourette Syndrome?<P>

Tourette Syndrome (TS) is a neurological disorder characterized by
tics -- involuntary, rapid, sudden movements or vocalizations that
occur repeatedly in the same way. Diagnostic criteria include:<P>

 <UL><li>Both multiple motor and one or more vocal tics present at some
time, although not necessarily simultaneously;

 <li>The occurrence of tics many times a day (usually in bouts) nearly
 every day or intermittently throughout the span of more than one
 year;
  
<li>Periodic changes in the number, frequency, type and location of
 the tics, and in the waxing and waning of their severity. Symptoms
 can sometimes disappear for weeks or months at a time;

<li>Onset before the age of 18.</ul><P>

  Three fact sheets provide parents and educators with basic information on 
Tourette Syndrome (TS).  The first sheet is titled "Learning Problems and the TS 
Child" and is by Herman Davidovicz, a neuropsychologist.  It notes the high 
frequency of attention deficit disorders and learning problems in children with 
TS and provides information for parents on warning signs, reasons for the 
learning problems, suggestions for intervention, and consideration of remedial 
help and regular classroom adjustments.  The second fact sheet is by an 
educator, Susan Conners, and is titled "Specific Classroom Strategies and 
Techniques for Students with Tourette Syndrome." Strategies are suggested for 
the following areas: tic symptoms; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
problems; visual motor integration, auditory processing difficulties, and fine 
motor skill problems; and "short fuse" and oppositional behavior difficulties.  
The third sheet is by Jacqueline Favish, a special educator, and is titled 
"Techniques To Aid Students with TS in Completing Written Assignments." It 
offers suggestions for helping students with note taking, standardized tests, 
teacher-devised tests, and timed tests.  (DB)<BR>

  This parent and teacher guide considers discipline for children with 
Tourette Syndrome (TS) who have difficulty with behavioral compliance.  
Discipline is defined primarily as "training to act in accordance with rules," 
and is not punishment but involves teaching self-control and observance of 
societal expectations.  Controversy and misconceptions about discipline are 
noted.  Consideration is given to redirecting the child from undesirable 
behaviors which can occur with TS, such as the urge to spit or touch or grab 
other people's personal body parts.  Ways to redirect the child from obsessive 
thought repetition are also addressed to help avoid the child's distress when 
saying phrases or words of an obscene or violent nature which stick in their 
minds.  Practice in anticipating outcomes of behaviors can be helpful for the 
child with TS who has difficulty with impulse control and does not see the 
connection between actions and consequences.  In addition to teaching the child 
the concept of cause and effect, children can be taught how to make choices and 
to accept consequences for them.  Also important is providing the child with 
structure, direction, and limits regarding the expression of explosive anger.  
Included are brief annotations of three videotapes and three publications on TS.

  Tourette Syndrome (TS) is described as a genetically based, chronic 
constellation of neurobehavioral symptoms and associated features involving 
repetitive, simple, and/or complex motor and phonic tics.  Treatment generally 
involves neuroleptic medication.  Symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, 
attention deficit hyperactive disorder, learning disabilities, 
neuropsychological anomalies, school adjustment problems, and behavior or 
conduct disorders are often associated with Tourette Syndrome.  Milestones 
unique to the course of Tourette Syndrome may include parents' realization that 
something is unusual about their child's behavior, a referral to a school 
psychologist, an official diagnosis, and subsequent parental involvement with a 
support group.  The role of the school psychologist involves evaluation, case 
manager, counselor or therapist, and advocacy.  School psychologists are in a 
unique position to be prime facilitators and advocates in promoting self-
esteem, encouraging school achievement, and supporting warm family 
relationships and peer socializations.  Appendices outline symptoms and 
frequency of behavioral difficulties.  (Contains 23 references.) (JDD)<BR>

  Designed as a resource for two-year college faculty and staff working with 
students with disabilities, this handbook contains facts about various 
disabilities, practical suggestions for improving services, and resource points 
for further information.  Following a brief introduction, legal implications 
regarding disabled students are discussed for postsecondary education 
institutions, and general suggestions for overcoming negative reactions to 
disabled students are provided.  Next, the handbook describes symptoms and 
useful teaching techniques/classroom approaches for the following disabilities: 
learning disabilities; traumatic brain injury; mobility impairments; visual 
impairments (legal blindness); total blindness; hearing impairments, including 
information on using a relay system to call the hearing impaired and working 
with interpreters; back impairments; speech impairments; epilepsy; cerebral 
palsy; carpal tunnel syndrome; multiple sclerosis; rheumatoid arthritis; 
Tourette's syndrome; mental illness; suicide; Acquired Immune Deficiency 
Syndrome (AIDS); and substance abuse.  For each disability, telephone numbers 
of institutions offering further information are provided.  The manual then 
lists possible side effects of medication that students may be taking and 
reviews considerations regarding disabled student access to science 
laboratories.  Finally, evacuation procedures for visually impaired, hearing 
impaired, and non-ambulatory students are considered.  (MAB)<BR>

WHAT IS BIPOLAR DISORDER?<P>
  
Bipolar disorder, which is also known as manic-depressive illness and will be
called by both names throughout this publication--is a mental illness involving
episodes of serious mania and depression. The person's mood usually swings from
overly "high" and irritable to sad and hopeless and then back again, with
periods of normal mood in between.<P>

Bipolar disorder typically begins in adolescence or early adulthood and
continues throughout life. It is often not recognized as an illness, and people
who have it may suffer needlessly for years or even decades.<P>

Effective treatments are available that greatly alleviate the suffering caused
by bipolar disorder and can usually prevent its devastating complications.
These include marital break-ups, job loss, alcohol and drug abuse, and suicide.<P>

The following information on bipolar disorder is from <a href=http://www.cais.com/vikings/nami/disorder/disord1.htm#bipol> the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill (NAMI)</a>.<P>


BIPOLAR DISORDER AND DEPRESSION<P>
   
Almost one-third of six-to-twelve-year-old children diagnosed with
   major depression will develop bipolar disorders within a few years,
   according to a study of 79 depressed children over two-to-five years
   reported in the May 1994 issue of the Journal of the American Academy
   of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. Most became bipolar before the
   onset of puberty, and 32% became bipolar at an average age of 11
   years.<BR>
   
   The researchers recommend that those caring for depressed children
   should be on the lookout for symptoms of manic-depressive illness.
   They also suggested that--because antidepressants may worsen certain
   forms of manic illness in adults--prescribing antidepressants for
   children should be done with care.<P>

  Intended for personnel in programs serving persons with developmental 
disabilities, the booklet provides basic information about the major psychiatric 
disorders and their treatment.  Five sections cover: the major disorders; 
medications--uses and problems; assessment; cooordination of services; and 
psychiatric emergencies.  Major disorders such as schizophrenia and affective 
illness, bipolar disorder, and depression are described.  Commonly used 
antipsychotic and antidepressant medications are listed by both generic and 
trade names, and side effects are explained.  Four steps of assessment are 
recommended: (1) obtain informed consent from the client or guardian; (2) 
obtain medical and psychiatric history; (3) obtain a social history; and (4) 
obtain verification that the client has had a recent physical examination.  
Coordination of services including those of a physician, a therapist, a source 
of expert information on medications, and an inpatient facility is urged.  
Finally, appropriate immediate management of a psychiatric emergency is 
discussed.  Six references.  (DB)<BR>

  This booklet describes the symptoms, forms, causes, and treatment of 
depression, with particular focus on depression in children, adolescents, and 
older adults.  Symptoms include: persistent sad or "empty" mood; feelings of 
hopelessness, guilt, or helplessness; loss of interest in ordinary activities; 
sleep disturbances; eating disturbances; thoughts of death or suicide; and 
restlessness and irritability.  Among the disorders several forms are major 
clinical depression, dysthymia, bipolar depression (also called manic-
depressive disorder), or a combination of disorders.  Causes include genetic, 
biochemical, and environmental factors.  Treatments include drug, psychosocial, 
and electroconvulsive therapy, and (still under study) experimental treatments. 
Childhood depression may go unrecognized when combined with other types of 
behavior such as hyperactivity or delinquency.  Depression appears to be 
occurring more commonly among teenagers, whose symptoms are sometimes 
attributed to the "normal adjustments" of adolescence.  Symptoms of depressed 
older adults are often misdiagnosed as senility or everyday problems of the 
aged.  The depressed person can be helped by family and friends who maintain as 
normal a relationship as possible, point out distorted thinking without being 
critical or disapproving, acknowledge that the depressed individual is 
suffering and in pain, and express affection.  Family and friends should not 
blame the depressed person for his or her condition or say or do anything to 
exacerbate a poor self-image.  (CB)<BR>

  Depression is defined as a "whole-body" illness, involving the body, mood, 
and thoughts.  Three of the most prevalent types of depressive disorders are 
described: major depression, dysthymia, and bipolar disorders (formerly called 
manic-depressive illness).  Eleven symptoms of depression and 10 symptoms of 
mania are listed.  Causes of depression are discussed, focusing on genetic, 
psychological, and environmental factors.  Diagnostic evaluation and treatment 
are described.  The components of a diagnostic evaluation are discussed.  
Antidepressant medications are reviewed, focusing on tricyclics, monoamine 
oxidase inhibitors, and lithium.  It is noted that antidepressants are not 
habit-forming and that antianxiety drugs are not antidepressants.  Side effects 
of antidepressants are discussed and ways to deal with them are presented.  
Psychotherapies are discussed, including the issues involved in short-term 
therapy, behavior therapy, and psychodynamic therapy.  Information on self-help 
is presented, including realizing that depressive disorders make one feel 
exhausted, worthless, helpless, and hopeless.  Advice is given on what actions 
to take or not to take when one is depressed.  Information on how to help 
depressed persons is discussed.  This includes helping the depressed person to 
get diagnosis and treatment and offering emotional support.  Addresses of 
groups providing information are included.  (ABL)<BR>

  Noting that adolescents who commit suicide are often clinically depressed, 
this paper examines various approaches in the treatment of depression.  Major 
treatment models of adult depression, which can be directly applied to the 
treatment of the depressed adolescent, are described.  Major treatment models 
and selected research studies are reviewed in the areas of: (1) cognitive 
therapy; (2) cognitive and behavior therapy; (3) cognitive therapy with 
pharmacotherapy; (4) the use of pharmacotherapy for acute depression; (5) 
treatment of manic depression with lithium; (6) the use of lithium in learning 
and behavior problems; and (7) reality therapy.  The paper concludes that a 
combination of therapies may be needed to treat depressed adolescents: one 
therapy may be needed to treat the condition immediately, especially if the 
teenager is suicidal, and another therapy may be needed later to alter 
cognitive distortions and to encourage responsible choices in coping with 
life's problems.  (NB)<BR>

  By means of 12 selected subscales of the Personality Inventory for Children 
(PIC), which were used to plot profiles, this study investigated personality 
characteristics of oppositional children.  In general, oppositional children 
are children who do not do what is asked of them.  In particular, oppositional 
behavior consists of at least 6 months of disobedient, negativistic, and 
provocative opposition to authority figures which is manifested in at least two 
of the following five symptoms: (1) violations of minor rules; (2) temper 
tantrums; (3) argumentativeness; (4) provocative behavior; and (5) stubbornness.
Participants, who completed a 600-item PIC, were the parents of 43 oppositional 
children and 57 compliant children.  Their children were between 6 and 12 years 
of age.  Findings suggest that oppositional children may be psychologically 
maladjusted, have problems in school achievement, be depressed, and tend to 
come from ineffective families which lack cohesion.  Such children may display 
delinquent tendencies and be somewhat withdrawn.  Oppositional children appear 
to be anxious and to display some features that are similar to those exhibited 
by children with psychosis.  Oppositional children are often overactive, but 
not when they are severely depressed.  These children may also lack social 
skills and may not have effective social relations.  (RH)<BR>

Behavioural Disorders, published by the World Health Organization, Geneva, 1992<P>
F91.3 Oppositional Defiant Disorder<P>

   This type of conduct disorder is characteristically seen in children
   below the age of 9 or 10 years. It is defined by the presence of
   markedly defiant, disobedient, provocative behaviour and by the
   absence of more severe dissocial or aggressive acts that violate the
   law or the rights of others. The disorder requires that the overall
   criteria for F91 be met: even severely mischievous or naughty
   behaviour is not in itself sufficient for diagnosis. Many authorities
   consider that oppositional defiant patterns of behaviour represent a
   less severe type of conduct disorder, rather than a qualitatively
   distinct type. Research evidence is lacking on whether the distinction
   is qualitative or quantitative. However, findings suggest that, in so
   far as it is distinctive, this is true mainly or only in younger
   children. Caution should be employed in using this category,
   especially in the case of older children. Clinically significant
   conduct disorders in older children are usually accompanied by
   dissocial or aggressive behaviour that go beyond defiance,
   disobedience, or disruptiveness, although, not infrequently, they are
   preceded by oppositional defiant disorders at an earlier age. The
   category is included to reflect common diagnostic practice and to
   facilitate the classification of disorders occurring in young
   children.<P>
   
  Diagnostic Guidelines<P>
  
   The essential feature of this disorder is a pattern of persistently
   negativistic, hostile, defiant, provocative, and disruptive behaviour,
   which is clearly outside the normal range of behaviour for a child of
   the same age in the same sociocultural context, and which does not
   include the more serious violations of the rights of others as
   reflected in the aggressive and dissocial behaviour specified for
   categories F91.0 and F91.2. Children with this disorder tend
   frequently and actively to defy adult requests or rules and
   deliberately to annoy other people. Usually they tend to be angry,
   resentful, and easily annoyed by other people whom they blame for
   their own mistakes or difficulties. They generally have a low
   frustration tolerance and readily lose their temper. Typically, their
   defiance has a provocative quality, so that they initiate
   confrontations and generally exhibit excessive levels of rudeness,
   uncooperativeness, and resistance to authority.<P>
   
   Frequently, this behaviour is most evident in interactions with adults
   or peers whom the child knows well, and signs of the disorder may not
   be evident during a clinical interview.<P>

  In sample of 177 clinic-referred children aged 7-13, association was found 
between diagnosis of conduct disorder and several aspects of family 
functioning: maternal parenting (supervision and persistence in discipline) and 
parent adjustment (paternal antisocial personality disorder and paternal 
substance abuse).  Children with oppositional defiant disorder were 
intermediate to families of children with conduct disorders and clinic control 
children.  (Author/NB)<br>

  This practicum designed and implemented a program using art therapy to 
improve the social competency of elementary-aged children with attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorder and oppositional/defiant disorder.  Students 
were in a special class for children with severe emotional disturbances.  The 
children met once a week in art therapy sessions either individually or in 
pairs and were observed in structured and unstructured situations.  A 
combination of art therapy, verbal associations, and role playing were used to 
help children interpret social cues, generate solutions to social dilemmas, and 
apply this learning in social settings.  Analysis of projective drawings, 
interviews, and observations suggested that the children improved in the areas 
of interpreting social cues and generating solutions to social problems.  
However, application of learned social behaviors was observed only when students
were first given a verbal reminder.  Appendixes include a letter to parents and 
samples of students' drawings.  (Contains 23 references.) (DB)<br>

  In response to increasing demands that Canadian school boards provide 
behavior adaptation programs to counter the effects of disruptive home 
environments, school violence, and victimization, this paper explores 
definitions and diagnostic criteria for the following behavior disorders: 
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, 
conduct disorder, juvenile delinquency, and antisocial personality.  The paper 
outlines how these disorders can be placed on a continuum from least 
problematic to most problematic.  A brief literature review summarizes effects 
of interventions currently employed to treat youth with behavior disorders.  
Difficulties associated with current treatments are highlighted and an 
integrated approach to treatment is provided.  The proposed model targets youth 
diagnosed with conduct disorder ages 13 through 17 by providing them with male 
and female leaders and a group revolving around an educational/remedial 
framework.  Activities are arranged to challenge students intellectually, 
physically, and emotionally, in order to form, challenge and extend self-
concepts held by group members.  (Contains 27 references.) (PB)<br>

teaching children with attentional deficit disorders, oppositional disorders, 
conduct disorders, autism, developmental learning disorders, childhood 
depression, borderline personality disorders, and childhood schizophrenia.  The 
first chapter presents information on the normal child including motor 
development, perceptual development, language acquisition, and social and 
emotional development.  Charts of age appropriate norms from ages 2 through 5 
are provided.  Among 10 charts given in the extensive chapter on the special 
child are a temperament checklist, a self-concept rating scale, a chart of 
basic developmental tasks, language milestones, and indicators of possible 
learning disorders.  A chapter is then given to each specific disability area 
organized around theoretical considerations, student characteristics, causation 
and prognosis, and treatment and management.  Suggested readings are provided 
for each chapter and a glossary of terms is also included.  (DB)<br>

  Due to similarities in symptomatology, childhood depression has often been 
misdiagnosed as conduct disorder.  Differentiating between the two disorders 
would help to direct the appropriate interventions for each disorder.  Children 
(N=48) between the ages of 6 and 13 years and their parents participated in a 
study designed to analyze variables which could discriminate children who 
display depressive or conduct disorders from those who are free of significant 
disturbance.  Children were selected by their teachers or school counselors as 
being conduct disordered or normal in conduct.  Sixteen of the subjects were 
normal controls screened for psychopathology.  The remaining 32 conduct 
disordered subjects were administered the Children's Depression Inventory and 
were classified as either depressed (N=16) or as conduct disordered (N=16).  
Children also completed the Nowicki-Strickland Locus of Control Scale for 
Children and the aggression scale of the Frost Self-Description Questionnaire.  
Parents completed the Beck Depression Inventory, the Maryland Parent Attitude 
Survey, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales II.  A two-
group discriminant function analysis identified five variables that maximally 
differentiated the depressed/acting out group from the conduct disordered 
group: parental disicpline, locus of control, parental depression, internalized 
aggression, and family adaptability.  These variables support research 
suggesting that depressed children often have a depressed parent; receive 
harsh, power-assertive discipline from their parents; have a rigidly adaptive 
family style; have a more internal locus of control; and tend to internalize 
aggression more than do non- depressed conduct disordered children.  (NB)<br>

Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), National Library of Education (NLE),
Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI), U.S. Department of
Education.   It is operated by The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC).   ERIC EC
provides information on the education of individuals with disabilities as well as those
who are gifted.  We also provide access to information from a variety of sources outside

<center><h2>HOW TO JOIN A LISTSERV</h2></center><P>

E-mail lists, often known as listservs, are interactive computer-based communications. 
E-mail lists can be manually administered by humans, or they can be automated by
servers such as listserv, or majordomo.<P>

<B><I>Subscribing to a Manually Administered List</B></I><P>

To subscribe to (join) a manually administered list, send a regular e-mail message to
the administrator or owner of the list.<P>

<B><I>Subscribing to an Automated List</B></I><P>

Automated lists have at least two accounts--one for the server (the list ADDRESS) and
one for the actual list (the list NAME).  To subscribe to (join) an automated list, send an
e-mail message to the list ADDRESS, not the list NAME, for the server to recognize the
command.  Examples are given for two of the more common types of automated
lists listserv and majordomo. <P>

<b>For listserv lists:</B><BR>
<ul><LI>Leave the Subject: line blank
<LI> In the body of the message, type only the following line:<BR>

          <i>subscribe {listname} {yourfirstname} {yourlastname}</I><br>
     ex:  subscribe l-hcap Happy Golucky</ul><P>
       
<b>For majordomo lists:</B>  Majordomo lists do not require {yourfirstname} and
{yourlastname} in the message.<br>
<ul><LI>Leave the Subject: line blank
<LI> In the body of the message, type only the following line:<BR>

      <i>subscribe {listname}</I><BR>
      subscribe spedtalk</UL><P>
       
<B><I>Posting Messages to a List</B></I><P>

To post a message to the list, send it to the NAME of the list in the TO: field.<P>

<table width=475>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top><b>Example:</b></td><td width=300><b> TO:  spedtalk@virginia.edu</b></td></tr></table><P>

<b><i>To Find a List of Lists</b></i><P>
A quick way to find a list of (the thousands of) lists is as follows:<P>

<table width=475>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>Send message to:</td><td width=300>listserv@listserv.net</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top>With command in body: </td><td width=300>lists global</td></tr>
<tr><td width=200 valign=top> Or: </td> <td width=300>         lists global/[keyword]</td></tr></table>
where [keyword] is the topic of your choice (e.g., disability).<P>

 at Multicultural Symposium</CENTER></H2></CENTER>

January 8-10, 1997<BR>
Radisson Hotel<BR>
New Orleans, Louisiana<P>

 Dr. Carlos Cort&eacute;s, internationally known author and speaker in the field of diversity and multiculturalism, will be the keynote speaker for CEC's 1997 Symposium on Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Exceptional Learners. The symposium will be held January 8-10, 1997, at the Radisson Hotel in New Orleans, LA.  <P>
	In his keynote speech, Cort&eacute;s will look at future trends in multiculturalism and what they mean for education. The symposium audience will get a new perspective on how schools and educators must change to provide educational content and strategies that prepare students to function in a world that must accommodate peoples of all cultures, nationalities, and ethnicities.<P>
	Cort&eacute;s' presentation will outline changes in educational practices that allow students of 
all abilities and disabilities to build on their individual strengths and backgrounds. He will
 address issues that today's educators face as they work with students of diverse cultures, such as language development, adapting curriculum, the development of social skills, and assessment.<P>
	Cort&eacute;s gained international recognition for his publications on multicultural issues,  including Three Perspectives on Ethnicity: Blacks, Chicanos, and Native Americans and Beyond Language: Social and Cultural Factors in Schooling Language Minority Students. He has also lectured widely throughout the United States, Latin America, Europe and Asia on multiculturalism and diversity and has served as a consultant to government agencies, school systems, universities, mass media, businesses, and other organizations. In addition, Cort&eacute;s was  named Professor Emeritus of History at the University of California, Riverside.<P>
	Cort&eacute;s has received several awards for his work, including the National Multicultural Trainer of the Year Award, the Faculty Public Service Award, the Smithsonian Institution Public Lecturer, and the Hilda Taba Award of the California Council for Social Studies.<P>
	The symposium's sessions address the most compelling and critical issues involving students with special needs of diverse backgrounds, giving insights into current problems as well as practical tools and solutions.<P>
	The symposium is co-sponsored by CEC's Division for Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Exceptional Learners and the Louisiana State Department of Education.<P>

<H2><A NAME="TOP">CEC President Gerald Hime Responds to <BR>"The Struggle to Pay for Special Ed."</A></H2></CENTER>

<center><table width=475 border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0><tr><td align=left>
In a letter to the editors of <EM>Time</EM> magazine, CEC President Gerald Hime took issue with <EM>Time's</EM> November 4, 1996 article,  "The Struggle to Pay for Special Ed." (Bolston, pp. 82-83), disputing the story's assertion that special education is too expensive.<P>

The article cited an example of "community outrage" in rural South Dakota resulting from the cost of tuition and travel for a local student with autism.  The author stated that "the cause of the community outrage was the money for [the student's] special education comes, under the legal requirements of the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, from the budget of the local school district." The article further pointed out that although federal and state laws have passed laws requiring special education for students with disabilities, Congress and the states "have been parsimonious with the money to pay the added costs" spawning "intense conflict between parents and school officials."<p>
President Hime's response to the story:

Dear TIME Magazine Letters Editor:<P>

I was very disappointed to see TIME perpetuate the myth that special education is unaffordable (EDUCATION, Nov. 4).  You made it appear that special education is not only exorbitantly expensive but that local districts must bear the brunt of its cost. In fact, educating a child with special needs costs, on average, two and one-half times that of a general education student. Across the nation, states provide 56 percent of the funds for that cost; local sources provide 36 percent. But the real savings is that as a result of special education more students with disabilities are becoming productive, independent citizens than ever before--approximately 70 percent of students with disabilities are employed, and an ever increasing number are attending college and other post-secondary educational institutions. <P>
	It should also be noted that federal appropriations have lagged behind the levels set forth in the legislation guaranteeing a free, appropriate public education for students with disabilities. Though the federal contribution to special education was supposed to cover 40% of its costs, federal spending for these programs has hovered around 7%. Hopefully, the recent Congressional funding increase for special education (approximately $750 million) marks a commitment to fully fund the federal/state special education partnership.<P>
	The cost of providing public assistance to an individual who has not gained the skills necessary for employment equals approximately $36,000 a year, plus loss of productivity and tax revenue. Given these facts, the real question is Can America afford not to provide special education for its children?<P>

Sincerely,<P><P><P>

<EM>By Linda Blanton
</EM><P>
On October 15, 1996, the Specialty Areas Studies Board of the National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education (NCATE) approved CEC's guidelines for preparing special education professionals. As a result of this action, the 40 states that now have partnerships with NCATE will have to align their state standards for preparing special education professionals with CEC's. <P>
	Eleven of those states (AK, CT, DL, IL, MD, MS, RI, SC, VA, WA, and WV) will require colleges and universities to submit their special education professional preparation programs to CEC for approval in order to retain state accreditation. In the remaining? for non-NCATE partnership states, colleges and universities seeking NCATE accreditation will also have to seek CEC approval of their special education programs by demonstrating that they meet the standards.<P>
	By including CEC's Knowledge and Skills for Beginning Special Education Teachers within the CEC/NCATE standards for program approval, CEC has merged certification standards with accreditation standards and set the stage for special education teachers graduating from CEC/NCATE approved institutions to teach throughout the United States and Canada. <P>
	For further information on the CEC standards, the accreditation process, or related assistance, contact CEC's Publications and Professional Standards unit at 703/264-9408 or <A HREF="mailto:cec.pro@cec.sped.org">cec.pro@cec.sped.org</A>.

What is the goal of education? The answer seems simple: to educate all students
equitably and effectively. Teachers who accept this responsibility, however, face many
challenges (Ysseldyke & Algozzine, 1995). What works for teachers in the following
situations?<p>    <ul><li>Teaching students with disabilities in general education
classrooms at the secondary level.    <li>Managing disruptions with students in
elementary schools.    <li>Planning reading instruction for a diverse group of learners.   
<li>Providing consistency across settings for students with disabilities.</ul><P>    This
article provides some answers--through technology and some pioneering preservice
teachers.<br>    As the student population becomes more diverse, planning instruction
becomes more complex. As greater numbers of students with special needs are placed
in general education classrooms, educators are looking for effective ways to manage
classrooms and provide instruction. Teachers are seeing a need for ongoing evaluation
of instruction, and they are concerned about meaningful outcomes for students. In this
light, traditional methods seem less useful.<p>    If teachers begin to doubt their ability
to meet these challenges, then their best intentions could weaken and their
effectiveness could be compromised (Spaulding, 1992); students with special needs
would be particularly at risk in their classrooms.     <p>   
<h2>A New Collaborative Climate</h2><p>   
Teachers know that when they can share their collective expertise, they can achieve
expected and unexpected outcomes for all students (Hudson, Correa, Morsink, &
Dykes, 1987), even in the face of rapid societal change. Teachers themselves are rich
and valid resources of information about effective instruction; and they know their
classrooms and students in ways that others cannot (Goswami & Stillman, 1987). They
simply need a way to share these data in a useful, efficient way; to compile and
organize a large body of information about diverse student needs; and to collaborate
with one another about what works in today's classrooms. Technology and hypertext
environments are helping them respond to these challenges by expanding the universe
of effective instruction. <p>    Effective instruction was the topic of a Special Focus in
the Spring 1994 issue of Teaching Exceptional Children. Several articles (Aber,
Bachman, Campbell, & O'Malley, 1994; Algozzine, Ysseldyke, & Campbell, 1994;
Campbell & Olsen, 1994) highlighted the model of effective instruction and assessment
developed by Algozzine and Ysseldyke (1992) and how teachers in elementary and
secondary classrooms have used the model to guide their practice. What
follows is a description of how preservice teachers have used technology and
collaboration to apply those same principles to teach all students, including those with
disabilities, more effectively.<p> 
  
<h2>Hypertext Help</h2><P>   
<i>Sharing Ideas About Teaching Effectively</i> (SITE) is a computer program that uses
a hypertext environment to create a database of effective teaching tactics. Tactics are
the actions that teachers take to influence learning in their classrooms. SITE enables
teachers to collect and organize their tactics on individual cards within an easy-to-use
database.<p>    For example, working alone or in groups, teachers might record a tactic
themselves or browse through tactics previously entered by their colleagues.  Teachers can offer their own suggestions or comments as to the
effectiveness of a tactic, as well as the level (elementary, secondary), classroom setting
(inclusive, special education), student (general, special education), or content area
(reading, mathematics, science, etc.). They can also link their tactic to a teaching
strategy in Algozzine and Ysseldyke's (1992) model of effective instruction.<p>       


<h2>Problems, Interests, Needs? Check SITE!</h2><P>   
SITE provides teachers with an exceptional resource when they face problems in the
classroom. For example, Linda, a special educator in an elementary school, wanted her
students to manage their classroom responsibilities when she was not present.
Browsing through the database at her school, she found several tactics that suggested
ways for her students to use self-recording or work with peers in their general education
classrooms. Other teachers might want to look for ways to develop effective inclusive
classrooms that include not only students with special needs but also additional
teaching colleagues.<p>    Using SITE, teachers can select an area of interest reading,
for example browse through the tactics, then select and print tactics that seem useful.
They can also make comments about a tactic. <p>    Their feedback may be supportive
or suggest ways in which the tactic might be used more effectively. For example, they
might provide one or more of the following suggestions for a tactic:<br>    <ul><li>It
would be effective in another content area, as well.    <li>The tactic might be less useful
at the secondary level.    <li>It could be used with all students.   
<li>The tactic was successful in a general education classroom, as well as the
recommended special education setting.</ul><p>    SITE enabled a group of
prospective teachers to create a large resource that was easily accessible and
responsive to their individual diverse needs (see box, "Preservice Teaching On-SITE").
Many of their ideas are included in the following discussion. <p>       
<h2>Responding to the Challenges</h2> <p>   
The contents of SITE were organized to reflect the principles of effective instruction
(see Algozzine & Ysseldyke, 1992; Algozzine, Ysseldyke, & Campbell, 1994). Its
greatest value, however, may lie in the collaborative dialogue it fostered among its
users.<p>     <i>Accessible Information.</i> The SITE program makes information
immediately accessible a critical factor if teachers are to use their time efficiently and
effectively. Its contents are easily and quickly recorded, reviewed, and retrieved. To
record a tactic, a teacher simply types in a title and brief description of the tactic, and
then makes recommendations for its use. For example:<p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> Light Up That Mind!<p>   
<i>Description</i>: Frequently students find it difficult to remain on task because they
see no connection between the activity and its practical application. Teachers should
bridge lessons to real-life experiences and activities that are socially and culturally
significant to their students. This will ensure greater student interest, participation, and
a format for longer retention.<P>    <i>Recommended for:</i> both elementary and
secondary, general and special education students, in both inclusive and special
education classrooms, all content areas.    <p>   
Teachers have several options when reviewing and retrieving tactics. They might
search by level, setting, type of student, content area, or any part of the effective
teaching model (component, principle, or strategy). The program then selects the
tactics that fit the review profile; the user can then quickly scan that group of tactics and
retrieve and print those that seem appropriate.<p>    <i>Diverse Needs.</i> SITE reflects the needs and expertise of its users;
it also reflects the ways in which it is used. The information compiled by preservice
teachers in their version of SITE provides a glimpse into the perspective of novice
(preservice) teachers and reveals the diversity of their own concerns at that time. Many
of their tactics related to keeping students on task, making instruction relevant, and
managing behavior; a database compiled by another group of preservice or
experienced teachers might be very different. The database would continue to change
as new information was recorded, reviewed, and retrieved.<p>    The content of SITE
also changes according to the ways in which it is used. Whereas some teachers might
use it as a personal, ever-changing resource of teaching tactics, others might expand
the conversation to include other teachers in their school. Teachers who share
responsibility for a group of students might create a subset of tactics that would contain
entries related to their specific instructional needs such as teaching students with
hearing impairments, physical disabilities, or language differences. Another group of
teachers might use the database to organize their collective expertise in a specific
content area or grade level. Finally, a database might serve as a resource to a school
to address issues such as inclusion, integrating the community into the school, or the
unique challenges of teaching in urban or rural settings.<p>    <i>Effective
Instruction.</i> SITE is anchored to effective teaching principles (Brophy & Good, 1986;
Englert, Tarrant, & Mariage, 1992; Rosenshine & Stevens, 1986) within the structure
developed by Algozzine and Ysseldyke (1992). Their model organizes effective
instruction into four components (planning, managing, delivering, and evaluating
instruction) with related principles and strategies (Algozzine, Ysseldyke, & Campbell,
1994). Teachers place their own teaching tactics within this template by selecting the
strategy that is most appropriate or logical. The SITE program then automatically
associates that tactic and strategy with its related principle and component. For
example: The previous tactic "Light Up That Mind!" was linked to the strategy "Make
Lessons Relevant," which is contained within the principle "Presenting Instruction" and
the component "Delivering Instruction." <p>    This feature aligns classroom practice
with effective teaching principles and also provides a way to search for tactics based on
a teacher's individual interest or concern. If a teacher wanted to search on the strategy
"Make Lessons Relevant," he or she might find "Light Up That Mind!" among a group of
other entries related to that strategy. Teachers can search for tactics at any level of the
model strategy, principle, or component. Browsing through a series of tactics related to
one aspect of this template enables teachers to consider a range of alternatives on a
specific issue.<p>     <i>Collaboration.</i> The SITE program encourages ongoing
professional development among individual teachers. Through collaboration and
dialogue with other teachers, however, educators in many classrooms can address
issues related to the needs of students with disabilities.<p>    Interaction among
teachers can occur in several ways. When recording tactics, teachers have an
opportunity to recommend their use in other settings, with other students, and in other
content areas. Their suggestions are an integral part of each tactic and often provide
the basis for another teacher's search. Teachers often find excellent ideas suggested
by teachers in totally different grade levels or specializations. Teachers can also
comment on tactics provided by a colleague:<p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> State the Question Before the Student Name    <i>Description:</i>
Frequently students will not pay attention when they hear that a question is being
directed to only one particular student. If the teacher states the question before
directing it to a student, all students will be on task and trying to think of an answer.
Pose the question, give all students time to think, and allow them to generate an
answer on their own. Then, call on one student. This tactic will maintain students'
attention because they will constantly be wondering if the next question will be directed
toward them. <p>    <i>Recommended for:</i> elementary students, both general and
special education, in both mainstream and special education classrooms, all content
areas.<p>    <i>Peer Comment:</i> This is a very effective tactic: it encourages student
participation and gives students a reason to learn.<p>       
Another teacher suggested the following to colleagues: <p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> Five-Minute Math Technology<p>   
<i>Description:</i> To increase student's proficiency in basic addition, subtraction,
multiplication, and division, design a 100-problem practice worksheet and allow 5
minutes for possible completion. Correct the worksheet if students complete 95 or more
items. This allows you to measure student's automaticity of the skill and measure
progress over time. Once they meet the goal, they advance to the next level. <p>  
<i>Recommended for:</i> elementary, general and special education students, in both
inclusive and special education classrooms, all content areas.<p>    <i>Peer
Comment:</i> This tactic may not be good for all students because it is also testing how
fast students can write. The time limit could cause some students stress. This may not
be a good tactic for some students with disabilities. <p>       
The program enables all teachers-- novice or expert, elementary or secondary, special
or general, reading or music-- to share and support their ideas about good teaching.
One student, a music major, entered the following tactic:<p>       
<i>Tactic Title:</i> Evaluating During Class Without Disturbing Class <p>   
<i>Description:</i> During a choral rehearsal, if you want to evaluate students' sight
reading progress but do not want to stop your rehearsal for a test, set up a tape
recorder in another room and have students leave one at a time. They can identify
themselves on the tape, sing the example you have left for them, and then return to
class while having missed barely 5 minutes. <P>    <i>Recommended for:</i>
secondary, general and special education students, inclusive classrooms, music <p>   
<i>Peer Comment:</i> [from a colleague in special education] This tactic could be
adapted for many other instructional areas such as: letter recognition, oral reading,
color words, or thinking processes/ strategies as a word problem is being solved. <p>     
 
<h2>Expanding a Teacher's Universe</h2> <p>   
Morsink, Thomas, and Correa (1991) have suggested that effective communication is
the key to collaboration among teachers. Because the goal of the SITE program is to
extend information about effective teaching among colleagues, the ideas need to be
presented clearly and positively with opportunities for constructive and supportive
feedback.<p>     In a self-paced tutorial, the program provides clear instructions for
entering data in succinct and supportive language. The program requires teachers to
consider recommendations that may reach beyond their own classroom into those of
their colleagues. Our preservice teachers demonstrated this ability when, for
example:<p>    <ul><li>Teachers in general education entered tactics for teachers of
students with special needs.    <li>Teachers in special education made
recommendations for teachers in general education.    <li>Teachers of music
recommended tactics for students in general or special education programs.   
<li>Teachers at the secondary level recommended tactics for students at the
elementary level.</ul> <p>    The SITE database has demonstrated that a sizable
collection of effective teaching tactics could be compiled in a brief period of time. <p>     
 
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2> <p>   
Technology enables us to design resources according to our own needs and use them
to search effectively and efficiently for solutions to instructional challenges. Berthoff
(1987) would call this "RE-searching"looking once again for a better way to teach
through reflection on practice. In fact, according to Little (1982), the extent to which
teachers are able to discuss their practice collaboratively and inform and critique one
another is a measure of successful schools. Goodlad (1994) extended this notion to
include a broader school community and suggested that a great deal of reflective
conversation participants is often the signature of healthy educational settings (p.
18).<p>    SITE addresses these needs and creates a unique conversation between
pedagogy and practice, university and school-based classrooms, and novice and expert
teachers. It is, however, the many entries in which preservice teachers made
suggestions to one another, regardless of their area of specialization, that are
particularly encouraging. These entries suggest that teachers can be informed and
need not be constrained in their thinking by labels neither their own nor those of their
students. SITE demonstrates that a teacher's area of specialization does not inhibit an
honest conversation about another teacher's ideas. These preservice teachers have
provided a model for the kinds of conversations that can take place among any
teachers who seek to educate all students. <p>

<H2><B><FONT SIZE=+1>What Do Volunteers Do? </FONT></B></H2>

<H2><B><FONT SIZE=+0>Depending upon your time, availability, and interests,
you may choose to become involved in a one-time event, a short-term project
or a long-term commitment working with individuals with disabilities. For
example, you may choose to tutor students either in a classroom or after
school. Or you may want to be a &quot;buddy&quot; to someone with a disability
by going out to lunch or dinner, seeing a movie, or just visiting with
each other.</FONT></B></H2>

<H3><B>Why Should You Volunteer?</B></H3>

<P><B>One way to learn about careers in special education and related services
professions is to talk to professionals already practicing in the field.
Another way is to become a volunteer. If you have never worked with an
individual who has a disability, you may want to test your interest through
volunteer activities that can provide hands-on experience.</B></P>

<H3><B>Tips for Finding Volunteer Opportunities</B></H3>

<P><B>1. Contact a special education teacher or administrator in your local
school district to find out about classroom, playground, or related opportunities
where you can volunteer to work with students with disabilities.</B></P>

<P><B>2. Check with a department of special education or employment bulletin
board at a nearby college or university to see if they know of volunteer
opportunities.</B></P>

<P><B>3. Call Big Brothers, Big Sisters, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, YMCA,
YWCA or similar local organizations to see if they have programs through
which you can help an individual with disabilities participate in the organization's
activities.</B></P>

<P><B>4. There are many organizations and agencies that serve people with
disabilities. These organizations provide excellent opportunities for getting
to know individuals with disabilities, as well as offer various opportunities
to learn about career options. Contact the National Information Center
for Children and Youth with Disabilities (NICHCY) (800/695-0285 Voice/TTY)
for information on organizations in your area.</B></P>

<P><B>5. Volunteer clearinghouses or placement bureaus in your community
function as employment agencies and do their best to match the interests,
skills, and talents of potential volunteers with community needs. Look
in the yellow pages of your telephone book or contact your local United
Way.</B></P>

<h3>PREFACE</h3>
To be meaningful, research must respond to the needs of the community it is meant to serve, and the focus of research must evolve as that community's priorities change.  The  Division of Innovation and Development (DID), the research and development arm of the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP), has taken up this challenge by
supporting closer relationships between research and practice, exchanging findings and needs with broader audiences, encouraging the development of projects in key areas, and providing direct service to researchers and users.<P>
          
The work and achievements of DID have helped pioneer many common practices found in classrooms today.  For example, the Division was one of the first agencies to fund research on cooperative learning and on the effects of early childhood intervention.  The Division also has funded seminal work in reciprocal teaching, direct instruction, peer tutoring, learning strategies, and behavioral interventions that have led to dozens of strategies with greater success and enhanced efficiencies for children and youth with
disabilities.  In fact, the Division's R&D efforts have touched on virtually every aspect of teaching and learning, from exploring the influences of parents and families on learning to teacher planning; from psychosocial development to outcomes-based learning; and
from understanding how to best use technology in classrooms to exploring how students use their own language and communication systems to learn.  The Division has taken on many of the biggest research challenges facing education today, with results that continue to reshape how educators, policy makers, and the public think about teaching and learning. <P>
          
DID is responsible for four discretionary programs, funded at nearly $40 million in fiscal year 1995 and authorized under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). A brief description of each program is provided below:<P>
          
<ul> <li>
<b><i>Research ($20.6 million)</b></i>.  Authorized by Part E of IDEA, The Research in Education of Individuals with Disabilities Program provides support to advance and improve the knowledge base and improve the practice of professionals, parents, and others providing early intervention, special education, and related services including professionals in regular education environments to provide children with disabilities effective instruction and enable these children to learn successfully. <P>
          
<li><b><i>Technology, Educational Media, and Materials ($10.8 million)</b></i>.
Authorized by Part G of IDEA, the Technology, Educational Media, and Materials for Individuals with Disabilities Program supports projects and centers for advancing the availability, quality, use, and effectiveness of technology, educational media, and materials in the education of children and youth with disabilities and the provision of related services and early intervention services to infants and toddlers with disabilities.
<P>

<li><b><i>Serious Emotional Disturbance ($4.1 million)</b></i>. Authorized by Part C of IDEA, the Program for Children and Youth with Serious Emotional Disturbance supports projects designed to improve special education and related services to children and youth with serious emotional disturbance. <p>

Types of projects that may be supported under the program include, but are not limited to, research, development, and demonstration projects.  Funds may also be used to develop and demonstrate approaches to assist and prevent children with emotional and
behavioral problems from developing serious emotional disturbance. <P>
               
<li><b><i>Special Studies ($3.9 million)</b></i>.Authorized by Part B of IDEA, the Special Studies Program supports the collection of data, studies, investigations, and evaluations to assess the impact and effectiveness of programs and projects assisted under IDEA. <P>
               
Over the last decade, DID has supported ongoing changes in special and general education and efforts to support knowledge production and use as well as knowledge access.  DID has moved toward an agenda that focuses on results achieving better outcomes for children and youth with disabilities.  This transformation was motivated by a commitment of DID leadership to assure that the research knowledge in which they have heavily invested is accessed and used by practitioners and policy makers to improve their practices, programs, and policies.  This directory of project abstracts will provide an overview of the ongoing efforts of researchers supported by DID who are helping to advance DID's results-oriented mission.</ul><p>

<b>Performance Assessment and Standardized Testing for Students with Disabilities: Psychometric Issues, Accommodation Procedures, and Outcome Analyses</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023F50007 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>            
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98 <p>

ABSTRACT<P>
PURPOSE:  The project will attempt to gain an understanding of how students with a wide range of disabilities perform on and react to on-demand and in-class performance assessment tasks in mathematics and science.<P>

METHOD:  This investigation will focus on the use of performance assessment tasks as operationalized in a statewide student assessment system and by classroom teachers, with a sample of 4th- and 8th-grade students (N=200 per year) with varying academic abilities.  A two-tiered, cross-sectional group design with two levels of independent variables (nondisabled and disabled) and two levels of subject matter (mathematics and science) will be used.  Students' responses to performance assessment tasks and standardized multiple-choice tests, as well as post-assessment interviews with students, will provide data to answer questions concerning psychometric issues, accommodation procedures, and the utility of different types of assessments for evaluating academic outcomes.  Teachers (at least 20) involved in the administration of the performance assessment instruments will also be interviewed via a structured questionnaire to provide additional data on accommodation procedures and the functioning of students with disabilities on performance assessment tests.  Data analysis will involve MANOVA, multiple regressions, correlational analyses, and descriptive or qualitative features. 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project results will achieve widespread dissemination through the principal investigators' writing and speaking efforts.  Paper presentations and national conferences on children, assessment, and schooling as well as manuscripts submitted to journals will further enhance the impact of this project and facilitate advancement of research on performance assessment with students with disabilities.<P>

<b>Social Relations of Students with Disabilities in Mainstream Classrooms </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023A50033 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine characteristics of peer associates among elementary students with emotional and behavioral disabilities (EBD)and learning disabilities (LD) in general education settings.  The project will examine social network factors in determining these associations, and todevelop a social context assessment battery to facilitate full inclusion of these students by identifying social barriers to their social and academic success. <P>
METHOD:  This study will include 50 students with EBD and 50 with LD from the 4th- and 5th- grades of schools in metropolitan Chicago as well as rural, suburban, and urban areas of North Carolina.  A multi-method survey design will be used to assess features of students and their classroom social networks.  Group surveys will examine social cognitive maps, peer assessments of behavioral and social features, self-reports of academic, social and behavioral features, and self-reports on school conduct, academic achievement, and school violence.  General and special education teachers will also rate students on academic, social, and behavioral characteristics.  A semi-structured interview will be conducted with special education personnel to determine each school's strategies for inclusion.  Statistical analysis will then assess similarity of associates on each social construct identified as well as demographic and social differences between students who do not have disabilities and whether or not they affiliate with students with disabilities. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A technical report will be prepared to outline the application of this study's findings to the training needs of general and special educators who work with students with disabilities in general education classrooms.  Articles will be prepared for publication in scholarly special education, general education, and educational psychology journals.  Findings will also be disseminated to community schools through workshops, written reports, and direct consultation.<P>

<b>Examining Alternatives for Outcome Assessment for Children with Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023F50008 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a total of 12 studies forming a systematic research program on assessment accommodations and alternative assessment approaches that facilitate inclusion of all students in state-wide assessment programs.<P>

METHOD:    The planned research program will include three methodological approaches: (1) comparative studies involving a qualitative examination of the assessment systems in Kentucky and Maryland, as well as an investigation of characteristics of participating students with disabilities and their performance within those systems; (2) studies which involve secondary analyses of existing databases to address critical technical and implementation issues in the assessment of educational outcomes for students with disabilities; and (3) experimental field studies that involve the collection of new data to address several technical issues crucial to the development and modification of state assessment policies.  These studies will incorporate data from approximately 40,000 students with disabilities in these states, and subsamples of students with disabilities who will be exposed to the experimental comparisons.  These studies will explore the following issues: the ways in which assessment and accountability systems must be conceptualized and developed to have the range and flexibility to accommodate all students, including those with disabilities; the relationships between instructional accommodations and accommodations in assessment; issues and concerns of reliability and validity in the use of testing accommodations and adaptation, alternative assessments, and specification of standards and outcomes; and the use of alternative assessments for students with severe cognitive disabilities. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The work of project staff will be of immediate use to those at national, state, and local levels who are striving toward educational systems that are accountable for all students, including those with disabilities.  Reports will be prepared on the synthesis and comparison of the Maryland and Kentucky systems, the summary of data from analysis of secondary data bases, and the findings from experimental field studies on the possible effects of various accommodations and assessment approaches.<P>

<b>Parent and Teacher Congruency on Variations of a Screening Instrument: An Examination </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50009 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/96 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate whether variations in the screening instrument format influence congruence of scores among both parents and the child's teacher. 
METHOD:  The screening instrument to be used is the Developmental Observation Checklist System (DOCS).  The DOCS will be varied by (1) adding pictorial illustrations and examples and (2) adding a response category to the existing response options.  The sample will consist of 100 sets of parents and 100 teachers of children chronologically below the age of 6 years with and without developmental delays, drawn from early intervention and child care programs in Alabama and Georgia.  A 2x2x3 mixed measure analysis of variance will be used to analyze the effects variations in screening instruments have on score congruency among fathers, mothers, and teachers.  Two between-subjects factors with two levels each and one without-subjects factor with three levels will be included in this design.  An equal number of mothers, fathers, and teachers will complete versions of the screening instrument, and a control group of mothers, fathers, and teachers will complete the screening instrument in its original format. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide current research on parental and professional assessment congruency and information on the impact of variations in the screening instrument on this congruency.  Findings will be disseminated through conference presentations, journal articles and a doctoral dissertation paper.<P>

<b>The Influence of Teacher Characteristics on the Academic Performance and Behavioral Adjustment of  Students with Attention Deficit/ Hyperactivity Disorder </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50118 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is improve understanding of the characteristics of teachers that influence both their interactions with students with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and the behavioral adjustment and academic performance of these students. <P>  METHOD:  The research will be based on a three-year study involving two groups of students, one with ADHD and one of matched comparison students.  In Year One, students with ADHD and matched comparisons will be identified, screened, and assessed for baseline characteristics.  In Years Two and Three, the behavioral adjustment and academic performance of students will be assessed within and between two teachers and two classroom environments to determine the impact of teacher characteristics on school outcome.  The study will include a multimethod assessment of teacher characteristics, student characteristics, and student outcome (behavioral adjustment and academic performance), along with observations of teacher-student interactions.  Statistical analyses will include structural regression procedures based on a hierarchical linear modeling approach to examine change over time.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be incorporated into inservice training workshops throughout New England, and presentations will be made at meetings of national organizations of regular and special educators, school psychologists, parents of children with ADHD, and clinical and developmental psychologists.  Findings will be published in professional journals, and will also be assimilated into University of Massachusetts' masters-level programs in regular and special education, counseling, and school psychology. <P>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30103 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will assess the stability and change of the social and affectivecharacteristics of children with mild disabilities placed in "segregated" versus "integrated" settingscompared to "at-risk children" and children who are achieving normally. <P>
METHOD:  A total of 300 referred third graders will be randomly selected and matched in termsof age, gender, and ethnicity to 100 third graders identified as achieving normally.  Measurementof social and affective outcomes will include sociometric assessments to assess peeracceptance/rejection, teacher ratings of social skills, self-concept, loneliness, school attitudes, andcritical behavioral events.  In addition, comprehensive assessments of students' school histories will be recorded and quantified from existing school records.  The project will examine both short-term and long-term effects of various educational placements on students' social and affective development using a prospective longitudinal research design. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this project will be targeted to have an impact in three areas: the academic community and other research activities, the cooperating schooldistricts, the California State Department of Education, and the department's special educationsection.  In addition to the conventional outlets of published reports and conference presentations within the research community, personnel from state school districts will be involved in education community conference presentations and publications to target educators and policymakers. <P>

<b>Utility of Alternative Assessment Models for Identification of Mildly Handicapped Children </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20002 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project intends to establish the utility of alternative assessment vis-a-vis traditional assessment in establishing the eligibility of students with mild disabilities for special education and related services. <P>

METHOD:  Two interrelated studies will be performed.  The first study will compare the extent to which current referral practices and alternative assessment procedures result in identification of the same "at-risk" children as would traditional assessment procedures.  The first study will consist of 135 students evenly divided among three ethnic groups. The students will be studied, assessed, and referred for formal assessment using alternative assessment procedures.  The second study will compare the utility of four alternative assessment models (including dynamic assessment, achievement-achievement discrepancy, neuropsychological, and behavioral models).  Investigators will evaluate 204 students, again stratified among three ethnic groups, using alternative assessment model and traditional assessment models, with order of testing randomized.  Degrees of coincidence and agreement among ethnic groups and between alternative and traditional models will be studied.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings from this project will inform policy makers on the utility of alternative assessment for reducing ethnic disproportions; moreover, it will permit informed decisions on the relative merits of the four commonly recommended alternatives. The project will also evaluate any ethnic bias among the models evaluated. <P>

<b>A Path to Literacy for Deaf Children through English and American Sign Language (ASL) </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30074 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assess the relationship between American Sign Language (ASL) competence and English literacy among deaf school children aged 8 to 15 years.  
METHOD:  Approximately 200 students aged 8 to 15 enrolled in a residential school for the deaf will be tested annually for 3 years.  ASL skills will be measured using a specially devised comprehension test, administered by videotape and requiring a nonverbal response.  English literacy will be measured using the Woodcock-Johnson Psycho-Educational Test Battery--Revised and a psycholinguistic computer measure developed by the investigator.  Performance IQ will also be assessed.  Research questions will then address the synchronic and diachronic relationships between ASL skills and English literacy, as well as exploring at what age ASL plays its greatest role in facilitating gains in English literacy. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Findings of research will be disseminated via published research reports, assessment guides, diagnostic manuals, and presentations at national conferences.  Results will serve as a basis for future assessment of ASL and academic performance to be carried out at participating schools to further extend the database.  Follow-up research is expected to implement and evaluate a full-scale literacy program using ASL and English for deaf children in the United States.  This program will serve as a model to numerous groups advocating a "bilingual/bicultural" approach for deaf children, and will therefore have a direct impact on many thousands of deaf students, their families, and their teachers. <P>

<b>A Study to Develop Braille Reading and Writing Norms and Instructional Interventions for Children Who Are Blind or Visually Impaired</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50123 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   The project will develop normative information on the Minnesota Braille Skills Inventory (MBSI) and establish a compilation of teaching intervention strategies for use by educators in teaching Braille reading and writing skills.<P>

METHOD:  Stage 1 activities will focus on collection of normative data, and will begin with a mailing to approximately 700-1000 teachers of the blind and visually impaired.  Approximately 150-200 of these teachers are expected to participate in such project activities including obtaining parental consent, conducting MBSI assessments, generating effective teaching intervention strategies, and collecting related demographic and family data.  Each teacher will collect this information for 3-5 students.  Each student will receive family information and assessment packets, including background information and a full MBSI as well as a survey to collect information about the student's current level of academic and social-adaptive functioning.  Concurrent with data collection activities, project staff will obtain technical assistance from a database development consultant to design the database, develop data entry systems, and train clerical staff to enter and conduct based analysis of information from teacher participants.  As participants in Stage 2, teachers will be asked to provide a minimum of three teaching/intervention strategies they have found effective in teaching students Braille literacy.  A Braille Intervention Strategies Committee will then be formed to compile these strategies and develop a teaching strategies manual.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Through development and dissemination of the MBSI and its companion compilation of instructional interventions for teachers, teachers of the blind and visually impaired will have access to an instrument that reliably assesses students' reading and writing skills.  Parents will also benefit from access to norm-referenced, performance-based information about their child's present level of Braille literacy. <P>

<b>Commonwealth Institute ADHD Project: Effects of School, Child and Family Variables on Drug   Responsiveness of Children with ADHD</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30082 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will utilize ecobehavioral principles and concepts, within the framework of a robust experimental design, to investigate the effects of school, child, and family variables on drug responsiveness of children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). <p>
METHOD:  A sample of 250 children with ADHD, aged 6 to 12 years, will be enrolled in a within-subject, crossover, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-response study of methylphenidate, with the placebo and drug order to be determined according to a 3 x 3 Latin square design.  Following a drug-free baseline, children will be randomly rotated through placebo and two active drug conditions, according to one of three experimental sequences.  Drug responsiveness will be analyzed across several variables, including academic performance and curriculum-based measures, teacher and parent ratings of social and maladaptive behaviors, child attributions of treatment effects, and side effects.  Four school variables, five child variables, and four family variables will also be analyzed alongside a host of sociodemographic variables. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Due to the large sample size of this study, the project will be able to provide a mathematical model of drug interactions that will enable researchers to use smaller samples in future studies of this nature.  The data from this study will provide the first comprehensive ecobehavioral assessment of the effects of methylphenidate on children with ADHD.<P>

<b>Stress, Social Support and Adjustment to Middle School Transition in Children with Learning Disabilities</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40155 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to improve understanding of the stress students with learning disabilites experience during and after the transition to middle school, the social support systems they use, and the role that social support plays in the adjustment of these students to the middle school environment.<P>

METHOD:  Project research will focus on: (1) the extent and nature of the stress students with learning disabilities experience during the first years of middle school; (2) the extent and nature of the social support students with learning disabilities receive from family, peers and school personnel; and (3) the role that social support plays in reducing stress and facilitating the adjustment of students with learning disabilities both during and after the transition to middle school.  The subjects will consist of students from the 4th grade (N=360), including 120 students identified as having learning disabilities, 120 students identified as low achievers, and 120 students identified as nondisabled average achievers. During Project Year 1, staff will select students for the 3 study groups, focusing on those students who may be exhibiting extreme behavioral problems.  At this time staff will also ask teachers to complete the School Climate Inventory to assess the heterogeneity of the elementary school represented in the sample.  During Project Years 2 through 4, project procedures will involve the delivery of assessment instruments to students in individual interviews, and questionnaires mailed to the students' families.  Staff will use interview and questionnaire results to assess both school and family climates.  In following student interviews, staff will conduct a variety of stress scale tests to focus on changes in stressors the   student is experiencing. In addition to formal assessment, project staff will monitor and track changes that may occur in family structure and composition, special education services for students, and changes within the school itself.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  With the information gained by this research, educators will be able to focus not only on ways to reduce the stressors of middle school, but on ways to help students with learning disabilities manage their stress with social support.  This knowledge will serve as a foundation for the development of plans and programs designed to facilitate transitions between public school environments. <P>

<b>Project FACILE <br>
(Functional Analysis and Contextual Intervention in Learning Environments) </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20040 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  Project FACILE will study individualized and system-level technologies for improving the educational experiences of students with at-risk behaviors. <P>
METHOD:  The project will conduct a complete functional analysis, use the analysis results to determine the possible communicative function of the behavior in question, and design an intervention to replace the behavior with a prosocial response that serves the same communicative function.  These assessment and intervention procedures will be systematically tested at individual and school or system levels.  Normative rates of at-risk and appropriate social behaviors and social validation data will be used to evaluate the goals, procedures, and outcomes from this project.  School building personnel will be trained to screen for at-risk children, conduct functional analyses, and to design and implement contextual interventions. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Training materials based on empirically validated procedures will be produced to improve practitioners' ability to develop effective intervention strategies for students with at-risk behavior and reduce potential negative outcomes predicted for at-risk students who receive inadequate systematic interventions.  Students with at-risk behavior will increase their prosocial skill level, thereby reducing academic and social risks.  New research-validated knowledge and understanding of effective assessment and intervention strategies will be generated.  Research findings will be disseminated through a variety of professional outlets. <P>

<b>Educational Implications of Surviving Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50058 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/00<p>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will attempt to describe and understand, from the multiple perspectives of the survivor and parents, siblings, teachers, and the medical team, the educational and psychosocial consequences of surviving cancer.  The project will also consider the problems student survivors encounter upon returning to school.<P>

METHOD:  In the first study, the sample will be individuals who were diagnosed with childhood leukemia at age 5-7 years, survived, and are now at least 18 years of age.  These youth and their families will share their experiences, including the roles school and schoolwork played during and after treatment, including the response of the school to the illness and any learning difficulties that arose.  A second study will examine survivors at 10-12 years of age, five years after diagnosis.  This study will focus on subjects' recent re-entry experiences, and school personnel will be drawn into the interview sample.  This study will explore what preparations (if any) were made for the child's return to school after treatment and what problems were encountered.  The third study will follow survivors and their families as they experience school re-entry.  Staff will observe students in their classrooms to understand the complex social and psychological issues associated with reintegration.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A concerted effort will be made to ensure that research findings and products are widely disseminated and useful to diverse targeted audiences.  The organization and summaries of findings in the preparation of conference presentations, reports to parents, reports toschools, reports to medical teams, submissions to refereed journals, submissions to teacher magazines, and other materials will therefore be tailored to address the interests and needs of parents, physicians, classmates, teachers, policymakers, and researchers. <P>

<b>Project Target: Criterion-Referenced Physical Fitness Standards for Adolescents with Handicapping Conditions</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30091 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  5/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will establish and validate criterion-referenced physical fitness test items and standards for adolescents with selected disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Approximately 2,100 adolescents with sensory, orthopedic, or mental disabling conditions will be trained and/or tested on selected physical fitness parameters.  Tests to be employed will include PHYSICAL BEST, the health-related test of the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance Fitnessgram; and the physical fitness test of the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sport.  Findings from these tests will be used as the basis for the statistical validity of developed criterion-referenced standards.  In addition, a criterion-referenced Project Target Test of Physical Fitness and a corresponding educational program for the development of physical fitness would be created. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As a result of project activities, four national tests of physical fitness will be made more valid, useable, and accessible for adolescents with disabilities.  The project will extend the nation's current emphasis on criterion-referenced testing and programming to school-aged youngsters with disabling conditions. <P>

<b>Promoting Literacy through Ecobehavioral Assessment and ClassWide Peer
Tutoring for Racial/Ethnic Limited English Proficient Minority Students with Disabilities
</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40064 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate and validate instructional practices that will
maximize the literacy and academic achievement gains of racial and ethnic limited
English proficient (LEP) minority and majority students with disabilities in self-contained,
resource, and regular education settings.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will utilize ecobehavioral assessment and analysis procedures as a
research tool for identifying procedures associated with effectiveness criteria, and
evaluating ClassWide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) as an intervention for LEP students with or
without disabilities.  The first of five project studies will utilize ecobehavioral assessment
procedures to measure the classroom environment to determine ways to naturally
facilitate literacy and academic progress in mainstream regular and special education
classrooms.  A total sample of 180 students will be selected for classroom observations
that will be divided among self-contained, resource room, and regular education
settings.  Measures used will include demographic measures, process measures, and
product measures.  During Year 2, staff will conduct Studies 2 and 3 in order to evaluate
the effectiveness of CWPT as an instructional procedure that facilitates literacy and
academic progress.  In each treatment group, 2 students will receive tutoring in reading,
2 in spelling and 2 in math.  Data will continue to be collected on the literacy, academic
and language performance as a reflection of CWPT procedures.  Study 3 will replicate
Study 2 findings using a larger sample of students.  During Year 3, staff will conduct
Study 4, in which 24 students without disabilities will serve as partners in tutoring target
students in reading, spelling, and math.  At this time, staff will also conduct Study 5 to
verify procedures from Study 4, refine those procedures, and implement CWPT
programs with a larger sample.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   This project will result in new knowledge concerning the
ecobehavioral features of instruction, systematic replication, adoption of an effective
instructional procedure (CWPT) to a new population, and the translation of research to
practice. <P>

<b>Advancing and Improving the Knowledge Base on Content/Scaffolded Reading
Comprehension Strategies with Parental Involvement: An Asian LEP+LD Student
Perspective </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023A50081 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will advance and improve the research knowledge base on
serving Asian students who are limited English proficient (LEP) and who have learning
disabilities (LD).  The project will explore the extent to which a research-based
content/scaffolded reading comprehension intervention that has been previously found
effective with Spanish speaking students who have learning disabilities and speak
English as a second language (ESL), can be generalized to students from distinctly
Asian backgrounds. <P>
METHOD:  The research design will include parental involvement among two groups of
30 third- through fifth-grade students from Asian backgrounds who have learning
disabilities.  Phase I is designed to prepare LD resource specialists so they will develop
adequate knowledge of the content/scaffolded reading (CSR) intervention strategies
through working with non-target students.  While data on these students will not be
collected and analyzed, information and insights gained from this stage will be
incorporated into the second phase of the study.  In Phase II, the CSR intervention will
be delivered by participating LD resource specialists who facilitate the scaffolding,
eventually leading reciprocal teaching.  Phase III, Peer- and Parent-Facilitated
Intervention, is designed to facilitate target students' practicing and maintaining of CSR
comprehension strategies and content knowledge through in-class peer-mediated
cooperative learning groups and within-home parent-mediated practices through use of
students' native languages.  A combination of descriptive, quantitative, and qualitative
measures and data analysis will be utilized to address research questions on student
change over time and comparison of Asian students' change against that of
English-speaking students with learning disabilities. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Both the research processes and products will advance
the current knowledge base with respect to: (1) educational needs of Asian students
who are limited English proficient and have learning disabilities; (2) professional needs
of monolingual English speaking LD resource specialists; (3) needs of parents for
training and support in forging meaningful partnerships with teachers; and (4) needs of
schools to promote parental involvement in their child's school learning, particularly
inner-city Asian parents who are limited English proficient. Project findings will be 
incorporated into the Project Director's presentations at state, local, national and

GRANT NUMBER: H221A50002 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to improve special educational services
provided to children and youth of native Hawaiian ancestry with special needs. 
METHOD:  This project will focus on: (1) the development of comprehensive and
culturally appropriate instructional models to effectively serve special education
students of Hawaiian ancestry in the least restrictive environment; and (2) on meeting
the needs of students at risk of being identified as needing special education in regular
classroom settings.  Project staff will implement a state-wide parent and community
involvement component to encourage and support the participation of parents in school
programs.  Parent involvement staff will be hired to coordinate efforts within each
community to increase parental participation.  Staff development activities will be
sponsored to support the use of direct instructional practices.  Through the funding of
master teachers and part-time teachers, support will be provided for development and
implementation of school-wide plans.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Outcomes from the project will include: improved
educational performance among special needs students of Hawaiian ancestry;
increased participation of Hawaiian parents and community leaders in schools;
improved school-level and district-level capacity to serve Hawaiian students in the least
restrictive environment; and increased public awareness of the educational needs of
Hawaiian students.<P>

<b>Parameters of Effective Instruction for Language-Minority Students with Disabilities 
and Those at Risk for School Failure: Research Synthesis and Dissemination </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023E50013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will begin to develop a professional knowledge base on
effective teaching practices for language minority students with mild disabilities or who
are at risk for school failure.<P>

METHOD:  This study will focus on instructional issues, specifically classroom practices
which demonstrate the greatest promise for improving the academic achievement of
language minority students with disabilities.  Practices which break down barriers
between school and home and those which assist in establishing proactive collaboration
between educators and families will be targeted.  Staff will combine Slavin's (1986)
best-evidence synthesis and Ogawa and Malen's (1991) multi-vocal approach in order
to better grasp the wide range of studies within the literature bases that will have
relevance for addressing the working hypotheses.  The technical quality of each piece
of literature will be assessed.  The overall synthesis will be based on a set of working
hypotheses generated from earlier research and modified and refined with input from a
wide range of stakeholder constituencies.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A series of audience-specific products will be developed
collaboratively with OSEP.  The project will utilize input from the constituency groups
and from a national forum.<P>

<b>Transition from School to Work and Community Living: Asian-American Students
with Disabilities and Their Needs in Transition</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023N40016 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate parents' expectations and students' needs for
transition among students with developmental disabilities across six ethnocultural
subgroups. <P>
METHOD:  Ethnocultural subgroups of Asian-American students will include Chinese,
Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and  other Asians.  The project, will study the
level of their awareness of available transition services.  The project will also provide
information about parent and student rights and available transition services in their own
language.  It will equip education professionals with important information for
appropriate and effective transition planning, reflecting a child's cultural values, future
employment preferences, and living arrangements.  Ten families of Asian-American
students between 16 and 22 years of age from each subgroup will be recruited from six
school districts and through public announcements on ethnocultural radio and television
broadcasting systems in the greater Los Angeles area.  Community leaders from the six
highlighted ethnocultural subgroups will be invited to take part in dissemination
activities.  A secondary demographic data analysis will be conducted, followed by a
study of parents' expectations and needs in transition using interview and survey
methods. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A brochure in six different Asian languages, technical
reports, and peer-reviewed journal articles will be prepared as final products of this
project. <P>

<b>Predicting Minority Parent Participation</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50038 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  4/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  3/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will enhance the level of service to traditionally underserved
minority group deaf or hard-of-hearing children by identifying parent characteristics that
do not meet the expectations of current service delivery systems. <P>

METHOD:  Hispanic, African-American, and Caucasian families (N=220 total) in five
cities, who have young children who are hard-of-hearing or deaf, will participate in this
study.  A two-tiered attempt will be made to collect information from this population
through phone interviews, followed by home visits where necessary.  The theoretical
framework for the study will address three general areas of mismatch between the value
systems of those who design family services and traditionally underserved families:
social support systems, family cohesion, and family decision making.  Analysis of data
will address two questions: first, the degree and nature of minority parent involvement in
the education of their deaf and hard or hearing children; second, the degree to which
involvement is reduced as a function of membership in a minority group versus specific
family traits and dyanmics.  Once characteristics of parents with higher or lower levels
of involvement in their children's services and education are identified, this information
could be used to identify children who might be better served through alternative
methods.  For example, some children might be better served if information and training
normally earmarked for parents was rerouted to some other individual more likely to
assist the child.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS: The primary outcome of this work will be to expand
contact with underserved populations by giving practitioners a way to respond to
families who don't fit current models of service delivery.  Initial dissemination will take
the form of presentations at annual meetings of major research, education, and special
education, organizations and those representing individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing, followed by subsequent dissemination through the submission of articles to
relevant journals.  Additional dissemination will take place through Gallaudet
University's Pre-College Outreach unit, which provides information and services
nationwide through workshops for service providers.<P>

<b>Effects of Use of Authentic Assessment Procedures on Literacy Development of
Bilingual and Monolingual Students with Learning Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50097 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/31/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will explore the assessment procedures that teachers use in
order to make decisions about the literacy instructional services of students, and to
better understand learner characteristics which may often mask second language
acquisition problems when compounded with learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This will be an exploratory and descriptive investigation using the case study
approach as the main research strategy from an ethnographic perspective.  Three
school sites within the Chicago Public Schools will represent one case study each.  By
studying the three educational settings as well as key figures within each (including
teachers, students, parents, and other school staff), it is expected that the particular
culture of each school will illuminate larger issues about special education teachers'
assessment practices.  Teachers will be interviewed regarding their theories of learning
disabilities, their beliefs about literacy instruction and learning, and their knowledge of
writing process and reading development.  Meanwhile, research staff will engage in
classroom observations and videotaping to establish an ethnographic baseline
understanding of teachers' practices prior to intervention.  Teachers will then receive
training and technical assistance in such assessment techniques as portfolio
assessment, student self-evaluation, and reflecting on both process and product
aspects on student work.  In addition to describing in detail all participating school and
classroom cultures, comparative analyses will be conducted to examine shared
characteristics of teachers' assessment procedures. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS: Findings will be incorporated into development of a series
of videotape and other training materials on authentic assessment as it informs literacy
instruction.  Ethnographic findings on interrelationships between second language
acquisition and learning disabilities will be disseminated through these training materials
as well as journal publications.<P>

<b>Accessibility to and Utilization of Intervention Services in the First 6 Years: A
Longitudinal Study of African-American Families and Services and Service
Agencies</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40083 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine the factors that influence early intervention service
accessibility and utilization within African-American families with children who are
developmentally disabled.<P>

METHOD:  This research is based upon a conceptual framework that links service
utilization to three major components: the personal, familial, and cultural characteristics
of potential users, dimensions of the service delivery system, and the socio-political
context within which service delivery and utilization take place.  The first of two
longitudinal components entails a survey of early intervention and related service
agencies, designed to obtain data on: (1) the representation of African-American
families in intervention programs; (2) agency policies and actions regarding the
recruitment of families from underserved populations; and (3) policies and practices
regarding the delivery of culturally sensitive and appropriate services. The longitudinal
design will enable the research team to ascertain changes occurring in all three areas
over the 3-year period of the study. The second component entails a study of the
intervention experiences of African-American families of children with disabilities during
the first 6 years of the child's life.  The design for this component encompasses two
cohorts of families (45 in each), one with children in the birth to 3-year range and the
other in the 3- to 6-year range.  Qualitative analyses will provide a holistic context for
understanding responses to the various scales and questionnaires, while quantitative
analyses will be used to explore the extent to which relationships implied in the
conceptual model can be validated statistically.  Analysis will also include determination
of the appropriateness, reliability, and validity of the various measures employed in the
study so that the study's underlying conceptual model can be subjected to rigorous
empirical testing in subsequent work. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Through this project, researchers will learn the extent to
which existing early intervention and other related services are accessible to
African-American families of children with developmental disabilities, identify barriers to
service accessibility and utilization, and draw implications for policy, practice, and future
research.  <P>

<b>Discourse Analysis of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse Students with
Exceptionalities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50020 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct an in-depth analysis of bilingualism and
sociolinguistic influences in various contexts.  This analysis will provide insight into the
experiences of culturally and linguistically diverse students with exceptionalities. 
METHOD:  The research site, La Mesa Elementary School, serves 408 students from
rural communities in southern New Mexico.  Approximately fifty percent of the school's
students speak Spanish as their primary language.  Classroom activities will be
observed three times per week for seven months, and interviews will be conducted with
students, teachers, and family members.  Student records will also be analyzed. 
Through classroom observations, videotaping, and interviews, project staff will identify
classroom discourse and language use.  The resultant data and documentation will also
be analyzed to identify effective teaching strategies and unique educational and
sociocultural needs of students.  Emergent themes and grounded local theories will be
identified, and findings will then be disseminated. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be disseminated through various
channels, including: presentations at appropriate conferences; publication in refereed
journals; information sharing with colleagues through computer networks; and inclusion
of findings in coursework at New Mexico State University.  A 20-minute videotape will
also be made of various classroom discourse contexts; this videotape will be used for
presentations, teacher training, and instruction. <P>

<b>An Examination of the Effect of Three Spanish Reading Approaches on the Reading
Achievement of Limited English Proficient (LEP) Students with Learning Disabilities and
LEP Students At-Risk for Learning Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50036 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine the effectiveness of three instructional methods
delivered in Spanish for teaching 1st grade students who are limited English proficient
(LEP) and who have learning disabilities (LD), and for teaching 1st grade students who
are LEP and at risk for LD. <P>
METHOD: The first method, Literature-Based Spanish Reading Approach (LB-SRA), is
based on characteristics of effective reading instruction for students who are limited
English proficient and have LD.  The LB-SRA approach attempts to teach meaning by
using a strong literature component and combining reading, writing, and oral language. 
The LB-SRA does not teach phonics or phonological awareness.  The second method,
Systematic-Integrated - Spanish Reading Approach (SI-SRA), which teaches explicit
phonic and phonological awareness as well as meaning, will integrate the
characteristics of effective early reading instruction for students who are LEP and who
have learning disabilities with characteristics of effective early literacy instruction that
have already been validated through previous research with English-speaking students.
The third method, General-Education-Spanish Reading Approach (GE-SRA) will be the
standard reading instruction already provided in the general education classroom, and
can be described as a program teaching meaning and implicit phonological awareness
and phonics.  120 1st grade students who have limited proficiency in English, from four
schools in Los Angeles, California, will be selected to participate in this study. Children
will be randomly assigned to one of the three methods of instruction.  Treatment will
include two weeks of baseline, followed by 20 weeks of daily, 60 minutes per day
intervention, ending with one week of followup intervention.  A between-groups design
will be used to examine effectiveness of different approaches.  Method of instruction will
be the independent variable and the dependent variable will be student performance. 
Student progress also be monitored twice weekly using curriculum-based
measurement, as well as letter naming and letter sound fluency tasks.  Student
progress will be examined using a Hierarchical Linear Modeling analysis.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Planned project products include an annual project report
and a number of research papers, a handbook reporting on project procedures, a
teacher handbook, and other publications of project outcomes.  Dissemination activities
will include inservice consultations, guest lectures, site visits, and presentations at
professional conferences. <P>

<b>Project SERVE LD: Successful Early Recognition of Variables in the Evaluation of
Learning Disabilities</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30010 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will attempt to reduce the theory-practice gap in identification
of and preparation of remediation plans for students with learning disabilities by
analyzing the decision process and identifying the salient variables that ultimately result
in final diagnosis and interventions for teachers, resource specialists, and psychologists
working with children with learning disabilities. <P>
METHOD:  Beginning with stated definitions and policies for disability determination and
the development of treatment plans, the project will study what actually happens in
practice for approximately 10,000 African-American, Asian, Caucasian, Filipino, Latino,
Indochinese, and Native American children who will be referred and evaluated for all
types of learning disabilities in the diverse San Diego City System.  Through regression
analysis, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis applied to approximately 100
variables per child, the program will analyze the decision process, determine the
variables that are actually employed to qualify a child as learning disabled, describe the
characteristics of children referred for, but not qualified as learning disabled, summarize
the process of developing treatment recommendations, and examine how treatment
plans are implemented.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Information gained through this study will be
systematically communicated to teachers, resource specialists, psychologists,
administrators, and parents in order to have an immediate positive impact in terms of
streamlining the process of learning disability determination and the development of
treatment plans.  Findings will be further disseminated via reports to school
administrators and parents in communities involved, through a monograph to be
developed and sent to local, state, and national agencies and to researchers in the field,
through symposia presentations at professional conventions, and through publications
in major journals.<P>

<b>A National Study of State Education Policies for Language Minority Students with
Disabilities</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50037 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will: (1) identify State policies regarding educational services
for students with disabilities who are also identified as language minority students; and
(2) synthesize experts' recommendations for improvements of these policies through a
Delphi procedure. <P>
METHOD:  Current state policies for serving language minority students with disabilities
will be identified through document review and content analysis.  Existing special
education policies, including statutes, rules, and regulations and state plans will be
reviewed for the 50 states and the District of Columbia.  State Education Agencies
(SEAs) will also be contacted to obtain copies of relevant policy documents.  Next, an
expert panel will review the policies found and make recommendations for
improvements, using a Delphi procedure.  This technological forecasting technique
collects the opinions of experts for analysis, and brings their opinions to consensus. 
The panel will include 15 representatives from the areas of bilingual education, special
education, bilingual special education, and educational policy.  Electronic
communication media will be used to facilitate this process.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will provide recommendations to states that
have not developed specific policies and to those revising policies for educational
programs for language minority students with disabilities. Copies of the project report
will be made available to professional organizations and databases, as well as special
education representatives at each SEA and members of the Delphi expert panel (who
represent colleges and universities nationwide.) <p>

<b>A Longitudinal Study of Young Children with Fragile X Syndrome and Their
Families</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30081 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a longitudinal study of the development of at least
100 boys with Fragile X syndrome between birth and 72 months of age.  METHOD: 
Using growth curve analysis the project will characterize developmental patterns and
document the attainment of key developmental milestones in five domains: cognitive,
communicative, social, adaptive, and motor skills. The project will also document
stability and change in temperament and behavioral characteristics.  Interviews and
surveys will be used to describe unique family contexts among subject children.  A final
component of the study will determine clinicians' perceptions of the unique learning
styles and instructional or therapeutic strategies needed for young children with Fragile
X syndrome. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project hopes to provide a foundation for future
proposals including a longitudinal life span study of persons with Fragile X syndrome
and their families, as well as other research linking biological and environmental factors
to developmental outcomes.  Dissemination efforts will include promotional brochures, a
monthly newsletter, curriculum materials, and handbooks.<P>

<b>Age of Peers and Its Effects on the Social Interactions of Preschoolers with
Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20168 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project involves a 5-year series of studies that will investigate the
extent to which age of peers influences the development of social skills among
preschoolers with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  In the first 2 project years, 80 3- and 4-year-olds with mild disabilities will be
paired with four different play partners for two play sessions each.  Sessions will be
analyzed for level, complexity, and nature of social interactions.  The second series of
studies will examine whether or not repeated opportunities for dyadic play with a
younger child improve generalized social skills of 4-year-old children with disabilities, as
has been observed to be the case with nondisabled children with low rates of social
interaction.  Thirty 4-year-olds with mild disabilities will be randomly assigned to dyadic
play with a same-age peer, dyadic play with a younger child, or a control group.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  These studies will increase understanding of how peers
influence social interactions of young children with disabilities.  Important information on
the need to consider peer characteristics when designing early intervention programs to
promote social competence will result.  Project findings will be disseminated through
journal publications, presentations at conferences, and development of guidelines for
teachers in child care settings serving young children with disabilities.<P>

<b>Elementary School and Boys with Fragile X Syndrome </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50034 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct the elementary school portion of a longitudinal,
life-span study of boys with Fragile X syndrome.<P>

METHOD:  Project staff are currently conducting the early childhood portion of this
study, gathering data on the early development, temperament, behavior, and patterns
of
family coping and adaptation of 100 boys.  During the elementary phase, research
questions will focus on: (1) developmental, functional, and school achievement growth
patterns; (2) factors that influence development and achievement; (3) the development
of social competence and peer relations; (4) factors influencing social competence and
peer relations; (5) the nature and quality of school experiences provided during the
elementary years; (6) the needs and concerns of teachers working with boys with
Fragile X syndrome; (7) effective strategies for enhancing achievement and social
competence; and (8) patterns of family coping and adaptation during the elementary
years.  Eighty boys and their families will be followed between 1st and 5th grade to
answer these questions.  Mixed method designs and hierarchical linear analyses will be
used to chart patterns of growth and change, identify correlates of change, and
determine successful educational and intervention strategies.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be submitted to leading journals for
peer review and publication, and also presented at state, regional, and national
conferences related to child development, education, and family support.  Specific
project publications will include: a manual for parents describing in simple language the
early development and needs of children with Fragile X syndrome; a guide for teachers
and therapists who work with these children and their families; and a professional guide
summarizing findings from the survey of professionals, which will also describe
important factors to consider in working with families. <P>

BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will use an existing parent-child interaction data set to improve
the usefulness of parent-child interaction scoring systems, and to further the knowledge
of the nature and effects of the mother-child interaction.<P> 
METHOD:  In addition to identifying parent and child behaviors that correlate with
measures of child development, research will identify parent and child characteristics
and parents' perceptions of stress, social support, and resources that best correlate
with
parent interaction behaviors.  After the existing data set has been coded to measure
both mother and child behavioral dimensions in order to examine the bidirectionality of
the interaction, a number of analyses will be performed, including: a factor analysis to
determine factor structures of all relevant systems, analyses to demonstrate criterion
and predictive validity, and analyses to establish the relationship between the variables
set forth in project objectives.  The stability and change within dyads of parent-child
interaction will further be examined over time.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  By establishing criterion-related and predictive validity of
coding systems employed, staff will enable clinicians, practitioners, and researchers to
better choose and employ the coding system best suited to their needs.  A monograph
will be produced by project staff and consultants during the final year.  Summaries of
findings will be disseminated through a newsletter and computer bulletin boards.<P>

<b>An Analysis of the Effectiveness of Staffing Patterns for Young Children Attending
Natural Group Environments for Early Intervention</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30072 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine the effects of different service delivery structures
on the development of toddler-age children with disabilities (and their families) receiving
early intervention within natural group environments.<P>

METHOD:  The study will compare four different service delivery structures within
natural group settings with toddler-age children with disabilities receiving services under
the Department of Mental Retardation.  Children will be assigned staff and services
through the Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) process.  The four service
delivery structures to be evaluated will include: (1) a full-time teacher within the group
environment the entire time the child attends and therapy (as needed) delivered within
the group environment; (2) a full-time teacher within the group environment the entire
time the child attends and therapy delivered (as needed) outside the natural group
environment; (3) a teacher attending the natural group environment at least once a
week for consulting purposes and therapy delivered (as needed) within the natural
group environment; and (4) a teacher attending the natural group environment at least
one time a week for consulting purposes and therapy delivered outside the natural
environment.  Evaluation of these service structures will occur on a 3-month basis
during a 12-month enrollment period for each child.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will expand the current knowledge base on
the effects of receiving early intervention in natural group environments in a number of
ways.  Findings will be presented at state, local, and national conferences, and articles
and descriptions of service delivery practices will be prepared for journals and
newsletters.  Research monographs will be generated on methodology and findings,
and training manuals will be prepared on service delivery practices found to be
effective.<P>

<b>Longitudinal Study of Risk and Protective Factors Affecting the Development of
Children Prenatally Exposed to Illicit Drugs and Alcohol</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50111 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/31/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate early elementary school experiences and
developmental outcomes of children with documented exposure to illegal drugs during
pregnancy. <P>
METHOD:  Cohorts of both drug-exposed and nonexposed children ages 5 - 9 years
(N=60 children in each cohort) will be followed during their early schooling.  Within each
cohort, 40 children will have had prenatal exposure to illegal drugs and/or alcohol and
the remaining 20 will be a comparison group with no documented exposure.  For the
first cohort, the work represents a four-year extension of a completed two year
developmental study.  For the second cohort, this study provides an opportunity to
replicate and cross-validate developmental trajectories and findings from the earlier
research with Cohort 1.  Since a wide variety of factors have been found to influence
student outcomes and adjustment, measures of prenatal drug exposure; family risk and
protective factors, developmental status, child behavior at home and school,
environmental factors, academic achievement, and social/emotional adjustment will all
be used.  Individual testing, observations in the classroom and on the playground, and
school archival record searches will be employed to gather data for these measures. 
Data analyses will be conducted to: (1) examine differences between groups; and (2)
explore the variance; accounted for by drug exposure, independent of other variables,
in
the prediction of later school success and failure. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of the first analytical study (of Cohort 1 from ages
3-9) will be incorporated into preservice training in graduate university coursework. 
Annual reports will be developed and presentations will be made at national and
regional gatherings of professionals, researchers, and educators, as well as articles
submitted to professional journals to reach this same audience. <P>

<b>Committee on Prevention of Reading Difficulties in Young Children</b> <br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023S50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 11/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 11/14/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a thorough study of contemporary research on the
development of pre-reading and reading skills, the assessment of factors associated
with reading problems, and the comparative effectiveness of formal and informal
interventions for young children who are at risk for developing reading problems.<P> 
METHOD:  The study will be carried out by a committee of experts in cognitive science,
developmental psychology, neuroscience, teaching and learning, literacy, and special
education.  The research that will be reviewed includes advances in cognitive
psychology, early childhood development, neurology, ethnography, and related fields. 
Promising methods for early identifiction of reading problems will be examined, as will
the scientific bases and effectiveness of various educational and other interventions for
particular groups of children, including those with cognitive or neurological deficiencies,
those from impoverished or minority subcultures, and perhaps those with limited
English
proficiency.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the study's conclusion, the committee will issue a
scholarly report identifying effective approaches to assessment, prevention, and
intervention in a range of settings including schools, preschools, Head Start programs,
child care centers, social service agencies, doctors' offices, health care clinics, and the
home.  In addition, the committee intends to develop a series of concise publications
tailored to specific  audiences, and will explore the possibility of separately funded
dissemination venues, including public media. <P>

<b>A Longitudinal Study of Developmental Patterns of Children Who are Visually
Impaired</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10188 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  6/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This study will examine the sequence and rate of development of children,
ages birth to 6, who are blind or visually impaired.  Measures of visual acuity, behavior,
temperament, and environment will be obtained in an effort to determine first, if there
are differences between development of blind and sighted children and, if there are,
what variables might be identified as predictors or correlates to development.<P> 
METHOD:  This longitudinal study will be accomplished through a collaborative effort of
Teachers College, Columbia University, and a national consortium of six service
providers that will be established to cooperate in the collection of data.  An assessment
battery will be selected by the project Technical Advisory Committee, which will cross
the three domains of child variables (such as developmental quotient, visual acuity, and
health status), family variables (such as socioeconomic status, demographics, and
mother-child interaction), and program variables (such as home vs. hospital, support
services, and curriculum).  Project staff will conduct training of two project evaluators
from each participating program who will collect data in their programs.  Subjects will be
children with visual disabilities who are referred to and served by the programs
participating in this study; it is foreseen that the study will include a sample size of 300
children per 1-year cohort.  Yearly analyses will be conducted of the patterns emerging
in the three sets of variables, their interaction, and their influence on child competence
and family adaptation.  The normative data collected in this study will be analyzed by
measures of central tendency, factor analysis, and discriminant analysis.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Annual data will be pooled with previous data and
reported to the field by means of project reports.  Dissemination efforts will include
these annual reports, journal articles, and a final report.<P>

<b>Research on Treating Aggression in Young Children</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023N40039 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will systematically replicate and extend the findings of a pilot
investigation, in which the rate of aggression across four children decreased to
normative levels through the use of observational learning of high status peers,
individualized training scripts, and a self-evaluation paradigm.<P> 
METHOD:  Staff will develop an observation system and a computerized system of
situation descriptions.  Replication studies of pilot research will then be conducted,
followed by two additional studies with Native American subjects.  In a small group
setting, children will watch high status peer models discriminate between positive and
negative examples of social interactions, state positive alternatives to aggression, and
practice positive social interactions using puppets.  Following study of peer models,
subjects will practice these same responses and will be tested with novel scenes for
knowledge acquisition.  Following training, the effects of a self-peer-teacher evaluation
procedure to enhance generalization from training settings to observational settings will
be tested.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will create a training methodology which
will: (1) reduce the probability of young children being placed in special education and
support friendships and long-term inclusion in general class settings; and (2) reduce
aggressive behaviors in young Native American children attending tribal public school,
day care, and/or Head Start.  In addition to dissemination of the computer program,
observation system and training package, findings will be disseminated via a series of
journal articles and conference presentations as well as a final report for the funding
agency.<P>

ENDING DATE:  6/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will provide credible evidence on the benefits and costs of
early intervention programs, including programs that vary by intensity, the degree of
parent involvement, and age at start.<P>

METHOD:  Data will be examined from a benefit-cost follow-up study of 430 children
with a variety of disabilities including visual impairments, intraventricular hemmorrhage,
medical fragility, and others who received early intervention from the Early Intervention
Research Institute from 1985-1990.  Subjects were randomly assigned to control and
experimental groups where both groups of children received treatment.  Experimental
treatment either began earlier, was more intensive, or added a parental involvement
component in addition to the control services.  By following both groups of students
longitudinally, the study will estimate benefits to families and society that result from the
early intervention received. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  By comparing dollars spent with dollars saved, this
project
will provide a perspective previously unavailable in the field of early intervention for
children with disabilities and will help to answer questions regarding which early
intervention programs serve children and the community best.<P>

<b>Prevention of Antisocial Behavior Patterns Among Children Grades K-3 </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H237B20024 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  This project will develop, evaluate, and disseminate a model program for
the early identification and primary prevention of conduct disorders and antisocial
behavior patterns in kindergarten-level children. <P>

METHOD:  The project will consist of four phases of approximately 1-year's duration
each, as follows: (1) Feasibility Study; (2) Intervention and Longitudinal Tracking; (3)
Replication and Longitudinal Tracking; and (4) Longitudinal Tracking and Follow-up. 
The model intervention program to be developed will have a dual focus on direct child
intervention and family support and intervention.  A state of the art early intervention
program will be developed for delivery by school-based consultants and a model family
support component will also be developed focusing on: (1) improving target parents'
effective parenting practice; and (2) accessing needed services available from
community and state social service agencies. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The components of this model program will be packaged
in year 4 and selected, key school district staffs in the state of Oregon will be trained in
them.  The final package will be broadly disseminated to the field and made available to
professionals for the cost of reproduction and mailing.  Training and technical
assistance to potential model program adopters will be negotiated as appropriate with

<b>Programming Integration of Preschoolers (Project PIP): Developing Peer
Relationships Between  Children With and Without Developmental Disabilities</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10167 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/91 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The study will investigate the effects of interventions designed to enhance
social-communicative interaction among preschoolers with developmental disabilties.
<P>
METHOD:  At least 40 preschoolers with developmental disabilities, and an equal
number of nondisabled classmates will participate.  Exchange theory will be applied to
analyzing interaction patterns and to generating strategies for modifying interaction
patterns to produce more acceptable outcomes for social partners and lessen the
desire
to terminate interactions and relationships.  Some basic characteristics of
peer-mediated intervention tactics will be modified, such as spreading interventions
across the day, rather than conducting concentrated training sessions.  Interventions
will involve: (1) teaching typical peers to use ecobehaviorally derived strategies for
interaction with their disabled classmates; (2) teaching fundamental social skills to
children with disabilities; and (3) a treatment package based on the functional
components of these interventions.  In addition, longitudinal effects will be monitored
and investigations of intervention components that appear necessary to ensure that
children with disabilities continue to interact with typical classmates and develop peer
relationships in subsequent educational placements will be conducted.  Single-subject
experimental designs will be used to evaluate outcomes.  The effects of intervention will
be assessed with observational, sociometric, and teacher and parent rating measures. 
In addition to analyses of changes in the rates of social behavior demonstrated by
children, conditional probability analyses of sequential data will be used to continue the
process of identifying strategies that prove particularly effective in promoting sustained
interaction.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The experimental procedures developed and validated in
the studies will form the basis for two training manuals on: (1) daily intervention to
promote constructive social-communicative interaction in integrated preschools, and (2)
facilitating social adaptation of children with disabilities during transitions from
preschool.  Dissemination efforts will include publication of the training manuals,
research papers, papers focusing on the clinical procedures, and training workshops for
practitioners.<P>

ENDING DATE:  7/31/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will systematically investigate changes in state during the first
few months and years of life, and will identify variables and conditions that potentially
impact the emergence of various state organization patterns.<P> 
METHOD:  A longitudinal research design will measure state behavior across early
months and years of life among 25 infants at high risk for profound and severe
disabilities.  Additionally, a General Systems Theory approach will be adopted to
investigate the process of emerging state patterns in relation to other interacting
variables, such as: levels of cognitive, motor, and social development; quality and
frequency of rhythmic patterns; communicative skills; social interactions with caregivers;
and medical interventions and health status. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Results of this research will provide intervention
programs
with important information for assisting in the development of more stable and adaptive
state patterns in persons with profound and multiple disabilities.  Findings from the
project will have additional implications for the assessment and treatment of traumatic
brain injury, and the behavioral changes and physical losses associated with aging.<P>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C10103 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 12/15/91 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/14/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study how early intervention provided to infants and
toddlers impacts families, and specifically, how families perceive these services.  The
study will examine three assumptions: (1) families need and welcome these services
and supports; (2) early interventionists know how to validly assess family needs and
develop programs to meet them; and (3) these services will enhance the developmental
potential of infants and toddlers who are disabled or at risk.<P> 
METHOD:  Researchers will collaborate with the University of Oklahoma Medical
Center
in the early identification of approximately 36 families of neonates who are at significant
risk due to genetic/congenital conditions, birth trauma or prematurity, and/or
combinations of maternal risk factors (e.g. age, substance abuse, AIDS, etc.).  Over a
5-year period, qualitative methodologies will be used to probe the perceptions and
experiences of parents (and when appropriate, siblings) of infants, toddlers, and
preschoolers.  Twelve families will be identified in year 1 and followed over 3 years. 
Twelve new families will be added each of the first 3 years.  A total of three intensive,
audiotaped interviews will be conducted per year for each family, including interviews
conducted with a significant other outside the family, but involved in the family system in
order to triangulate the data collected.  The first interview will be designed to probe the
issues of: (1) initial communications with professionals from a variety of disciplines; (2)
transitions from hospital to home; (3) contacts from and referrals to additional services
and resources; (4) realizations and adjustments to the infant's needs; (5)
self-perceptions and coping; and (6) perceptions of assistance received from
professionals and interpersonal networks.  Follow-up interviews will further document
the nature of services, supports and/or resources provided to or sought by the
families.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products will include five annual research reports, a final
monograph, book, and field guidelines for parent involvement in early intervention. <P>

BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study the lasting effects of two approaches to preschool
education as well as the course of development of preschool graduates as they
progress from childhood to adolescence, passing through two critical school transition
periods. <P>
METHOD:  The subjects of the study will be 197 elementary and middle school children
who qualified for special education and participated in a previous preschool intervention
study.  These children, who have mild to moderate delays in cognitive and language
skills, received either an academically based Direct Instruction model or a cognitively
based Mediated Learning model for between 1 and 3 years of intervention.  Subjects
will be followed through another five years of schooling and the associated transitions. 
Evaluation instruments will include a variety of cognitive, academic, social, adjustment,
school placement, and employment measures.  Data analysis will vary according to the
research question addressed, and include repreated measures analysis of variance,
multiple regression, survival analysis, and growth curve analysis techniques. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will generate much-needed information on:
the ability to match instructional programs to students; long-term effects of numerous
models for early intervention, with some retrospective information on children's
readiness to learn as a result of either model; key periods in school when children with
developmental delays are at risk for difficulty, or ready to experience a developmental
growth spurt; the relationship and mechanisms between early cognitive and linguistic
functioning and later skill development; and validity of initial judgments of risk based on
early assessments.<P>

<b>Facilitation of Intersubjectivity to Remediate Language Delay of Preschool Children
with Mental Retardation</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20077 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This 4-year project will investigate the effectiveness of interventions to
facilitate language development of toddlers and preschoolers with mental retardation.
The premise underlying the six studies in the project is that intersubjectivity must be
established in order for the child with disabilities to utilize the verbal and nonverbal
information from others with whom he or she interacts. The project will describe and
test
experimental efforts to facilitate the establishment of joint referential states for
communicative exchanges.<P>

METHOD:  The studies will examine both descriptively and experimentally the
integration of cognitive, affective, social, communicative, and language skills during the
first 5 years of life. In Study 1, extant videotapes from at least 200 mother and infant
dyads (infants ranging in mental age from 10-18 months) will be coded in real time to
indicate their attentional state vis-a-vis both objects and their mothers. The
development
of joint attentional state will be described from this cross-sectional sample of young
children in comparison to published reports on normally developing children.
Seventy-six children will be involved in the remaining five longitudinal experimental
studies. Studies 2, 3, and 4 will utilize prototypic interactive computer games for
sensorimotor skills and storybooks as one context to compare to more typical dyadic
play and storybook contexts in terms of the establishment of joint reference and
communication. In Study 2, teachers will attempt to establish joint reference with young
children with disabilities in the context of an object permanance computer game ("Find
the Bunny") or during play with mechanical toys. Study 3 will be a replication of Study 2
except that parents and their children with disabilities will be involved.  Ongoing
analysis
of videotapes of teaching sessions will provide the empirical basis for suggestions
about
ways to facilitate joint attention and communication within these contexts. A computer
controlled videotape analysis system will be used with both keyboard and voice input to
expedite the tape rating and feedback process. In Study 4, parents will be provided with
interactive, computerized storybooks or regular storybooks to examine the utility of
reading activities as joint referential and communication contexts. Study 5 will broaden
the study to establishment of joint reference and language production in a small group
setting (3 children, 1 teacher) in which simple play scripts are enacted (e.g., snack time,
putting a baby to bed). Half of the children will be involved in a small group with one
child who does not have disabilities and half will be in contexts including only children
with disabilities. In Study 6 the investigation of interventions to facilitate joint referential
states and lanuguage production will be conducted in large group free play situations in
a structured classroom which is integrated with children who do not have disabilities or
in one that includes only children with disabilities. An intensive collection of data on
language use and sensorimotor skills will ensure comparability across the 276 subjects
involved in these cross-sectional and longitudinal studies.  <P> ANTICIPATED
PRODUCTS:  In addition to the findings from the studies, an outcome of the project will
be the development of an observational technology from which complex social process
descriptions can be completed, analyzed, and used as the basis for suggestions on
how
to modify interactions with young children with disabilities. The studies will provide
evidence about the relative effectiveness of new language intervention techniques for
early childhood special educators who work with children who have both developmental
and language delays. <P>

BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine the effects of behavioral momentum on
children's instructional engagement within naturalistic instructional contexts.  METHOD: 
In Study 1, high-probability mands will be interspersed with low-probability mands. 
Children's attempts to respond to low-probability mands, correct responses to
low-probability mands, and duration of time children are engaged in learning activities
will be examined using a multiple probe design.  Four students in a classroom
averaging
12-15 preschool students will participate in Study 1 during center-time activities.  Mand
testing will be conducted using high-interest, thematically-based sets of toys.  In Study
2, high-probability mands will be used prior to introducing low-probability response
situations (response situations in which a child response is not required).  Children's
attempts to respond and their correct responses will be examined in these situations
with low-probability behaviors and with high-probability behaviors.  Study 2 will utilize
similar students and preschool settings, but subjects will be provided with
low-probability
response contexts (teacher self-questioning) instead of high-probability contexts. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research reports and manuscripts will be prepared for
professional journals in special education.  Research results and information on
behavioral momentum will also be presented at state professional conferences, and will
be integrated into the Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation's teacher
training program for early childhood special educators.<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This research project will empirically investigate the efficacy of an
expanded intervention appropach involving behavioral consultation with parents and
teachers of preschool children who are at risk for social-emotional difficulties 
METHOD: 
Children experiencing social withdrawal and isolation and children experiencing conduct
difficulties will be identified, treated, and monitored for approximately 3 to 5 years, from
preschool through early elementary school transitions.  Screening procedures and
teacher referrals will identify 120 3-5 year-olds in Head Start programs.  Children
selected for the project will be assigned randomly to experimental and control
conditions.  In the experimental group, children will be further assigned randomly to
baselines in a multiple baseline design.  Consultants trained in behavioral consultation
will work with parents and teachers to deliver a treatment package either for social
withdrawal or for conduct disorders.  Treatment programs will include social skills
interventions supplemented with parent and teacher behavior management strategies. 
Consultants will also monitor students' progress as they make the transition into
elementary school.  <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In the area of practice, products will include: (1) treatment
packages for socially withdrawn and preschool students with mild conduct disorder; (2)
treatment integrity checklists and rating scales for monitoring the implementation of
specific treatments; and (3) foundation of an effective preschool consultation and
intervention model put in place in a county Head Start organization.  Contributions to
research will increase understanding of effects of conjoint behavioral consultation with

approximately 12 different sites from the southeastern portion of the United States,
each
of which provides only one of the two treatment models being investigated.  Treatments
will be administered by the regular interventionists at these sites, who have been
trained
to proficiency in the model they are required to implement.  The study is based on a
pre-
post multifactorial design that will assess the relative contribution of several variables to
two major outcomes of intervention services: (1) the level of family involvement with
their child after 12 and 24 months of services, and (2) the fine and gross motor gains
that the children have attained after 12 and 24 months of intervention.  Four factors will
be used to assess family involvement in the child's intervention program including the
amount of time that primary caregivers engage in therapeutic motor exercises with their
child, and the style of the primary parent/caregiver during interacting with the child. 
Both quantitative and qualitative procedures will be used to assess motor outcomes
that
children attain.  In addition, the study will determine whether the effects of these
curricula are replicable across sites.  A cost benefits analysis will examine the
magnitude of motor gains that children attain in motor intervention programs as a
function of the monetary and family resource expenditures that are required to produce
these gains. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include a technical report to
be advertised for distribution after 12 months of intervention data, state and national
conference presentations, and journal articles.<P>

<b>Prenatal Cocaine Exposure and Social Development of Young Children: A Field
Initiated Research Project </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C10092 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/91 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct a 5-year program of descriptive and
intervention-based research that increases both knowledge regarding social and other
developmental outcomes for young children exposed prenatally to cocaine and
resources for providing early intervention to this group.<P> 
METHOD:  Subjects for all studies will be infants and young children (6 months to 6
years of age) who were exposed to cocaine prenatally and (for Study 1, the longitudinal
study, only) non-exposed matched controls.  Cocaine-exposed children will be recruited
primarily by contacting mothers served by the Mother Baby Chemical Health Program
of
Group Health, Inc., in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area.  Throughout the
seven studies, specific instruments have been selected to provide three different types
of measures of the social development of children exposed prenatally to cocaine: (1) a
general, performance-based outcome measure of social competence; (2) measures of
the type, quantity, and quality of social interactions in home and care/school settings;
and (3) direct assessment of other aspects of the child's development.  Study 1,
involving 50 drug-exposed children and 50 non-exposed matched controls, will consist
of a 5-year, longitudinal descriptive analysis of social and other developmental
outcomes.  Four experimental studies (focusing in turn on environmental arrangements,
teacher-mediated interventions, affection training activities, and parent training to
promote social interaction competence) will each produce a set of empirically valid
intervention procedures.  In the final 2 years of the project, these separate intervention
procedures will be combined into a comprehensive treatment package, and the effects
of this package will be evaluated for both short- and long-term effects on the social
interaction of young children.  Data analysis will include ANOVAs and MANOVAs, and
mulitple baseline across subjects designs for the intervention studies.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will be directed at early
intervention personnel and researchers and will include journal articles, conference
presentations, training materials, and teacher manuals.<P>

<b>Maximizing Effective Teacher-Mediated Intervention in Inclusive Preschools
Implementing Developmentally Appropriate Practice </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023N40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>


ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  This project will develop and validate a package of teacher-mediated
intervention strategies that can be effectively used to teach preschool children with
developmental delays and disabilities.  The children involved in the study are enrolled in
inclusive preschool programs implementing developmentally appropriate practices. <P> 
METHOD:  The studies combine single subject methodology, eco- behavioral
measures, a national survey, and social validity measures to examine: (1) the
effectiveness of the teacher-mediated intervention package across a variety of
participants and target skills, specifically addressing skill acquisition, generalization, and
maintenance; (2) the comparative effectiveness of the full teacher-mediated
intervention
package with two subcomponents of the package, including each interventionists' effect
on child outcomes and their acceptability to the interventionist; (3) the effects of
implementation of the package on subjects' level of enagagement, interactions with
peers, and selected variables within the classroom; (4) the extent to which a cumulative
training package is effective in teaching preschool teachers to implement the package
for the purpose of teaching skills to children with developmental disabilities; (5)
perceptions of preschool teachers who have implemented the combined intervention
package; and (6) the perceptions of parents of preschool children concerning the
procedures and outcomes of intervention.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project results will be disseminated through publication of
research reports to early childhood and special education journals, as well as
presentations at national conferences.  A cumulative Effective Teacher-Mediated
Intervention training manual will also be developed and disseminated along with a
trainers' guide. <P>

<b>Teaching Styles in Early Intervention: Responsiveness and Directiveness</b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94  <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/99

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will research the extent to which teachers of infants, toddlers,
and preschoolers with disabilities should teach by: (1) responding to child initiations; (2)
giving them directions; and (3) combining responsiveness and directiveness. 
METHOD: 
Staff will conduct research in three stages to address relevant issues: (1) naturalistic
inquiry in classrooms; (2) experimental inquiry in classrooms; and (3) experimental
inquiry in one-on-one teaching situations.  Ten teachers and their students (N=60: 20
with disabilities; 40 without disabilities) at a university child care center will be used in
Study 1.  The naturalistic inquiries will provide information about the current state of
practice in a small sample of teachers and children, which will guide procedures and
measurement systems for controlled experiments.  The first controlled experiment,
again with a small sample, will guide the development of procedures for a large
field-based controlled experiment. Four substudies in the first 2 years will be
implemented to conduct the naturalistic inquiry.  First, the effects of teaching style on
child engagement will be investigated.  Second, the antecedents of teaching styles will
be studied.  Third, the long-term outcomes differentiated by teaching style will be
researched.  Fourth, the classroom atmosphere will be investigated with qualitative
procedures.  The second major study, conducted in Year 3, will consist of training
teachers to use three different styles and analyzing child engagement.  The third major
study, conducted in Years 4 aqnd 5, will investigate engagement and task performance
of children in teacher-child dyads exposed to specific teaching styles.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The results of this research will expand the knowledge
base regarding the relationship between teaching and child behavior in the field of early
intervention, provide information of use to teachers and parents as they implement
interventions, and guide preservice and inservice efforts to train teachers to use
developmentally appropriate and effective methods.<P>

<b>Research on Behavioral Momentum with Preschool Children with Disabilities
</b><br> GRANT NUMBER: H023B50056 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine variables that may influence the effects of
high-probability response situations on low-probability response situations.  METHOD: 
This study will examine the effects on long and short inter-trial intervals between
high-probability response opportunities.  High probability responses to mands (i.e.,
obligated commands that call for child response) will be followed by low-probability
mands.  Children's attempts to respond to low-probability response mands, correct
responses to low-probability response mands, and duration of time children are
engaged in learning activities will be examined within an alternating treatments design. 
In addition, three early childhood special educators will be asked to sub- jectively
evaluate the instructional procedures using a questionnaire.  Participating subjects will
be ten preschool-aged children with develop-mental delays attending various local
preschool programs.  The study will be conducted during center-time activities in the
selected classrooms or at Head Start.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will begin to identify systematic
instructional
procedures in the natural environment that early childhood special educators may use
to increase young children's instruc-tional engagement and teach them new skills and
behaviors.  During this project, systematic teaching procedures will be identified and
disseminated through ERIC, journal publications, a state conference presentation and
in
early childhood special education courses at the research university.<P>

<b>The Identification of Educational and Emotional Support Needs for Teen Fathers of
Infants with Special Needs: A Survey of Service Providers for Teen Parents</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to assist service providers in meeting the
needs of teen fathers of infants with disabilities by identifying needs for training,
available services, major obstacles, and current levels of involvement of teen fathers in
caring for their children. <P>
METHOD:  Project staff will begin with a comprehensive mail and telephone survey to
identify agencies which provide support programs for teen parents, including fathers,
with a special focus on programs that provide special programs to meet the parent
training and emotional support needs of this population.  Information gained from a
review of the literature will then be analyzed to develop a survey instrument.  After pilot
testing in Pennsylvania, this survey instrument will be revised and sent to random
agencies from a nationwide list of agencies providing parent training and emotional
support programs for teen parents.  Based on evaluative information gathered from this
nationwide survey, a plan for a model program will be developed.  This model is
expected to consist of a menu of services and approaches to parent training and
emotional support for teen fathers of infants with special needs, and will be reviewed by
at least two agencies prior to finalization.  The final model will draw on the strengths
and
experience of all agencies responding to the survey, and details of the model will be
made available to each identified agency. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  In addition to feedback to participating agencies, project
findings will be disseminated through a variety of media.  A presentation abstract will be
prepared and submitted to a national conference on special education, and a brief
summary of project findings will be sent to newsletters for teen parenting and early
intervention programs.  A journal article on project findings will also be submitted to a
peer-reviewed special education journal. <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the effectiveness of several intervention
models
for serving infants and toddlers prenatally exposed to cocaine. <P> METHOD:  The
project will include 3 intervention models: (1) a center-based program that will provide
participating children with 25 hours per week of early intervention services with
transportation provided; (2) a home program which will provide participants with 3 hours
per week of home visits; and (3) a follow-up program which will not include any planned
intervention programs.  Children in all three groups will receive medical monitoring and
developmental assessments.  A parallel qualitative research effort will employ a case
study methodology to provide a in-depth analysis of all three models.  Three further
studies will include: (1) a comparison of motor intervention models; (2) an investigation
of play and language development; and (3) a study of effects of early intervention
models on the emergence of nonverbal communication.  Costs of intervention models
will also be studied. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Expected outcomes of the field-initiated research effort
will include definitive knowledge of the early development of children prenatally

<b>Validation and Field Trial of a Multiple Gating Approach to Preschool Screening for
Behavior Problems </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C30017 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This research will assess the psychometric characteristics and validity of a
multiple gating screening procedure designed to identify at-risk preschool children, ages
3 through 5. <P>
METHOD:  Researchers have developed a screening system known as Preschool
Screening for Behavior Problems (PSBP) that uses multiple gating.  Procedures used
by PSBP consist of three interrelated stages cross-validating results.  Stage one
involves preschool teachers ranking students using objective criteria for both
externalizing and internalizing behavior dimensions.  Children identified in this stage are
then targeted for teacher-completed behavior rating measures in the second stage. 
Students exceeding normative criteria on stage two measures pass this gate and are
assessed further on stage three behavioral observation measures.  These direct
observations will be recorded in the classroom.  Six separate studies in the first year will
establish the reliability and validity of the PSBP process.  In the second year
researchers will establish normative databases, cutoff scores, and decision criteria for
stage two rating scales and stage three observational measures.  In year three the
efficacy and social validity of the PSBP will be assessed.  The fourth and final project
year will focus on disseminating results. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This research will produce systematic, cost-effective
procedures and instruments for the early identification of preschool students exhibiting
behavioral profiles that put them at risk for more severe behavior disorders.  The
validated PSBP will be a psychometrically sound, field tested procedure that can be
easily implemented by preschool personnel.<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will evaluate the effectiveness of child find operations in
Hawaii, what gaps and barriers may be impeding success, and how the child find
component could be strengthened.<P>

METHOD:  Data from recent years will be collected from existing agency records.  In an
effort to identify children "missed" by child find, records will be studied by sampling
approximately 400 of the 4000 children certified eligible each year.  Impact data will be
collected through surveys and interviews.  The coordinating council (HEICC) and the
Evaluation Advisory Group will create initial standards against which to evaluate the
effectiveness of child find.  Interviews, focus groups, and surveys of families, program
staff and administrators will identify gaps and barriers to a more effective child find
program.  Samples of 40 families will be drawn from program records.  A Project
Advisory Group will consider these identified gaps and barriers, and describe ways to
improve policy and practice.  Necessary resources and impacts will be studied with
input from program and families.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Information about Hawaii's process and service utilization
will be summarized in a report that will provide a basis of comparison for other states as
they generate their own data.  A Guide for Conducting Evaluations of Part H Child Find
will be produced.  The guide will describe a model of evaluation of child find that can be

<b>Project VOCABULARY: Understanding Early Growth & Remediation Effects for
Students with Disabilities or At Risk of Reading Failure </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50121 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/15/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/14/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will increase understanding of the early vocabulary growth of
children with disabilities or at risk of reading failure; and investigate parsimonious and
efficacious means of remediating vocabulary delay.<P>

METHOD:  Strand I (Measuring and Monitoring Vocabulary Growth) consists of four
studies designed to develop and validate a classroom-based measure of vocabulary to
monitor growth over the critical period of kindergarten and first grade.  The relationship
between early vocabulary growth and reading acquisition will also be examined.  Strand
II (Evaluating the Effects of Strategic Intervention) is comprised of two studies
examining the independent and combined effects of incidental and explicit methods of
vocabulary learning.  This strand of research will further investigate the level and type of
intervention necessary to promote and sustain vocabulary growth in students with
disabilities or at risk of reading failure.  Research will be conducted over a five-year
period.  Two distinct geographic regions will be included to increase the generalizability
of findings.  Twenty-four to thirty kindergarten and first grade teachers will participate in
each year of the project.  Each teacher will nominate four students with learning
disabilities or vocabulary delay and four average achieving students.  Vocabulary
performance will be correlated with the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. 
Published norm-referenced tests will be used to assess receptive and expressive
vocabulary.  A classroom-based measure of vocabulary knowledge will be used to
assess the depth and breadth of words sampled from project classrooms.  The
Language Sample Analysis will be used to assess important vocabulary indices emitted
by students during natural speech, including mean length of utterance, number of
different words, and total number of words.  Finally, measures of reading fluency and
comprehension will be used to assess reading achievement.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Outcomes of this project will include: (1) a relevant and
useful measure for gauging vocabulary growth in children with disabilities or vocabulary
delay; (2) more thorough understanding of the vocabulary knowledge of children in
relation to curricular expectations; (3) validated methods to enhance vocabulary growth;
and (4) methods of strengthening and supporting vocabulary growth over time.  These
outcomes will be disseminated through research reports, inservice workshops,
curricular materials, and a classroom-based index of vocabulary growth.  <P>

<b>Efficiency and Efficacy of Phonological Awareness  Instruction for Pre-Readers
At-Risk for Reading Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50012 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will extend the research base for children at risk of reading
failure by:  (1) experimentally evaluating the efficacy and efficiency of two instructional
approaches through a combination of formative and summative measures of
phonological awareness; and (2) investigating the developmental appropriateness of
two sizes of phonological units of instruction. <P>
METHOD:  From six kindergarten classrooms in two schools, approximately 150
chidlren will be screened to determine those at risk for reading disabilities. 
Pre-intervention levels of phoneme segmentation ability will be defined with two
standardized normative and formative measures: scores from a standardized phonemic
segmentation instrument; and comparisons of school building segmentation norms and
individual levels of phonemic segmentation.  Children falling below the 25th percentile
in
phonological awareness will be assigned to one of two instructional approaches for ten
weeks of intervention; phonemic segmentation, or onset-time segmentation as a
scaffolded step prior to phonemic segmentation.  A control group of peers will be taught
phonological awareness from current basal curricular materials.  An experimental
design with multiple methodologies will be used including measurements of time to
proficiency, pre/post experimental control, and time series.  Efficiency, the primary
dependent variable, will be measured by comparing the levels in phonemic
segmentation over time to the number of sessions required to achieve proficiency. 
Efficacy will be determined by pre/post comparisons of phonemic segmentation ability
and a phonemic segmentation maintenance test two weeks after intervention. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Primary outcomes from this study will include: (1)
extension of the research base identifying efficient and effective methods for teaching
phonological awareness to prereaders at risk for reading failure; (2) profile analysis of
individual children's responses to phonological awareness instruction through formative
assessment; and (3) professional conference and inservice presentations and journal
articles articulating the relationship between design principles and efficiency, efficacy,
and intensity in phonological awareness instruction for prereaders at risk for reading
failure.<P>

<b>Social Relationship Development in Community Contexts for Young Children with
Severe Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50169 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct research to investigate the social relationships
experienced by young children with severe disabilities. <P> 
METHOD:  The project will undertake a series of studies which will focus on: (1)
demonstrating the efficacy of intensive, longitudinally-applied intervention tactics; (2)
understanding how young typical children's attitudes and behaviors can be made more
facilitative of relationship-building with peers who have disabilities; and (3) determining
how and why consumers adopt and use effective instructional practices in the social
relationship domain.  The first study will provide community-based social relationship
intervention for young children with autism.  Study Two will include a psychometric
study of existing methodology for assessing the presence or absence of preschoolers'
stereotyped views of persons with disabilities in community contexts.  An intervention
study will then aim at maximizing positive and supportive attitudes and behaviors as
expressed by young children, who are not disabled, in community settings.  The third
study will solicit the concerns of potential adopters of intervention plans regarding the
issues, incentives, and disincentives associated with adopting best practices.  This
assessment information will be followed by targeting community providers for adoption
of the interventions developed in the first two studies.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop: (1) empirically based
articles/chapters; (2) conceptual articles/chapters; (3) white papers synthesizing related
policy issues; (4) intervention manuals for direct-line staff; (5) news segments; and (6)
yearly monographs on the state of practice related to relationship-building interventions.

<b>Examining Child Care Providers' Attitudes Toward Substance Exposed Children
and
Their Familes </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50051 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine child-care providers' self-perceived knowledge
and skills, as well as their attitudes toward working with children who have been
exposed to controlled substances and their families.<P>

METHOD:  Two surveys will be employed: Self Rating of Professionals' Knowledge and
Skills and Attitudes Toward Special Populations Survey.  The latter survey will also
assess attitudes toward children with Down syndrome and chronically ill children for
comparison purposes.  These surveys will be administered to 100 child care providers
recruited from public, private religious, and private secular child care settings prior to a
two-hour training session.  The purpose of the training session is to increase providers'
knowledge of the physical, psychosocial, and educational impact of substance
exposure
on infants and toddlers.  It is hypothesized that child care providers' attitudes toward
working with substance-exposed families are poorer than toward working with children
with chronic illness or Down syndrome; it is also hypothesized that these attitudes are
related to self-perceived level of knowledge and skills in working with this population,
and extent of prior training in issues surrounding children with such exposure. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Examining care providers' attitudes toward families with a
history of substance-abuse will be useful in assessing training needs, and in estimating
the effectiveness of such training as a form of intervention, and a change agent in
adjusting providers' attitudes.  Project results will be disseminated to other practitioners
and researchers through publication of articles in scientific journals and through
presentations at national, state, and local conferences. <P>

BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will attempt to gain a better understanding the poor
bound-morpheme acquisition (BMA) of children with specific language impairment (SLI)
in preschool students through a variety of bound-morpheme learning tasks.<P> 
METHOD:  A variety of bound-morpheme learning tasks will be administered to children
with SLI (N=120) and children with normal language development (N=120), 40 each per
project year.  The task variations will be designed to explore the three components of
the BMA process: vocabulary learning, bound-morpheme learning, and
bound-morpheme generalization.  In Project Year 1, the effects of vocabulary learning
on bound-morpheme learning and generalization will be assessed.  In Project Year 2,
the effects of phonological versus semantic enhancements on bound-morpheme
learning and generalization will be examined.  In Project Year 3, the effects on
generalization of reducing vocabulary load as well as emphasizing the affix versus
emphasizing the contrast between affixed and unaffixed forms will be investigated.  In
each of the three project years, a set of associated tasks that assess skills likely to be
pertinent to children's BMA performance will also be administered.  These tasks
investigate sentence memory, nonverbal rule induction, utilization of known
bound-morphemes and phonological and semantic similarity effects.  Statistical
techniques, such as multiple regression analyses, will be used to examine the results of
the bound-morpheme learning task, as well as their relationship to those of the
associated tasks.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The combined results of these studies will clarify whether
theories of storage/access deficits or rule-induction deficits better predict subject-group
differences.  In addition, the results will determine which components of the BMA
process (vocabulary learning, bound-morpheme learning, and/or bound-morpheme
generalization) should be the focus of clinical intervention.<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will extend the line of research on attitudes toward
preschoolers with mild to severe disabilities, and will develop naturalistic and
economical strategies for effectively promoting social relationships among preschool
children with and without disabilities. <P>
METHOD:  Over a three year period, 17 kindergarten teachers and 15 special
educators, 250 kindergarteners, and 124 preschoolers with mild to severe multiple
disabilities from Memphis City Schools will participate.  Study One will use a
randomized group design to examine the effects on social contact, children's books,
and
guided discussions on the attitudes of kindergarten children toward children with
disabilities.  In Study Two, a component analysis will be used to examine the
effectiveness of individual components of the intervention package.  Study Three will
examine the feasibility and effectiveness of the intervention package as a class-wide

<b>Second Generation Research in Early Intervention: Long-Term Outcomes in
Children and Their Families </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C50171 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>
PURPOSE:  The project will conduct a second generation research study to examine
the long-term effects of early intervention on children and their families. <P> METHOD: 
This study will involve the long-term follow-up of 300+ children and their families who
participated in the Family, Infant, and Preschool Program (a family-centered model)
between 1981 and 1985. Data on participating children, now between 14 and 16 years
of age, has already been collected.  Multiple regression analyses by sets will be the
principal means of assessing long-term outcomes, and a regression analysis by sets
will
be used to relate several sets of independent variables to the dependent variable of
interest.  Independent variables will include: parent and family characteristics; child
characteristics; social support factors; child diagnosis/development; and intervention
features.  Long term outcomes variables will include: child's social adaptive level;
independent behavior; school achievement; intelligence quotient; school placement;
mainstreaming outcomes; parent well-being, family well-being; level of social support;
parental sense of control over services; and parental satisfaction with services. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This investigation will yield the first long-term follow-up
data on family-centered intervention practices.  A  nontechnical report will be
disseminated to state and federal legislators, State Education Agency (SEA) staff in all
50 states, the administrators of local public school systems and other agencies
responsible for early intervention services.  Findings will also be published in
newsletters serving primarily administrative and policy-making audiences.  In addition,
research findings will be submitted to a variety of journals and conferences serving both
researchers and educators.<P>

<b>Longitudinal Study of the Impact of Early Intervention Services on Infants and
Toddlers withDisabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H159E50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/30/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/00 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine the extent to which Part H is being implemented
at
the local level and examine the relationships between the extent of implementation and
the child and family outcomes achieved.<P>

METHOD:  This study will document the developmental trajectories of 1,800 children in
the first five years of life and examine the relationships between the growth experienced
by children with different disabling conditions and the early intervention services they
receive.  Subjects will represent urban, suburban, and rural communities, including
communities with high proportions of minority group families, in 18 communities located
in 12 states.  Multiple areas of child and family functioning will be measured.  Child and
family outcomes will be assessed when the child enters early intervention and at each
1-year anniversary thereafter until the child reaches 36 months of age.  All children will
be assessed and family outcome data collected at 36 months and again at 60 months. 
Data gathered will address the provider, nature, quantity, quality, and cost of early
intervention services received by each child and family.  The study will also collect
information about the nature of Part H implementation at both community and state
levels.  Information on behavior and services in preschool special education and
kindergarten will be collected as children age and enter new educational settings. 
Hierarchical linear modeling will be used to examine the growth trajectories of children
with different disabilities and to determine the relationship between child growth and
Part H services.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be disseminated to potential
audiences, including policymakers, federal, state, and local administrators, researchers,
practitioners, parents of children with disabilities, advocates, and professional
organizations.  Findings will be disseminated in several formats, including: annual
comprehensive reports at the end of Years 3, 4, and 5; brief reports in each of these
years; short summaries of key findings; articles submitted for publication in professional
journals; and conference presentations and briefings. <P>

<b>Using Instructive Feedback to Promote Future Learning </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023A50013 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will evaluate the use of expansion instructive feedback in small
group and low-structure activities and to assess its effects on the efficiency of future
instruction. <P>
METHOD:  Two studies will be conducted using expansion instructive feedback with
between 12 and 20 children with disabilities ages 4 to 8 years.  A parallel treatments
design will be used.  Study 1 will be based in small group instructional contexts, while
Study 2 will focus on low-structure, child-directed activities.  These low-structure
activities may include free play, art, and snack time.  Behaviors to be taught will be
individualized for each child, but will focus mostly on discrete responses from functional
academic and communicative domains.  Two behavior sets will be taught in alternating
daily sessions, one set with and one set without instructive feedback.  In instructional
conditions of both studies, a constant time delay procedure will be used involving
ensuring the child's attention, presenting a stimulus and task direction, using a control
prompt immediately, presenting a short response interval, providing consequences and
instructional feedback, and presenting an inter-trial interval.  Student behavior will be
observed and assessed, and the role of instructional feedback in improving future
instruction will be evaluated. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project staff will submit three manuscripts for publication
in professional literature.  An instructional manual will be developed, evaluated, and
disseminated for preparing teachers to use instructive feedback, and findings will be
submitted to two national conferences.  A fact sheet describing instructive feedback
research will be mailed to a large mailing list of interested practitioners.  Notices
regarding the manual and fact sheet will also be posted on electronic bulletin
boards.<P>

<b>The Effects of a Writing Intervention on the Development of Phonological Skills in
Primary Grade Children with Learning and Reading Disabilities </b><br> 
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50024 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 1/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE: 10/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will provide and evaluate results of instruction emphasizing
both phonological and sound-to-letter skills while students are engaged at a meaningful
task rather than a skill and drill practice task.<P>

METHOD:  Students with learning disabilities in first through third grades (N=16-20) will
be given opportunities to use the writing process as a means of developing both
phonology and letter-sound skills.  Students will write daily in their own journals and will
be encouraged to attend to the phonology of the language system by using invented
spellings for words they cannot spell correctly.  It is expected that students will make
gains in phonological awareness, spelling, and reading skills.  A multiple-probe,
single-subject research design will be employed, and curriculum-based measures in
phonological awareness, spelling, and reading will be taken weekly.  Multiple probe
measures will be graphed to monitor ongoing progress, and will be shared with
students' teachers.  In addition, special education teachers will be interviewed three
times to examine their perceptions about using the writing process as a literacy
intervention. <P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  An information packet will be developed for dissemination
to special education teachers and teacher trainers.  The packet will provide useful
information about the reading process and will suggest ways to use writing activities to
facilitate development of reading skills.  Samples from study participants' journal
writings and teacher interviews will be featured in the packet.<P>

<b>Generalized, Transitional, and Longitudinal Effects of Prelinguistic Communication
Intervention </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C20152 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate effects of prelinguistic communication
intervention on: (1) children's generalized prelinguistic communication skills; (2) parents'
use of behaviors that facilitate children's language development; and (3) children's
language development and linguistic communication.<P>

METHOD:  Sixty children with communication delays who are at risk for related
disabilities will be seen five times over a 2-year period.  Half of the subjects will serve
as
a contrast group, while the other half receives staff-implemented intervention. 
Treatment group subjects will remain in intervention for 6 months or until they meet five
mastery criteria.  Treatment goals include: action and vocal imitation of familiar and
unfamiliar models, participation in social routines, requesting, commenting, and
comprehension and expression of vocabulary that encodes the key word for what the
child was communicating nonverbally.  Intervention techniques will include contingent
imitation, scaffolded modeling, environmental arrangement, and violations of routines.
<P>
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  If parents in the experimental group use more behaviors
facilitating language development, such findings will support the important bidirectional
assumption of the family-systems approach to intervention and the transactional theory
of development, two theoretical models undergirding Public Law 99-457, Part H. After
determining the effectiveness of intervention, results and validated intervention
procedures will be disseminated to practitioners and researchers.<P>

<b>Activity-Based Assessment: A Functional Approach to Determining Eligibility of
Young Children with Disabilities </b><br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023B50028 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the effectiveness and utility of Activity-Based
Assessment for determining eligibility of young children with disabilities for early
intervention services.<P>

METHOD:  The research consists of two studies, each using a mixed factorial design. 
In Study 1, 20 parents of children who are referred to state agencies for evaluation of
eligibility for early childhood special education programs will be selected as subjects. 
This study will examine (1) the functionality of test items as measured by parents using
the Functional Skills Checklist (FSC), and (2) parental satisfaction with their role and
involvement in the assessment process as measured by a Parental Satisfaction
Questionnaire.  Study 2 will select 20 early interventionists as subjects, and will
examine
(1) the functionality of test items as measured by early interventionists using the FSC
and (2) the degree of linkage between eligibility assessment information of the Activity
Based Assessment and intervention programming versus a traditional assessment
measure using the Intervention Linkage Checklist.  This study will be designed for
replication to further define effects of the alternative eligibility assessment procedure
with different subjects, locations, and test comparisons.<P> 
ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project plans to complete the following dissemination

<b>Auditory Training for Spatial Orientation in Children with Visual Impairment</b> <br>
GRANT NUMBER: H023C40107 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will study how children with visual impairments can use naturally
occurring auditory information to maintain their spatial orientation while moving about.<P>

METHOD:  For the first project area, staff will conduct a functional assessment of sound
localization.  A practical, standardized test for the precision of sound localization will be
developed for use by mobility instructors.  This test will be assessed for its ability to predict
problems with travel skills.  For the second component, staff will study the guidance of
locomotion via sound fields.  A training procedure will be developed to enhance sensitivity to
reflected sound and "sound shadows" in a safe environment allowing repeated practice.  The
procedure will be standardized and made available to mobility instructors using inexpensive
materials.  For the third component, staff will focus on spatial orientation from dynamic
listening. <P>
A procedure will be developed for training children about room layout by listening to moving
sound sources.  The procedure draws on recent advances in audio recording for
three-dimensional
playback.  The sample will be children with visual impairments (N=200) and children without
visual impairments (N=16) aged 6 to 12 years.  For the assessment, the 16 children without
visual
impairments will participate.  The classroom-based procedure will use portable equipment
designed to be easily moved, and will produce computer-generated speech noise.  The testing
procedure will require children to judge the position of a sound relative to a reference position
that is straight ahead at ear level.  Staff will later use results of these studies to explore a
procedure for making an audio tape recording that will portray the spatial layout of the training
room when played back over earphones.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will produce two standardized assessment and
intervention procedures to contribute to the orientation and mobility training of children with
visual impairments.  Results will be published in professional journals, workshops, and
manuals.<P>

<b>The Development and Evaluation of an Early Intervention Program for Nonreaders and
Nonwriters</b><br>


GRANT NUMBER: H023C50089 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/16/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/15/99 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will collaborate with teachers on the development, implementation, and
evaluation of an integrated curricular approach designed to teach the self-regulated use of
comprehension and composition skills and strategies to primary grade students with mild
disabilities.  The project will focus specifically on those who are nonconventional readers and
writers in grades 1-4. <P>

METHOD:  In the first study, comparative and normative data will be collected on
primary-grade
students with mild disabilities in order to provide baseline information for measuring effects of
the
experimental curriculum.  Over the course of three years, 13 teachers and their 130 students with
mild disabilities will participate.  Analyses will focus on the short-term and multi-year effects of
the curricular approach on teacher's instructional practices, and their special education students'
reading and writing achievement, and metacognitive and strategy knowledge.  Staff will also
study
whether gaps between students in the experimental group and their nondisabled peers diminish
over time.  In the second study, the experimental curricular approach will be embedded in
language arts and content area subjects to evaluate the effectiveness of the curriculum when it is
presented as part of the regular education curriculum.  Four regular education teachers in the
primary grades, their 16 mainstreamed students with mild disabilities, and all associated regular
education students will participate in this study.  The performance of mainstreamed students will
be contrasted with that of students who continue to receive the curricular approach in special
education settings.  Pretest and posttest data will be analyzed to determine the effects of the
experimental curriculum on the achievement of students with learning disabilities, metacognitive
and strategy knowledge, and self-perceived competence.  Specific consideration will be given to
data providing information on the extent to which cognitive strategies in the experimental
curriculum can be incorporated as part of the "regular" curriculum, and the relative effectiveness
of the curriculum employed in regular education versus special education settings.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the conclusion of this research project, a disseminable
curricular approach will be available to advance teachers' knowledge and practice related to the
improvement of literacy instruction and the learning of young students with mild disabilities. 
Annual reports will be prepared and disseminated to academicians and teaching professionals. 
An
ongoing series of executive summaries will be distributed to administrators and other key
personnel of schools in the local service area. Project staff will be present findings through
conference presentations and journal articles.  They will also be available for consultation with
local school districts.<P>

<b>PROMISE: Practitioners and Researchers Orchestrating Model Innovations to Strengthen
Education</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50005 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/99 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, validate, and disseminate a model for
practitioner-researcher collaboration and staff development, resulting in cutting-edge, successful
practices that are implemented and sustained in schools. <P>

METHOD:  Research will conduct two "generations" of research activity aimed at developing
instructional procedures that help teachers accommodate students with disabilities during
mainstream reading activity.  In Years 1 and 2, staff will implement the PROMISE collaborative
research model with one school and a traditional "expert" model with a second school.  Both
qualitative and quantitative methods will be used to examine the effects of these two contrasting
research models on teacher beliefs and values, school culture, teacher practice, fidelity of
treatment implementation, and student outcomes.  In Years 3 and 4, staff will study the effects of
the research model in participating schools in terms of whether (and if so, how long) these
innovations are sustained.  In addition, staff will replicate the process initiated in Years 1 and 2
and contrast collaborative versus expert models in two additional schools.  Again, the project
will
generate information about the efficacy of further refined reading instruction.  In replication of
Year 1 and 2 research, teachers in the first generation of schools will be responsible for staff
development in the second generation of schools.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  PROMISE is expected to have national impact through the
development of otherwise unavailable products and knowledge including: (1) the creation of a
model for school-university research collaboration that bridges between practice       and
research;
(2) a manual and videotape designed to disseminate this model; (3) validated methods for
including students with disabilities in general education for reading instruction; (4) a training
manual and videotape explicating and illustrating the reading methods; (5) research reports on
the
relative effects of collaborative versus expert research models, on reading treatment components,
and on specifying a model for school-university research partnerships.<P>

<b>Project BRIDGE: Bridging Research and Instruction through Dynamic and Ground
Exchange</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50021 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop, field-test, and evaluate a model of elementary literacy
education that is: (1) considerate of and sensitive to the regularities, routines, and resources of
individual schools; (2) grounded in the dynamic and equitable exchange between professionals
practitioners and researchers; (3) sufficiently defined to generalize to other schools and produce
replicable findings; and (4) sustainable by faculty most proximal and responsible for bringing
about change.<P>

METHOD:  Research will be conducted over a four-year period.  Forty general education
teachers, 8-10 special education teachers, and four school principals will participate along with
four university faculty.  All students with identified reading disabilities, two children identified
as
at risk for reading failure, and two average-achieving peers will participate from each classroom
for a projected total of 280-300 children over the four year funding period.  Each school will
establish two teams per school that will be responsible for developing specific mechanisms and
strategies of the BRIDGE model for their respective sites.  One of these teams will represent K-2
classes, the other grades 3-5.  A modified multiple-case replication design will be used to
evaluate
the effects and sustainability of the model.  School culture, climate, and student literacy
achievement, engagement,
and attitudes will be assessed through a framework of measures to be determined at the local
school level.  In addition to technical adequacy criteria, these measures will be proximal to
school
culture and climate and will provide a cadre of common assessment instruments across
schools.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research reports from the first two project years will examine
the
reading literacy growth of students with disabilities within the context of several bridging
mechanisms and options at the school-building level.  Curricular materials and reports from
Years
3 and 4 will provide the theoretical base and practical implications for designing and
implementing
a model for bridging research and practice that benefits students with disabilities and those at risk
for reading and academic failure.<P>

<b>PROJECT RILT</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50033 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/99 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, implement, and evaluate the Research Instructional Lead
Teacher (RILT) system, a model for bridging the gap between research and practice in the
education of children with disabilities in general education classrooms.<P>

METHOD:  The RILT model will address implementing effective, research-based instructional
strategies for teaching students with learning disabilities, mild behavior disorders, and students
with mild, moderate, severe, and profound disabilities in regular education elementary
classrooms. 
Using an AB design, three time series experiments will be conducted to assess: (1) procedural
reliability of implementation of the RILT model, (2) procedural reliability of teacher
implementation of selected strategies, (3) learning of students with disabilities during
implementation of the RILT process, (4) learning of students without disabilities who receive
remedial educational programs, and (5) teacher instructional and student responding
(ecobehavioral) variables during implementation.  Three ethnographic case studies will be
conducted from the emic perspective to identify influential belief systems impacting selection
and
use of instructional strategies.  Five studies using single subject experimental designs will be
conducted to study the effectiveness of RILT.  Results
of a school climate survey will be examined to determine differences (if any) on variables
measured in schools after participation in RILT. The RILT model will then be replicated in
another school using local resources and action research data collection procedures.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop: (1) an RILT model implementation
module describing module components, roles of key research teachers, procedures for
implementation and training, and results of implementation in various settings; (2)
"teacher-friendly" intervention modules describing research-based interventions, step-by-step
procedures for implementing interventions in general education classrooms, adaptations made in
different classrooms, and manageable data collection procedures. The project will also develop
disseminable materials for professional journals and conferences.  These reports and modules
will
be made available to a variety of professional institutes, clearinghouses, and technical assistance
organizations.<P>

<b>Visual Involvement in Literacy: Reading and Discussing Books with 3- to 8-Year Old
Students 
Who are Deaf and Hard-of Hearing</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N40040 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to perform a sociolinguistic study of successful
involvement strategies in a visual modality that are used by teachers of varying backgrounds and
styles.  The subject of the study will be equally divided between both hearing and deaf users of
Manually Coded English (MCE) and American Sign Language (ASL).<P>

METHOD:  The project initially involves transcription and analysis of 10 videotaped reading
activities by teachers and 10 videotaped discussion activities by teachers and students.  First, five
teachers (three hearing and two deaf) will be asked to read with their class one of two picture
books, "Too Much Noise," which uses many words connected with sounds.  Second, they shall
be
asked to involve their students in discussing the first book after hearing the story.  The same five
teachers will then read a second book, "Five Chinese Brothers," which uses many words
connected with vision, again followed by a
discussion of the story with the class.  The total number of students will be 52, and students shall
be videotaped as well.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide an empirical basis for the transcription
and analysis of successful involvement strategies; the transcription and analysis of teachers' and
students' interaction in discussion; and an understanding of how the involvement strategies are
impacted by the teacher's target language and audiological background.  The result will be a
research-based model for developing inservice training for teachers, parents, and others who
wish
to read and discuss with students, to develop or enhance techniques for creating interpersonal
involvement as well as more involvement in discussion in a visual modality.<P>

<b>Is Learning Disabilities Nothing More than an Oversophistication of Low Achievement? A
Quantitative and A Qualitative Synthesis</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E50004 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop a definitive statement of whether, and to what extent,
students with learning disabilities differ from peers who are low-achieving and who do not have
learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  A meta-analysis will be conducted, addressing the following questions: (1) In terms
of standard deviations, how does performance by low-achievers compare to that of students with
learning disabilities?  (2) What magnitude of difference separates the two groups in terms of
social
acceptance and classroom behavior? and (3) Are student grade levels, race, and socioeconomic
factors relevant to intergroup differences?  A comprehensive review of published and
unpublished
literature will be conducted.  These studies will then be coded along various methodological and
demographic dimensions and critiqued for technical quality.  The staff will then calculate
individual
effect sizes for comparisons between the two groups of students (learning disabled/low
achieving)
and analyze individual effect sizes along dimensions such as academic performance,
achievement/
performance discrepancies, social acceptance, and school behavior.  In addition to the
meta-analysis, staff will analyze a subset of studies meeting the highest standards of scientific
rigor
as part of a qualitative, best-evidence synthesis approach.  Finally, findings will be submitted to a
panel of experts for formative feedback, followed by further analyses based on their
feedback.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be made available as quickly as possible
through submission of prepublication reports to the Educational Resource Information Center
(ERIC).  Results will also be published in relevant journals, including a possible special issue on
the subject to include both the meta-analysis and the best evidence synthesis.  The final report
will
be published as a monograph, and presentations will be made to scholarly audiences at national
gatherings.<P>

<b>Accommodating Student Diversity in General Education Classrooms: A Downward
Extension of
Class-wide Peer Tutoring</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N30003 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will reorganize 1st- through 3rd-grade reading instruction to enhance
regular educators' abilities to accommodate a wider range of academic diversity in the
mainstream.<P>

METHOD:  In Year 1, staff will develop and pilot Class-wide Peer Tutoring (CWPT) strategies
for beginning readers in six 1st grade classrooms in two schools.  Procedures will make use of
strategies and principles of effective reading instruction.  The impact of these procedures will be
carefully monitored by means of curriculum-based measurement.  In Year 2, staff will examine
experimentally the effectiveness and feasibility of the downward extension of the strategies with
different types of students in mainstream 1st-grade classrooms.  Participants will include 20
1st-grade teachers and 120 children, half of whom will be either at risk for or already involved in
special education services.  In Year 3, the downward extension of the program will be used to
permit teachers to tailor CWPT experiences to student's individual needs.  Decisions about
CWPT
placement will be aided by computer-managed curriculum-based assessment, which will be
implemented class-wide.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Concrete products of the program will include a new, validated
tutoring system in reading suited to needs of various levels of readers and a manual for training
teachers and support staff to use the methods developed through the program. <P>

<b>Investigation of Sequence of Reciprocal Interactions within Behavioral Episodes of Problem
Behavior</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023N50004 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate a conceptual model of the sequence of
reciprocal interactions within behavioral episodes (explosive escalating sequence of behaviors)
of
problem behavior.<P>

METHOD:  Project staff anticipate gathering data on 500 to 600 behavioral episodes of problem
behavior exhibited by a stratified sample of 100 to 110 elementary-aged students diagnosed as
seriously behaviorally disabled, learning disabled, and/or developmentally disabled.  Prior to
direct
observations of behavioral episodes, a scatterplot analysis will be completed by educators on
each
student to identify those times in which there is a high probability that behavioral episodes will
occur.  Data will be summarized descriptively for the entire sample through simple univariate
statistics.  Logistic regression techniques will be conducted to explicate the sequence of
reciprocal
interactions within behavioral episodes of problem behavior.  These techniques will also be used
to explore the conditional probabilities among the behaviors associated with each interaction.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project expects to develop products such as: presentations at
national, state and regional conferences; professional articles, book chapters, and manuscripts;
and
dissemination through electronic networks to reach parent and practitioner networks.<P>

<b>Deaf Students as Readers and Writers: A Mixed-Mode Research Approach</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023T30006 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will examine the acquisition of reading and writing skills in deaf and
hard-of-hearing children based on a quantitative study of child characteristics and a qualitative
study of the classrooms they attend.<P>

METHOD:  The quantitative study of student outcomes will include measures of student
language, reading and writing skills, in two age-matched groups of deaf and hard-of-hearing
students in two schooling settings.  This study will also include institutional variables of the
settings where they receive their schooling, and analyses of associations between the students'
performances and these institutional variables.  The qualitative study of instructional practices
will
examine two distinct settings which exemplify different modes of communication during reading
and writing instruction.  This study will be coupled with analysis of deaf and hard-of-hearing
students' responses to instructional language as documented in their interaction and engagement
with instruction, in their reading and writing practices, and in their written products.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Key research personnel will include activities to disseminate
project findings through their writing and publishing.<P>

<b>Synthesis of Intervention Research </b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023E40014 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/10/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is twofold: (1) to analyze through a meta-analysis and a
synthesis of single-subject research, as well as a narrative, instructional programs that have
produced data on populations with learning disabilities; and (2) to integrate research findings
across a diverse study of instructional interventions for students with learning disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  For the first phase of the project during Year 1, a search of the relevant literature
will
include at least four on-line databases including: (1) the Educational Research Information
Center
(ERIC); (2) Psych Lit, a review of psychological journals; (3) Med-line, a review of all medical
literature; and (4) Comprehensive Dissertation Abstracts.  Search descriptors will include
learning
disabilities, reading disabilities, and dyslexia.  In the second phase of Year 1 all group design
intervention studies will be analyzed via a meta-analytical procedure.  Analysis will primarily
consist of individual study units and careful selection of studies for inclusion on methodological
and conceptual criteria.  Analysis will include: (1) the collection of published studies; (2) coding
of study characteristics; (3) calculation of effect size as common measures of study outcomes;
and
(4) search for relations between study characteristics and study outcomes.  Studies used in the
intervention synthesis will include students with learning disabilities in the sample who receive
intervention over a minimum period of time; will be retrievable from university libraries, ERIC,
or
from University Microfilms International; will measure treatment outcomes quantitatively; and
will show no severe methodological flaws.  For the group design studies, meta-analysis will be
conducted through five methods: (1) outcomes will be transformed to a common metric; (2) the
study will be used as a unit of analysis and dependent measures will be analyzed separately; (3) a
meta-analysis will be performed using a probability method; (4) all studies will be pulled
together
to test for homogeneity; and (5) studies will be pulled to look for sampling errors. The final
phase
of Year 2 will focus on hypothesis testing, data analysis, writing and presenting the outcomes of
the quantitative analysis.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will provide a comprehensive analysis of all
published intervention research with students with learning disabilities and will clarify and
integrate relevant research findings across diverse study characteristics.  The analysis developed
from this project will be incorporated in textbook chapters, disseminated in articles, and
presented
to state departments and professional conferences.<P>

<b>The Development and Use of Cheremic, Graphemic, and Phonological Coding in Deaf High
School-Aged Readers</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50050 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine the short-term memory (STM) strategies used by deaf
individuals in contrived and real-world reading situations, and to explore the correlation of these
strategies with (1) individual factors such as reading level, level of hearing loss, and age of onset,
and (2) with educational and family characteristics, including communication mode and
language,
parent adaptation, involvement, permissiveness and expectations, and early reading, sign, and
speech experiences.<P>

METHOD:  Subjects will include 20 high school students who are severely or profoundly
prelingually deaf high school students, half of whom will be poor readers.  Half of each reading
group's subjects will have hearing parents, the other half having deaf parents.  Deaf subjects will
be compared to 20 hearing students who have scored below-average on STM and reading
comprehension tasks.  Subjects will complete two measures of STM, designed to elicit confusion
among like stimuli and to thus reveal preferred coding strategies.  Semi-structured interviews
with
deaf subjects and their deaf or hard of hearing parents will be videotaped.  Student interviews
will
include role-play, reporting of everyday strategies, review of test results and examiner
observations, and discussion of word-play materials.  Parent interviews will focus on parent
attitudes, expectations, and the child's early communication and education experiences.  Analysis
will determine if there are significant differences between coding strategies used by the different
groups of subjects on readers on STM tests.  Correlations will also be explored between deaf
readers' primary coding strategies and their scores on three informal speech-related measures, age
of onset, and levels of hearing loss.  Finally, staff will correlate coding strategy and reading
group
to the interview data from subject and parent interviews.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The information to be gained from this research will have
significant impact on both programming decisions and philosophies as well as on strategies for
teaching reading.  Project staff will disseminate findings in writing and through presentations at
conferences and workshops.  Journal articles are planned for submission to several journals
related to reading and special education.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to synthesize and broadly disseminate current research
on positive behavioral support for students whose behaviors include self-injury, aggression,
tantrums, property destruction, and self-stimulatory behavior.<P>

METHOD:  Based on a literature review resulting in an anticipated sample of 100-150 papers,
staff will prepare a monograph which will include: (1) a list of articles composing the final
review
sample; (2) dimensions of functional analysis and assessment reported; (3) proactive nature of
intervention; (4) aspects of change in social systems; (5) ecological validity of intervention agent
and setting; (6) types of interventions employed and degree of skill improvement; (7) outcome
effectiveness with respect to initial reduction in problem behavior; and (8) dimensions of social
validity.  This monograph will also address trends across time, factors related to intervention
effectiveness, and gaps in the literature base.  The research synthesis monograph will be
translated
into four monographs summarizing "what works".  The four monographs, as well, will be written
with the following audiences in mind:  (1) federal, state and local policy makers and general and
special education administrators; (2) teachers, families, and related service provides; (3) students
with problem behavior; and (4) friends, peers, and community citizens.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:    Following the development of the  monograph and manuals, a
forum on Positive Behavioral Support will be convened, with members of all stakeholder groups
invited to attend. <P>

<b>Interpretation of Narrative Theme and Students with Learning Disabilities</b> <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30126 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 10/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will investigate the ways in which students with learning disabilities,
compared with peers who are not disabled, comprehend complex text that focuses on a content
domain of fundamental importance, namely, human social interactions. The project will also
determine what types of instruction are effective in promoting comprehension and generalization
of comprehension. <P>

METHOD:  The general methodology to be followed will be modeled on the general strategy of
clinical interviews, using sets of 20 students with learning disabilities and equal numbers of
age-matched and reading-ability-matched students who are not disabled.  Initial questions will be
open-ended and students will be encouraged to talk freely.  Detailed probe questions will be
employed to extract further information.  A coding scheme will be developed for the analysis of
the resulting protocols. Statistical analysis will use primarily analysis of variance and
covariance.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project expects to generate the following products: selected
and evaluated reading materials that focus on a small set of issues that are interesting, important,
and useful for students with learning disabilities; guidelines for effective instructional strategies;
an
instructional program developed on the basis of these guidelines; and an evaluation of the
instructional program. <P>

<b>A National Evaluation of Residential Camp Programs Serving Persons with
Disabilities</b><br>


GRANT NUMBER: H023C30002 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   The project will conduct a national evaluation of residential camp programs serving
persons with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  The investigation will include 14 residential school and/or summer camp programs
serving children with disabilities, to include a total of roughly 1,500-2,000 total cases
nationwide. 
A pre-post measurement will be employed to determine campers' affective growth resulting from
their exposure to residential camp programming.  These measurements will be conducted by
parents and caregivers to better measure program generalization and impact beyond the camp
experience.  A second test will be administered to determine effects of particular components of
outdoor programming on skill acquisition of campers.  A case study approach will also be
employed using interviews and observations of a representative sample of campers from each
regional site.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The study will contribute significantly to the understanding of
the
value of planned outdoor programming for children with disabilities, address the benefits of
residential camping experiences for persons with varying levels of disability, and provide
professionals with validated and comprehensive procedures for evaluating residential camp
programs serving children with disabilities.<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will determine the feasibility of implementing a School Support System
approach to monitoring that continues to examine compliance with regulatory requirements,
evaluates the effectiveness of
special education programs and services, and identifies and provides technical assistance and
support.<P>

METHOD:  Following a thorough review of the literature (including other state practices and a
survey of service providers), staff will review local education agency (LEA) statements of
assurances to comply with regulatory requirements.  The LEA application process will also be
reviewed to minimize repetition in describing how regulatory requirements are to be met.  School
Support System data gathering instruments will be examined and a database will be created
containing information to be gathered using these instruments.  School Support Team members
will be surveyed concerning the effectiveness of compliance data gathering instruments.  The
available literature on the attainment of IEP goals as indicators of effectiveness will then be
examined, and a review will be conducted of other states' activities in determining indicators of
program and service effectiveness.  Five regional focus groups will be established in the state,
and
group reviews and discussions of potential indicators of effectiveness will be conducted.  A
sample of effectiveness indicators will thus be developed, and effectiveness data collection
instruments will be prepared and implemented.  The data collected through these instruments
will
be compiled and analyzed, and findings will be reviewed with members of School Support
Teams.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The School Support System will provide for continued LEA
compliance with regulatory requirements while incorporating an evaluation of service
effectiveness with a focus on benefits to students.  A mechanism to identify needs and provide
technical assistance and supports to the LEA with a focus on systemic change will also be
included. <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will assist the Office of Special Education Programs in the transfer of
information and data from major studies, currently reported at the federal level in technical
reports
into consumable, commercially disseminated products.<P>

METHOD:  The contractors shall review available literature on information transfer as the term
is
used in the context of social marketing and the field of education.  The five-step approach to
marketing the contractors have used in the past will be applied to this project, with major steps
being as follows: defining a clear purpose for each dissemination product; identifying,
qualifying,
and quantifying target audiences; designing content and format; determining most appropriate
media; and establishing a means of evaluating results.  Following market research, contractors
will
develop a database of publishers and producers who will be contacted regarding dissemination
needs.  Final publishers of selected products will be selected from this list.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Deliverables shall include: a list of OSEP reports on major
studies
for which a potential market is believed to exist; a synthesis of literature based on the literature
review; market research plans in various drafts; the prioritized list of dissemination materials;

<b>Goals 2000 and the Inclusion of Students with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023U40001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:<br>
ENDING DATE: <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE: As requested under Section 1015 of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act, this
project is intended to conduct a "comprehensive study of the inclusion of children with
disabilities
in school reform activities assisted under the [Act]."<P>

METHOD:  The National Academy of Sciences (NAS) will establish a Study Committee of up to
15 experts which will design and carry out a set of activities, including conducting site visits,
holding a workshop, and commissioning scholarly papers.  Components will include: (1) An
evaluation of the National Education Goals and objectives, curriculum reforms, standards, and
other programs intended to achieve the goals.  The intent will be to ask how less emphasis can be
placed on process requirements and more on program quality, while maintaining adequate
safeguards.  (2) A review of assessments and measures, and other methods to collect data on
educational progress of students with disabilities.  Issues may include whether separate
standards,
thresholds, outcomes, or assessments should be developed for some students with disabilities; the
comparability of modified and unmodified assessments, "flagging" of modified assements;
adapting performance-based assessments.  (3) An examination of what incentives or assistance
might be provided to states to develop improvement plans that adequately address the needs of
children with disabilities.  Issues will include incentives to classify children as disabled and
various
instructional and organizational approaches. 4) The relation of Goals 2000 to other federal laws. 
Issues will include comparisons of Goals 2000 and IDEA and how they can be brought into
greater harmony.  (5) Such other items as NAS considers appropriate.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  As required by the Act, The National Academy of Sciences will
submit an interim report of its findings and recommendations to the President and Congress not
later than 12 months from the beginning of the project, and the final report not later than 24
months from the date.<P>

<b>A Study to Determine the Current Levels of Outcome Attainment of Students with Specific
Learning Disabilities (SLD) and Students with Severe Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159A40007 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to establish a baseline data pool with which to
demonstrate the current level of outcomes attained by North Carolina students served under the
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<P>

METHOD:  The first year of the study will focus on two groups of students with disabilities
(students with learning disabilities and students with severe impairments).  The second project
year will expand the study to include all students receiving services under IDEA.  Data will be
collected across the following domains: (1) participation outcomes; (2) enabling outcomes; (3)
academic outcomes; and (4) post-school outcomes.  A previously conducted feasibility study has
indicated that these data can be collected with reliability using the AUEN system.  Six North
Carolina school systems have been invited to participate in the project, three of which
participated
in the previous feasibility study.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The long-range goal of the project is to establish a state-wide
evaluation system to be used by all public schools in North Carolina.  With this system, the
public
schools of North Carolina will be able to make judgements about the effectiveness of their
programs for special needs students and make decisions for improving ineffective programs.<P>

<b>State and Local Education Efforts to Implement the Transition Requirements in the
Individuals
with Disabilities Education Act</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159D50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  3/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  2/28/98 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will establish and implement a research agenda designed to investigate
state and local education efforts to implement the transition requirements in the Individuals with
Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).<P>

METHOD:  The University of Vermont Center for Transition and Employment, the University
of
Illinois Center for Instructional Research and Curriculum Evaluation, the University of
Minnesota
National Transition Network, and the National Association of State Directors of Special
Education (NASDSE) are collaborating in this three-year effort to establish and implement a
research agenda designed to investigate state and local education efforts to implement the
transition requirements in the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  The overall
project will consist of five separate substudies.  Substudy 1 will employ a survey of 58 state and
territorial directors of special education and 500 local directors of special education to acquire
information on the range and variation in state and local policies related to the definitional
components of transition services.  Substudy 2 will use a longitudinal follow-up of 200 randomly
selected students in their last year of schooling to document the nature and extent of their
participation in transition planning and explore the relationship between their participation and
the
resulting post-school outcomes approximately one year after leaving school.  Substudy 3 will use
expert review and case studies to identify context and salient characteristics (e.g.  policy,
organizational structures, funding, staffing, professional development, evaluation, interagency
collaboration, leadership, advocacy, instruction and curriculum) that define exemplary
implementation of transition services and promote positive outcomes for youth with disabilities. 
Substudy 4 will combine the survey in Substudy 1 and the longitudinal data in Substudy 2 to
examine interagency involvement at federal, state, and local levels.  In addition, an issues forum
will be used to identify impediments to and strategies for improving interagency involvement at
state, federal, and local levels.  Substudy 5 will conduct a policy analysis to identify federal
program services and policies which are relevant to the design and delivery of transition services
and fulfill the requirements of IDEA.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products developed as a result of these investigations will
include: descriptive materials such as brochures and news releases, articles in national, regional,
and state level newsletters, project publications including research reports, policy briefs and case
studies, journal articles and book chapters, and workshop and conference presentations. <P>

<b>A Full Evaluation Study of the Oregon Supported Education Plan and Its Impact Upon
Student
Outcomes</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159A40016 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  1/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will determine the effects of recent Oregon restructuring reforms and
their impact on the inclusion of all students in regular education settings.<P>

METHOD:  The Full Evaluation Study will continue to refine an assessment process developed
during the feasibility study and then use the process to measure direct student outcomes.  The
process will use: (1) the Oregon Portfolio Assessment System; (2) extant student assessment
data;
and (3) school records.  Staff will also conduct two multiple-site descriptive case studies (at
elementary and secondary levels) using these sources to document the impact of supported
education on the direct student outcomes of students with and without IEPs.  An analysis of the
relative impact of supported education "implementation factors" on student outcomes will be
conducted, integrating professional staff/parent respondent data with direct student outcome data
to create a set of multidimensional dependent variables for analysis.  The project will also
pilot-test and provide feedback to the ODE about their development of the Oregon Portfolio
Assessment system for use with students with IEPs, thus continuing the important process of
integrating long-range statewide plans.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A full evaluation report will document each of the following:
findings of the study related to the impact of supported education implementation factors on
outcomes for students with and without IEPs; the development of a process to monitor the effects
of supported education on students with and without IEPs; and recommendations regarding the
use of Oregon's Portfolio Assessment Process with students with IEPs. <P>

ENDING DATE:  9/30/96 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will improve and inform decision making that seeks to better align the
intent and implementation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) with the
goals of national education reform for children with disabilities. The project will also provide
direction for systemic reform by increasing understanding of significant problems in the
identification, integration, and school completion rates of children with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  Staff will conduct a series of national database analyses investigating graduation,
integration, and identification rates and the influences of demographic, economic, and other
educational factors at the state level.  Interviews will be conducted with staff in states selected for
their success in aligning IDEA implementation with national goals in order to relate state
performance to specific policies, resources, and other educational and demographic factors. 
Individual state databases will be used to conduct policy analyses through examination of locally
reported identification, integration, and school completion indicators as well as interviews with
local special education directors.  A policy study will also be conducted to examine local
variation
within one state based on district data and interviews.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings will be disseminated through direct mailings
to

ENDING DATE:  9/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:   This project will establish a Center for Policy Research on the impact of general
and
special education reform to investigate and analyze critical issues in current general and special
education policies, their interactions, and their impact on students with disabilities, with a focus
on discerning policy options for stakeholders at the federal, state and local levels.<P>

METHOD:  Over a 3-year period, the Center will conduct extensive cross-site analysis of diverse
state and local sites and across dimensions of policy development, implementation and impact. 
The Center will use primarily qualitative research methodologies, including systematic policy
review, case study design and action research.  The Center will report on: (1) interaction of
special and general education reform efforts within sixteen states; (2) four in-depth case studies
of
how state-level special and general education reform policies interact with and impact on local
school districts and on students with disabilities; and (3) four additional in-depth case studies of
school districts engaging in reform of both general and special education, such as those creating
"inclusive" schools, including their interactions with state-level educational policies.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The Center will provide a structured program of training and
mentoring to at least four graduate students each year in the fields of public policy and/or
disability policy.  They will be offered formal coursework and will participate as field

ENDING DATE:  5/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the feasibility of developing a system for collecting
student outcome data that can be integrated into the current Colorado state compliance
monitoring process.<P>

METHOD:  Following a literature review, staff will identify desired long- and short-term
outcomes, which will then be organized into a matrix of possible student outcomes based on the
Expanded Curriculum model.  Focus groups will be held with special education administrators,
service providers, and consumers to identify the most useful student outcomes to measure.  A list
of appropriate instruments to measure these outcomes will follow.  Project staff will then identify
currently available student outcome data and identify and pilot-test new data collection
instruments and procedures for needed additional student outcome data.  These will include
difficult student tasks, formats for IEP data collection, student participation checklists, and
functional skills evaluation checklists, all of which will be targeted specifically for students with
serious emotional disturbances, learning disabilities, or mental retardation.  These instruments
will
then be compiled and integrated into existing systems of data collection prior to planning of the
collective computer program.  This program will finally be pilot-tested and its overall efficacy
will
be evaluated.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Anticipated products of this research include: (1) a conceptual
framework and instruments for measuring social, student, and functional life competency
outcomes; (2) a battery of data collection instruments on outcomes common to all students with
invisible disabilities and those unique for students identified with serious emotional disturbances,
learning disabilities, and moderate mental retardation; (3) a description of the procedures used
for
collecting the student outcome data; and (4) a plan for the computerized aggregation, analysis
storage, and retrieval of the student outcome data.<P>

<b>School Choice Options and Positive Outcomes for Students with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50050 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/98 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will examine four school choice options that may be enabling children
with disabilities to reach successful outcomes.<P>

METHOD:  Options to be explored include two established options (second chance programs
and
postsecondary options) as well as two emerging options (charter schools and home schooling). 
Qualitative methodologies will be used to examine the experiences of students with disabilities in
all options, and quantitative methodologies will be used in measuring outcomes for students in
second chance and postsecondary options in comparison to those who do not participate.  The
study will also examine how charter schools and families participating in home schooling
educate
students identified as having a disability, as well as the potential impact of these practices on
students and special education.  After separate studies of all four options, a fifth study will
integrate all findings in order to enable policymakers and educators to make informed decisions
about the possibilities of school choice options and the attainment of outcomes for students with
disabilities.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products will include the customary research reports and journal
articles.  In addition, staff will develop products that present the findings in an user-friendly
format. These products will include policy briefs, short reports, and fact sheets.  Similar products

<b>The CHILD Health Resource Partnership: Collaborative Health Interventions for
Learners
with
Disabilities (CHILD)</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023D40013<br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97:<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop an integrated, transagency and transdisciplinary
model to
plan, deliver, and research the efficacy of pediatric health care support services to
families and
young children with chronic health care needs and developmental disabilities. <P>

METHOD:  This three-year clinical research project targets children between 4.5 and 6
years
who
are at high risk for cumulative educational and functional disorders because of dual
developmental
disabilities and chronic health conditions.  This project focuses on the late preschool to
early
primary school period as critical to the success of children who must move from early
intervention
programs that emphasize more family-centered and interagency services to less
collaborative,
more professionally-centered school-age services.  Targeted CHILD participants will
have a
variety of mild to severe neurodevelopmental and neurobehavioral disorders,
associated active
medical conditions, and mental health disorders.  During the first of two research
phases staff
will
observe, follow, and compare two groups of young children with dual medical and
developmental
needs within the public schools.  The control group will consist of a matched sample of
children
(N=25) who will receive a program plan that they have typically received regarding an
array of
uncoordinated services.  The experimental group will also enroll a matched sample of
children
(N=25) who will receive the CHILD interventions.  After a period of 1 year, Phase 2 will
commence, in which the control group will begin to receive the CHILD interventions. 
Within
and
between group effect size comparisons will be analyzed as well as the progress and
outcome
indicators from using each child and family as its own control. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in the development of a system of
transagency care for children and families with developmental disabilities and medical
and
mental
health needs, a family-centered model of decision making about child needs that relies
on
parental
participation and co-leadership, and establishment of collaborative transagency
strategies for
teamwork that foster agency and policy changes.     <P>

ENDING DATE: 12/31/96<P>                                 

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will restructure secondary programs at Holt High School in
order to
provide improved student advocacy for students with disabilities and those designated
as "high
risk". <P>

METHOD:  Interactive relationships will be developed with established school
programs, child
and adult service agencies, and the Holt community.  Parent and student support
groups will be
established, and training in postsecondary rights and service delivery systems will be
provided
for
students and parents.  A core transdisciplinary staff will be established with the ability to
identify
needs and assist with making contacts with identified agencies.  Specific services
provided to
students will include mentorship, vocational assessment, career counseling,
psychosocial
counseling, training in assertiveness and self-advocacy, and other services as identified
imperative
to transition into adult life. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  An estimated 250 students will be served directly through
the
project, and an additional 300 will receive indirect services.  The ultimate outcome for
the
students will be active participation in achieving personal, educational, and vocational
skills

<b>Systemic Restructuring to Include Children with  Disabilities: A School-based
Multi-District 
   
Demonstration Program</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023R20030 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/92 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>
ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will determine what common systemic changes need to be
made in
schools that are restructuring to increase the inclusion of students with disabilities in
general
education and improve outcomes for all students. <P>

METHOD:  An initial model of necessary systemic changes will be developed that will
achieve
the
above goals regardless of the sociodemographic characteristics of a school, its stage of
restructuring, or the innovative practices adopted by the school. This model will be
developed
through determination of common systemic changes specified in strategic plans
developed at the
end of the first year of the project by all five participating schools.  The model will be
demonstrated through implementation of changes selected by participating schools as
being
critical to implement selected innovative practices.  Through case studies the
implementation
process will be evaluated, and case study results will guide the process of revision and
refinement
throughout the project. <P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  A newsletter will be developed that describes project
findings
and
status of the demonstration.  Presentations will be made at national, regional, and state
conferences.  Project staff will meet with the principal investigators of the other six
funded
demonstration grants to share findings and shape further dissemination plans.<P>

<b>Synthesis and Dissemination of a Knowledge Base Regarding Outcomes from the
Placement
of
Students with Disabilities in General Education Classrooms</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023E40005 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>                                 

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to provide practitioners with easier access to
relevant
information and to provide answers on how to appropriately educate students with
disabilities in
the least restrictive environment (LRE).  The project will synthesize, communicate, and
foster the
use of the knowledge base concerning the placement of students with disabilities in the
general
education classroom, and the outcomes of different general classroom support models
for
students with different disabilities.<P>  

METHOD:  Staff will use a grounded theory approach, integrating multiple data sources
and
generating themes, patterns, and constructs inductively.  The synthesis will focus on
the key
variables of students' characteristics, program characteristics, setting and context, and
intended
and actual outcomes.  A series of coding matrices will be developed and combined to
describe
the
data set and to study the factors affecting student outcomes.  Staff will initiate the
knowledge
base synthesis by creating an easily accessible database through which practitioners
and
researchers can find useful information about the outcomes of the placement of
students with
specific disabilities in specific teacher/learning environments.  Staff members will then
review
and
index the usable knowledge of outcomes according to disability, types of outcomes,
program
characteristics, and developmental and grade level.  Next, staff will prepare at least two
different
information packets synthesizing portions of the database.  Selection of topics will be
based on
the
number of the documents in the database and the perceived needs of those in the field. 
This
database will be disseminated and supported through the inclusion of stakeholders
throughout the
process, a forum to be held in Washington, DC in cooperation with OSEP, and a
dissemination
strategy including the use of electronic networks.  Finally, staff will provide an analysis
that will
compare strengths and weaknesses of different inclusion models for different types of
students.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Products will include a bibliography; collected knowledge
of
outcomes indexed by disability, types of outcomes, program characteristics, and
school-level; a
user-friendly database with a manual that will enable users to access the database and
manipulate
it for their own needs; and two information packets synthesizing selected portions of the
database. <P>

<b>School-Linked Services to Support Better Outcomes for  Children with Disabilities
and Their
Families</b><br>  

GRANT NUMBER: H023D40015 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/96<P>                                 

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will conduct research examining school-linked services for
children
with
disabilities and their families based on a conceptual framework that views system
issues, service
issues, and child and family outcomes as important areas for study.<P>  

METHOD:  Project staff will undertake two components of research: a multisite analysis
of
systems, services and outcomes, and an in-depth look at the delivery of services in a
school-linked
model in one community.  The multisite component will examine the services and
outcomes for
students in special education across 65 Healthy Start school-linked sites in California. 
Under the
multisite component, staff will analyze data collected for a concurrent Healthy Start
evaluation to
compare services and outcomes for students in special education with those for other
service
recipients.  To provide a richer look at special education in a school-linked services
model, staff
will study school-linked services for students with disabilities at a single Healthy Start
site.  The
design for this component includes both qualititative and quantitative techniques. Data
collection
techniques will include staff interviews, direct observations, document analysis, reviews
of client
and student records, family interviews, and family case studies.  Service and outcome
data for
students with disabilities and their families will be compared with those for others in the
same
school and with students in special and regular education in a comparison school that
serves a
similar population but does not provide school-linked services.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This study will provide a detailed description of a
school-linked
services model from the policy perspective, service-provider perspective, and family
perspective. 
Data from the qualitative components will be used to describe how school-linked
services
models
bring about improved child and family outcomes.<P>

<b>Evaluating School-linked Services for Children with Disabilities and Their Families
</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023D40017 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/94<br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/97<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:      This project will describe the participation and outcomes of students with
disabilities and their families who receive school-linked services in schools that are
implementing
the full-service school concept, and to study programmatic and policy implications
associated
with
the delivery of school-linked services using a full-service school concept.<P>  

METHOD:  Staff will conduct three interrelated studies to address: (1) the
implementation of
this
concept of delivery; (2) whether services provided are culturally competent and based
on family
needs rather than service providers' perspectives; and (3) academic and social
outcomes of
participating students with disabilities.  The research will be conducted in two
elementary
schools
selected by the district because of their substantial need for general health, mental
health, and
social services.  Study 1 will conduct case studies with the schools as the unit of
analysis to
provide an in-depth profile of the full-service concept, describe the participation of
children and
families, and identify systemic and programmatic features that act as barriers to, or
facilitators of
participation.  Study 2 will compare the extent of participation and the outcomes of
students with
disabilities who attend full-service schools with: (1) students without disabilities in the
same
schools; and (2) students with disabilities who receive continual special education and
related
services in representative schools in the district.  During this study, staff will also assess
and
analyze students' outcomes using the National Center for Educational Outcomes
model. Finally,
Study 3 will involve an analysis of 12 individual case studies of students with disabilities
and
their
families that focuses on the quality of services and whether this quality varies with type
of
disability and race and ethnicity.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in an in-depth profile of the
full-service
school concept, an in-depth description of full-service school concept implementation,
an
analysis
of the academic and social outcomes for students with disabilities, and data regarding
programmatic and policy  implications of the full-service school concept.<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will study school-linked services that are designed to support
better
outcomes for children with disabilities and their families through the combined efforts of
the
Kansas State Board of Education (KSBE) and two local school districts providing
school-linked
services.<P>  

METHOD:  The sample for this investigation will include all children (N=270) and their
families
who receive school-linked services through one of the two target projects.  This
research project
consists of interactive qualitative and quantitative components designed to augment
each other. 
For the  qualitative component, staff will conduct naturalistic inquiries regarding policy
and
implementation issues related to school-linked services. These naturalistic inquiries will
reveal
the
perspectives of participants at all levels of the implementation process, including
consumers,
teachers, administrators, related service providers, and other stakeholders. During the
first project
year, the inquiry team will identify service integration needs and barriers at each site
and develop
potential solutions relative to matters such as logistics of services and staff training
needs. 
During
the second project year, policy, planning, and implementation recommendations will be
enacted
and the inquiry will serve as a formative evaluation of their impact.  Using both
consumer and
participant perspectives, inquiry teams will examine both accessibility and outcomes of
these
services.  The third project year will involve development and refinement of case
studies
detailing
the impact of planning and implementation processes carried out during the first two
years.
Quantitative descriptive research techniques will be used primarily to examine the
impact of
school-linked services integration in terms of accessibility of services and outcomes of
services.
Investigations will be prioritized by relevant stakeholders through Advisory Council
participation
and naturalistic inquiry information. Areas of study will include length of time between
problem
identification and implementation of services, and demographic information.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  This project will result in identification of effective
processes for
the initial development and implementation of school-linked services, identification of
barriers to
school-linked service implementation, and a description of the impact of school-linked
services
on
children with disabilities and their families.<P>

ABSTRACT<P> 

PURPOSE:  The project will  implement and evaluate a school-based change process
to help
schools take a comprehensive view of special education services and the needs of the
children
they serve.<P>  

METHOD:  The model to be employed includes the following components: (1)
school-wide self
examination; (2) parental involvement; (3) a school-based planning team; (4) ongoing

exit of the researchers.  Within the model, school staff and parents articulate guiding
principles
for
the design of effective services for children with disabilities, and then participate in a
four-day
workshop to examine school practices in relation to these guiding principles and the
school's
stated goals.  Two schools that are engaged in school-based restructuring will serve as
test sites. 
Qualitative case study methodology, quantitative measures, and data produced by the
built-in
evaluation process will be used to provide evidence of the change model's
effectiveness in
producing meaningful outcomes for special education students.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Research findings and results from this project will be
presented
at annual meetings of professional organizations and published in relevant journals. 
Specific
project products anticipated will include a practitioner guide on considerations in making
schools
more effective for children with disabilities, and a description of special education

project.  Three school districts (one each in the first, second and third years of the
project) will
provide in-depth qualitative data for analysis of local and classroom-level changes that
impact
special education programs and students.  Quantitative data will be collected from
participating
school districts, calling for information from administrators, support staff and teachers
who use
the Portland Instrument and the About Your District Questionnaire.  Students'
performance
indicator data will be gathered from schools via the Student Information System and
direct
examination of a stratified random selection of students' IEPs.<P> 

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  At the local district level, findings of the study will be
presented
to all participating school districts, and will be disseminated on request to other South
Dakota
school districts through the state agency and Modernization Project.  At the state level,
findings
will be disseminated through presentations at state-wide conferences and through print
media
disseminated through state agencies and organizations.  At the national level,
dissemination
activities will include reports to the Department of Education, presentations, and
publication of
monographs through national organizations.<P>

BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P> 

PURPOSE:  This project will demonstrate that systemic school reform is possible, that
its effects
can be documented, and that methods used to initiate systemic reform can be
disseminated to
other schools.<P>  

METHOD:  Over a two year period, stakeholders and project staff will develop and test
a more

<b>Project Succeed in  Middle Schools: Securing Understanding in Content Through
Consultation
and Explicit Environmental Demands</b>  <br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C30064 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  7/01/93<br>
ENDING DATE:  6/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  This project will develop, field-test, and evaluate a special education
service
delivery
model for middle schools, with content teachers as the primary source of
instruction.<P>  

METHOD:  In Year One, the project will focus on providing content teachers a structure
for
organizing their content-teaching.  During Year Two, the study will investigate effects of
systematic databased feedback on teachers' use of this structural framework.  In Year
Three,
attention will shift to examine how teachers manipulate the two dimensions of the
framework in
their curriculum and within their interactive instruction to achieve changes in student
perception
and learning.  In the fourth project year, the special educator will be added as case
consultant
within this package with a student progress monitoring system.  The teacher will also be
placed
in
the role of researcher to identify individually effective strategies within a component
analysis,
using individual student monitoring of learning outcomes and explicit consultation
support
systems.  Finally, in Year Five, the manipulation of Organized Knowledge Forms and
Interactive
Learning Tasks will be synthesized in a consultation system and evaluated.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Dissemination activities will include the following:
presentation
at
national conferences during all 5 years of the project; presentations at preconference
workshops;
publication of a number of research reports, monographs, and training modules; and
teaching

ENDING DATE:  9/30/96<P>

ABSTRACT <P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and implement a process for adapting and
internalizing
effective assessment and instructional practices for students with disabilities that will
inform the
ongoing broader school-based restructuring efforts in the four-school Powerful Schools
Coalition
(PSC). <P> 

METHOD:  An organizational context will be developed to stimulate ongoing
implementation of
school innovation for students with disabilities.  The PSC will develop a  plan for
systemic
change
to incorporate effective practices for students with disabilities in PSC restructuring
efforts. 
Effective practices for students with disabilities will be designed, introduced, evaluated,
refined,
and incorporated in field-test classrooms within participating schools.  Validated
practices will
then be selected for implementation throughout the PSC.  Case studies will be
conducted on the
policy, organization, administrative, opera- tional and cultural features that enable
schools to
implement systemic changes.<P>  

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will identify the mediating and bridging
conditions
that link effective teaching and learning practices with structural alterations that sustain
positive

<b>Beyond Bridging the Gap: Creating Learning Communities of Research and
Practice</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023G50045 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate a participatory research and development
model that creates learning communities of research and practice.  The ultimate goal of these
communities of research and practice is to impact teacher thinking and instructional behavior in
inclusive classes, the school systems and cultures in which teachers work, university teacher
training and research programs, and the academic outcomes of students with and without
disabilities in inclusive classes.<P>

METHOD:   The project will develop a working model of participatory research and
development
(PR&D).  In the first year, the model will be implemented with ten secondary special and general
education teachers (expanding to 35 teachers in the first three years) to address authentic
instructional problems in the inclusive classrooms of participating teachers.  Descriptive and
intervention studies will determine the effects of teacher involvement in participatory research
and
development on their problem-solving/innovation development process, including their planning,
instructional behaviors, and attitudes.  Intervention studies over the first three years of the project
will determine the effects of teacher participation in the PR&D process and implementation of
classroom teaching and learning strategies in experimental classrooms on the academic
performance of students with mild disabilities as well as those without disabilities (N=80
students
in the first and third years, N=40 in the second). In addition, in each year of the project, the
academic performance of students with and without mild disabilities within experimental classes
will be compared to the academic performance of students with and without disabilities in
classrooms where teachers do not participate in PR&D, but do implement the innovations of
PR&D teachers.  Descriptive studies will address the effects of teacher, administrator, and staff
involvement in participatory research and development on the system, culture, and professional
climate of the schools included in the project. Finally, descriptive studies will determine the
effects
of participation in participatory research and development on the attitudes, future research plans,
and teacher preparation programs involving participating university educators.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   Project findings will be disseminated through presentations to
peers within participating institutions and regional and national conferences.  Research findings
will be published in practitioner and research journals.<P>

<b>Performance Enhancement Routine for Use in Inclusive Secondary Content
Classrooms</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50143 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/00<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will develop and validate four new routines, called Performance
Enhancement Routines, which will be aimed at overcoming the barriers associated with methods
used to ensure and evaluate mastery of secondary school content.<P>

METHOD:  Components of the Performance Enhancement Routines to be developed and
validated include the following: an Assessment Planning Routine to be used by teachers in
analyzing content they teach and creating assessment tools appropriate to both content and
student characteristics; a Study Guide Routine to help teachers create study guides matched to
assessment tools; a Review Routine to be used as a closure activity through which students can
review important information in cooperative study groups; and a Feedback Routine to provide
feedback to whole classes of students on both content and process aspects of learning.  An
evaluation of effects of the teacher training program on the implementation of this model will be
conducted, as will an evaluation of effects of the instructional model on student performance on
both content measures and motivational factors.  The social validity of the instructional model
will
also be measured by specially designed surveys.  Descriptive studies yielding both quantitative
data from teacher surveys and qualitative data from information received from teacher focus
groups will also be collected.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The routines to be developed through this project will be usable
in combination with current Content Planning Routines and Content Delivery Routines to help
students with disabilities succeed in content-area classes at the secondary level.  Numerous
reports and professional papers will be prepared for presentation and publication through
journals,
conferences, and agency-sponsored training sessions. 
These papers will include the original position paper, results of annual studies, and teacher
training procedures.<P>

<b>A Feasibility Study for a Data-based Tracking   System for Secondary Students with
Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H159F50001 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  7/31/97 <P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will evaluate the feasibility of implementing a state-wide student
tracking system for Alabama's secondary students and young adults with disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  A follow-along project design will be employed to collect data on both in-school
and
post-school indicators.  The sample will consist of students from Jefferson County (urban) and
Lee County (rural) high schools.  All students over 17 years of age in participating schools will
be
administered a questionnaire (approximately 242 students.)  For the post-school phase, half of all
students who exited these two school systems in the 1994-1995 school year will be administered
the post-school questionnaire via telephone, (approximately 202 post-school participants.) 
Ultimately, the student tracking system would gather information on the same students at both 17
years of age in-school and 9 months post-school.  This information will then be used to identify
links between post-school indicators and specific programs, services, and prior program
improvement activities.  A task force will be developed, to consist of individuals from an array of
state and local agencies representing administrators, educators, and consumers. This group will
translate project outcomes into a set of recommendations for policy formation, adoption, and
implementation in Alabama.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:   The final project report will include a description of the piloted
student tracking system, the developed in-school instrument and revised post-school instrument,
the results of the pilot test in terms of analysis for in-school and post-school indicators, the final
project evaluation report, and the task force's recommendations for policy formation.<P>

<b>Indicators of Integrated Academic/Occupational Curricula in Secondary Classrooms Serving
Students With and Without Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023B50033 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/96<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The purpose of this project is to develop valid measures of classroom practice that
are sensitive to the level of integration of academic and vocational curricula in a variety of high
school courses, including those experienced by students with disabilities. <P>

METHOD:  Using systematic observation methods in a purposive sample of forty academic,
vocational, and blended classes offered at a comprehensive high school participating in the
Southern Regional Education Board's "High Schools that Work" initiative, project staff will
assess
four domains of curriculum and instruction: (1) content blend; (2) vocational content; (3)
instructional strategy; and (4) student activity.  Data will consist of pre-coded administrative
descriptions of courses and student types (including numbers of students with disabilities),
pre-coded teacher descriptions of courses, daily teacher logs of classroom activity, and observer
logs of classroom activity.  Interobserver agreement, correlational analyses, and teachers' and
observers' structured comments will be used to test the validity of the measures.  Repeated
measures profile analyses will be used to ascertain if there is a profile or set of profiles that are
most likely to occur in high school classes that have been pre-specified as "integrated
academic/occupational courses", such that integrated classes may be differentiated from classes
that do not integrate academic and occupational curriculum.  Additional profile analysis will be
used to determine if student disability is associated with certain curricular and instructional
features and whether those features are similar to those found in classes that integrate academic
and occupational learning.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The project will develop valid classroom indicators of integrated
curricula based on current conceptual models; an analysis of the utility of the conceptual model
for describing regular and special education classroom activities; measures of reliability of
teacher
reports of integrated curricula; and benchmarks of local practice in the participating school.<P>

<b>General Education Development (GED) Success: Effective Instructional Interventions for
Students with Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023P30004 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  9/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE:  8/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will identify and document interventions that provide effective
individualized instructional accommodations and supports for students with learning disabilities
and behavior disorders in secondary GED preparation programs.<P>

METHOD:  A multi-agency Advisory Task Force will identify the needs and barriers to GED
programs that students experience, effective preparation programs and instructors, and
intervention strategies that will address student needs.  Students with disabilities who have
dropped out of Seattle schools will be recruited and assigned to one of three regular education
GED programs: a computer-assisted curriculum for pre-GED and GED preparation; a test-based
GED curriculum based on student strengths and test characteristics; or a program of instructional
accommodation and support based on identification of barriers and successful program features. 
Budget strategies will be identified to capture the FTEs of all target students so that interventions
can be supported without grant funds after the project ends.  Each of these GED interventions
will be evaluated to determine its effectiveness in preparing students to successfully complete the
GED subtests.  Students who successfully complete these interventions will be compared with
students who do not complete them, and a control group of nonenrollees on occupational, social,
and personal outcomes.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:    Information on effective GED practices identified in this
project
will be disseminated to secondary and postsecondary program sites, professional and advocacy
organizations, and state and federal offices.<P>

<b>Students' Entrepreneurial Education Research Project</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C50080 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  5/01/95 <br>
ENDING DATE:  4/30/98<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  The project will investigate the relationship between entrepreneurial education and
the development of self-mastery skills for secondary students with emotional disorders during
school and upon exit or graduation from high school.<P>

METHOD:  Using a three-level entrepreneurial curriculum, staff will work with 55-75 students
ages 6 through 21 who are participating in three different alternative programs as a result of
failure in a mainstreamed secondary education environment.  Staff will coordinate project
activities and facilitate a multi-disciplinary, multi-agency advisory and service team to include
students, teachers, counselors, entrepreneur mentors, employers, parents, law enforcement
representatives, and representatives of social service agencies.  A case study approach using a
participatory action research model will provide the qualitative component of the project's
evaluation, while standardized measurement tools combined with subjective assessments by
entrepreneurial coordinators will provide quantitative evaluation. The business community will
be
drawn in to help determine specific employability skills they want to see in potential new
employees, and mentors will provide support as each class plans, develops, and implements an
entrepreneurial enterprise.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project findings will be presented at local, state and national
conferences directed towards teachers, administrators, related services personnel, adult service
providers, parents and students with emotional disorders.  The Colorado Department of
Education will disseminate the finished curriculum state-wide, and staff will submit process and
research articles to relevant professional journals.<P>

<b>The Development and Validation of a GED Proficiency Attainment Model for Students with
Learning Disabilities and Severe Emotional Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023P30008 <br>
BEGINNING DATE:  8/01/93 <br>
ENDING DATE: 12/31/97<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This program will identify barriers to GED program participation and completion
for
students with learning disabilities (LD) and severe emotional disturbances (SED) who drop out
of high school.  The project will also design, implement, and evaluate an intervention model to
accommodate these students' needs related to completion.<P>

METHOD:  In the first phase of the project, those involved in the GED process will participate in
interviews, focus group meetings, and/or observations.  These data sources will provide
information describing the current needs of students and instructors in GED programs.  In
collaboration with those involved, an intervention package will be designed for implementation
and evaluation in the second research phase.  One product will be an intervention model
generalizable to other GED programs.  The intervention model will address academic and
self-management skills as major areas influencing GED participation and completion.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  The instructional model will consist of three packages: (1) a
Recruitment Package; (2) a GED Preparation Package (consisting of the Strategies Application
Component, the Strategic Tutoring Component, the Content Enhancement Component, and the
Self-Management Component); and (3) a Test Performance Package.  In each area, learning and
self-management strategies and related needs of students with LD and SED will be addressed in
conjunction with the teaching skills and programmatic influences on participation and

<b>Research in Self-Determination of Students with Cognitive Disabilities</b><br>

GRANT NUMBER: H023C40126 <br>
BEGINNING DATE: 10/01/94 <br>
ENDING DATE:  9/30/99<P>

ABSTRACT<P>

PURPOSE:  This project will conduct an empirical examination of the causal relationship
between
self-determination and positive adult outcomes through a longitudinal follow-along study of
school graduates with cognitive disabilities, including mental retardation and learning
disabilities.<P>

METHOD:  This project spans five areas of research that staff members will conduct over a
period of 5 years.  First, through a longitudinal follow-along study, staff members will explore
the
causal relationship between self-determination and adult outcomes.  Using precollected data
related to self-determination status and demographic information, project staff will monitor
participants' progress at 1 and 3 years after graduation, including employment status,
postsecondary education status, marital status, and perceived quality of life.  Participants
recruited
for this component will include students (N=150) with mild to moderate levels of mental
retardation and severe learning disabilities.  Self-determination assessments will include five
domains: (1) autonomy; (2) self-regulation; (3) self-actualization; (4) perceptions of
psychological
empowerment; and (5) perceptions of self.  In the second, third, and fourth components, staff will
describe the development of self-determination through various means, including a longitudinal
study of perceptions of control and attributions of academic achievement.  Students ranging in
age
from 8 to 19 years will participate, including those with mental retardation, learning disabilities,
and students who are not disabled. During each project year, staff will assess each student on
various measures studying locus of control, perceptions of helplessness, and other research foci. 
The final area of research involves the development and field testing of a model of teaching that
distributes the responsibility for learning among teachers, parents, and students, giving primary
control to the student.  Participating students will be the primary agents for choices and decisions
at each phase of the model's development.<P>

ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS:  Project research activities will result in data detailing the causal
link between self- determination and adult outcomes and describing the developmental course of
constituent elements of self- determination. Project demonstration activities will result in the
validation of a model of teaching that can be used to promote self-determination.  Project
materials will be distributed to national organizations, journals, and conferences.<P>
